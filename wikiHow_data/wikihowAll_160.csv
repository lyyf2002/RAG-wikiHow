Serve beef with Merlot.,
Choose complimentary cheeses.,
Plan a balanced menu.",How to Serve Merlot Wine3," If you are planning a dinner party, you should consider pairing your food and wine. This means selecting certain dishes that will compliment the wine. There are several types of food that pair wonderfully with Merlot, notably beef.Start researching food and wine pairings. Read some cooking magazines and scroll through websites that offer a variety of recipes.
Search for recipes that highlight beef. You can use it as an appetizer or main dish. Cocktail meatballs would be a good choice for a starter.
If you want to impress your guests, there are several flavorful beef dishes you could choose as an entree. Consider serving a grilled steak with a blue cheese butter.
If you don't want to serve beef, chicken would make a lovely main dish. Try a classic roast chicken.

, Take into account what type of event you are planning. For example, maybe you are just inviting guests for hors d'oeuvres. If so, consider a selection of cheeses. A wine and cheese party can be a simple and elegant event.Cheese and wine naturally complement each other. Consider offering a hard, aged Cheddar with your Merlot.
You should include one soft cheese in your selection. Camembert goes nicely with Merlot.You can add a variety of other cheeses to pair with your wine. Try a Gruyere or Pecorino Toscano., There are many benefits that come from thoughtfully pairing food and wine. If done properly, you will be able to draw out unnoticed flavors in both your dinner and your Merlot. You want to balance flavors and textures so that they complement one another.Typically, wines pair well with foods from the same region. For example, if you are serving a French Merlot, consider cooking some French dishes.
Pay attention to each of your courses, including the starter. You could begin with a traditional Caesar salad. The flavors in the dressing will complement the Merlot.
Certain foods are difficult to successfully pair with wines. Avoid tomatoes, vinaigrettes, and artichokes.

Have a wine list.,
Include a variety of wines.,
Sell wine by both the glass and the bottle.,
Train your servers well.,
Have selling contests.,
Teach servers to offer comparisons.,
Take tips from your vendors.,
Follow the law.",How to Sell Wine1," Even if you don't have that many wines on your menu, having an organized, detailed list can help customers feel less intimidated about asking about wines. Plus, it gives your customers all the options they have, instead of just a few recommendations from servers.Consider having an abbreviated list of popular wines for those who don't want to dig through a long list.;
, When deciding what wines to sell at your restaurant, make sure to include a variety. Of course, you want to have more wines that go with your type of food, but including a variety of brands, regions, flavors, and sweetness will help serve all your customers.The bulk of your menu should be popular wines that sell well. However, you can also include a few unusual wines that will appeal to the connoisseurs who visit your restaurant.
Change up the menu from time-to-time, as it will bring a freshness to the menu. You can sell new wines early on with a discount to get customers hooked, plus have your servers push those particular wines.

, Selling wine by the glass can be more profitable, as it usually has a higher markup, plus it services people who just want a single glass. However, selling wine by the bottle can lead to more sales overall, as customers feel they are getting a deal by buying the bottle, buying more than they would by the glass. Therefore, make sure you find ways to sell both at your restaurant., Servers should know the wines in and out, as well as be able to present and open a bottle with ease. If a server is new and doesn't have wine experience, have them open the by the glass wines for the bartender to learn the technique.Provide training on ways to recommend wines, such as what wines go best with what types of food. If you can't provide the appropriate training yourself, have an outsider come in to train your staff on a regular basis.
Tastings can help your servers learn the wines. Have weekly tastings where your servers can try out different wines. They'll be more knowledgeable about the wines. Plus, when they find wines they like, they'll be more motivated to sell them.
Another way to help educate servers is to have them pick out a couple of wines each day to learn about. In addition, once they learn about the wines, those can be the ones they push that day., You can have weekly or daily contests to see which server can sell the most. You can break it down into categories (most variety, most bottles, highest sales) or just stick to highest sales. Have a small reward for the winner., One way to help someone choose a wine is to offer a comparison of both an expensive bottle and an inexpensive bottle. The idea is not to put down the inexpensive bottle, but rather to emphasize the good qualities of both wines. That way, the customer can make a decision about what they can afford., Most vendors have been around the block a few times. Since they sell to a variety of restaurants and venues, they've likely learned a few tricks about selling wines along the way. If they offer advice, seriously consider it for your restaurant., You'll need to follow certain laws when selling wines at a restaurant. These laws can differ from state to state, so you'll need to look up the laws in your own state. However, some basic rules apply across all states.For example, most states have a minimum age for who can sell alcohol. Often, 18-year-olds are allowed to sell alcohol under the supervision of a 21-year-old.
Get the appropriate licenses. In pretty much every state, you need a license to sell alcohol. Check with your city and state to learn the licenses you need to operate legally.
Check IDs. When selling wine, you'll need to check IDs to determine if the person is the legal age to drink (21).

Find your favorite gewürztraminer.",How to Serve Gewurztraminer," This fragrant wine is best enjoyed at 55 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (12 to 15 degrees Celsius). Use a wine cooler to chill the wine to an exact temperature. If you don’t have a wine cooler, you can chill your gewürztraminer in the refrigerator. Check the temperature using a wine bottle thermometer. If you don’t have a wine bottle thermometer, leave the gewürztraminer in your refrigerator overnight. It may not be at the perfect temperature but it will be sufficiently chilled.
If your gewürztraminer is acidic, chill it two degrees more. If it’s less acidic, chill it two degrees less.;
, For an authentic presentation, serve gewürztraminer in a long stemmed white wine glass. Fill the glass until it’s one third full. This will let the wine aerate and improve the flavor.



Use a decanter to pour the wine if you want to improve the flavor of a cheaper gewürztraminer.
Twist the bottle as you pull it away from the glass to prevent wine from dripping after you pour., Place the wine in the refrigerator or wine cooler in between glasses to keep the wine cold. Alternatively, place the opened bottle in a metal bucket filled with ice. Letting the wine warm up between glasses will negatively impact the flavor.

, Wine begins oxidizing once it’s open. This natural chemical process impacts the quality of the wine. Therefore, try to finish the bottle within a day or two. Similarly, if you don’t have proper wine storage tools such as a cooler or wine cellar, drink unopened gewürztraminer within a few weeks of purchase., The strong floral notes in gewürztraminer couples well with robust cuisines. For example, this wine is delicious with Middle eastern dishes containing nuts, dates, and spiced meats.Similarly, gewürztraminer pairs nicely with hearty German food such as sauerkraut and sausages.Avoid serving gewürztraminer with sweet dishes. The sweetness of the wine coupled with the sweetness of the dish could be overpowering.

, The sweet, crisp flavors in this wine complement rich foods by dampening the fatty flavors. Most pâtés, such as pâté de foie gras, pair wonderfully with this wine. Other excellent pâtés include liverwurst and terrines.Serve pâté chilled and spread it on crackers or bread.

, Populate your cheese plate with stinky soft cheeses. Some excellent cheeses include Roquefort, Munster, Pont l’Eveque, and the classic bleu cheese.Next, add a variety of crackers, pickled vegetables, nuts, apple slices, and dried fruit to eat with the cheese.


Don’t serve flavored crackers with robust cheeses. For example, if you served garlic crackers with bleu cheese, the flavors would clash unpleasantly.

, Instead of having a sweet dessert, serve a chilled glass of gewürztraminer after dinner. This wine is a great way to finish a dinner party and help you relax after a hearty meal. However, avoid pairing the wine with a dessert as the sweetness could be overwhelming.

, Look for specialty wine producers. Most gewürztraminer wine found at grocery stores is low quality. Visit your local liquor store, shop online, or visit a gewürztraminer winery to find quality brands.Experiment with different gewürztraminer producers to find one you like.


Gewurztraminer wine will range from dark yellow to copper colored. If it’s too pale, it’s a low quality wine.
This wine should have a very strong lychee, rose, and spiced smell. If the wine doesn’t smell like anything, it’s an over processed wine., Gewurztraminer is produced all over the world. However, this wine originated from the foothills of the Alps, and many believe that the best gewürztraminer is authentic gewürztraminer. Countries such as Germany, Italy, and France (specifically Alsace) produce high quality, authentic gewürztraminer.You can also buy excellent gewürztraminer from Australia, New Zealand, and California. The location is less authentic but the quality of the wine is good.

, This wine can have varying levels of sweetness. If you don’t like sugary wines, choose a dry gewürztraminer. If you prefer a dessert wine, choose a medium or sweet gewürztraminer. Keep in mind that gewürztraminers in general are considered sweet wines because of their floral aromas.A wine with a complex floral aroma often tastes sweeter than it actually is, even if there isn’t any sugar in the wine.

Learn all you can about wines.,
Figure out what the customer wants.,
Divide and conquer.,
Give the customer a ""secret."",
Tell a story.,
Make your customers feel valued.,
Pay attention to the law.",How to Sell Wine2," Anyone who sells wine at a liquor store needs to have some knowledge of what they're selling. To gain knowledge, read the labels of the bottles, as well as wine guides. Another way to learn more is to talk to other people who are more knowledgeable in the field.It goes without saying that you should be trying as many wines as you can, so you can have firsthand knowledge of each wine's flavors.

, When a person comes in looking for wine, often they want guidance. Asking questions can help you figure out what kind of wine will be best for the customer's needs. For example, if a guest says they want a bottle of wine for a gift, ask a few questions to narrow down what kind of wine will be appropriate.You could ask questions such as, ""Who's the gift for?"" ""Is that person knowledgeable about wines?"" ""Do you know what kinds of wines the person normally drinks?"" or ""Does the person have a sweet tooth?""
Knowing the answer to these questions can help you figure out what kind of wine will work best for the person.

, That is, make sure you present your wines in a way that makes sense to your customers. For instance, many wine stores divide wines by regions, such as Italy, France, California, and so on. Within each section, further divide it by type of wine. You could also have a section that features local wines, as well as an area that features bargain wines. Include displays of featured wines that are on sale.

, That is, if a customer feels like you are sharing a trade secret with them, they feel like they're on the inside, and they're more likely to buy. For instance, you could say that one wine is a particular deal because the company has a special relationship with the winery, and you prefer to drink it because it's a great wine at a good price.You could also try, ""Everyone says the northern region has the best wine, but the truth is, if you go east a little bit, you get a great wine for a lot less. Take this wine for example...""

, With so many wines on the market, it's difficult to pick one wine over another, particularly if they are similar. One way you can sell a particular wine is to talk about its history, its maker, and the region it's made in. In other words, tell a story about the wine to get the customer intrigued.For example, you could say, ""This bottle may seem expensive, but think about this: This bottle was made by monks in the Netherlands, and it has been aged over 20 years. I don't know about you, but I haven't even had a car for that long.""

, Customer perks can make your customers feel like they belong to a special club. When they feel valued, they'll come back to your store and buy more wine. You could offer perks such as rewards program or a free bottle of wine for loyal customers during the holidays. Another option is writing handwritten thank you notes for customers who spend a lot at your store., Just like in a restaurant, you need to follow certain laws when selling wine in a store. Once again, each state has its own laws regarding the selling of alcohol, particularly wine, so be sure to look up the laws in your state.Have the correct license to sell. You'll need to follow state and city laws when it comes to the proper licenses. Contact your government to find out more.
Make sure to hire people of an appropriate age. Check the laws in your state to see how old someone needs to be to sell wine in a store. In some states, it's as young as 18.
Don't forget to card. The legal drinking age is 21, so you need to make sure you're selling wine to people of a legal age.
Only sell wine where you're allowed to. Some states limit where liquor stores can be, such as only within so many feet of a school or church. In addition, some states don't allow grocery stores to sell wine, so make sure to check what your state allows.

They feel light in your mouth as opposed to heavy and thick.Light red wines include pinot noir, schiava, and gamay. These pair well with white meat, carbohydrates, roasted vegetables, and rich fish dishes, including:


Chicken
Salmon
Breads;
, Medium bodied-reds feel a little more substantial in your mouth, and they typically have an alcohol content between 12.5 and 13.5 percent. Medium reds are merlot, cabernet, cabernet Franc, and sangiovese. These types of wines go well with a variety of meats, cheeses, and carbohydrates, including:Bread
Crackers
Red meats
Pork
Hard cheeses
Cured and smoked meats

, Full-bodied reds feel full and thick in your mouth, and usually have an alcohol content above 13.5 percent. Reds that fall into this category include cabernet sauvignon, rioja, zinfandel, and shiraz. These wines complement a number of foods, including:Lamb and steak
Hard cheeses
Stews
Wild game

, A dry wine is one that has no sugar left in it, meaning it has no sweetness. Dry red wines, such as merlot, pinot noir, and cabernets, pair well with foods that have a pinkish color, such as:Salmon
Prawns or shrimp
Tuna

, Like light reds, light white wines generally have an alcohol content below 12.5 percent. These wines include sauvignon, pinot grigio, and pinot blanc. They are best paired with lighter foods, such as:Salads
Raw and cooked green vegetables
Light fish
Seafood
Chicken

, Sweet wines have more residual sugar leftover from the fermentation process. Sweet wine is the opposite of dry wine. Sweet white wines include Riesling, moscato, and Gewurztraminer. These are ideal with:Soft cheeses like brie
Smoked meats
Cured meats
Desserts
Carbohydrates
Chicken and pork

, Full-bodied whites generally have an alcohol content above 13.5 percent. Wines in this category include chardonnay, white rioja, and marsanne. The bold flavor of the wine and high alcohol content goes well with rich foods, including:Salmon
Lobster
Chicken and pork
Potatoes
Breads
Roasted vegetables

, Sparkling wine has a high carbon dioxide content, and this gas makes the wine fizzy. Examples of sparkling wine include Prosecco, brut, and Champagne. These types of wines are great complements for foods like:Hard and soft cheeses
Salads
Raw and cooked greens
Light fish and seafood

, The challenge when pairing wine with spicy foods is that the wine can accentuate the heat, rather than complementing the flavors. The best pairing for spicy food is a white wine that’s sweeter than it is dry, light and lower in alcohol content, and with fruity hints. Good wines for spicy food include:Riesling
Gewurztraminer
Viognier
Gruner

, Cabernet sauvignon grapes are relatively easy to work with, so even cheaper red wines of this varietal are likely to be good. Good times to opt for a cabernet sauvignon include when:A restaurant’s wine list is limited
You're on an airplane
You're looking for an inexpensive gift for a lover of red wine.

, Chardonnay is a full and flavorful wine, so even budget chardonnays are going to be acceptable compared to wines that should have subtler aromas.Cheaper chardonnays are great for travelling, and are great housewarming or host gifts. Their versatility also makes them good for dinner parties.

, Fine wines get better with age, but cheaper, lighter-bodied, and fruitier wines tend to lose some of their flavor when they get older. When you're buying budget or mid-range wines, opt for bottles that are between two and three years old., The high acidity of sauvignon blanc wines make them ideal for cooking, including in salad dressings, in white sauces, and as a replacement for lemon or lime juice.


Sauvignon blanc also has a bit of a peppery kick, which is another reason it’s great for cooking., There are a number of environmental factors that can affect the flavor of a wine, including temperature, frost, and diseases. Because vintage wines weren't produced in recent years, there's no way to know which of these factors may have affected the flavor of a vintage bottle unless you look it up.There are lots of resources online for looking up vintages, including vintage reports, buying tips for vintage bottles, reviews, and ratings.
Before buying a vintage bottle, search the year and the varietal to look up information about the wine.

, A digestif is a beverage that you drink after a meal to help aid digestion, and fortified wines are commonly consumed as digestifs.Fortified wine is wine that has stronger spirits, like brandy, added to it. Common fortified wines include:


Port
Vermouth
Sherry
Madeira
Marsala

, When all else fails, you can always ask for help to choose the right bottle. At restaurants, you can ask the wait staff or a bartender. At the liquor store, ask a store associate to point you in the direction of a wine you might like based on a few criteria:


Decide if you want a red wine or a white wine
Choose between sweet wine and dry wine
Mention if you're pairing the wine with any food
Mention particular wines that you know you like

, Varietal is a way of describing a wine based on the grape variety used to make it. There are a great number of varietals, and each has its own particular characteristics and aromas. Popular varietals include:Cabernet sauvignon, a full-bodied red wine with hints of cherry and currants
Pinot noir, a medium-bodied red that’s smooth and rich
Merlot, a medium- or full-bodied red with hints of black cherry
Rosé, a pink wine made with a blend of grapes
Chardonnay, a complex white with hints of vanilla
Riesling, a sweet white with floral aromas
Sauvignon blanc, a white wine with hints of herbs

, Region is another way of classifying wines, and this method focuses on where the grapes were grown rather than the type of grape used. Labelling wines based on region is more popular in Europe than in North America. Regional wines you can check out include:Bordeaux, an area of France known for their centuries-old red wines
Port is a fortified wine that comes from Porto and the Douro Valley in Portugal
La Rioja, an area of Spain known for it’s full-bodied reds
Champagne, an area of France that’s best known for sparkling wine

Grab a lengthy wood screw.,
Twist the screw into the broken cork.,
Place the hammer’s claws around the screw.,
Pull the cork out.",How to Remove a Broken Cork1," A sheet metal screw will work, too. It also helps to grab a hammer and a screwdriver. For this method you need a screw that’s long and sturdy enough to act as a corkscrew.
If you have a corkscrew, this will be your best bet as it’s designed to pull the cork out of the bottle. However, it’s assumed here that you don’t have one.;
, You will need to gently, but firmly insert the screw into the broken cork by twisting it down. 








If you have a screwdriver it could be useful here for inserting the screw without pushing the cork further down.
If you notice the cork is being pushed down, stop. Try creating a small hole with the point of a knife for the screw to go into.
Insert the screw until it is far enough into the cork so that it won’t pop out. But you also need to leave enough room for the claws of the hammer to grab the screw. Try not to drive the screw through the cork if you can. Doing so can make it harder to pull the cork out of the bottle.

, Once you have the screw, at least, 0.4 inches (10 mm) or so into the cork, begin pulling up the screw.


Instead of pulling straight up, the hammer should work like a fulcrum. Like you would with certain corkscrews, you want to apply a downward force on the handle of the hammer to lift the screw and cork up.

, Push down on the hammer’s handle to act as a lever to pull the screw upward taking the cork with it.









If using the hammer as a fulcrum doesn’t work and it looks like the cork is going to break, then try pulling straight up.
You may also have to use your fingers and grab the head of the screw and pull up with force.
Take your time and move slowly. The cork will be weakened from breaking.

Figure out what your bottle is worth.,
Sell more than one bottle at once if possible.,
Consider an auction.,
Sell directly.",How to Sell Wine3," If you have a rare bottle of wine stashed away in your home, you may find yourself in a position to want to sell it. Fortunately, many companies buy rare bottles of wine. The first step is figuring out how much the bottle is worth so that you can decide whether you want to sell it or not.The best place to figure out what your bottle is worth is to search online wine databases/stores that specialize in wines, such as http://www.wine-searcher.com/ or http://www.2020wines.com/.

, Most people buying high-dollar wine aren't interested in buying a single bottle of wine at once. Rather, they prefer lots or cellars of wine, primarily because it is easier to assess how the collection has been kept., Auctions are a common way to sell wines. Big-name auction sites that specialize in things like antiques and fine art will auction off wines, such as one of the most famous auction companies, Christie's. However, you can also use sites that specialize in auctioning wine. Most will auction the wine for you, such as http://www.zachys.com/ or https://www.winebid.com/., Another option is to sell directly to corporate buyers. Some wine stores specialize in buying up rare wines, and then they sell them to other customers. Usually, you either ship or take the wine into the store, and it's evaluated. Then they make you an offer or return the wine to you if they don't want to buy it.Generally, all you need to do is find a store or business that buys wine. Your best bet is finding a website that offers this service. You don't need a special license or registration as long as you're selling your personal collection of wine.

Grab a knife.,
Insert the knife into the cork near the cork’s edge and the neck of the bottle.,
Turn the knife.,
Twist the cork out.",How to Remove a Broken Cork2," Use a sharp knife that is thin enough to get into the opening of the bottle. For this method, you’ll have better luck if you use a flat knife and not a serrated one. The flat knife will be able to smoothly slide into the cork without as much resistance as a serrated knife.

, Push the knife about 1 inch (25 mm) into the cork. Don’t push the knife into the center of the cork. You need to get it in on the edge so that when you turn it you can make larger turns. You’re not unscrewing the cork as much as you’re turning the knife and cork together. This motion is more like turning a door knob than unscrewing a bottle cap.

, Pull up as you turn the knife. Be very careful here as you will now need to grip the flat part of the knife’s blade.









Wear gloves if you have some to protect your fingers.
Start turning the knife, very slowly, around the mouth of the bottle. The knife should be angled at roughly forty-five degrees to give it leverage.
You may have to try wedging the blade of the knife between the bottle and the cork, depending on how much cork you have to work with.

, Once you’re able to pull the cork up enough to get a good grip with your fingers, remove the knife.









As soon you don’t the need the knife as a wedge to pull up the cork, put it down and remove the remainder of the cork with your fingers. Then, enjoy your wine or champagne.

Remove any debris from the cork.,
Push the cork into the bottle.,
Pour your wine through a coffee filter or strainer.,
Pour the wine into a new container.",How to Remove a Broken Cork3," Pushing the cork down into the bottle is the easiest way to get to your drink, but it’s also the messiest to deal with. If your cork has broken and you can’t pull it out using other methods, you can always push it in.


Before you go pushing the cork into the bottle, make sure to remove any debris that you can from the cork. You will always end up with some, but try to make it easier on yourself and get rid of as much as possible.
Make sure to do this somewhere you are ok with possibly wine or champagne squirting out of the bottle. You should not be wearing any clothing you like for this method. The pressure that you release when pushing the cork down into the bottle may cause some of the liquid to spray out.

, Using your fingers, push the cork down until it falls into the bottle.









You will now have access to your drink, but there is also a cork and some debris in the wine or champagne. Quickly strain the liquid.

, After the cork lands in the bottle, use a coffee filter to strain out the residual cork pieces.









If you have a glass coffee pot like a Chemex with paper filters you can pour your wine from your bottle into the container.
The filter will catch all the cork debris and let the liquid pass through.
You can also use any paper filter over any type of container.

, You can rinse the bottle and pour the wine back in using a funnel. You may want to use another container, though. If most of the cork is still in the bottle, you can also just pour the wine into a decanter. Then, enjoy.









Once you push a cork into a bottle, you won't be able to easily remove it. It's best to store your liquid in a new bottle.

Grab a hard-soled shoe or a towel.,
Hit the bottom of the bottle.,
Twist the rest of the cork out of the bottle.,
Enjoy your wine or champagne.",How to Remove a Broken Cork4," This method is best saved as a last resort as you will be hitting the bottle on a hard surface like a wall or tree. You should not try this method on drywall or any weak structure. The pounding could break or damage your walls or furniture.
This method is very dangerous as you can easily break the bottle, causing the glass to shatter. The glass can injure you severely. Proceed with extreme caution.

, Wrap the bottom of the bottle in the towel or place inside the opening of a hard-soled shoe. Then carefully hit the bottom of the bottle onto your hard surface. 








The shoe should be sturdy like a dress shoe. It should have a solid, flat heel.
If you have a towel, make sure to wrap the towel evenly so that the part of the bottle hitting your hard surface is as flat as possible.
Hit the bottle on your surface with a slow and consistent rhythm. The force of your motion and the movement of the liquid will slowly begin to push the cork upward out of the bottle.

, Once the cork has begun to emerge from the bottle, grab it with your fingers and pull it out.









Don’t keep hitting the bottle when you see that you can grab the cork. If you hit the bottle on the surface and force the cork out, your liquid will come spraying out after it.
Even when pulling the cork out, you may want to give your wine or champagne a few minutes to settle before pulling out the cork. It may spray when you remove the cork.

, Once you have finally removed your cork, you can now sit back and enjoy a hard earned drink.


This method of popping out the cork should be saved for last. It is recommended that you push the cork through the bottle before attempting this method.

"
"
Chill the bottle well prior to opening.,
Locate a dish, bar, or serving towel.,
Grasp the neck of the bottle with four fingers of your left hand (if right-handed) and place your thumb over the top of the basket.,
Twist the retaining wire on the wire cage six half-turns counter-clockwise.,
Either leaving the wine cage on the cork or removing it, put your thumb on top of the cork and grasp it with the rest of your hand.,
If you do not feel the cork loosening, pull with increasing pressure on the cork with your left hand while still rotating the bottle with your right hand.

,
When the cork starts to come out, slow its exit with your left thumb, allowing it to barely pop out.

,
The goal of this operation is to barely make a sound when the cork comes out.

,
Pour the wine into clean Champagne flutes.

",How to Properly Open a Bottle of Sparkling Wine," A bottle that is not properly chilled will push the cork out on its own and will foam up and out of the bottle aggressively, making a mess and wasting wine.;
, Use it to dry off the bottle, if wet from being chilled.

, Keep the bottle pointed away from you and others.

, The cork may be pushed out by the pressure any time after the basket is loosened, so apply firm pressure with your thumb on the top of the basket. If your wine was adequately chilled, the cork will rarely if ever get pushed out on its own.

, While holding the cork steady, firmly twist the bottle with your right hand. It is most comfortable to do this with the bottle held at a 45 degree angle and balanced on your side or hip.

Chill the Champagne on ice.If you plan to finish your bottle of Champagne over the course of a night, keep it chilled in a bucket full of ice to preserve the flavor.,
Keep the Champagne refrigerated.,
Don’t freeze Champagne.",How to Recork Champagne," When a Champagne cork is removed from the bottle, it mushrooms out and cannot be reinserted back into the bottle. Regular wine bottles and some bottles of hard alcohol come corked with straight corks that can be recycled in Champagne bottles to help preserve the leftovers.To recycle an old cork, insert the old wine or whiskey cork into the Champagne bottle in place of the original cork.
Champagne bottles are specially designed to withstand the pressure inside the bottle created by the carbon dioxide. Never transfer leftover champagne to a regular wine bottle as a method of preserving it.;
, There are sealers and stoppers available that are made for preserving Champagne, and they are specially designed to fit into Champagne bottles. Some of these are vacuum sealers that remove excess air from the bottle, while others are specially designed stoppers that are able to withstand the pressure that will build up in the bottle.


Only wine made using a special tradition in the Champagne region of France can be called Champagne. Sparkling wine from different regions may have bottles with different sized openings, so make sure you’re using a Champagne-specific stopper.

, Not everyone has old corks or special Champagne sealers lying around, a third option is to cover the opening with plastic wrap. Seal it tightly around the rim, and secure the plastic in place with an elastic band around the neck.

, Champagne is ideally served between 44.6 and 57.2 F (7 to 14 C).


Fill a wine or metal bucket halfway with a half-and-half ice and water mixture. Gently place the bottle into the bucket, and finish filling the bucket with more ice and water. Make sure to leave the top third of the bottle exposed., Whether you plan on finishing the bottle immediately or not, keeping it cold is one of the most important factors to preserving its flavor and fizz. In fact, if you plan to consume your open bottle within 24 hours, you can simply refrigerate it, uncovered, for the duration., Not only can freezing the wine destroy its flavor, but a bottle can also explode if it’s left too long.

Err on the side of fewer rackings.",How to Rack Wine," Racking wine involves using a few relatively simple tools, most of which should come standard with home wine-making kits, or will be available at any home-brewing retailer. To rack wine properly, you'll need:


At least two carboys or sterilized buckets
A siphon tube
An air-lock cap for the wine;
, Commonly called ""meta solution,"" a mixture of potassium metabisulfite or sodium metabisulfite, diluted in water. These are available commercially, or can be mixed at home. In general, about a tablespoon of meta solution needs to be distilled in about a gallon of water.Everything that's going to touch the wine needs to be sterilized with meta-solution as well, usually by sloshing a bit of it in the bucket or through the tube, then dumping it in a safe place.
Meta-solution is pretty harsh, which means it's a good idea to use it in a well-ventilated area, wearing breathing protection and gloves when you're handling it. Follow the directions on the package.

, Take the vessel containing the wine with the sediment and open it up, then place it up on a raised surface. Depending on the amount of wine you're making, you may need a significant amount of space to do this, or just a tabletop and the floor of your kitchen. Make sure your siphon tube is long enough to reach wherever you're trying to siphon the wine.


The process involves gravity, so it’s absolutely essential that the full carboy of wine be higher than the tallest portion of the clean receptacle you’re going to use to catch the wine, or else the process won’t work.

, Place the notched end of the siphon tube into the carboy, making sure to not touch the sediment lying on the bottom. You should be able to see the line of sediment fairly clearly by the time you're ready to rack the wine, and it should be significantly darker and cloudier toward the bottom of the wine. Let the tube fall most of the way into the wine, but keep it at least an inch or two above the sediment line.Insert the other end of the siphon into the clean receptacle, or let it hang above. You'll have to get it started and then insert it quickly into the receptacle, but check and make sure the tube is long enough to reach in.

, There’s little science to it: start sucking on the other end of the tube as if you’re drinking from a straw until the wine begins to flow, then get the tube into the clean vessel as quickly as possible. This takes a little practice to do without getting a mouthful of wine or spilling. But, hey, a mouthful of wine. It's not the worst.


When the wine starts going, insert the tube quickly into the receptacle and try to keep the flow “quiet."" Keep a close eye on the sediment, making sure you don’t stir it up, or that either of the tubes don't splash around, putting lots of oxygen into the wine.
As second carboy becomes full, or sediment begins to flow, clamp the hose to halt the flow of the wine and cut it off.

, Winemaking is an art as much as a science, and you’re going to lose some wine in the process. When have you siphoned enough off? You'll mostly be eyeballing it and making the call yourself. It’s all part of the job.


Don’t worry about trying to skim right over the top of the sediment and get all the wine possible out and remove all the sediment. If you're making wine yourself, there's going to be a small amount of sediment left at the end.

, Once you've gotten the wine in the new vessel, install the airlock on top, which should usually be screwed on securely and then clamped down. Different airlocks will work differently, so it's important to follow the specific manufacturer's instructions. Most of them will just need to be plugged directly into the opening in the carboy.

, In general, winemakers will use the racking process to rack when moving it from the primary fermenter to the secondary vessel, and when moving wine from the secondary fermenter to a bulk aging vessel. Wine is often also racked after fermentation is complete, to help clarify the wine and remove some of the sediment. The process and vigorousness of racking largely will depend on the variety of wine you’re making and your own personal taste as an enjoyer of wine.Some wine makers rack only once and others will rack four or five times, depending upon the flavor profile they’re going for and how clear they want the wine.
If you’re going to eventually filter your wine, you don’t need to rack it more than once or twice.

, By the time the batch has been fermenting for a week, it’ll need to be put into a carboy with an airlock, which means you’ll need to move it from the first vessel anyway, making it a good time to rack it and move it to an appropriate secondary fermentation vessel, outfitted with an airlock.


Be very careful not to rack your wine too early. The fermentation process produces a large quantity of gas, making it dangerous for carboys and barrels alike, if it's too active.
For the most part, carboys are made safe by outfitting them with an airlock, which serves to let gasses escape the vessel, but keep outside oxygen, microbes, and bacteria from getting in.

, The second racking comes when the wine is finished fermenting, sometimes after a few days more and sometimes after as much as a month. Typically, this racking needs to be done to remove as much of the spent yeast as possible, since it should have settled thoroughly and is no longer affecting the fermentation process.


As the yeast becomes less active a week into the fermentation, it’s less vigorous about protecting itself from contaminants, which means it needs to be air-locked. The less sediment that makes it through this first step, the better. Even this early in the process, as much as 80 percent of the sediment will already be in place, as well as lingering pulp from the must.

, Most wine is racked no more and no less than three times. The third racking should be completed when the wine is completely cleared up, and this last racking should be done primarily to remove sediment and clarify the wine.


Some winemakers might choose to rack wine again, if the finished product needs to be very clean and clear to satisfy the style and the variety. Some winemakers will rack several more times to get the clearest wine possible.
If you're adding sulfites or are planning to filter the wine before you bottle it, you don't need to rack it anymore.

, Red wines are traditionally always racked, but some white wines don’t need to be and are instead bottled “on the lee,” or sur lie aging. Chardonnay, Champagne, and Muscadet are traditionally bottled on the lee, which some winemakers think helps to alter and integrate the inherent oakiness of the wine.


If you’re making white wine and want to try bottling on the lee, you need to taste the batch often and bottle most of it when it tastes right to avoid spoilage.

, Every time you rack wine, you expose it to lots and lots of oxygen, accelerating the aging process and exposing it to microorganisms and bacteria. Since the sanitization process is a long process prone to human error, it’s better to put the wine through fewer racking. Less is more.

Remove the skirt from the bottle.,
Remove the labels from the bottle by soaking.,
Remove the labels from the bottle through heat.,
Remove remaining residue.,
Sterilize the bottle.,
Remove spots and stains on inside of the bottle.,
Create a label for your wine.,
Fill the bottle with wine.,
Close the bottle with a screw-top.,
Close the bottle by corking (not recommended).",How to Reuse Screw Top Wine Bottles for Making Wine," Many screw-top wine bottles come with a collar or skirt attached to the neck of the bottle. These skirts help regulate the amount of oxygen that can reach the wine, and are meant to emulate the foil wrap found on traditional corked bottles. These skirts are often made of a lightweight metal such as tin or aluminum. To remove the skirt:


Twist off the foil along with the cap. Thinner skirts can often be removed with the cap by gripping the skirt along the base and giving a quick twist, opening the cap and loosening the skirt all at once. Remove in one piece.
Pry the skirt away with a screwdriver or other flat tool. Should the skirt remain on the bottle after opening, you may need to pry it away. Use a wedged tool such a screwdriver to create a flap on the skirt. Continue to pry with the screwdriver, or use pliers to pull away the skirt.
Cut the skirt away with a sharp knife. Depending on the thickness of the skirt, a sharp knife can create an incisive flap, which can be used to peel the skirt away. Be careful when using knives or screwdrivers to avoid a slip of the hand and injury.;
, For keeping track of your wine and storing them properly, you’ll want to make sure you don’t get confused by incorrect labeling. Soaking the bottles in a few homemade solutions is a simple way of removing labels from bottles and requires just a few household items.


Fill a bucket with water.
Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda for every 2 cups of water; alternatively, add 1/4 cup of ammonia.
Soak the bottles in the bucket for 30 minutes.
Labels will detach while soaking.
Manually peel off any labels that do not fully detach. Gloves recommended if soaking in ammonia.

, If you want to save the labels from your bottles for later use, you can remove them safely by using heat.


Bring a pot of water to a boil.
Hold the wine bottle over the boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes.
The glue will soften. Carefully remove label from the bottle with your hands (may be hot).
Can be steamed for an additional 10 to 15 minutes if the label will not remove.
Bottles may also be baked in the oven for 10 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit to loosen the glue holding the labels., Some labels will leave a film of residue on the bottle after they have been removed. This residue can often be removed with soap and warm water, and gentle scrubbing with a dish-safe abrasive such as a scrubbing pad. Steel wool may also work, but can run the risk of scratching the bottle.

, Regular cleaning methods of soap and water will not always destroy the bacteria and other germs that can remain in the bottle. Since you are storing wine in these bottles for a period of time, it is essential to ensure the bottle is as sterile as possible.


Purchase a water-mixable oxygenating cleaner.
Mix the solution as per the instructions provided on the cleaner.
Submerge the bottles in the solution according to instructions.
Once finished soaking, allow to dry. Sanitation occurs while the bottle is drying., Cleaning the inside of a bottle so that it is spot-free can be difficult. Two solutions can help remove those stains:


Fill the wine bottle one-quarter full with uncooked rice.
Add enough liquid soap to fill the bottle half way.
Fill the remainder of the bottle with hot water.
Replace screw-top or stop the opening of the bottle and shake vigorously for several minutes.
Allow the water to cool.
Pour out the contents of the bottle. Alternatively, you can use a bottle brush along with soap and water to scrub the inside of the bottle., How you label your wine is entirely up to you. There are many resources for purchasing wine label templates or even customizing a wine label, for a price. However, nothing is stopping you from using masking tape and a marker in order to label your wine. Note that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has several requirements for wine labeling in the United States (such as vintage date, alcohol content and declaration of sulfites), so keep this in mind if you plan on selling your wine., Insert your home-grown wine into the bottles in accordance with how the wine was prepared. You may also fill the bottles at your local vintner, for a price.

, As you are reusing a screw-top bottle, you may still have the original top for the bottle. This screw cap can be reused for sealing your wine. However, note that since the original seal was broken, recreating the same air tight conditions will be difficult, if not impossible, and thus it cannot be guaranteed that air and bacteria will not be able to enter the bottle.As such, reusing screw-top bottles best lends itself to short-term storage.

, Reused screw-top bottles can be corked for longer term storage, but this is generally not advised, as screw-top bottles are not made to support corks, and are much more prone to breaking during the process. If you would like to cork your bottle, do the following:


Purchase a corker. Corkers are divided into smaller hand models, and larger bench or floor models. Bench and floor models allow for quicker corking and are ideal for corking a large quantity of bottles. Hand models are more suited for smaller batches of bottles.
Prepare your cork. Corks are hard and rigid upon purchase and need to be softened before being inserted into the bottle. Soak the corks in water for several minutes before corking in order to provide pliability to the corks. They may also be steamed in a pan of water for 1 to 3 minutes until pliable to the touch.
Once pliable, use the corker to insert the cork into the bottle.
Leave bottles standing up-right between 1 and 2 days to give the corks time to re-expand and create a seal in the neck of the bottle."

Eat first.,
Drink slowly.,
Choose your beverages carefully.",How to Lessen the Effects of Alcohol1," When you consume alcohol it sits in your stomach while it waits to be processed. If you don't have food in there, the alcohol will process faster and at one time. If you have food in your belly, the alcohol will enter your system more slowly and at a varied pace thus lessening the effects of alcohol immediately.This is especially important if you know you will be drinking for a sustained period, like a bar crawl.;
, For the same reason that you want food in your stomach, drinking slowly will allow your body to process the alcohol over a period of time. Whereas, if you inundate your body with alcohol, it will be more difficult to process.

, Choose alcohols with fewer congeners (substances that are also produced during the fermentation process), which are less likely to cause a hangover. Light-colored beers and white wine have fewer congeners than darker beers and harder liquors. Stay away from brandy, whisky, and red wine.Cheap boozes tend to give you a worse hangover. Your body expends more energy to process impurities left in the alcohol.
Clearer alcohols like vodka, gin, and white rum are good options."
"
Drink plenty of water.,
Drink sports drinks.,
Drink some orange juice.,
Stay away from caffeinated beverages.,
Drink Sprite.,
Don’t drink more alcohol.",How to Lessen the Effects of Alcohol2," Drink water throughout the day before you start drinking alcohol and drink water in between alcoholic beverages. As one of the key causes of a hangover is dehydration, the more you do to combat it beforehand the better. If you have a hangover, be sure to drink plenty of water as well.Drink a pint of water before you go to sleep at night. Since your body continues to process water while you sleep — albeit less water — you will still wake up more dehydrated than when you go to bed. Since hangovers operate on dehydration, you can help lessen the effects of alcohol by drinking more water.Try to leave a glass of water by your bed so you can drink it when you wake up.

, In addition to water, these isotonic sports drinks can quickly replenish the fluids in your body, while adding carbohydrates needed for energy and electrolytes to your system.Sports drinks can be good to ease an upset stomach, too. Pick a flavor that tastes good and won’t make you further nauseous.

, Vitamin C, specifically, helps replenish energy, which is vital when the lethargic power of a hangover kicks in. The fructose found in many types of juices will help replenish sugars in your body depleted in order to process the alcohol you’ve consumed.Tomato juice and coconut water are also great options., Since alcohol is a depressant and makes people sleepy, it seems like the common cure-all would be coffee. Yet, coffee will further dehydrate you. If you have an upset stomach too, coffee may further irritate it. Stick to water. Rest is better than coffee., Chinese researchers tested the effects of 57 drinks and found that Sprite was the most effective at combatting hangover effects. The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase is released by your liver when you consume alcohol. The longer this enzyme is in your system directly relates to the length of your hangover. Get rid of it quickly if you want a shorter hangover. These researchers found that Sprite flushed the human system of alcohol dehydrogenase faster than any other beverage. Herbal tea actually prolonged the presence of this enzyme., Stay away from ""the hair of the dog that bit you."" While many people will tell you to just drink a little more of what you drank the night before to get over a hangover, don’t listen to them. All you’ll be doing is prolonging the effects of the alcohol. It may numb your symptoms in the short-term, it’ll probably worsen the hangover in the long term."

Eat some eggs.,
Eat some crackers or toast.,
Eat foods rich in potassium, like bananas.,
Eat soups rich with nutrients.",How to Lessen the Effects of Alcohol3," Eggs are an essential foodstuff for any hangover cure repertoire. They contain an amino acid called cysteine, which soaks up the toxins introduced to your body by alcohol. Eat a few egg whites and soon enough you’ll begin feeling back to normal.Fry or scramble them; it doesn’t matter how you prepare your eggs, as long as they are cooked. An urban myth says to drink a couple raw eggs after a night out on the town. The slimy factor mixed with the ever-present danger of salmonella make this myth simply that — a myth., Your first inclination may be to eat a heavy, greasy cheeseburger. Don’t do it. Eat something light like crackers or toast. Both contain sodium— something your body needs to work properly and something that alcohol consumption tends to reduce. , Since you urinate more when you drink heavily, your body is losing its precious potassium. Lower potassium levels lead to lethargy, nausea, and weakness. Bananas and kiwis are great sources of potassium. Baked potatoes, leafy greens, apricots, and mushrooms are also loaded with potassium. Consider chasing that last drink with a banana to lessen the effects of alcohol., Bouillon, chicken noodle, and miso soups are great soup options for a number of reasons. They all contain many nutrients your body needs to overcome a hangover and the nauseating effects of alcohol. Sodium, cysteine, and the rehydrating power of water and broth will help you immensely."

Sleep it off.,
Take a shower.,
Go for a short walk.",How to Lessen the Effects of Alcohol4," Hangovers are best eliminated with time. Since alcohol makes you feel sleepy, you might reach for the caffeinated beverage. This won’t work for you. Your body needs time to recuperate. Take a nap. This is the best way to get rid of that headache and to get your better judgement back., A warm shower will raise your core temperature. A warmer temperature will prepare your body for sleep, which will in turn allow you to bypass the horrendous headache of the dreaded hangover.


If you need to stay alert while drunk, a cold shower can help wake you up and keep your at the ready., A great way to get your alcohol’s effects under control is to go for a walk. Walking speeds up your metabolism, processing what’s in your stomach faster. So going for a short stroll may help reduce the duration of your alcohol’s effects. Obviously, alcohol impairs your ability to walk, so make sure you go for your jaunt in a safe space — away from cars and stairs (the two greatest dangers to the drunk)."

Take Ibuprofen, naproxen, and other prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs).,
Take a B6 supplement or shot.,
Take an antacid.",How to Lessen the Effects of Alcohol5," These medications can help numb that pounding headache. Follow the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more unless prescribed by a doctor.


Do not take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Acetaminophen will tax your liver further, leading to mild and even severe swelling., B6 will help revitalize your body.B6 increases cognitive function as well as reducing nausea and vomiting. You can purchase B6 from most pharmacies or vitamin supplement stores., Stomach pains and nausea are common effects of alcohol. Antacid pills will help regulate the acidity levels in your stomach. If you feel sick, pop an antacid. Sodium alginate and potassium bicarbonate based antacids, available over the counter, can help a lot. Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more than is recommended by your doctor."

Hold your breath.When you hold your breath, you stop your diaphragm from moving normally.,
Change your body position.,
Drink a glass of water quickly.When you drink quickly and without stopping, your abdominal muscles are put to work and your hiccups might end in the process.,
Try coughing.Coughing forcefully uses a lot of abdominal muscle power, and the action might halt the hiccup reflex.,
Put pressure on the bridge of your nose.Place your finger on the bridge of your nose and press as hard as you can.,
Make yourself sneeze.Sneezing puts abdominal muscles to work, which can break up the hiccupping action and hopefully end it.,
Gargle with water.Gargling requires you to concentrate, and the action can disrupt the way you are breathing and using your abdominal muscles.,
Drink a shot of vinegar.Strong substances like vinegar or pickle juice can “shock” your body into a bout of hiccups.,
Ice the problem.Take a small bag of ice and place it on the skin of your upper stomach, which is near your diaphragm.,
Stimulate the vagus nerve.The vagus nerve is related to a number of bodily functions, and stimulating it can help end your hiccups.,
Seek medical treatment if your hiccups last more than 48 hours.",How to Get Rid of Hiccups When You Are Drunk1," Since hiccups seem to be associated with a reflex movement of the diaphragm, halting it can help to end them.


After holding your breath for a few seconds, swallow large breaths of air a few times. Repeat this process a few times to see if it can stop your hiccups.;
, Sit while pulling your knees up to your chest or bending over will compress your diaphragm.Hiccups are related to diaphragm spasms, and compressing the diaphragm may reduce the spasms.


Be careful getting up and down--remember that your coordination and sense of balance might be impaired when you are drinking.

,


You can use a straw or two to help you drink the water more quickly.
Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups.

, Even if you don’t actually have to cough, just make yourself do it.

, It’s not clear why this technique works, but putting pressure put on a nerve or blood vessel often seems to help.

, To make yourself sneeze, try sniffing a little pepper, breathing in a dusty area, or walking out into bright sunshine.

, All of this together can help end a bout of hiccups.

, However, if you already have them, they may also “shock” your body into ending them.


If this method does not work the first time, it is probably best not to try it again, since drinking too much vinegar can irritate your stomach and esophagus. If it doesn’t work, just try a different method.

, The cold can cause changes in your circulation and muscle activity in the area, which might stop the hiccups.


If your hiccups do not go away within twenty minutes, remove the ice and try a different method. Leaving the ice on too long can cause soreness.

, Try one of these tricks:


Let a spoonful of sugar slowly dissolve on your tongue.
Eat a spoonful of honey.Tickle the roof of your mouth with a cotton swab.Stick your fingers in your ear.
Sip water (or some other non-alcoholic, non-carbonated beverage) slowly, letting it hit the roof of your mouth., Typically, you can cure hiccups with home remedies. However, if your hiccups last longer than two consecutive days and you've tried treating them at home already, it's time to see your doctor."

Choose a plain vodka to drink.,
Throw your bottle of vodka in the freezer for a few hours.,
Pour the vodka into a small glass.,
Sip vodka, don't shoot it.,
Eat appetizers between sips.",How to Drink Vodka1," Most vodka aficionados believe that drinking vodka in its pure form is the proper way to enjoy this beverage.








Vodka is commonly made by fermenting either grains or vegetables.Grain-based vodka tends to taste smooth, even fruity while vegetable-based vodka can taste harsh or medicinal.According to some vodka enthusiasts, a good vodka will taste creamy and smooth. It will smell grainy and have a thick texture when frozen. A bad vodka will be harsh, bitter tasting, watery, and smell like medicine. If vodka burns your palate, it is most likely lower quality.If you have trouble picking a vodka, opt for a popular brand. Most people prefer the taste of Grey Goose, Absolut, Smirnoff, Ketel One, or Stolichnaya.If pure vodka is too aggressive a taste for you, opt for a flavored vodka like green apple or vanilla. The added sugar content may make the drink more palatable.;
, This isn't wine! You want this beverage as cold as possible.








Don't worry about your vodka freezing solid. Alcohol has a much lower freezing point than water and will remain unfrozen in a standard freezer.

, Only fill it enough for a few sips. Remember, this isn't a cocktail; plain vodka will make you intoxicated more quickly.









Small tumblers are customary for clear vodkas. Fill the tumbler to between 3-5 millimeters below the rim.Shot glasses are acceptable substitutes for tumblers.

, Focus on savoring the taste rather than getting drunk.









Smell the vodka as you swirl it in your glass. Take a small sip and let the flavor rest on your palate for a few seconds. Exhale through your nose to fully appreciate its grainy aroma. Now swallow it and savor the aftertaste.Vodka was originally created to be a food spirit, meant to be imbibed gradually like wine., This will help counter the taste and balance the potency of plain vodka.


Russian drinkers refer to appetizers as ""zakuski"" and it is considered traditional to snack between each sip.Common zakuski include quiche, smoked fish, spicy sausage, olives, and cucumbers.

Locate the name of the country that made the wine.,
Check the quality designation.,
Look for the year to learn the wine's vintage.,
Find the name of the specific region of origin.,
Identify the region.,
Find the bottle shape that matches the wine you want.",How to Read a Wine Label1," The label will tell you where the wine was made; if it was produced in specific countries, it is an Old World wine. When someone refers to a wine as an “Old World” wine, this means it was produced in one of the countries that are thought to be the first countries to make wine. Some people prefer Old World wines simply because they appreciate the long history that went into the making of these wines.Old World wines tend to be lower in alcohol content, and lighter and more restrained in taste – although this is not true of every wine.
Countries that are considered to be the birthplace of winemaking include: France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Georgia, Hungary, Switzerland, Israel, and Lebanon.;
, Old World wines are regulated and graded, and each country has its own system of rating its wines. In general, they rank from “superior quality” wines to “table” wines, which are the lowest-rated, everyday wines. The quality designations of several European wine countries, from highest to lowest quality, are as follows:France: AOC (Appellation of Controlled Origin), VDQS (Wines of Superior Quality), Vins de Pays (Country Wine), Vins de Table (Table Wine).
Germany: QmP (Quality Wine with Special Attributes), QbA (Quality Wine from Specific Appellations), Deutscher Landwein (Superior Table Wine), Deutscher Tafelwein (Simple Table Wine).
Italy: DOCG (Denomination of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin), DOC (Denomination of Controlled Origin), IGT (Typical Geographical Indication), Vini di tavola (Table Wines).
Spain: DO (Denomination of Origin), DOC (Denomination of Qualified Origin).
Portugal has only one classification, indicating a good quality wine: DO (Denomination of Controlled Origin).

, Most wines are vintage wines, and the label will tell you the year that the wine was made. Vintage wines are made of grapes from the same harvest year, and are usually designed to be aged. Non-vintage wines are made from a blend of grapes from different harvest years, and are not intended to be aged.Look on the front of the label for a year, which is usually written out completely (for example, 1989, 2007, 1967).
If it is not part of the main label, it might be printed separately on a sticker on the bottle neck.
If the year is not listed on the front of the bottle, it might be on the back label.

, This information should be listed prominently on the front of the label. In Europe, most wine makers label their bottles according to the region they come from, not the type of grape. Vintners assume the buyer will be savvy enough to know that “Red Burgundy” (Burgundy being a region in France) means “Pinot Noir.” Different types of grapes are grown in different regions, producing different types of wine.In France, the region Alsace produces fruity, Germanic wines; the Bordeaux region produces Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot; the Champagne region produces sparkling white wines; Beaujolais produces a light red wine that is released in November each year and is designed to be consumed right away.
Chianti is not a type of grape, it is a region of Italy that makes Chianti wine.

, High quality wines are often extremely specific when describing the region that produced them. Generally speaking, the more specific the location named, the more famous the vineyard.Meursault in Burgundy is a village that is known for producing high quality Chardonnay. A wine label listing this town may be of higher quality than one that simply names “Burgundy.”
Right outside of Bordeaux is a small town called Saint-Emilion, that is famous for its Merlot-blends. A wine label that specifies Saint-Emilion is likely to contain a higher quality wine than one that simply lists the region Bordeaux.
The Rheingau is a region of Germany that produces the best Riesling wines, and is considered the birthplace of German wines.

, European wines are bottled according to type, so the shape of the bottle will give you a clue as to its contents. If you're looking for a specific type of wine, you don't need to read the labels if the bottle isn't appropriate to that type of wine.Straight, high-shouldered bottles contain Bordeaux wines – green glass for red wines, clear glass for white. (The shoulder is the point where the bottle diameter increases.)
In France, Burgundy, the Loire, and the Rhone use gently-shouldered bottles. Outside of France, this type of bottle sometimes contains Chardonnay or Pinot Noir.
Tall, slender bottles are usually from Germany and Alsace, and tend to contain Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, or the sweet dessert wine Gewurztraminer.

A higher percentage means the drink is likely to get you drunk faster.Beers with higher alcohol contents often have around 15-18% alcohol. They may come from smaller, more independent breweries as opposed to larger companies.
Even beers with around 11% alcohol content are quite potent. If you can't find something in the 15-18% range, see if you can find anything at around 11% alcohol.
Remember your limits. A few strong beers can really set you over the edge. Slow down the pace of you're drinking when you feel buzzed. If you start to feel very dizzy or sick, this is a sign you need to stop drinking. You do not want to end up ill from alcohol.;
, Mixing spirits with diet mixers, like diet soda, gets you drunk faster. This may be because regular sodas are recognized as food, slowing down the body's absorption of alcohol. The body may not treat diet soda as food, allowing the alcohol to be absorbed quicker.People do not necessarily notice they're getting drunk faster when mixing spirits with diet mixers. If you're mixing liquor with diet soda, make sure to be aware you may be drunker than you realize.

, Bubbly drinks may get you drunk faster. If you're looking to get drunk fast, and like champagne and spritzers, order a bubbly drink.Bubbly drinks include champagne, sparkling wine, spritzers, and drinks mixed with tonic water.

, Hard liquors can get you drunk faster than beer or wine, as they have a higher alcohol content. Doing shots can be particularly useful, as you'll be absorbing high alcohol products fast. Vodka in particular has been shown to increase the speed of intoxication. Try drinking hard liquors if you're looking to get drunk fast.Keep in mind, depending on the bar, drinks will be stronger or weaker. Some bartenders may, for example, give you considerably more than a single serving of liquor in a mixed drink.
You can also ask for a double of something. This will allow you to get two servings in a single drink. If you're drinking more, and faster, this will allow you to get drunk quicker.
Liquor has a very high alcohol content. Overdoing it on liquor can land you sick. Try to stick to only one or two hard drinks.

, High stress levels can slow intoxication. If you're doing something stressful while drinking, or feel stressed going into the situation, this could affect your buzz.Try to calm down just before a night drinking. Before going out, do something that normally relaxes you. Watch your favorite television show. Read a book. Do some deep breathing techniques.
Go out drinking with friends that decrease your stress level, rather than increase it. If you're with friends that tend to stress you out, you may not get as drunk as quickly.

, You should never drink on an empty stomach. This is very dangerous. However, do not eat a huge meal before a night of drinking. Food slows down your body's ability to absorb alcohol. If you start drinking just after a large meal, it may take you longer to get drunk.Have a light meal a few hours before drinking. Go for something like a salad with chicken, a light sandwich, a serving of fish, or a small serving of pasta.
Never drink on an empty stomach. While this will definitely get you drunk fast, it increases the likelihood of you getting sick from drinking. Drinking on an empty stomach can be very damaging to your health.

, If you're drinking with friends, you're more likely to drink fast. People finish their drinks quicker when in a large group. Drinking faster gets you drunk quicker, and also increases the amount you'll drink throughout the night. All of this can result in achieving a greater buzz faster.Do not neglect to track your drinks, however. It's easy to accidentally overdo it when drinking in a group, especially if you're around people with a higher alcohol tolerance. Be aware of how you're feeling when you drink. If you start feeling uncomfortable, it's time to stop even if your friends want to drink more.

, Drinking out of a regular beer glass may inhibit your ability to get drunk. Curved or fluted glasses may get you drunk faster. This is because it's difficult to measure the halfway point in a curved glass versus a straight glass. You will drink faster, as you'll be unsure of how much you're drinking.If you're drinking at a bar, you may be served curved glasses if you order beer or champagne.
If you're drinking at home, try picking up a few cheap curved glasses at local supermarket or department store.

, If you want to get drunk fast, you need to know your limits. You do not want to end up getting sick. Be aware of how much you can drink and still keep yourself in check.You may know your limits from previous experiences drinking. For example, you know you start to feel sick and lose memory around the four drink mark.
If you're new to drinking, you may be unsure of your limits. Try to be aware of what you're feeling. If you start to feel physically ill, or very dizzy, this is a sign you should stop. You can also ask a friend to look out for you, and let you know when you seem to be losing control.
You want to remain in control of the situation, even if you're drunk. This can be harder to do if you're attempting to get drunk fast.
If you feel yourself becoming very inebriated, take a break for a bit. You do not need to keep chugging alcohol throughout the night to keep your buzz going. You should stop once you feel drunk.

, Many people avoid food before drinking in order to get drunk faster. This is never a good idea. Always eat something, even something small, prior to drinking. You should also snack throughout the night. Go for high protein foods, like nuts or cheeses., Getting drunk once in awhile can be fun, especially in a social event. However, in the long run, alcohol abuse can cause damage to your overall health. During most events, stick to one or two drinks. This will keep you safe and healthy., Alcohol can interfere with certain mediations. If you're going to be getting drunk, check the labels of all your medications. Make sure they do not interact poorly with alcohol.Avoid taking painkillers after a night of drinking. These can interact poorly with alcohol and cause damage to your liver and other organs. Painkillers with acetaminophen can be particularly dangerous."

Hide alcohol in other containers.,
Buy a concealed flask.,
Use a coffee cup to hide alcohol.,
Choose vodka.,
Hide odor by creatively spiking drinks.,
Drink carefully to avoid getting caught.,
Freshen your breath.,
Use eye drops.,
Stay hydrated.,
Keep quiet.,
Know when you've reached your limit.",How to Drink Without Getting Caught," If you want to drink subtly, try to conceal your alcohol in other containers. Pour beer into a soda container. Mix liquor into half a bottle of soda or juice. Pour alcohol into a paper fast food restaurant cup. Pour clear liquor into a mouthwash container., Many online retailers, such as Amazon, sell flasks specifically made to help you conceal alcohol. Prices vary depending on the type of flask you get.


Most flasks are hidden in clothing. They may strap under a tie or bra or can be secured up your sleeve.Other flasks are disguised as bags or purses. If you want to drink at an event that forbids alcohol, these devices could come in handy., The styrofoam, plastic, or paper coffee cups given out at coffee shops are great for concealing alcohol. Save a cup the next time you get coffee out.


If the coffee cup is Styrofoam or unclear plastic, you can use it to conceal virtually any type of alcohol as the liquid will not be visible through the cup.A clear plastic cup can still be useful. Red wine looks like coffee and you can also mix a dark liquid, like soda or pomegranate juice, with a liquor of your choice. You can also simply spike your coffee., Vodka produces less smell than many types of alcohol. It is also easier to conceal as it looks like water to a causal observer. You can easily drink vodka out of a water bottle without getting caught., If you want to add alcohol to drinks, there are many ways to creatively spike a beverage that masks the odor. Consider some of these tricks.


Spike your coffee. Coffee has a strong scent that covers the smell of most alcohol. Adding a dash of liquor to a cup of a coffee is unlikely to cause too much smell.Choose a peppermint flavored drink, like peppermint hot cocoa or tea. Peppermint gives off a strong scent that usually overpowers alcohol.Around the holiday season, non-alcoholic drinks made with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, and other strong, earthy scents are easy to spike without getting caught. Much like peppermint, these smells are hard to detect., Be aware of the manner in which you are drinking. Taking extra caution when imbibing can decrease the likelihood of getting caught.


If you're using a flask to conceal alcohol, drink when others are not around. Sneak off to a private location to steal a drink. If you're hiding alcohol in something like a coffee container, drink as you normally would.
Keep the container in which you're hiding alcohol away from others. If they take a sip or smell the alcohol, you'll end up getting caught. If someone asks to try your drink, make up an excuse. Claim you have a cold or flu and do not want to infect them.

, Alcohol tends to cause bad breath. If you want to hide the fact you're drinking, use mouth wash, breath strips, and mint flavored gum. Try to always be chewing on something with a strong odor, like foods with red onions and garlic, in order to cover up the smell.

, Some people are prone to bloodshot eyes when drinking. If this is the case with you, try to carry a small eye drop container with you when you drink. You can purchase one at a local drugstore. If you feel your eyes getting itchy, irritated, or dry run to the bathroom and use the container.

, Drink plenty of water when you're drinking. Not only can this prevent hangovers, it can help cover up the smell of alcohol.


Strive to drink one, 8 ounce glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink. A 8 ounce beer or glass of wine counts as a drink. One shot of hard liquor also constitutes roughly one drink.
Sports drinks that contain electrolytes can also be helpful when it comes to concealing alcohol.

, People tend to slur their speeches when drunk. They also tend to lose track of the volume of their voice. If you're trying to avoid getting caught drinking, try to keep quiet and listen.

, After a certain point, you cannot hide your drinking no matter how hard you try to conceal it. Inhibitions fall with drinking and you'll be less vigilant the more you drink. If you begin to feel tipsy, you might want to stop. You may notice you feel unbalanced or lightheaded. Many people also feel increasingly social and happy when they're beginning to become drunk. If you notice these symptoms, stop drinking.

Try counting or other rote activities.If you have your brain concentrate on a moderately difficult activity, it might stop causing the hiccups.,
Focus on breathing.,
Increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream.If there is an abnormally high level of carbon dioxide in your blood, your brain will focus on this, and the hiccups may stop.,
Drink water in an uncomfortable position.,
Have someone scare you.Being frightened is a good way to take you mind off of something, including hiccups.",How to Get Rid of Hiccups When You Are Drunk2," If you have been drinking, you might have to concentrate a little harder, but in this case that might actually help. Try one of these tasks:


Count backwards from 100.
Say or sing the alphabet backwards
Do multiplication problems (4 x 2 = 8; 4 x 5 = 20; 4 x 6 = 24; etc.)
Say each letter of the alphabet and a word that begins with that letter

, Normally, we don’t think about breathing. If you concentrate on it, however, it might help end the hiccups.


Try holding your breath and slowly counting to 10.Try inhaling through your nose as slowly and as deeply as you can, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times.

, You can increase your bloodstream’s carbon dioxide level by breathing abnormally:


Hold your breath as long as you canBreathe deeply and slowly
Blow up a balloon
Breathe into a paper bag, You might try bending over as you drink, or drinking from the far side of the glass.Since this is an unusual way to drink, you will have to concentrate not to spill the water. The distraction might help end the hiccups.


Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups.

, If you are really scared by something, your brain might focus on that rather than the hiccup reflex. For this to work, you will need a friend to help—ask them to leap out of the darkness or jump around a corner when you least expect it.

Find the name of the country of origin.,
Look for the brand name.,
Identify a production date.,
Check for the type of grape used.,
Identify the name of a vineyard.,
Note the viticultural area.,
Find the words “estate bottled.” For a wine label to boast the words “estate bottled,” 100% of the grapes in that wine were grown, processed, fermented, and bottled at the same location.The words “estate bottled” often appear under the vintage (year), on the front of the label.

,
Look for the net contents.,
Check the alcohol content.,
Pay attention to the wine ratings on the shelf.",How to Read a Wine Label2," Locate the country that produced the wine, to determine if it is a New World wine. This information should be clearly listed on the front label. If it is not on the front, it may be on the back label.New World wines tend to vary dramatically, and a good deal of experimentation goes into producing new, interesting varieties.
Warmer climates produce wines that have bolder, fruity flavors and be more full-bodied than Old World wines, and usually have a higher alcohol content.
New World wines come from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa.
California wines will usually tell you that they come from Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles, or another region that makes wine.

, For New World wines, the brand is also the name of the vineyard that produced the wine, and it will usually be the main name on the label. It will be written in the largest type size, and usually appears at the top of the front label., Wines are usually vintage, which means that they are identified by the year they were produced. You can age a bottle of wine to allow its flavor to mature and develop. There are also non-vintage wines, which are made from grapes harvested during different years. These wines are not meant to be aged.Check the label for a date first. Look at the front label and then the back label to see if you can find the date. It will usually just be a year, such as 1998 or 2014.
If you cannot find the date on the label, then it might be printed on a sticker on the bottle’s neck.

, This is usually the second-largest writing on the label, after the brand name. New World wines label their bottles according to the type of grape that was used to create the wine. Rather than memorizing which type of wine comes from which region, all you need to know is which types of wine (i.e. type of grape – or varietal) you enjoy.If a specific varietal is named, at least 75% of the wine must come from that type of grape. (Wines with mixed grape types must have a generic name such as “table wine.”)
Cabernet Sauvignon is currently the most popular wine in the world. It is a full-bodied red wine that can taste of black cherry, baking spices, black currant, or cedar.
Merlot is a middle weight red wine that is fruitier and smoother (lower in tannins) than Cabernet Sauvignon.
Syrah is a full-bodied red wine that can contain tastes of violet, black pepper, plum, and blueberry. Australia produces many Syrah (or Shiraz) wines.
Chardonnay is a white wine that is medium- to full-bodied, that can have notes of citrus, pear, apple, butterscotch, cinnamon, and toasted caramel.
Pinot Grigio (or Pino Gris) is a light-bodied white wine that can have notes of citrus, pear, apple, floral, and cheese rind.
Sauvignon Blanc is an aggressively citrus (grapefruit) white wine, with notes of melon, mint, green pepper, and grass. It is a light- to medium-bodied wine.

, If a specific vineyard is named on an American wine, such as “Jackson Estate Vineyard,” then 95% of the grapes used to make that wine must have come from that specific vineyard.Not all wines will list a vineyard on the bottle, but some do, especially if the winery attributes special qualities to its wine because of the property.

, An officially designated viticultural area is a region such as Napa Valley that is noted for high quality wines. The region will be specified on the label, indicating that 85% or more of the grapes used to make the wine were grown in that area.,, The amount of wine in the bottle must be clearly marked. For a standard size bottle, this is usually 750 mL. The volume amount will be marked on the label, or stamped into the glass of the bottle itself.You can also buy large bottles of wine. These are often referred to as magnums. These bottles contain the equivalent of two bottles of wine, which is about 1.5 Liters.

, Typically, wines range from about 7% alcohol content to as high as 23%. Sweeter wines have a higher percentage of alcohol than dryer wines, and New World wines tend to have a higher alcohol content than Old World wines.American wines cannot exceed 14% alcohol content by volume, or they cross over into a higher taxation level.
American wines that are labeled “Table Wine” can have an alcohol content of 14% or less, without having to specify the amount of alcohol on the label.

, The Wine Spectator publishes an extensive list of wines that have been tasted and rated according to their very specific system. Stores that carry wine often post these ratings on the shelf below the wine bottle. Although personal taste always trumps someone else's opinion, this is a good place to start if you want to try an unfamiliar wine.A rating of 95-100 indicates a “great” or “classic” wine (by the Wine Spectator standards.)
90-94 indicates an outstanding wine with unusually high character and style.
85-89 describes a “very good” wine with special qualities.
80-84 is the rating for an good wine; one that is “solid and well-made.”
75-79 describes a “mediocre” wine, one that the tasters believed to be drinkable but flawed.
Wines rated below 74 are not recommended.

Hit the gym or the local park.,
Go bungee jumping.,
Fall in love.,
Experience nature.,
Ride a roller coaster.",How to Feel Drunk Without Drinking1," Exercise is one of the most well-known ways to experience a drunk-like feeling without imbibing in alcohol. Getting a regular cardio session in releases your body's endorphins, seratonin, and dopamine, which are chemicals in your brain. When released, these chemicals can create a sort of euphoric feeling, not unlike the feeling of being drunk.Exercising regularly can make a lasting impact on your mood. Find an exercise plan that suits you. If you're social, try joining a group class, such as cardio dance or boot camp. If you value some solitude, consider taking up running.;
, For a lot of people, the rush that comes from extreme sports is the best kind of high you can get. If you're looking for a mind-altering experience that does not involve drinking, there are a lot of options for you. For example, you could try sky-diving, white water rafting, or snowboarding. All of these activities have a significant impact on your mental state, as well as being physical exercise.Try looking for local adventure groups in your area. Often, you can join a group excursion for something like rock climbing or hang gliding. This can cut down on the cost of extreme sports, and also help you to make new friends who share this interest with you.

, People who have been in love have described themselves as feeling giddy and out of control. Being in love--or lust--can actually affect the human brain in the same way that alcohol, or drugs can. When you're in love, your dopamine levels spike, creating a euphoric feeling. Besides euphoria, love can also make people feel less inhibited, more generous, and reduced stress levels., Do you ever notice that you feel like a different person when you're on vacation? That is probably because many of us choose to take our breaks away from our typical environments--and for many people, your typical environment is an urban one. When you're on a beach, in the mountains, or hiking in a forest, the brain seems to process information differently. Sounds are louder, colors more vibrant, and the air feels different. This is not unlike the feeling of being drunk. Go outside!, Your local amusement park can be a great place to find that exciting feeling you have been looking for. Whether you try out the latest super coaster, or take a thrilling water ride, there are plenty of attractions that can leave you feeling exhilarated. Roller coasters can definitely provide some of the same feelings you would get from drinking alcohol. You can expect to feel dizzy, wobbly, and disoriented. And often, immediately ready to move on to the next ride!"

Learn how brandy is made.,
Get an overview of the history of brandy.,
Learn that there are different types of brandies with different rating systems depending on age.,
Learn the different aging systems.,
Consider trying Armagnac.,
Consider trying Cognac.,
Consider trying American brandy.,
Consider trying pisco brandy.,
Consider trying apple brandy.,
Consider trying eaux de vie.,
Consider trying Brandy de Jerez.,
Choose your brandy by type and then age when purchasing.",How to Drink Brandy1," Brandy is any distilled spirit made from fruit juice. The fruit is crushed to get just the juice and then the juice is fermented to make fruit wine. After that, the fruit wine is distilled to produce brandy. The brandy is then usually aged in wooden barrels, although some brandies are not aged.


Brandy is made from grapes but there are brandies made from other fruits such as apple, peach, plum and many others. When brandy is made from another fruit, the fruit name is said first before the word “brandy.” For example, if made from apples, it would be called apple brandy.
Brandies get their dark color from aging in barrels. Un-aged brandies will not have this caramel color but colors will often be added to create the same look.
Pomace brandy is made a bit differently. Instead of just fermenting the grape juice, fermentation and distillation to make pomace brandy will include the skins, stems and seeds of the grapes. Pomace brandy is also known as marc (English and French) and grappa (Italian).;
, The name ""brandy"" originates from the Dutch ""brandewijn,"" or ""burnt wine,"" which evokes the warm, glowing feeling from the first sip of a fine brandy.


Brandy has been made since the 12th Century but was originally only made by apothecaries and doctors and used as a medicine. French authorities only allowed winemakers to begin distillation in the 16th century.
The French brandy industry grew slowly until the Dutch began importing brandy for consumption and for export to other European countries. It was cheaper to ship in terms of the amount of alcohol than wine, and so was economically viable for merchants.
The Dutch invested in building distilleries in the French winemaking areas of the Loire, Bordeaux and Charente. Charente became the most lucrative area for brandy production and is the location of the town called Cognac., Popular types include Armagnac, Cognac, American brandy, pisco, apple brandy, eaux de vie and Brandy de Jerez. Brandies are categorized by age, according to different systems for different types of brandy.

, Brandy is processed in a slow and gentle manner to bring out all its flavors and is traditionally aged in oak barrels. There are different aging systems and categorizations for different kinds of brandy. General aging labels can include AC, VS (Very Special), VSOP (Very Special Old Pale), XO (Extra Old), Hors d’age and vintage but these vary greatly for different types of brandy.


VS (Very Special) has been aged a minimum of two years. These are best used for mixing as opposed to drinking neat.
VSOP (Very Special Old Pale) brandy is usually between 4 and a half to six years old.
XO (Extra Old) brandy are usually six and a half years old or more.
Hors d’age brandies are too old to determine the age of for some reason or another.
For some brandies these labels are regulated while for others they are not.

, Armagnac is a grape brandy named for the region of Armagnac in the southwest of France. It is made from a blend of Colombard and Ugni Blanc grapes and distilled once in column stills. Then it is aged for at least two years in French oak, resulting in a more rustic brandy than Cognac. After aging different aged brandies are blended to make a consistent product.


3-star or VS (Very Special) brandy has a youngest brandy in the blend that has aged at least two years in oak.
VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least four years in oak, although many of these brandies are actually much older.
Napoleon or XO (Extra Old) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least six years in oak.
Hors d’age brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least ten years.
If the Armagnac has an age on the label it means that the youngest brandy in the bottle is that age.
There are also vintage Armagnacs that are at least ten years old and the year of harvest will be displayed on the bottle.
These age categories only apply to Armagnac; Cognacs and other brandies will have different meanings for these categories.

, Cognac is a grape brandy named for the town of France from which it originates and made from a blend of specific grapes including Ugni Blanc. It has to be distilled twice in copper pot stills and aged in French oak barrels for at least two years.


3-star or VS (Very Special) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least two years in oak.
VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least four years, although most brandies in this class are actually much older.
Napoleon, XO (Extra Old), Extra or Hors d’age brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least six years in oak. On average, these brandies are usually actually 20 years old or more.
Some Cognacs age 40-50 years in oak.

, American brandy includes many different brands and does not have much legal regulation. Any age categorizing such as VS, VSOP and XO are not legally controlled and you should be aware of this when buying. There are only two U.S. regulations that affect the consumer in terms of the brandy.


By law if the brandy has not been aged for two years, it must have the word “immature” on its label.
Additionally by law, if it is not made from grapes then it must say the fruit from which it was made.
Since classifications are not regulated by law, different brands have different ages for their classifications and their aging processes may not be very long. Check the websites of the distillers for more information on particular varieties and ages.
There are no legal requirements dictating which distillation techniques should be used.

, Pisco is an un-aged grape brandy made in Peru and Chile. Because it is un-aged it is clear in color. There is currently an argument between Peru and Chile over who should be allowed to produce pisco and if it should be restricted to certain regions.

, Apple brandy is made using apples and comes from either America, where it is called the applejack, or France, where it is called Calvados. It is very versatile and can be used in a range of cocktails.


The American version, applejack, is very bright and fruity.
The French version, Calvados, is more nuanced, subtle and layered in flavor.

, Eaux de vie are un-aged brandies made from fruits other than grapes such as raspberries, pears, plums, cherries as well as others. They are usually clear because they are un-aged.


In Germany eaux de vie is called ""Schnapps"" but this is not at all the same thing as American schnapps.

, Brandy de Jerez originates from the Andalusia region in Spain and has its own prescribed production method in which it is only distilled once in copper stills. It is then aged in American oak barrels.


Brandy de Jerez Solera is the youngest and fruitiest and has a minimum average age of 1 year.
Brandy de Jerez Solera Reserva has a minimum average age of 3 years.
Brandy de Jerez Solera Gran Reserva is the oldest of the brandies with a minimum average age of 10 years.

, The type can be one of those discussed or it can simply say “brandy”. If it does not have a particular type then look for the country of importation and the source used (for example, grapes, fruit or pomace). Choose by age after you have chosen by type. Remember that general age categories for brandy are very variable and differ according to the type.

If you don't have a breathalyzer handy, use a BAC chart or online calculator to work out when you are safe to drive. Calculating your BAC without a breathalyzer will require you to keep closer track of how much alcohol you consume.;
, Different drinks have different percentages of alcohol content, and the size of a ""standard"" drink differs, as well. So a standard drink of beer is not only a different amount than a drink of whiskey, it also has a different alcohol content.One standard drink is considered one 12 fl oz beer; one 5 fl oz glass of wine; one 1.5 fl oz shot of hard liquor. Overall, a standard drink is a drink which contains 14 grams (0.49 oz) of pure alcohol. Beer is usually 4% – 6% alcohol. This varies depending on the type of beer, so check the label to be sure. Some imports, malt liquors, and craft beers are stronger (8% – 12% or more).
One standard drink of wine ( white, red, rose, and champagne or sparkling wine) is measured as 5 ounces.The average alcohol content of a 5-ounce glass of wine is around 12%.
One standard drink of 80 proof hard liquor is measured as 1.5 ounces. One shot of liquor typically contains 40% alcohol. Be aware that some drinks are made with even stronger potency, like 151 proof rum or grain alcohol. Thus, your BAC may rise more quickly when drinking hard liquor in place of beer or wine.
Some mixed drinks contain more than one type of alcohol and will contain more alcohol than a standard drink.

, Your BAC depends on your gender, age, and your weight. These elements contribute to how quickly your body will metabolize alcohol.


Alcohol is absorbed differently by men and women. Men's bodies typically contain more body water (61% vs 52%) and will be able to dilute the alcohol more.
A 165-pound man who has had four standard beers in one hour will have an estimated BAC of 0.082%. If his 130-pound female friend decides to match him drink-for-drink during that hour, she would have a BAC of about 0.123%.
Know your current weight. Your weight will affect what your estimated BAC is because typically if you are hydrated, the more you weigh the more water your body will have to dilute alcohol. This can slow absorption.
Note that alcohol is absorbed through muscle tissue and not fat. The more body fat you have, the higher your BAC will be. So, a man who weighs 180 pounds but is in good shape will typically have a lower BAC than a man weighing 180 pounds who is out of shape.
Your age will also have a factor. As we age our metabolism slows down and our bodies may not process alcohol as quickly.

, To calculate your estimated BAC, not only track how many drinks you’ve had, but what you’ve been drinking, and how fast you’ve been drinking.


Whether you’re serving yourself or drinking at a bar, the chances of you consuming a standard drink are lowered. Unless you are drinking from a can or pint glass, you're not always poured a standard drink with exact proportions. Oftentimes bartenders will eyeball the amount of liquor or wine that gets poured. Therefore, it’s a good idea to count your drinks but round up to be safe.
Notice how fast you are consuming alcohol. The faster you drink, the faster your BAC will rise. Because your body can only process a certain amount of alcohol at a time, the more you have in your stomach and bloodstream, the higher the BAC. , The most accurate way to calculate your BAC is by drawing blood. Other methods will give you a good estimate of where your BAC is, but shouldn’t be relied on to be completely accurate.


Use a BAC chart to find where you are at. You can look up one online or print one out for wallet.
The truth is that it’s very hard to get an accurate measuring of your BAC without a breathalyzer, blood draw, or complicated math. Because everyone’s bodies are different, variables such as food consumption, body type, hydration, fatigue, other ingredients in your drinks, etc., make it difficult to guess.
You can also use an online BAC calculator to give you an estimate. If you’ve kept track of your intake and know your weight, this will give you a reasonable estimate.

, Time will have an effect on your BAC. Your BAC won’t lower faster if you space out your drinking. But it also won’t be as high as if you drank several drinks in a short time period. However, as your body processes the alcohol over a period of time, your BAC will lower.


For example, if you have three 12 fl oz beer drinks in one hour, are male, and weigh around 200 pounds, your estimated BAC is roughly around 0.044%. If you were to space those same four drinks out over three hours, your BAC would be around 0.010%. As for sobering up, the general rule is to subtract 0.015% from your total BAC for each hour that passes since your last drink. This is not, however, exact. If you are unsure, err on the side of caution and call a cab if you're on your way home for the night.

, In addition to age and gender, your BAC can be affected by the following BAC variables:Body type
Fat/muscle content
Metabolism
Emotional state
Diabetes
Alcohol intolerance
Hereditary factors
Other ingredients. Water and juice mixed with alcohol may slow absorption for a lower BAC. Carbonated beverages like tonic water and energy drinks speed up absorption for a higher BAC.
Most online BAC charts and calculators assume that you are not drinking on an empty stomach or have any prevailing conditions that would further affect your BAC. These variables are why it is so hard to calculate your BAC without a professional test or breathalyzer.

, While some people believe that certain substances, foods, or actions can help you sober up, many of these techniques don’t actually affect your BAC. Note that drinking a glass of water or coffee does not dilute the blood and sober you up. Water can slow the absorption of new alcohol but cannot reduce the effects of alcohol already in your blood. Caffeine may make you feel more awake but doesn’t have any effect on your BAC.
Food will only prevent your BAC from rising quickly if it’s already in your system before consuming alcohol.
The type of alcohol you consume won’t affect your BAC. One type of alcohol doesn’t affect your BAC more than another. Your BAC is affected by the quantity of alcohol, not the type.
Your tolerance doesn’t affect your BAC, just how you feel. BAC is measured by the quantity of alcohol in your blood. Even if you don’t feel drunk, you may be over the legal limit.

, Using breathalyzers and calculating your BAC by keeping track of alcohol consumption over time, your weight, and reference charts are great ways to stay responsible and get an estimate. However, relying on only one method to calculate BAC, or using any of the methods as a concrete calculation is not advised. Learn to judge your level of sobriety by how you feel, but don’t rely on it. Signs of impairment vary with the individual. Even at a BAC level of 0.02%, you may experience some loss in judgment, an altered mood, and a decline in your ability to multitask.
If you think you might be too intoxicated to drive, then play it safe and don’t.
Keep a BAC chart on your smartphone or in your wallet to use as a reference.

, Learn to pace your drinks and drink wisely; focus most on enjoying your time among friends. That way you can keep yourself, and anyone around you safe and sound.


Alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. A glass of water or club soda and lime won’t sober you up faster, but will help to keep you BAC at a manageable level.
Eat before you drink. Don’t drink on an empty stomach as this will not only allow alcohol to be absorbed faster but can make you sick.
Stay hydrated. Alcohol dehydrates your body and can cause you to feel hungover the next day.

, If you’re going somewhere to drink make sure that you plan a safe way to get home. The more intoxicated you are the more likely you are to make bad decisions.


Assign a designated driver or ask a friend to pick you up at a certain time or when you call.
Use a taxi, Uber, or Lyft. If you know that you’ll be too intoxicated to drive, plan to take a cab home and budget for it.
Make arrangements to stay at a friend’s place.
Leave your car keys at home or with someone you trust.

, If you do drive somewhere and drink too much, or find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, it’s good to have a backup plan.


Have a friend or family member you know you can call to pick you up.
Keep extra cash on you in a place separate from the rest of your money. This extra cash can be used to get you a cab if you need. By separating it, you prevent yourself from spending it.

, A DUI or accident is a horrible, expensive experience. Learn to enjoy drinking less while socializing more.


A BAC chart, calculator, or breathalyzer are all good tools to help you stay safe when drinking. However, it’s impossible to calculate your absolute BAC without a blood test. If you feel like you’re in danger of over drinking or unable to drive, don’t.
Learn to read your own stages of inebriation, and learn your limits. It’s not always easy to cut yourself off. Ask your friends to look out for you, stay hydrated, and take it slow.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat to reduce nausea.,
Eat to move toxicity out of your system.,
Eat to restore blood sugar.,
Boost your metabolism with yoga and coconut water.,
Take an NSAID pain reliever for headaches.,
Sleep it off.",How to Cure a Hangover Fast1," Get the water flowing as soon as you wake up. This may help push toxins leftover from excess alcohol out of your system, but the main goal of hydration after a night of drinking is to save you from getting dehydrated. While experts don’t know for sure what causes hangovers, most people agree it has a lot to do with not having enough fluids in your body.Doctors recommend that you drink eight 8 oz glasses of water a day. You may have to drink more than this in order to get your fluids back in balance. One trick is that sports drinks are a good source of electrolytes and fluids and these drinks may help you stay hydrated.;
, Nausea plays a big role in morning-after misery. There are things you can eat to quell your upset stomach. Brew some ginger tea—which calms down your stomach—while you prepare some other helpful dishes.Bananas, tomatoes, and artichokes are all on the list for calming down feelings of nausea.


Bananas prompt your stomach to produce more mucus, thickening the stomach’s mucus barrier against gastric acids that cause heartburn and an upset feeling. If you are having heartburn after drinking try a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker to alleviate the discomfort with the acid. Take this with water or a sports drink.Tomatoes provide simple sugars which keep you from losing blood sugar while your liver works to metabolize the alcohol.Artichokes have been shown to relieve nausea and lower bloating.A virgin Bloody Mary (called a Virgin Mary), for example, contains tomato juice, lime juice, salt, and hot sauce, a combination that revs your metabolism, restores blood sugars and electrolytes, and provides Vitamin C., A food that assists your liver in metabolizing toxicity is asparagus, which is full of amino acids and needed minerals. It works by actually reducing the toxicity of cells in the liver. It is also a diuretic, which means it stimulates the flow of urine, quickly washing away toxins as your liver cleanses your body., Another way to use food to reduce symptoms of a hangover is to eat light, easy-to-digest foods like crackers, and lean protein/low fat things like egg whites or plain Greek yogurt. Food is important for restoring blood sugars so that your body’s processes can return to normal.Try a sports drink like Gatorade or Powerade to help restore blood sugar and replace electrolytes and fluid levels.

, Revving your metabolism helps your body to burn leftover toxins from alcohol more quickly. Light exercise like yoga is enough to increase circulation and heart rate without making you sweat (which further dehydrates you). Coconut water is low in sugar and restores electrolytes., Headaches are a common part of hangovers. To minimize your headache, it is permissible to take over-the-counter headache medications like ibuprofen and aspirin—otherwise known as NSAIDs. You can also practice holistic remedies to calm a pounding head.Avoid acetaminophen (most commonly found in Tylenol) as this drug combined with alcohol can cause liver damage.
At-home remedies for headaches include herbal tea (like ginger root and butterbur) and massage.

, There’s no proof that going back to sleep when you wake up with a hangover makes it go away, but sleep is important for our nervous systems to function properly. Lack of sleep can lead to memory and concentration loss.Sleeping in can help your body relax and heal itself, possibly leading to reduction in hangover symptoms. If you choose to sleep if off make sure you get up and get some fluid in you and take some medication like NSIAD’S for pain relief and headache.

Turn on some tunes.,
Channel your inner child.,
Scare yourself silly.,
Stay up too late.,
Drink coffee.",How to Feel Drunk Without Drinking2," Most people have experienced an emotional reaction to a piece of music. It might be hearing a favorite song from high school, your wedding dance song, or an old family favorite that provokes a very real mental and physical reaction in people. Certain pieces of music can transport an individual to a different time and place. In other words, music can temporarily remove us from reality. Music can create euphoric reactions in individuals. And like everything relating to music, it's all about your personal tastes., Want to feel dizzy and disoriented? Kids are the experts! Think back to your younger years. Remember the exhilarating feeling you got from spinning around and around in circles until you fell down? Why not try it again! You could also turn somersaults, or grab your friends and head to the local park or playground. Find a hill to roll down, or go as high as you can on the swings.

, Fear can elicit many of the same feelings that being drunk can cause. One of the common denominators is feeling a loss of control. When done responsibly, this feeling of being out of control can cause a rush of adrenaline--and excitement. Also, after your mind logically realizes that you are not actually in any danger, a sense of giddiness and light-heartedness can set in. Which makes the fear worth it!There are lots of ways to scare yourself. Grab a creepy book, or watch a thriller on tv. Better yet, grab your friends and have a camp out in the backyard. Have a competition to see who can cause the most shrieking with the scariest ghost story.

, Feeling groggy is one of the most common reactions to drinking alcohol. You can try to mimic that by making yourself as tired as possible. Push yourself to stay up later than normal, and read or watch television until you are forcing yourself to keep your eyes open. This will feel like you've had too much to drink. It's not a good idea to try this one when you have an important day at school or work coming up.

, Or a lot of any kind of caffeine. Too much caffeine in any form is going to produce the jitters, and might give you the anxious feeling that you could get while drunk. Caffeine can also make you much more talkative and more willing to be social. Just be careful, too much caffeine is not good for your health--mental or physical."
"
Change your mood.,
Alter your behavior.,
Feel physically different.,
Enjoy new sensations.",How to Feel Drunk Without Drinking3," Feeling drunk can definitely affect your mood. Some of these changes are positive, and some you would probably rather avoid. Alcohol causes chemical reactions in the brain, and these reactions can also be caused by other activities. That is why you might be able to feel the effects of drinking without ever taking a sip. Some changes in your mood might include an increased feeling of happiness, giddiness, or excitement. Alternatively, your mood might grow darker, and you could experience feelings of loneliness or anxiety., The feeling of being drunk can cause people to start acting differently. When the chemicals in your brain are having new reactions, it is reasonable to expect some changes in your behavior. For example, when you feel drunk you might become more social and talkative. These side effects are likely because you feel a little more relaxed and confident. In other cases, you might become withdrawn and even a little angry., When you feel like you've been drinking, you will likely notice some changes in how you physically feel. You might start feeling sleepy or groggy, as if you really want to fall asleep. Dizziness is something else that people regularly experience while they're drunk. Your vision could blur, and you could find yourself having some trouble balancing when you try to walk. People usually also have much slower physical reactions when they're feeling drunk., People like to feel a buzz because it feels new and interesting. It can feel exciting, the same as trying any new experience. Experimenting with these new feelings and effects can be really fun, as long as you are careful. Just make sure to know your limits and be aware of your surroundings when you're trying to capture a buzz.

Learn what neat means.,
Drink brandy neat when you have a good quality aged brandy.,
Get a brandy snifter.,
Serve immediately.,
Warm up the glass in your hand.,
Smell the brandy while holding the glass at chest height.,
Bring the glass to your chin and smell through your nose again.,
Raise the snifter to directly under your nose and smell through both your mouth and nose.,
Take a very small sip.,
Take more sips, starting small and working your way up to bigger sips.,
Start young and move older if you are tasting multiple brandies.,
Try not to look at the type and cost of the brandy if you are tasting a number of brandies.",How to Drink Brandy2," Drinking brandy “neat” means that you are drinking it by itself with no ice or mixer. You taste only the brandy and nothing else, allowing you to fully experience the flavor.


Ice will melt and water down the brandy, ruining the flavor.

, The best brandies should be savored on their own. This will help you enjoy the flavor fully, heightening your experience and allowing you to truly get a taste of the best brandy experience., A brandy snifter or brandy balloon is a short glass with a wide base whose sides taper in at the top. It will have a short stem and come in many sizes, although no more than 2 ounces (60 ml) will usually be served at a time. These glasses are perfect for drinking brandy because they concentrate the subtle aromas at the top of the glass when nosing or smelling them.


A thoroughly clean snifter that has been air-dried prevents other tastes from interfering with that of the brandy.

, Brandies do not need to breathe like wine does. If you let it sit for too long then some of the volatile alcohols will evaporate. This will lose some of the character of the brandy.

, Many connoisseurs prefer to warm up the brandy because gentle heat enhances the flavor and aroma. The best way to do this is to simply hold the glass in your hand to gently warm it up. The wide base of the glass makes it easy to warm in your hand.


You also can warm the glass by pouring warm water in it and then pouring out before filling with your brandy.
Another way to warm the brandy is to carefully heat the glass over an open flame.
Be careful not to overheat! Overheating can cause the alcohol to evaporate and ruin the bouquet and flavor.
Do not swill the glass because you can lose some of the subtle aromas in the brandy.

, Nosing (smelling through your nose) the brandy at this distance will allow you to smell the floral notes and introduces the delicate aromas to your nose. This prevents your senses from being overwhelmed when tasting., Raise the snifter to chin height and take a deep breath through your nose. Nosing at this height will let you smell the dried fruit aromas in the brandy.

, When you bring the snifter up to your nose you can smell the spice aromas in the brandy. This nosing will be much more complex than the previous two.

, Your first sip should simply wet your lips so that it does not overpower you. The first sip should be the smallest possible sip and will bring the flavor into your mouth. If you become overpowered it may put you off tasting the brandy again.

, These are meant to acclimatize your mouth to the flavor. Only once your taste buds are acclimatized can you fully appreciate the taste of the brandy.


Drinking brandy is as much about the aroma as it is about the taste so make sure you continue to appreciate the aroma as you sip the brandy.

, If you are tasting a number of brandies then you should start with the youngest first. Always leave a small amount of each to come back to later- you will be surprised how much the first taste can change after your nose and palate have warmed up to the brandies.

, Both type and price can influence the way you taste a brandy so it is best to cover this information when tasting to really discover the flavors that you like. This can help you learn more about yourself as well.


You can mark the glasses on the bottom somehow before pouring them. Then mix the glasses up before drinking so that you do not know which is which.

Drink brandy in mixed drinks when you have a younger and less expensive brandy.,
Consider trying a Sidecar cocktail.,
Consider trying a Metropolitan.,
Consider trying a Gentleman’s Hot Toddy.,
Consider trying a Pisco Sour.,
Consider trying the Jack Rose.,
Consider trying the Prescription Julep.",How to Drink Brandy3," For example, if you have a VS brandy or another unnamed brandy then you can mix these into cocktails. Brandy is part of the wine family so it does not always work well with certain sodas and tonics but there are many good-tasting mixed drinks.


Although Cognac is an aged, more expensive brandy, it is commonly used in mixed drinks as well.

, The Sidecar is a classic cocktail that the Ritz Carlton in Paris, France claims to have invented in the early 1900s. You will need 1.5 ounces (45 ml) Cognac, 1 ounce (30 ml) Cointreau or triple sec, .5 ounce (15 ml) fresh lemon juice, a lemon twist for garnish and an optionally sugar for rimming.


Rim a chilled martini glass with sugar. A martini glass is shaped like an upside down triangle on a long stem. Chill the glass in the freezer and then dip the top rim in a plate of sugar to rim it.
Pour the ingredients (except the lemon twist) into a cocktail shaker with a few ice cubes and shake vigorously.
Strain to remove the ice cubes and pour into the glass.
Garnish with the lemon twist. You can make the lemon twist by peeling off a thin strip of the rind around the lemon in one full circle.
You can alter the ratio of Cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice a little bit to find the perfect flavor for you.

, A Metropolitan is a classic cocktail whose first recipe is dated 1900. You will need 1.5 (45 ml) ounces brandy, 1 ounce (30 ml) sweet vermouth, .5 tsp simple syrup and 2 dashes Angostura bitters.


Make a simple syrup by combining 1 cup water with 1 cup superfine sugar in a jar. Seal the jar and shake until the sugar is completely dissolved. Keep the jar in the refrigerator.
Pour all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice cubes and shake well.
Strain into a chilled martini glass. A martini glass has a long stem with a cup shaped like an upside-down triangle.

, A Hot Toddy is a classic hot drink that has often been historically used as medicine. It can be made with a variety of spirits including brandy and apple brandy. You will require 1 ounce (30 ml) brandy or apple brandy, 1 Tbsp. honey, ¼ lemon, 1 cup water, a pinch of cloves, a pinch of nutmeg and 2 cinnamon sticks.


Coat the bottom of a mug or Irish coffee glass with honey and then add the brandy or apple brandy and the juice of the ¼ lemon.
Boil the water in a kettle or pot and pour into the glass.
Stir the mix and add the cloves and cinnamon sticks.
Let it sit for 5 minutes and then add nutmeg and enjoy!
You can alter the ratios of brandy to water. If you are using apple brandy, you may choose to increase the amount of the apple brandy for extra flavor.

, The Pisco Sour is the most popular way of consuming pisco and is the signature drink of Peru and also very popular in Chile. You will need 3 ounces (95 ml) pisco, 1 ounce (30 ml) fresh squeezed lime juice, ¾ ounce (22 ml) simple syrup, 1 fresh egg white and 1 dash Angostura or Amargo (if you can find it) bitters.


Make a simple syrup by combining 1 cup water with 1 cup superfine sugar in a jar. Seal the jar and shake until the sugar is completely dissolved. Keep the jar in the refrigerator.
Combine the pisco, lime, simple syrup and egg white in a cocktail shaker without ice and shake hard until the egg white is foamy, about 10 seconds.
Add ice and then shake very hard until it is well-chilled, again about 10 seconds.
Strain the ice out and pour in a chilled pisco sour glass. A pisco sour glass is relatively small and shaped a bit like a normal shot glass, except the base is thinner and the edges spread out a bit more at the top.
Add the dash of bitters on top of the egg white foam.

, The Jack Rose is a classic cocktail that was very popular in the 1920s that uses applejack, the American type of apple brandy. You will need 2 ounces (60 ml) applejack, 1 ounce (30 ml) lime juice and .5 ounce (15 ml) grenadine. True American applejack is hard to find but if you can get hold of it, try this cocktail.


Pour the ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake well.
Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. This glass will have a long stem with a cup that is shaped like an upside down triangle.

, This drink first appeared in print in 1857 and combines cognac and rye whiskey for a soothing refresher perfect for summer. You will need 1.5 ounces (45 ml) VSOP cognac or another good brandy, .5 ounce (15 ml) rye whiskey, 2 tsp sugar dissolved in .5 ounce (15 ml) water and 2 sprigs fresh mint.


Place the sugar and water in a tall glass or julep cup (traditional silver cup) and mix until sugar dissolves.
Add mint leaves into the glass and gently press to release the flavorful oil. Do not smash up the mint or else you will release bitterness from the leaves.
Add the brandy and rye whiskey to the glass and stir to combine.
Fill the glass with crushed ice and stir with a long spoon until the glass begins to get frost on the sides.
Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint and serve with a straw.

Avoid a greasy breakfast.,
Stay away from more alcohol.,
Be cautious about Alka-Seltzer.,
Avoid acetaminophen and hangover pills.,
Stay away from coffee.,
Avoid a sauna or steam room.",How to Cure a Hangover Fast2," College drinkers like to say that a heavy, fat-filled breakfast will soak up unwanted toxins and add needed sugars into your depleted system. While pretty much any food does deliver sugar to the bloodstream, doctors say that heavy food will only contribute to heartburn and stomach upset, something you are working to get away from with a hangover.Instead, look for low-fat foods to restore blood sugar, like crackers and cereal.

, The famous “hair of the dog” treatment for hangovers is actually a very bad idea. This solution swears that drinking more alcohol the next morning will keep you from feeling sick. While this does continue your alcoholic buzz, it actually makes the headache when you do stop drinking even worse., Many people swear by the fizzy antacid known as Alka-Seltzer, but ultimately this remedy may irritate your stomach more than it relieves nausea symptoms. The active ingredient sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, neutralizes stomach acid, yes, but other ingredients like citric acid can irritate your stomach at the same time., Keep in mind that some pills promising to help with headaches and hangovers do more damage than good. Tylenol (made of acetaminophen) can cause liver damage when paired with alcohol.Most pills on the market claiming to relieve hangovers have been proven to be completely ineffective, so save your money., Although many people like the idea of turning to coffee for a quick pick-me-up when they are feeling groggy from a hangover, the truth is that coffee can contribute to dehydration and cause headaches. It can also contribute to stomach problems., Since alcohol metabolizes in your system in about an hour, purposefully inducing sweat the next day does nothing but make you more dehydrated. Going to a sauna can actually be dangerous, especially if you haven’t had much water to drink since you woke up with the hangover.


Even though sweat does wash toxins out of your body, by the time you get to a sauna, few toxins from alcohol exist in your blood, making a sauna an ineffective solution for hangovers.

Eat a full meal before going out.,
Take a nap before drinking.,
Alternate drinks with water.,
Drink alcohol only once per hour.,
Drink a lot of water after you get home.",How to Cure a Hangover Fast3," Since the fastest way to recover from a hangover is to avoid one in the first place, start by eating well before you start drinking. This will reduce the impact that the alcohol has on your body because the food that is digesting will slow the alcohol’s absorption. Good choices of food to eat before hand include bread, milk, cheese, and meat. These will be digested slowly and are high in protein., Since most people get a poor night’s sleep after drinking too much, getting ahead of this and making sure you feel refreshed before drinking will reduce the impact that a bad night’s sleep will have on your body. If you know that you are going out this weekend you may want to sleep more during the week to stay rested., In an effort to keep your body’s hydration on par with the dehydration effects of alcohol, order a glass of water with every beverage. Drinking a water after each beer, for example, will prevent you from being dehydrated, potentially reducing the symptoms of a hangover the next day., It typically takes your body 60 to 75 minutes to metabolize an alcoholic beverage, so allowing your body to recover from one before consuming the next is a good way to prevent a hangover. Slow drinking also prevents your blood alcohol from rising too quickly., To prevent any ill effects of dehydration, finish your night with a few extra glasses of water. To remind yourself to do this (since, if you are drunk, you probably won’t be thinking about water), set out a glass of water on the kitchen counter or next to your bed. Some people might even set out their NSAID too.


If you think you’ll be spending the night somewhere else, set a reminder alarm on your phone.

Consider brewing a blackberry wheat beer.,
Introduce blackberries into a porter or stout recipe.,
Avoid adding berries to very clear beers.",How to Make Blackberry Beer1," Easily the most popular beer style to brew with berries is hefeweizen. The mild, yeasty flavor of this wheat-based beer make it the ideal backdrop for the bright, sweet flavor of blackberries. Other wheat styles, such as Belgian whites, also work well.;
, Blackberries also work well in rich, roasted beer styles like porter and stout. The smoky, chocolate flavors of these beers pair effortlessly with fresh berries, just as you might combine these flavors in a dessert.

, Note that adding fruit to a beer will impair its visual clarity, which is another reason why thick, cloudy hefeweizens and stouts make good pairings. Adding blackberries to a crystal clear pilsner, for example, will mar its appearance.

Wash your apples.,
Select a mix of sweet, ripe, and crisp articles for the best cider.,
Cut and core your apples while you set a large pot of water to boil.,
Cook your apples in boiling water until the apples are cooked through.,
Transfer your apples in batches to a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth.,
Strain the liquid from the pulp.,
Save the rest of the pulp in order to make applesauce.,
On low heat, heat the separated liquid in a pot, add the lime, and mix in spices as desired.,
Serve the cider hot, chill it and serve cold, or can it and store for later.

",How to Make Apple Cider or Apple Juice," Be sure to wash your apples, especially if you are using non-organic apples, in order to remove all dirt and pesticides from the fruit you'll be extruding into a delicious juice.;
, If you select your apples right, you may not even need to add any sugar to your cider, as the natural sugar content in the apples will suffice. If you're planning on making a large amount of cider, select a bushel of apples, which is relatively cheap and produces approximately 15 to 20 ounces of juice.Select from among the following kinds of apples for the best results:


Red Delicious
Gala
Rome
Fuji
Honeycrisp
Pink Lady

, The process of coring your apples and cutting them into smaller pieces can be made much easier by using an apple segmenter. These segmenters are circular, with handles at the sides, and have blades that bisect the circle at even intervals. Simply fit the segmenter over the middle of the apple, press down, and your apple will be cored and cut into even pieces.


Note that you don't need to peel the apple in addition to coring. Apple cider calls for apples with the skins intact, which saves you a lot of grunt work.

, Depending on the size of your pot and the amount of apples, this could take anywhere from 10 minutes to less.

, In order for the food processor or blender to fully break up the apples, you may need to add a small amount of the water left over from boiling. Be careful, however, not to use too much, as this will dilute the final product.


If you have a juicer, you may find profitable use for it here instead of using a food processor or blender. The juicer will remove a lot of the pulpy sediment, obviating much of the need to strain. If you do use a juicer, you don't need to strain the liquid, which is covered in the next step.







, There are a number of ways to do this, each involving different amounts of time and effort. Experiment with what works best for you, given time constraints, equipment, and desired levels of involvement.

Line a sieve or colander with cheesecloth or an old t-shirt and let gravity separate the juice from the pulp. (Use a bowl or other receptacle to catch the liquid.)






Similarly, use a paper coffee filter in a sieve for even clearer liquid.






Refrigerate the juice for 48 hours and allow the liquid and pulp to separate. Then, decant the liquid from the pulp by slowly pouring the liquid on the top into a separate container.







, Waste not, want not. Applesauce is easy when you've already done half the work.

, Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and vanilla bean all work in combination with each other; decide which spices you'd like to use — without going overboard — and add them to the cider in small batches, tasting frequently.


At this point, see if the cider needs any additional sugar in order to reach your desired sweetness. If it does, add sugar as needed.

Realize that social drinking can weaken your resolve.,
Understand that it can be difficult to accept that your drinking has become out out control.,
If you take nothing else from this writing, remember this quote.,
Create diversions.,
Work more.,
Think about how you'll feel in the morning.,
Think about your friends and family, or even celebrities if you have to, that don't have drinking problems.,
Focus on your children.,
Finally, let's get back to where we started.",How to Control Drinking," For many people, social drinking can lead to excessive drinking, and at some point, we face the realization that our quality of life has sunk to a very low point. However, we still want to be able to have drinks at a wedding, a super bowl party, a Halloween party, etc.;
, We don't view ourselves as alcoholics, and we don't have any interest in the mind washing that treatment programs such as AA offer. The first, and most important thing, is getting our heads into a place to accept our weakness. Once we accept that we want to make a change - now it's time to move forward!

, ""The next drink will always come."" There will always be an opportunity to relax with a cold beer. Knowing this is hugely important. We are not looking to never have a drink again in our lives - we simply want to cut down our drinking drastically. If we can keep in mind that there will be an opportunity to indulge again, it makes things so much easier.


As an example, you're at work on a random Tuesday afternoon. You start thinking about hitting the scotch when you go home. However, what is the purpose for drinking on this Tuesday evening? Isn't it possible that you could be a good dad, a good husband, a good friend, etc. who stays sober on this evening? Do you really need to drink? How about skipping this Tuesday and going to the bar on Wednesday to watch a ball game? Even better, how 'bout taking two days off and going on Thursday to watch that game? Remember - the next drink will always come, so just put if off for a couple of days, it will taste that much better.

, Diversions are the most important thing you can do to cut back on drinking. If you are cognizant that you are too weak to sit at home and not hit the bottle, find something else to do to distract you.


Go see a movie, go shopping, take a walk, go to the gym, etc. We need to stay active to avoid the pratfall of pouring the first drink. And know this, the first drink will always lead to many more on that given night.
Keep telling yourself, I don't need a drink tonight, because on ""this day"", however far down the road it may be, I'm going to have a few, and they will be delicious.

, Simple as it may sound, what better way to ween yourself off the bottle? Most of us who drink too much are functional alcoholics. We don't drink when we work. So isn't it ridiculously simple? Get a part time job on the side. Not only will you earn extra money to help yourself or your family, you've found the best distraction that you can possibly have to keep yourself off the sauce.

, For those of us who drink too much, our normal is being hung over. We feel like crap, and wait until we can drink again so we'll feel better. And on those rare days when we didn't drink the previous night, we feel great. Invigorated. Before you toss down that first beer, remember the last time you woke up with no booze in your system. You felt really good. Think of that as your high.

, Picture how their quality of life is. Pick up a magazine and read about a family who spent their day at an amusement park. Call your brother or sister and have them tell you about the innocuous things their family did today that didn't involve booze. Realize that everything doesn't have to be centered around alcohol.

, If you don't have children, focus on what your imaginary children would think about you in your present state. We have an obligation as parents to be the best mentors and influences as we can be. Are we, as heavy drinkers, doing our jobs? Were our parents heavy drinkers? For some of us, no, so why are we? For others, yes, so do we want to be the embarrassment our parents were? Embarrassment. That's the key word. Remember that moment when our child first came into the world? We would do anything for that kid. Think about how our excessive drinking might embarrass our child or children at some point? Or even worse - think about how our excessive drinking might make us inattentive parents and lead to an injury or worse for our child or children.

, We have a choice to make, as excessive drinkers. Do we want to go the point of no return, where we have to go into rehab, or do we want to control our indulgences and become a better person? If you're reading this, I expect you are thinking about control. We all have the opportunity to get our lives back together, while still keeping our dignity. We don't have to walk around proclaiming ""I'm an alcoholic and I'm sixty days sober"". We all have the potential to cut back on our drinking, while still not becoming a teetotaler. These tips make it easy, because I truly believe that thought of never having a drink again is what keeps most alcoholics from seeking help. With my program, this isn't part of the equation. It's a simple, gradual move from the addiction of the bottle, to the enjoyment of the bottle.

Make sure you are sober enough to drive.,
Calculate your BAC.,
Check your mirrors and lights.,
Make note of the speed limit.,
Stay alert as you drive.,
Avoid changing up driving habits.,
Forget about 'tricking' the test.,
Be respectful.,
Feel confident about your sobriety.,
Know what to expect.,
Be ready for alternative testing methods.,
Respect the breathalyzer.",How to Beat a Field Sobriety Test," You should never drive if you feel intoxicated, even if you know you are under 0.08 blood alcohol content. If you have been sitting for a while, get out of your seat and move around. You often feel more sober while sitting down. You may realize when you stand that your drink was a little stronger than you thought.;
, Even if you feel completely sober, your BAC may disagree. In general, it takes about somewhere between 3 and 5 drinks to put most people past the legal limit of 0.08. However, due to an array of variables – such as chemical changes in your body, and how well hydrated and nourished you are – you may not be in the clear with even 1 drink. Don’t make the mistake of trusting yourself to have the low BAC you expect and find out the hard way that you don’t. How much gets you to 0.08?


People 120 pounds and less can generally have 2 drinks before they hit 0.08
People 120-160 pounds can generally have 3 drinks
People 160-200 pounds can generally have 4 drinks
People 200-240 pounds can generally have 5 drinks, Since you don’t want to give the police a reason to pull you over, make sure to go over those safety procedures that you should always be performing. Turn on your car and lights, and walk around the car to make sure everything looks and sounds right. Make sure your mirrors are at a good angle for you to see out of. If you need to do anything, such as adjust the seat, do it now so you aren’t trying to do it while you drive.

, This is another tip that you should always be doing. Don’t go more than a couple miles per hour over or under the speed limit. Watch out for speed limit changes. They usually have a reflective neon stripe above on the sign, but not always. Don’t let yourself become so distracted by looking for speed limit signs that you become unsafe!

, Don’t let yourself zone out while you drive. Cars are heavy, dangerous machines. Keep the music turned down and open the window to let rushing air keep you alert. As always, keep your cell phone in your bag or the back seat for the duration of your drive.

, Doing something out of the ordinary will take your mind off driving and make you seem more nervous. For example, some would advise you to chew gum to cover up the scent of alcohol. Police have heard this advice too – so it may instead be an indicator to them that you are covering something up. Besides, if you have only had 1 drink, your breath won’t reek of booze the same as someone’s after a half bottle of whiskey. Experienced police officers know the difference.

, There are many myths about how you can fool a breathalyzer. Pennies, batteries, and onions won't change the reading, so don't bother. They will also indicate that you have something to hide. Don't drive if you are even concerned about your BAC and you will have nothing to worry about.

, Police officers aren’t five-armed monsters. They will respond well to someone who is respectful and friendly. Answer their questions simply with as few words as possible. Don’t take it too far by trying to strike up a casual conversation with them. The more cooperative and concise you are, the quicker you can get back on your way.

, Don’t try to prepare for SFSTs. They are based on your body’s natural responses to certain stimuli. Besides, if you are not drunk, you have nothing to worry about. Research has shown that police officers are correct in assessing drunkenness in SFSTs 91% of the time.

, There is nothing wrong about the public knowing what is legally prescribed to police to assess drunkenness. There are 3 standard tests performed by most police officers, and you may decline to take these tests. However, the consequences for declining are unpleasant, depending on the state. The officer may take your driver’s license on the spot, and you could lose it for months.If you are sober, you have nothing to worry about.


Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) involves the police officer assessing your eyes for signs of drunkenness. When you are drunk, your eyes jerk and twitch when moving from side to side. Police officers are also looking to see if you have trouble following an object moving in front of you. They may use a pen as the prop for this, or just their finger.Walk-and-Turn (WAT) is the well-known test in which the driver walks 9 steps heel to toe, turns, and comes back in the same fashion. Make sure you follow all the directions. Don’t begin until instructed to. Losing balance is another indicator of drunkenness. Failing in 2 of these areas indicates intoxication.
One-Leg Stand (OLS) is similar to WAT. It is performed outside the car and has a set of criteria which indicate whether a person is drunk. They are looking to see that you are following their directions. Losing balance or doing anything to catch your balance are signs of intoxication. Since you are required to count the 30 seconds out loud, verbal cues are also a sign. Like WAT, failing 2 of these indicates intoxication.

, A police officer may choose another method for determining your level of intoxication. This might be asking you to recite the alphabet backwards, counting out loud, or an alternate dexterity test. They will also be assessing your voice for signs of intoxication like slurring.

, Though they are not foolproof, they are the final say in a field sobriety test. If you feel the reading is wrong, live to fight another day. Contact a lawyer to appeal the DWI after the ordeal is over. Also keep in mind that you can be given a DWI in spite of a BAC under 0.08 if you display other signs of intoxication.

Determine when to add the blackberries.,
Purchase blackberry puree or juice for use in your beer.,
Add whole, fresh blackberries to your beer.,
Steep dried berries in the secondary fermenter.,
Add blackberry extract at bottling.",How to Make Blackberry Beer2," In most cases, you'll want to add the berries to your beer during secondary fermentation. If you add the fruit much later, the sugars will not undergo much fermentation. If you add the fruit any earlier, you run the risk of infecting the beer with the bacteria that are inevitably present on the berries.

, Perhaps the most common and straightforward way to add berries to a beer is by pouring fruit puree or juice directly into the secondary fermenter. This will give you a full blackberry flavor, but will also lend your beer a bluish purple color.

, If you have access to good quality fresh berries, you can add them to the secondary fermenter as well. Before adding them, freeze and thaw them to break up the berries' cells and release their juices. Steeping the berries in a cheesecloth bag will prevent you from having to filter skins and seeds out of your beer later.

, If you use dried berries, you can impart the full flavor of the fruit without turning the beer purple. You can dry the fruit yourself using a food dehydrator or purchase the dried fruit from the supermarket.

, If you want to bypass the trouble of steeping fruit in your secondary fermenter, you can purchase a small bottle of blackberry extract instead. This liquid can be added directly to your bottling bucket. Note that the flavor of fruit extracts is often thinner than the flavor from whole or pureed fruit.

Purchase the appropriate size keg cozy for your keg.,
Zip the keg cozy onto the beer keg.,
Consume the beer as quickly as possible.",How to Insulate a Beer Keg1," The most straightforward and often most effective way to insulate a keg is by buying a specialized ""keg cozy."" These insulated jackets are usually made from neoprene and are similar to smaller can cozies designed to insulate aluminum cans from the warmth of your hand.


Keg cozies can be purchased from some home brewing supply stores and from specialty manufacturers. Searching the Internet for suppliers is the best way to locate and purchase a keg cozy.
Make sure that you buy the right size for your keg. Keg sizes are not standardized, but common sizes include the ""half barrel"" with a volume of 15.5 gallons (59 L) and the ""quarter barrel"" (pony keg) with a 7.75 gallon (29 L) capacity.;
, After thoroughly chilling the keg using either a refrigerator or an ice bath, you can position the insulating keg cozy around it. Usually this is done by wrapping the cozy around the sides of the keg and zipping it up to keep it in place.

, Keg cozies will only keep the beer chilled to the appropriate serving temperature for about 4 - 6 hours. For this reason, you should plan to serve the beer from your keg as soon after insulating it and removing it from a chilled setting as possible.

Find physical challenges.,
Make alcohol free cocktails.,
Start a new hobby.,
See more movies.,
Do errands you've been putting off.",How to Do Dry January1," Many people give up alcohol in January to shed some weight and improve their overall health. If this is part of your dry January goal, give yourself some physical challenges. Having physical goals will distract you from drinking and the endorphins you gain from exercise can help replace the high you feel from alcohol.Set a goal beyond your current fitness abilities. For example, if you can run about 10 minutes without getting winded, try increasing your running time to 15 minutes, then 20 minutes, and so on.
If you're dedicated to a fitness goal, your energy will go towards that. This will make it easier to avoid thinking about alcohol. You will also have less desire to drink, as you likely won't want to sabotage your fitness goals by overindulging in booze.;
, Many people enjoy the taste of a particular type of alcohol or cocktail. You do not have to go back to alcoholic beverages to satisfy cravings. Look in to making your own alcoholic cocktails or ordering alcohol free beverages at bars.You can mix things like juice, bitters, and seltzer water to create imitations of drinks like Old Fashions and Gin and Tonics. Think about what flavors you crave and try to replicate them. For example, if you love mimosas for brunch, try mixing flavored seltzer water with orange juice to satisfy the craving.
You can purchase alcohol free wine and beer at the grocery store.
If you're going out to a bar for a social event, plan your drinks in advance. Many bars have menus online that list alcohol-free drinks or cocktails. Find something you can treat yourself to that does not contain booze., Many people lean on alcohol for entertainment. If you often have a few drinks to pass the time, find other ways to entertain yourself.Join a class. You can try a cooking class, improv class, painting class, or another class that interests you. The money you'll save on alcohol can be put towards educating yourself.
Take up a hobby you've neglected. If you used to sew but don't anymore, get back into that.

, Many people enjoy seeing all the Oscar nominations before February. Try to focus your attention towards seeing plenty of movies in January. Instead of gong out to the bars with friends, plan a movie night.Keep in mind, some theaters do serve alcohol on certain nights of the week. Try to avoid these kinds of theaters to stay on track with your goals.

, Staying busy can keep you away from alcohol. Many people see January as a time to reorganize and change their lifestyle. If there are any projects or errands you've been putting off, indulge in these instead of drinking.Think about anything you've been meaning to do but haven't. Maybe there's a drawer in your bedroom that needs reorganizing. Maybe you've been meaning to finally figure out a budget to pay off your credit card.
Use January as an opportunity to sit down and figure out these things instead of indulging in alcohol.

Find somebody to bet against.,
Outline the rules.,
Choose the stakes for the game.,
Get your drinks and sit down.,
Start drinking.,
Cover your opponent's second shot with the empty beer glass.,
Savor your second drink and collect your winnings.",How to Drink Two Beers Before Somebody Drinks Two Shots," The most important thing you'll need for this trick is a competitor who is a good sport. This can potentially be anyone in the bar, but a friend is probably the best choice. However, if you see strangers who look like they can take a joke, go for it.


Avoid bothering bikers, surly-looking regulars, or anyone else who looks like they won't react well to losing a bet. Use common sense here.;
, If the person you choose is up for a challenge, explain the game to them before you start. This part is important — if you don't explain the rules clearly, you'll probably get some angry complaints and a refusal to pay up. The bet works as follows:


You will order two beers and your opponent will order two shots. To win, you must drink both beers before your opponent can drink the shots. If anyone isn't drinking, feel free to substitute soda or water for alcohol.
Neither person can touch the other's drinks or glasses.
Both people must drink only one drink at a time — no touching the second drink until the first is finished.
Your opponent must give you a one beer head start. In other words, s/he must wait until you finish your first beer before s/he drinks the first shot.

, These are up to you, but small friendly bets tend to be the most fun. For example, you might try playing for a few dollars. Another good idea is to have the loser buy the winner a drink.


Large bets are certainly possible, but these can lead to hurt feelings for the loser.

, Set the two beers in front of you and the shots in front of your opponent. Sit across from each other at a small table so that you can easily reach each other. Get ready to drink!

, Finish your first glass of beer at a reasonable speed. Your opponent will probably have his or her hands on the first shot, ready to throw it back as soon as you finish. This is exactly what you want. Be ready to act fast as soon as you drink the last drop of beer.

, This is it! After you finish your first drink, your opponent will probably go straight for the first shot. Quickly flip your beer glass and put it upside down over the second shot glass.

, Since you aren't allowed to touch each others' glasses, your opponent can't get to the second shot. You win.


Be ready to defend yourself from accusations of cheating! Remind your opponent that you obeyed the rules of the game: you didn't touch anyone's glass except your own and you drank one beer at a time.

Hydrate accordingly.,
Take note of other substances that cause dehydration, and be careful not to combine them with too much alcohol.,
Eat a good meal before drinking alcohol.,
Be aware that booze does not mix with most medication.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid drinking alone.,
Secure a designated driver before anyone in your group has a drink.",How to Drink Alcohol1," Alcohol will dehydrate you, so it is important to make sure you have sufficiently compensated for this. Your system will be less upset by the experience of intoxication if you are well hydrated before you have your first alcoholic beverage of the day.


You should already be in the habit of drinking enough water per day to stay hydrated. If you are not, it is probably best that you start. To be clear, soda, juice and tea do not count as water. They may have water in them, but there is no substitute for pure H2O when the goal is to hydrate. Drink extra water when you know you will be having a lot of alcohol in the near future.
Take physical exertion into account when deciding how much water to drink. If you went to the gym or played sports before you hit the bar, drink a lot of water before you start drinking alcohol. If you plan to drink while you are out dancing, prepare to supplement your boozy drinks with plenty of water.;
, The most common are caffeine, sugar and sodium. Definitely skip dessert if you plan to drink a lot of booze.


It was recently discovered that drinking up to four cups of coffee per day will not dehydrate you as much as originally speculated. You should still be careful with stuff like energy drinks and caffeinated sodas since they tend to combine sugar and caffeine in unnatural amounts. Also note that sweeteners used in diet soda dehydrate your body more than natural sugar. If you must mix your booze with stuff like Red Bull or Cola, make sure you balance it out with a glass of water in between drinks.
Keep in mind that everyone has different reactions to what they put into their bodies. Depending on your weight, height, metabolism and other biological factors, you may need to drink more or less water in order to fend off the symptoms of dehydration.
Be aware of your body’s reactions to dehydration so that you can maintain control of your condition throughout the night. Early symptoms include headaches, dizziness and nausea. Be ready to put down the bottle and start drinking water as soon as you experience any of these things.

, If you drink on an empty stomach, you will reach intoxication much faster and the effects will be more intense.


Be careful when drinking booze while you eat. Some beverages, like wine, go better with food than others. Drinking beer with food might make you feel full faster. It doesn’t hurt to leave at least a full hour between eating dinner and starting to drink.
With a nice hearty buffer of food in your system, less alcohol will be sent directly to the bloodstream and you will be able to enjoy more adult beverages before things get out of hand.
Good foods to eat before a night of drinking are high in protein, fat and carbohydrates. Some examples are burgers, fries, eggs, bread, potatoes, bacon, tacos, etc. Fried foods, while they come with other risk factors involving general health, provide a great foundation for a saucy night on the town.
Consuming alcohol to or past the point of intoxication takes a lot out of your body. You can make it a little easier on yourself if you take a general multivitamin regularly. But beware, because multivitamins require a lot of time and water in order to break down properly. If you plan to drink at night, take your vitamins in the morning with a whole lot of water.

, Studies show that 70% of Americans take prescription meds regularly. If you are one of them, check the information packet you got from the pharmacy to see if there are any alcohol advisory warnings associated with your medicine before drinking.


Check the warning labels on all over-the-counter medicines as well.
Alcohol will decrease the effectiveness of many antibiotics. It may also cause nausea or other side effects when combined with such medicine.
Many antidepressants and anxiety medicines should not, under any circumstances, be mixed with alcohol. It is likely your doctor warned you about this, so you should already know better than to drink while you are on these meds.
Pain killers should never be combined with alcohol. Even over the counter doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen can cause liver damage when mixed with booze. If you took a couple of ibuprofen earlier in the day for cramps or a headache, wait 4-6 hours before having a drink.
Medicines generally require a lot of water in order to be fully absorbed into your system. Some cause dehydration. Even if your meds are okay to mix with alcohol, be sure you have consumed enough water to compensate for the difference before hitting the bottle.

, The symptoms of sleep deprivation do not go very well with the effects of alcohol consumption. Sleep deprivation causes many symptoms that are similar to those of alcohol intoxication. You will almost definitely black out faster than you would otherwise. Take this into account before you get started.


If you didn’t get enough sleep last night, you may start to feel intoxicated after fewer drinks.
Take a disco nap just to be safe. You can do this between getting off work and preparing to go out on the town.

, On top of being risky, it’s not nearly as much fun. When you drink alone, it is easier to overdrink and let things get out of hand. You don’t have the fear of embarrassing yourself. There also won’t be anyone to notice if you pass out from alcohol poisoning.


Be careful when you go out for drinks alone. Decreased inhibitions might make you more likely to seek out the attention of strangers and get into a potentially dangerous situation. Always go out with at least one trusted friend.

, Otherwise, you stand the risk of being stranded, riding home with someone who is drunk, or ending up behind the wheel when you shouldn’t be.


Set aside some cash for cab fare if nobody wants to remain sober, and remind your friends to do the same.
In the event of people drinking at your place, be sure to offer crash space for those who can’t drive home. It is your responsibility as host to make sure nobody in your party is allowed to drive drunk.

Gather some insulating materials for wrapping the beer keg.,
Wrap the chilled keg in the towels and blankets.,
Secure the towels and blankets in place.",How to Insulate a Beer Keg2," If you don't want to spend the money on a specialized keg cozy, you can improvise a similar setup. Begin by gathering a few thick towels, blankets, or other warm, thick fabrics. A roll of bubble wrap also works well when wrapped in several layers. Doubly so when wrapped over an ice jacket.

, Wrap the fabrics you've chosen as generously as desired around the outside of the keg. The more fabric you place around the outside of the keg, the longer the beer will remain chilled.

, If the beer keg will not be moved much during use, you can probably simply tuck the fabrics into each other to keep them in place. Otherwise, you can try taping them in place using packing tape or duct tape. Another option is placing the entire wrapped keg into another container, such as a large trash can.

Be aware of why you drink.,
Identify and avoid triggers.,
Write down your reasons for quitting.,
Seek support from friends.",How to Do Dry January2," Figuring out the reasons you typically drink can help you cope emotionally. You can realize what role alcohol plays in your life, allowing you to find other means to fill that role.First, think about when you tend to drink. Do you drink socially on the weekends? Do you usually have a beer or two after a long work day?
Once you've identified situations where you typically drink, think about why you're drinking. If you, say, usually have a few beers alone Thursdays and Fridays, maybe the stress of work makes you want to unwind. Think about other things you could do to unwind. Maybe you could go for a long walk instead or give yourself a treat, like a bowl or ice cream, instead of reaching for the booze.

, There may be certain situations or moments in which you're more tempted than others. Try to identify times where triggers to drink occur. Once you've identified these triggers, try to alter your schedule to avoid them.For example, maybe your office has happy hour on Fridays. In order to avoid attending, try to schedule something just after work on Friday. If you, say, have a spin class at the gym every Friday, this is a great excuse to skip out on happy hour.

, It can be hard to stay motivated if you lose track of the reasons behind your goals. When you start feeling tempted to drink, get out a pen and paper and write down all the reasons you quit.Think about your mentality when you began dry January. Why were you motivated to quit drinking? Was it to shed holiday weight? Was it to remind yourself how to entertain yourself without alcohol?
Write down as many reasons you can remember in regards to why you quit. You can keep this list on hand and consult it when you need added motivation.

, It can be hard to quit drinking all by yourself. Try asking friends and family members for support. You can let people know not to invite to events where there is a lot of alcohol. You can also ask a friend or family member to do dry January with you. The two of you can keep one another motivated throughout the month.Oftentimes, people feel it's appropriate to encourage others to drink, even after they've politely declined. If you have friends or family members that say things like, ""Come on, just have one,"" politely let them know you don't need this extra pressure.

Do not let a slip up destroy your goals.,
Allow yourself small rewards.,
Avoid bars altogether.,
See dry January as a way to adjust long term habits.",How to Do Dry January3," You may very well slip up during dry January. Many people end up indulging in one or two drinks or end up drinking with friends socially one night. Instead of seeing this slip up as a reason to quit altogether, see it as a small mistake and get back on track the next day.Remember, if you've been drinking a lot during December, limiting your drinking in January is an accomplishment. If you can go all of January drinking only once or twice, this is still something to be proud of. One mistake in dry January does not mean the month is shot.

, Alcohol is often a reward for people. You may have a drink at the end of a long day, for example. Many people combine dry January with other goals for the new year, but do not eliminate all your rewards at once. If you're too strict with yourself, this increases your likelihood of slipping up. Replace alcohol with other rewards instead of eliminating rewards altogether.You may find you save a lot of money not drinking. Use that money to indulge in another way. Order takeout on Friday night instead of spending it at the bar. Buy yourself a new outfit on Sunday afternoon instead of a glass or two of wine.

, While you can order non-alcoholic drinks at bars, it's easy to feel awkward or uncomfortable being the only one not drinking. You also may be under pressure to drink if a friend is, say, buying a round or buying shots. For the most part, try to avoid bars altogether during dry January. Only go to bars if it's an event you cannot avoid, like a good friend's birthday party., Going dry for a single month is unlikely to make long term changes to your health. Many people who go dry for the month of January end up returning to bad habits after the month has passed.Therefore, try to see dry January as a way to address and break bad alcohol habits. See it as a route to long term changes rather than a month-long break.


Think about how you feel not drinking. Pay attention to the benefits, like increased energy, reduced anxiety, extra income, and more free time.
Consider how you can cut back in February. You can plan to, say, only drink once a week or every other week as your New Years goal.

Remember your past experiences.,
Avoid mixing too many kinds of booze together.,
Be wary of sugary mixers and syrups.,
Stick to top shelf brands when possible.,
Pace yourself.,
Know when to stop.",How to Drink Alcohol2," These should be a good indicator of what and how much you can drink without having a bad time.


Most people have at least one kind of booze that doesn’t sit well with them. It is good to know what specific cocktails contain this type of spirit so that you can be more successful in avoiding it.
If this is your first time drinking, start slowly with a couple of beers or glasses of wine so that you can get an idea of how alcohol affects you.
Be extra careful when you are experimenting with something new. It can take years to become truly aware of how all the different types of alcohol affect you.

, Some people react better to different combinations than others, but it is generally less stressful to your system if you decide on one drink and stick to it for the whole night.


Tequila is notoriously incompatible with other kinds of booze.
Crème liqueur such as Irish Crème can mix well in certain cocktails, but is known to cause a curdling effect that may upset your stomach faster than usual. This should never be consumed in excess.
Many people also experience problems when combining beer with liquor. Unfortunately, the best way to know what works and what doesn’t in this case is through your own trial and error.
Some drinks have many different kinds of booze in them. Keep in mind that cocktails like Long Island Iced Teas contain several varieties of booze and may be more intoxicating than other drinks. Be very careful with these types of cocktails, and limit your consumption accordingly.
Always know what you are drinking. Any good bartender should be able to tell you exactly what is in the cocktails they serve. It helps to watch your drinks being prepared so that you can be sure you know what to expect. If you are mixing your own drinks, always stick to a recipe and use a shot glass for measuring.

, Beginners are especially likely to try to mask the alarming taste of alcohol with sweet mixers as a way to get the stuff down their throats. As discussed before, sugar increases the dehydrating effects of alcohol and is often associated with blackouts and hangover symptoms.


Some liquors such as rum, brandy, bourbon, and cordials have a pretty high sugar content on their own. Be especially careful when combining these with sugary mixers.
Keep in mind that when you order a drink like whiskey and cola, there is only one shot of whiskey in your glass. The rest of the drink is mostly high fructose corn syrup. By the time you have consumed enough of these to feel tipsy, you have also consumed two or three times more cola than alcohol.
Also know that most bars do not serve 100% juice, so any fruit juice that is mixed into your cocktails is going to have extra sweeteners.
Popular shots like Sex on the Beach have even less liquor in them than mixed drinks. They are served in shot glasses, but amount to less than a full shot of alcohol since they also contain mixers.
Diet mixers may not contain sugar, but some sugar substitutes are known to be more dehydrating than sugar itself.
If you want to avoid the dehydrating effects of sugar, the best mixers to use are soda and tonic. Soda is essentially just carbonated water. Tonic contains quinine, which has light pain killing and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains sugar, but not as much as other carbonated mixers. Some brands of diet tonic do not contain any sweeteners at all, so this is especially good to mix with alcohol. These may not do as much to mask the alcoholic flavor of liquor, but they are less likely to contribute to vomiting, headaches, and other hangover symptoms.

, Cheap liquor has more impurities and often leads to a rougher hangover. You may not be able to afford as many top shelf drinks per night, but they will taste better. This means you can enjoy the flavor without a bunch of mixers.

, It may be tempting to guzzle your booze, but then it becomes harder to keep up with how it is affecting you. It is much easier to overdrink when you drink too fast because you are not allowing the effects of the alcohol to set in before you decide whether or not to have another drink. A good starting pace for drinking alcohol is about one drink per hour.


Be sure your drinks are measured properly so that you can accurately limit yourself. If you are drinking at a bar, you can rest assured that this is already under control. If you are mixing your own drinks or drinking at a party, always measure the amount of alcohol in each drink by the shot.
Listen to your body. After you finish each drink, check yourself for signs of dehydration before getting another one. As discussed before, these are headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Stop drinking alcohol and switch to water as soon as you feel any of these things. Also note the condition of your basic motor skills. If you find yourself stumbling around or struggling to speak clearly, you probably shouldn’t have another drink.
Listen to your friends. If someone who cares about you suggests you should slow down or stop for the night, they are probably quite right.

, There are a number of ways to do this, but it all comes down to awareness and self-control. These things often come with maturity and experience, so this is the hard part for people who are just learning to drink.


Set a limit for yourself at the beginning of the night. Three drinks is a good limit for inexperienced drinkers. That should be just enough for you to experience the euphoria and social lubrication of light drunkenness without the throwing up, blacking out or otherwise getting out of hand.
If you think you might have trouble limiting yourself, tell a friend or designated driver about your limit before you start drinking and ask them to hold you accountable.

Eat something.,
Drink at least one glass of water before sleeping.,
Take a single 200mg ibuprofen tablet.,
Understand that you will sleep more soundly after drinking.",How to Drink Alcohol3," Avoid sugar in this case. You will thank yourself in the morning.


Stop at an all-night diner on the way home and grab some breakfast food. Think absorbent, greasy, and high in carbs. These kinds of foods are bad to eat all the time, but as mentioned before they are really good for moving alcohol through your system without too much of it getting into the blood.
At very least, snack on something absorbent like crackers, popcorn or pretzels before going to bed.

, If you can, drink more.


Also be sure to empty your bladder before sleeping.

, This can serve as a preemptive strike against hangover.


You should only do this AFTER consuming a meal and plenty of water. Drinking large amounts of alcohol may have temporarily damaged the lining of your stomach. Food, water and a couple of hours’ time should have improved this condition enough for a standard over-the-counter ibuprofen pill to do more good than harm.
Do not take more than one pill, just to be safe.
Avoid acetaminophen, as this comes with a higher risk of liver damage.

, You will sleep more soundly, although the quality of your sleep will be lower. Do what you must to compensate for this.


If you have to be up at a certain hour, set your alarm for earlier than usual. It will probably take a while for you to join the world of the living.

Drink up!",How to Drink Beer," Gone are the days when you thought beer only came out of a keg and into a red plastic cup. There are an infinite amount of varieties out there, meaning there's a beer out there that matches your ideal taste. Here's a brief and not-at-all comprehensive rundown (that would take ages):Ales. These ferment quickly and are generally a bit sweeter, fuller-bodied, and have a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) have more hops and are generally bitter. This category includes pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, barley wines, brown ales and tripels. Watch out for tripels – they've been fermented several times and can knock you off your feet.

Lagers. These ferment slowly and tend to have a ""crisper"" flavor than ales and are, in general, less ""hoppy."" Think of Heineken, Bud Light, Natural Light, Harp, Corona, Miller Genuine Draft – these are all light lagers.This category also includes pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks and marzens.

Stouts. These really fall under the ""ale"" umbrella, but they are their own beast. A stout is dark and often creamy, with tastes of chocolate and coffee undertones. There's also oatmeal and oyster stouts, too. For these, think Guinness, Beamish, and Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts.

Bitters. These are English ales that have a deep bronze look and a well-hopped flavor (in other words, bitter). In general, they have greater depth than IPAs. It's hard to qualify their taste beyond that as there are several categories: session or ordinary bitter, best or regular bitter and premium or strong bitter (often called Extra Special Bitters (ESB)).

Wheat Beer (or Hefeweizen). This is an ale with a light yet hazy appearance. It often has a slight banana or clove flavor. Sometimes it's spicy or apple-y, too. It's not bitter and it's often served with a wedge of lemon.;
, Just like red wines and white wines (and hard liquors) need to be treated differently and put it in different glasses, the same goes for different varieties of beer. Here's a few things to consider:Mugs – good for IPAs, red, black, brown, and blonde American Ales, Pilsner, English Stouts, smoked beer, witbier, American and English Porters

Pint glasses – good for American Ales, IPAs, Pale Ales, English Bitter and mild English Ales, cream ales, dark Lager and Stouts.

Goblets: Belgian IPAs and strong, dark ales, quadruples and tripels

Pilsner glasses: Vienna and Japanese lagers, Euro dark and strong lagers, American malt liquors, pale and red lagers, doppelbocks

Weizen glasses: Dark and pale wheat ales, and all ""weizens""

, Beer pairs just as well – if not better – with food like wine. And in general, it's the same idea: lighter foods like salads and fish go with lighter beers. Heavier foods and meatier meats go with darker beers. You should also pair ""regional"" beers with food of that region. Apart from that, here are a few things to remember:Does your beer have a caramel, cocoa or coffee flavor? Pair it with a smokey flavor, like with char-grilled foods.
Is your beer hoppy? This can provide an herbal contract to fattier foods, like salmon, pizza, and fried foods.
Is your beer sweet and fruity? Think appetizer plates, like grapes, cheeses, and bruschetta.

, It's important to store your beer in a cool area, away from direct light, heat and in a constant temperature. Ideally, most beers should be kept around 50–55 °F (10–13 °C). Anything higher and the lifespan of your beer will be shortened; anything lower and you'll make it hazy or cloudy.


Wanna get technical? Strong beers (like barleywines, tripels, dark ales) will be best enjoyed when kept just below room temperature, around 55-60F. Standard ales (like bitters, IPAs, dobbelbocks, lambics, stouts, etc) should be at ""cellar temperature, 50-55F. Lighter beers (think lagers, pilsners, wheat beers, milds, etc) should be around refrigerated temperature, or 45-50F.Think of it this way: the higher the alcohol content, the higher the temperature required and vice versa.

, A dirty glass may contain oils or grime that interferes with the true flavor of your beer. Also, it's just a little gross. To be sure, run your glass under hot water; use soap and water if necessary. Hold it up to the light to inspect for smudges and oil.


Don't mix your glasses, either. If it's a beer glass, use it as just a beer glass. Try putting beer in a milk glass and you'll get the picture.

, For the perfect beer, you need about 1"" to 1-1/2"" of ""head"" (the foamy stuff), or about 2.5–3 centimeter (1.0–1.2 in).To get at this, start by pouring the beer into your perfect glass at a 45-degree angle. The beer should stream down the midpoint of the side of the glass, allowing it to aerate. This creates the ""head"".


Having head is very important to get to the true flavors of the beer. No head and you'll lose what makes your beer tasty and delicious. It'll also provide a stronger, more decadent aroma.

, When glass becomes half full, start leveling it out slowly, pouring straight into the glass. This minimizes the head created, giving you the perfect amount.


If you head is forming too quickly (this happens with some beers), start pouring straight down the middle sooner. If it's not forming, keep it at an angle.

, Some people believe in the double-pour method as it supposedly increases the aroma and releases the flavors. This is especially true with Guinness (if that's how they do it in Dublin, it's best to follow suit). Here's how it's done:


Pour the glass half full, accumulating a large head
Let the head dissipate slightly
Pour again, aiming for that 1"" to 1-1/2"" of head in total

, Want to analyze your beer and learn which ones you love, which ones you loathe, and why? Start by looking at your beer, marveling at its color and body. Raise it in front of you, but not to the light (that'll make it appear lighter than it is). What do you notice?


Think about the head. Is it foamy? Creamy? Quick to disappear?
Consider its color. Is it more golden, red, or chestnut?
Look at its consistency. Is it creamy? Thick or thin? Hazy with debris or clean as a whistle?

, Just like you swirl around a glass of good red wine, swirl around your beer. This releases the aromas and fragrance of your particular beer. It pulls out the nuances and tests its head retention.


How does this beer differ from other beers you're used to when you swirl it around? How does the carbonation loosen? What happens from the bottom to the top of the beer?

, Most of taste is smell, after all. Take the first whiff through your nose. What do you sense? Fruits? Bread? Chocolate? Then take a whiff through your mouth (yes, the two are connected). Does it change at all?


If need be, swirl it around again. Does this intensify the smell?

, Take your first sip. Don't swallow quite yet. Let it ruminate on your palate, wandering and exploring every taste bud. How does it feel in your mouth? Now breathe out (this could change the taste as mucus gets released). Detect even the smallest flavors, like salty or sweetness. How does it change as it warms in your mouth, too?


Then swallow. Then repeat. Repeat, repeat, repeat, and repeat. How is it changing with every sip? Does it change as you reach the bottom of your glass?

, Don't leave it to get warm and stale. If you drank from a bottle (why would you do that?) and you recap it for later, it'll get skunk-y when you come back to it, so don't bother. Beer is best now.


Okay, so you can let it get a little warm. Really, really cold beer has its flavors masked by temperature. Let it warm up a bit and you may notice nice changes. But there's a line where it crosses and becomes not so tasty – if you wait, you'll find that line.

Take a drink and enjoy your Corona.",How to Drink Corona1," You can place your beer in the freezer, fridge or cooler. Depending on the method and the initial temperature of the beer, it could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to cool the beer - so in deciding which method to use, consider how soon you want to open your first beer.


Be careful not to leave your beer in the freezer for more than 30 minutes, as it may explode.
Using a cooler with ice water is the fastest method to cool beer (it transfers heat more quickly).With this method, allow the ice to settle inside the cooler for an hour or longer. Once the ice melts a little, place the Corona beers inside the cooler.;
, Use a bottle opener to remove the bottle cap from the top of the beer - as all Corona bottles require a bottle opener.








, Sprinkle the rim of the bottle with a little sea salt, Lucas or salt-based seasoning of your choice. Place a lime wedge over the opening of the beer bottle and squeeze the lime juice into the bottle. Push the lime wedge into the bottle to flavor the beer even more.









If you'd like to mix the drink more completely, try putting your thumb over the top of the beer and slowly turning it upside down a few times. Be careful: Turning the beer upside down at a fast rate will cause the beer to release carbonation and explode.

Hop characteristics are dictated by boiling times. According to the Brewmasters at Brew Supplies, the peak aroma is achieved at about 7 minutes after the start of the boil, and is almost completely lost at 15 minutes.
Peak flavor is about 20 minutes into the boil, and is almost completely lost at 40 minutes. All that is left is bitterness, which is fully achieved at approximately 60 minutes. Beer is not intended to have only one of these characteristics. Aroma, flavor, and bitterness are all necessary in their proportion to make the pallet desired.;

De-carbonate your beer.,
Shampoo your hair.,
Massage your hair with beer for 1 minute.,
Rinse the beer off.",How to Clean Your Hair With Beer1," Pour a bottle or can of beer into a jug or bowl and let it sit overnight or throughout the day. The more air surface your beer is exposed to, the faster it will oxidize and become flat.


Beer becomes flat by releasing the carbon dioxide it creates. It's important that the carbon dioxide is gone from the beer when using it to treat hair as carbon dioxide combined with water can create hard water or water with a high mineral content.The presence of carbon dioxide can hinder the effects of shampoos and make it harder for you to wash your hair effectively. As well, hard water causes the scales on each hair stand up, making your hair look tangled and tough.;
, Use whatever shampoo you normally use but skip the conditioner. The beer will act as your conditioner instead.


You can transfer your flat beer into a closed container or bottle and bring it with you into the bathroom or somewhere you can easily reach for while in the shower.

, Pour the container or bottle of beer into your hair and lather it onto your scalp.


Beer is also very beneficial for your skin as beer sediment or brewer's yeast helps reduce sebum production and control oily skin on your face or scalp.
You can also try dipping the ends of your hair with beer first, letting it set in your hair for about 5 minutes before rinsing your entire head with beer.

, It's recommended you don't rinse the beer off completely and leave it in your hair for a better effect. Towel dry your hair afterwards.


It may take a few washes before you see you can feel and see results.It's best to only do the beer wash a few times a week as it can be quite drying for hair if used everyday.

Measure for the cup. Take the glass' circumference but just aim for making the height half of the glass' actual size (or a little shorter than it actually is). This will give the shape of the cup but not the same large size.;
, The duct tape fabric should be folded in half and stuck together. Otherwise, the sticky side will catch to the glass mold (and you don't want a sticky inner to drink out of). You'll need to fold enough lengths to go all the way down the length of the glass (probably at least two lengths); each length will be joined by a small strip of duct tape to hold it together.

, Wrap at the midway or other lower point that you've selected for the height of the glass.

, Continue to use this method for each length wrapped around the glass.

, Wrap the duct tape fabric lengths around the glass until the tape reaches the base of the glass. The cup is best if the layers slightly overlap, to create less opportunity for leakage. At the base, stick the duct tape in a cross-like formation until all of the base is securely covered.


Once it is all done, wrap a piece or two around to secure all the layers neatly.

Check the pressure.,
Note the harmful effects when neglecting the equilibrium pressure.,
Consider the effects of the drop in pressure with the dispensing system.,
Don't exceed flow rate.,
Consider applying a compensator.,
Ensure an undisturbed beer flow from the coupler to the dispense unit.,
Avoid so-called “wild beer”.",How to Dispense Beer," For all kinds of kegs the first requirement is that dispensing should never take place below the equilibrium pressure of the dissolved CO2. The equilibrium pressure is the minimum pressure necessary to maintain the CO2 gas dissolved in the beer. Dispensing any keg below this pressure will unavoidably lead to a loss of CO2 gas, i.e., a loss of sparkling behaviour of the beer resulting in unfavourable “flat beer”. Furthermore, arising of bubbles in the beer hose (which is soon at ambient temperature) will lead to dispensing difficulties (sputtering/splashing).


While dispensing from KeyKeg in the straight-up position, all out gassing taking place in the KeyKeg will accumulate to bubbles in the beer line and lead to dispense complications.
When dispensing from ordinary stainless steel kegs, the use of too little pressure is widespread in an attempt to save CO2 propellant from costly CO2 bottles. The equilibrium pressure depends on two aspects: CO2 content and temperature. CO2 contents for beer typically vary from approx. 4 grams per litre up to 7 grams per litre. At 20oC these carbonization grades result in equilibrium pressures of 1.4 to 3.2 bars respectively.
In regular stainless steel kegs, dispensing should not take place above the equilibrium pressure either. Dispensing above the equilibrium pressure will inevitably lead to over- carbonization, a pick-up of CO2 gas by the beer. This phenomenon is harmful for the taste of the beer as well.
Note that this will not occur with the KeyKeg; in the KeyKeg, this second effect cannot occur because the beer is at all times separated from the propelling gas. Therefore, the KeyKeg has great benefits when a higher dispense pressure is needed. When for instance dispensing on the ground floor or even first floor from kegs stored in a cool cellar, the necessary extra 0.3 bar pressure per floor level can be added to the “normal” dispensing pressure without any negative effects of over-carbonization. In fact, dispensing from KeyKeg is advised at a slightly higher pressure than the equilibrium pressure (or higher) to avoid any possibility of CO2 loss of the beer.;
, These are more fully discussed below but they are especially important in low-volume outlets where the amount of beer sold is only moderate and the pick-up or loss of CO2 gas in the keg can take place during a long time span.

, The dispensing system from the coupler via beer hose, cooler and dispensing column to the tap valve causes a certain pressure drop during dispensing. Together with the (begin) pressure on the keg, this pressure drop affects the flow rate of the beer from the tap.

, Depending on the carbonization and temperature of the beer this flow rate should not exceed a certain value to avoid excessive foaming of the beer in the glass. Given the dependence on carbonization grade and temperature, it follows that a certain dispensing facility is dedicated only for type of beers with, at least approximately, the same carbonization grade and serving temperature.

, A way to achieve some extra regulating possibilities is the application of a compensator valve at the tap. With a compensator an adjustable pressure drop and thus flow rate drop can be achieved at the very end of the beer line to avoid excessive foaming in the glass. In this way a higher beer pressure and/or a too short beer line can be compensated. Even a lot of professional compensators in the market, however, are not properly designed from a beer flow point of view and therefore cause out-gassing/foaming of the beer in the compensator.

, Instantaneous pressure drops at all connections should be avoided.


The main rule is that the cross-section of the line should never increase, at least not in an abrupt way. A carefully designed smooth increase in cross-section, like for example at the outflow of the tap is possible. A decrease of the cross-section is less of a problem.
All sudden corners and flow changes should be avoided, therefore the use of any other valve except ball valves which allow an undisturbed flow when fully opened is highly unfavourable. Furthermore the valves should be opened and closed instantaneously when dispensing.

, When moving a beer keg, the beer gets agitated, physically the CO2 molecules get less tied to the water molecules and are more easily/faster to be set free at pressures below the equilibrium pressure. Leaving a moved keg at peace for some hours will cause the gas to be better tied up to the water and facilitate the dispensing tremendously.

Wet paper towels or rags.,
Wrap the paper towels or rags around the beer.,
Put the beer in the freezer.",How to Chill Beer1," You will need to make sure you have enough for each bottle or can. Once you’ve gathered enough, douse each in water. They should be completely wet, but not dripping. Too much water will cause them to stick to the beer completely and removing them will be difficult.;
, Make sure the middle of each can or bottle is completely covered, as those portions are what will chill faster. If you're using paper towels, try using two instead of one for a thicker covering.

, Make sure to place the beers slightly apart as they’re likely to stick together if they’re touching. Once in the freezer, each beer should take 8-15 minutes to chill. Also, remember to watch the time, because leaving the beers in the freezer for too long may cause them to explode.To avoid any possible injury, try putting each beer in a Ziploc bag in case they crack or break open. This will make removal both safer and easier.

Add a few drops of essential oils into your beer.,
Mix a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your beer.",How to Clean Your Hair With Beer2," The alcohol in the beer can be damaging and drying for hair but these effects can be counteracted by adding a few essential oils. It not only adds extra nourishment to your beer hair wash but can also provide you with a calming effect when you're massaging the beer into you hair, all the while leaving you smelling great. Consider adding:



Lemon oil: It strengthens hair, adds shine, and fights against dandruff.Almond oil: It moisturizes and soothes the scalp.

Chamomile oil: It adds shine and softens hair.

Jojoba oil: It adds nutrients to hair and moisturizes the scalp.

Lavender oil: It acts as a deep conditioner that moisturizes, nourishes and adds antioxidants to hair.Sandalwood oil: It helps with dry or split ends.

, Vinegar helps with counteracting rough or brittle feeling hair but smoothing out the scales or cuticles found on each of strand of hair. Shampoo especially aggravates hair by lifting up these scales and preventing hair from feeling smooth and looking shiny.


Consider using raw apple cider vinegar rather than commercial vinegar. Raw vinegar is not distilled, heated, or clarified. Raw vinegar has much of the good bacteria, nutrients, and enzymes needed to improve hair texture.
You can mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to 8 ounces (250 mL) of water instead of beer and treat your hair the same way you would with a beer wash.
It's best to only use a vinegar rinse a few times a week. If used everyday, it can be quite drying for hair.

Fill a cooler, bucket, or sink with ice.,
Add water to the ice.,
Add rock or granulated salt to your ice and water mixture.,
Put your beer into the ice, salt, and water mixture.,
Jiggle the beer every couple of minutes.",How to Chill Beer2," How much ice you use will depend on the size of your cooler, bucket, or sink. Try to make sure you have enough ice to bury the bottles or cans underneath it. If you have a lot of beer you may need to use more than one cooler or bucket or chill the beer in shifts.

, Make sure that you add enough water that the mixture is soupy. As a liquid, water can cover a can or bottle at more points than ice can, which will allow it to cool faster.However, water will also warm at a faster speed, so make sure you add more ice as it melts. This will require you to dump some of the water out each time you add ice.

, Salt will help cool your beer faster because it allows water to drop to a temperature below freezing without becoming a solid. This means that you get the benefit of the cold temperature of the ice while still having the surface exposure of the water. You should try to have 1 cup of salt for every 3 lbs of ice.Ice will melt faster because of the salt, so be sure to replenish the ice frequently. , Since the water is “super cool” be careful of touching it too much with your hands. Instead, try gently dropping the beer into your cooler, sink, or bucket. You should also make sure that each can or bottle has enough space to be moved around.

, Moving the beer around will help ensure that all the liquid inside gets equal exposure to the surrounding ice, which will, in turn, help it cool faster. You should make sure you move the bottles or cans every couple of minutes.


Once you’ve added the beer it should cool in 2-5 minutes.

Try using a compressed air can or computer duster.,
Place the beer on your AC unit and turn it up.,
Put your beer in the snow.",How to Chill Beer3," While simple, this method gets time-consuming if you’re trying to chill multiple beers. Simply turn the compressed air can upside down and spray the beer until frost forms. Holding the compressed air can upside down will help ensure that it’s at its coolest.For safety, try putting your can or bottle into a Tupperware container and making a hole to spray the compressed air through.
You should also use a pair of gloves to prevent any potential frostbite or injury to your hands.
Also make sure to pour your beer into a clean glass after attempting this method, as some compressed air cans contain a bittering agent that is dangerous to ingest.

, If you don’t have central air, you can place your beer on top of or in front of your AC unit and turn down the temperature. It should take about 15 minutes for your beer to cool.Make sure you watch the beers as they may cool faster than you anticipate and you don’t want them to explode.
Use gloves or an oven mitt to remove the beer to prevent any potential injury to your hands due to the cold.

, If you live somewhere with a winter season or a place with easy access to snow, you can utilize the frozen water for your benefit. Simply open a door or window and place your cans or bottles outside. If possible, try to bury them as deep in the snow as you can. Just make sure you don’t forget them outdoors!

Prepare a tub for the keg.,
Place a layer of ice into the container.,
Lower the keg of beer into the keg tub.,
Fill the remainder of the keg tub with ice.,
Add cold water to the keg tub.,
Add more ice to the keg tub as it melts.",How to Chill a Keg of Beer," To chill a keg, you will need a large, durable container into which the keg will fit with a little room surrounding it. The best option is buying a specialized keg tub, which can be found at many liquor stores and home brewing supply stores.


Another ideal container is a large trash can. Most high-capacity outdoor trash cans can easily fit a keg of beer inside with room to spare.
A third option is placing the keg of beer directly into a bathtub in your home. This will prevent you from having to procure a separate container, but will of course require your guests to fill their beer glasses from your bathroom.;
, After you have prepared a keg tub, pour a layer of ice into the bottom of the tub about 12 inches (30 cm) thick. This ice will rest underneath the keg and help keep it chilled.

, Partner with 1 or 2 other people to lift the keg into the tub. Lift the keg carefully and slowly, keeping it upright throughout. Lower it as gently as possible onto the layer of ice in the keg tub. Moving the keg around too much can cause the beer to be too foamy when dispensed.

, After the keg is lowered into the keg tub, pour ice into the tub until the keg is being contacted by ice over as much of its surface area as possible.

, Ice alone will help chill the keg, but for the most effective chilling an ice water bath is preferable. Pour cold water over the ice in the keg tub until the water reaches the level of the ice.

, To keep the keg chilled throughout your party or gathering, add fresh ice to the keg tub if too much has melted away. Excess water can be removed either by scooping it out with a pitcher or by punching a drain hole near the bottom of your keg tub.

Check to make sure your keg is empty.,
Look to see if your keg has a CO2 line.,
Lift the coupler handle at the base of the tap where it joins the keg.,
Pull the coupler off the empty keg.

,
Move the empty keg aside.

",How to Change a Keg1," You'll know that your keg is empty if you open the faucet of the tap and either very frothy beer comes out or none does.;
, Some kegs will have a CO2 tank that provides pressure inside the keg to help dispense beer. The gas also helps the beer hold its natural carbonation. If the system you're using has a CO2 line, turn it off.

, Grasp the coupler and rotate it counter-clockwise until it won't move anymore, usually just a half-turn.

Cut off the foil.,
Unfold the corkscrew and insert it in the cork.,
Begin dislodging the cork.,
Remove the cork.",How to Open a Bottle of Wine1," The sommelier knife is constructed with a folded knife on one end and a folded corkscrew on the other. Open the knife and use it to score the foil just below the lip at the top of the wine bottle. Remove the foil cap and discard it, then close the knife into its recess.


Some sommelier knives have a sharp disc, rather than a knife, intended to be used to cut the foil.
The foil should always be cut just below the lip of the wine bottle to prevent any wine from touching it when poured. Coming into contact with the foil can change the taste of the wine.;
, Position the tip of the corkscrew in the center of the wine bottle's cork, push it in, and begin twisting. Keep twisting the corkscrew until you have only one twist left.


Don't twist too far into the cork, or pieces from the bottom of the cork may get dislodged into the wine.
If you don't twist far enough, the cork may break in two when you try to extract it.

, Move the lever arm down toward the neck of the bottle. Set the first set of ridges at the bottom of the lever arm on the lip of the bottle. Push down on the lever so that the cork begins moving upward. If necessary, use the second set of ridges on the lever arm to continue dislodging the cork.


Make sure you have a firm grip on the bottle, and that the lever arm is firmly in place, before you begin pulling up. Otherwise, the arm might slip.
If the cork won't budge, you may not have screwed the corkscrew in far enough. Twist it until there is only one twist remaining before using the lever.

, Pull up the handle of the sommelier knife's handle firmly. The cork should easily lift from the bottle with a slight pop.


If the cork doesn't lift from the bottle, screw the corkscrew in deeper, lift the cork using the lever arm, and try pulling on the handle again.
In fine restaurants, sommeliers untwist the corkscrew from the cork while it is still in the bottle, then finish removing the cork by hand. The cork is set on the table for the patron to examine for signs of freshness.

Remove the foil and the metal cage.,
Hold the bottle properly.,
Twist the bottle and hold the cork.,
Pop the bottle.",How to Open a Champagne Bottle1," First, tear off the foil wrap that covers the cork. Then, untwist the wire loop to loosen the wire cage that protects the cork. Be gentle and take your time. Keep a thumb on the cork to head off an accidental pop.Do not remove the wire cage until you are about to open the bottle! Otherwise, you may risk the bottle uncorking before you are ready. The cage is there to protect the cork.;
, Grip the body of the bottle in your dominant hand. Wedge the bulbous end of the cork deep into the palm of your non-dominant hand.Support the base of the bottle against your hip. If you're holding the bottle in your right hand, use your right hip or the right side of your torso.Consider holding the cork with a kitchen towel. This can help you apply friction, making it easier to catch and contain the cork as it pops out of the bottle. The towel may also protect against a spill., Slowly rotate the bottle back and forth with your dominant hand. Keep holding the cork steady with your non-dominant hand. As the cork turns, gradually increase the distance between your hands until your dominant hand is midway down the bottle.








, Decide what effect you're trying to achieve. If you're indoors or around a lot of people, make sure to take out the cork gently to avoid damage. If you want the dramatic effect of a champagne shower, then you can open the bottle with a mighty pop and send the cork flying high through the air. If you are opening champagne for a classy occasion: aim for a ""sigh,"" not a ""pop.""








Opening gently: Slow down your twisting toward the end, once the cork is almost out. Grasp the cork firmly. Press your thumb up from beneath the lip of the cork until it slides smoothly out of the bottle. Keep your grip on the cork, and ""catch it"" so that it doesn't fly away. Try to do it so gently that the cork doesn't make a popping sound.Popping dramatically: Use your thumb to push the cork out from beneath the lip. Shake the bottle to stir up the carbonation, if you want a bit of a mess and a lot of added effect. Aim the bottle away from yourself, your friends, and any breakable items in the near vicinity. Avoid trying this method until you're comfortable opening a champagne bottle gently!

Cut off the foil.,
Set the corkscrew in place.,
Turn the handle.,
Push down the wings and remove the cork.",How to Open a Bottle of Wine2," Most wing corkscrews don't come with knives, so use a sharp kitchen knife to score the foil just under the lip of the wine bottle. Pull off the foil cap and discard it.

, Place the tip of the corkscrew in the center of the cork and push down gently. The metal cap surrounding the screw should rest against the top of the bottle, with the butterfly wings lowered against the neck of the wine bottle.

, Hold the metal cap in place on the bottle with one hand, and use the other to turn the handle and screw the corkscrew into the cork. As you twist, the wings will begin raising upward. Continue turning the handle until the wings have raised to an upright position.

, Place the bottle on a table and use both hands to push down the wings of the corkscrew. As you push them down, the cork will begin lifting. Continue pushing until the wings are flat against the bottle's neck and the cork has emerged from the bottle.


If you flatten the wings and the cork is still in the bottle, use the handle to twist it further into the cork until the wings are raised in an upright position again. Push them down again to raise the cork. Continue this process until the cork comes out.
You might have to grasp the corkscrew and pull out the cork to finish the job.

Cut off the foil.,
Insert five nails into the cork.,
Begin lifting the cork.,
Take out the cork.",How to Open a Bottle of Wine3," Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle. Take off the foil cap and discard it.

, Use a hammer to gently nail five small nails in a row across the top of the cork. They should be in close proximity, but not touching. Hammer them until there's a small gap between the heads of the nails and the cork.


This method is most effective if you use long, thin nails. Short, thick nails won't dislodge the cork as easily.
Be very careful when you're hammering the nails into the cork. Make sure the hammer doesn't touch the glass bottle.

, Place the claw of the hammer over the first nail in the line. Hold the bottle steady with one hand and use the other to pull the nail upward with the claw. The cork should lift a little with the nail. Continue down the row of nails, lifting the cork a little each time you remove one.

, Once all the nails have been removed, the cork should be dislodged enough for you to finish the job with your own elbow grease. Grasp the bottle with one hand and use the other to pull the cork from the bottle.

Cut off the foil.,
Place the wine bottle upside down between your thighs.,
Rap the bottle with the sole of a shoe.,
Check the cork and pull it out.",How to Open a Bottle of Wine4," Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle, then remove the foil cap and throw it away.

, Sit down on a steady chair and hold the wine bottle in a secure position between your legs. The top of the bottle should be pointing downward, while the base of the bottle should be pointing up.

, Make sure you hold the bottle steady with your legs and one hand, and use the other to rap the base of the bottle with the sole of a flat shoe. With each strike, the cork should dislodge a little.


Strike the bottle firmly and evenly across the base. Don't hit it as hard as you can, and don't graze the edge, or the bottle may break. However, if it doesn't seem to be making progress, you may need to hit it harder.
Make sure the bottle is in a stable position. Don't just hold it between your thighs; use your free hand to grasp it, too.

, Take a look at the cork's progress, then continue striking the bottle until the cork has dislodged enough that you can grasp it with your hand and pull it out of the bottle.


If you try pulling out the cork and it's still firmly inside the bottle, turn it upside down and strike it a few more times before trying again.
Don't strike the bottle until the cork pops out on its own, or you may lose a few glasses of wine.

Chill the bottle before opening.,
Open carefully in formal settings.,
Avoid shaking the bottle.,
Pour slowly.",How to Open a Champagne Bottle2," Store in the refrigerator, a cooler, or an ice bucket. Give it at least a few hours to ensure that the contents are completely chilled. Not only will this improve the taste, but it will make the bottle less likely to spray champagne everywhere., Keep a firm grip on the cork so that it doesn't fly away unexpectedly. Slowly twist the bottle—not the cork—until the cork is almost out of the bottle. Listen for the almost inaudible ""sigh"" of the cork coming loose.Then, pull it out delicately using entire palm of your hand. Hold the cork over the opened bottle for a few seconds to make sure that the foam doesn't bubble over.








If you are serving champagne as a waiter or a caterer, it is usually considered proper etiquette to open the bottle as unobtrusively as possible. Do not spray, and do not let the cork fly. Practice until you can do it without so much as a ""pop.""

, Champagne is a carbonated beverage stored under pressure. When you shake the bottle, you build up that pressure to dangerous levels. Opening a highly-pressurized champagne bottle will unleash a mighty spout of champagne and send the cork flying forward at high velocity.








If you do accidentally shake the bottle, let it sit still for an hour or two so that the contents have time to settle. The CO2 will absorb back into the drink more quickly if the champagne is cold., Champagne is carbonated, and the bubbly liquid rises quickly when poured into a glass. Don't spill and waste champagne – especially if you are serving someone else!








Hold the glass upright. Do not slant it to pour.
Fill a third of each glass with champagne. Then, top up the servings once you've poured a bit for everybody.Do not touch the spout onto the rim of anyone's glass. Champagne is often stored in cellars, and in some circles it is considered poor etiquette to risk dirtying someone's glass.

Choose a secondary storage container.,
Sterilize your storage container.,
Pour the vinegar into your storage container.",How to Make Wine Vinegar," You can combine a few glasses of leftover wine or buy a fresh bottle to use. Don’t mix red and white wine together. Instead, either make white wine vinegar or red wine vinegar. Red wine vinegar is great for bold salad dressings and deglazing cooking pans. White wine vinegar is lovely in rich sauces and tart vinaigrettes.For example:


If you want to make white wine vinegar, choose a white wine you enjoy drinking, such as a chardonnay or pino grigio.
To make red wine vinegar, choose a red wine that you enjoy drinking. For example, select a tasty merlot or cabernet.
The more aromatic the wine is, the more flavorful the vinegar will be.;
, This commercially available product is also called a vinegar starter or a mother. The bacteria in a mother creates vinegar when combined with wine, cider, or fresh fruit juice. You don’t have to use a mother when making wine vinegar. However, some people find that using a mother helps create wine vinegar faster.


You can purchase this substance from wine and beer supply vendors or online., If you don’t want to purchase a mother, use a live vinegar instead. Look for vinegars that are advertised as “unpasteurized,” “unfiltered,” and “active”. For example, Braggs organic apple cider vinegar is a live vinegar.


If the vinegar is not advertised as ""unpasteurized"" or ""active,"" it's not a live vinegar. If you use this ingredient, you won't be able to create wine vinegar.

, Use a large, wide-mouthed jar or bowl made of nonreactive materials such as glass or ceramics.Stir everything together well. This will evenly distribute the bacteria throughout the wine and aerate the mixture.


If you’re using a live vinegar, add 3 tablespoons of vinegar for every cup of wine.If you’re using a mother, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, add the mother to the wine and gently mix it in.

, The cheesecloth will block out the light while letting air circulate through the mixture.First, drape the cheesecloth loosely over the top of the jar. Next, secure the cheesecloth in place with a rubber band.


Cheesecloth can be purchased at gourmet grocery stores, wine and cheesemaking supply depots, and online.
You should be able to smell the wine vinegar when you place your face close to the cheesecloth. Otherwise, loosen the cheesecloth to allow air circulation.

, Place your cheesecloth-covered container in a dark corner of a pantry or under your sink. Choose a spot that won’t get much light or heat. The vinegar will need to sit for two to three months while it ferments.


The optimal temperature range is 75 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius.) If you store your vinegar outside of this range, the process will take longer., After three weeks of fermentation, examine the vinegar for a gelatinous film. This is the new mother. Try not to disturb this layer or you’ll risk agitating the bacteria that creates wine vinegar.If you don’t find a gelatinous layer after a few weeks, the wine isn’t turning into vinegar. This happens when you use pasteurized vinegar as a starter. Throw away your creation and start over, using live vinegar.

, Begin tasting the wine vinegar periodically after one month of fermentation. To do so, gently push aside the mother with a spoon and gather a small sample of vinegar. You’re looking for a brightly tart, acidic taste.If the wine vinegar isn’t ready yet, gently replace the mother and allow the vinegar to continue fermenting.

, Once your vinegar tastes ready, it’s time to harvest it. First, use a spoon to push the mother down into the vinegar. Next, pour away the apple cider into a large bowl. While you pour, use the spoon to block the mother and keep it in the jar.Make sure the bowl has been cleaned well with hot water and soap before using it. Otherwise, you may introduce bad bacteria into your vinegar.

, Add more wine to the jar with the mother in it. Replace the cheesecloth and ferment the vinegar for another two to three months. Once the mother is used up, it will sink to the bottom and another mother will form on the vinegar.


Once the mother sinks all the way to the bottom, you can scoop it out and throw it away.
You can use this method to create wine vinegar indefinitely.

, Choose a heat-proof container that’s made of a nonreactive ceramic or glass material. The container should also come with an airtight lid or cork. For example, purchase a swing-top or sealable wine bottle.Some other examples of storage containers include:


Mason jars with lids
An old empty vinegar container
A glass beaker with a cork

, Wash the container with hot water and a strong dish soap. Next, bring a pot of water to boil on your stove. Submerge the container in boiling water for ten minutes to sterilize it. Allow it to air dry completely.Some dish washers have a “sterilize” option that you can use instead.

, Use a funnel to siphon the vinegar from the bowl to your storage container. Depending on how much vinegar you make, you may need two or three containers to collect everything. After pouring the vinegar, tightly secure the lid of the storage container.


Store your wine vinegar in a cool, dark place such as your pantry for up to one year."

Look for an IPA from a brewery you like.,
Read the description.,
Check to see if the IPA won any awards.,
Ask friends and check reviews online.",How to Choose an IPA1," One way to increase your chances of getting an IPA that you will enjoy is to choose one that was made by a brewery you like. If you like the brewery’s other beers, then there is a better chance that you will like their IPA.


Keep in mind that it is important to consider other factors as well. Some breweries specialize in a specific type of beer, and IPAs might not be their thing. Be willing to try something new as well.;
, Many breweries take great care to describe their beers in a pleasing way, and these descriptions can also help you decide if the beer is something you might enjoy. Read the description and look for information about the beer’s flavor.


For example, a description of an IPA might include terms like “citrusy,” “herbal,” “hoppy,” or “smooth.” Note these terms and consider whether you might enjoy a beer with these characteristics. If you are not a fan of beers that have one or more of the characteristics in the description, then look for a different IPA.
Special terms in the description can also help you to make your decision. For example, you might notice the term “dry hopped” on some labels. An IPA that has been dry hopped will be less likely to have a bitter taste, so go for one of these IPAs if you dislike bitter beers. The term “imperial” might also show up on some bottles, and these IPAs are likely to have a higher ABV.Calories might also be something that you can find on the label. Breweries are not required to include the calorie counts on beer labels, but some breweries include this information anyways. Since some beers can be really high in calories, you might want to check the label for this information., Although an award is not a guarantee that you will like the IPA, it may help you to decide between a few choices or give you some direction if you are feeling overwhelmed by the number of IPAs you are considering. Check the package for any mention of awards and use this information to help you choose an IPA.


For example, you might notice that one of the IPAs you are considering took first place at a national competition. This might mean that the IPA has more mass appeal than the others, which may mean that you will be more likely to enjoy it.

, Other people can be a great way to find an IPA that you will enjoy. If you have any beer enthusiast friends, try asking what IPAs they liked and what ones they did not like. You can also go online and look for reviews of different beers.


Try to find beers that have been highly rated, such as getting 5 stars, 9/10, A- or A, or a 90% rating. These high marks mean that lots of people liked the IPA, so you might like it too.

"
"
Ask for a sample.,
Note the appearance.,
Inhale the aroma.,
Taste the IPA.",How to Choose an IPA2," If you are visiting a brewery or even a brewpub, then you are often encouraged to sample a beer before you decide to get a pint. If you are trying to choose between a few different IPAs or if you are not sure if you would like the brewery’s IPA, then ask the bartender for a sample.


Try saying something like, “I want to try this IPA before I decide what to order. Can I please have a sample?”

, After you get your sample, hold it up and take a look at it. This will give you a chance to see its color. Most IPAs have a deep golden color to them, but the color can vary in shades. Enjoying the appearance of the IPA is all part of savoring its flavor.Try to describe the appearance for yourself. What colors do you see in the glass? Is it golden? Amber? Pale orange? Is there any foam (head) on top of the beer? Is so, how much?

, Next, swirl the glass gently to help release some of the aroma of the beer. Then, bring it to your nose and inhale the aroma through your nose. This will enhance the flavor of the beer when you taste it and it will also provide a nice preview of the flavor.Pay special attention to the scent of the beer. What do you smell? Is it herbal? Floral? Citrusy? Is the aroma pleasant to you?

, After you have finished enjoying the aroma, you can taste the IPA and decide if you like it or not. Take a sip of the beer and hold it in your mouth for a minute. This will give you a chance to enjoy the flavors and the feel of the beer in your mouth.Note the taste of the IPA. What do you taste? Is it citrusy? Bitter? Sweet? Sour? Malty? Do you like the way it tastes?
If you like the IPA, then go ahead and order a pint to enjoy. However, if you do not like it, ask to try something else. IPAs can have a strong flavor, which is not for everyone. Make sure that you order something that you will enjoy drinking.

"
"
Identify the alcohol by volume (ABV) of the beer.,
Check the price.,
Consider meals you might enjoy with the beer.",How to Choose an IPA3," Many IPAs are high in alcohol, which can be a problem if you plan on drinking your IPAs over the course of an evening and do not want to get too intoxicated. Some IPAs have 6%, 7%, or even 8% alcohol by volume!Check the label or ask about the ABV before you decide to buy or try an IPA. If it is higher than you want it to be, then try something else.


To check the alcohol content of the IPAs you are considering, look for the ABV on the label followed by a number and a percentage. A higher number means that it is a more alcoholic beer.
Try to find one that is at or below 5% if you want something you can drink over the course of an evening. These are called session IPAs., Some IPAs can be expensive, especially if they have a special ingredient or a high ABV. Consider how much you are willing to pay for a six pack of IPAs and check the price on the product you are considering.


Keep in mind that craft beers can be a little pricey. Expect to pay around $8 to $10 for a six pack of IPA.

, If you are into pairing your beer choices with food, then think about what meals you might want to have with your IPA. There are several different types of foods that pair well with IPAs including:Spicy foods, like curries, Thai food, or Mexican food.
Deep fried foods, like French fries, fried chicken, or chicken wings.
Grilled foods, like burgers, steaks, or grilled shrimp.
Oily fish, such as salmon or mackerel.
Mango and citrus flavored desserts, such as mango sorbet or key lime pie.

Get some ring-sized memory wire.,
Measure out 1¼ to 1½ loops, then cut them with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters.Memory wire is very difficult to cut, so you want to use a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters for this.,
Twist one of the ends of your memory wire into a small loop.,
Add your bead(s), if desired.,
Consider adding a charm instead of beads.,
Make another loop at the end of the memory wire to secure the beads.,
Use the wine glass charm.",How to Make Wine Glass Charms1," Memory wire is a special type of wire that keeps its ""ring"" shape. There are lots of different sizes of memory wire, ranging from ring to bracelet to necklace size. You want to get the smallest size, which is the ring size. Anything larger will slide off the base of your wine glass.


Look for something that is between ¾ and 1-inch (1.91 and 2.54-centimeter) wide.;
, Do not use your good jewelry wire cutters. They are too delicate for this task, and the memory wire could dull the blades down.

, Use a pair of round nose pliers to pinch the end of your memory wire. Twist the pliers upwards, against the curve of the memory wire, until you have a small loop. Pull the pliers out and set them aside., You can add one big bead or a bunch of small beads. You can also do a combination of the two: a big bead with small beads to either side of it. Be sure to leave about ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) at the end of the wire so that you can make another loop.

, Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up a jump ring. Pull the ends of the jump ring past each other rather than away from each other. Slip the jump ring through the loop at the top of your charm, then close the jump ring. After this, you can slide the jump ring onto the memory wire.You can use a charm just by itself or with some small beads to either side of it.
If the ends of the jump ring aren't touching, you can pinch the jump ring to push them towards each other until they touch.
Some charms may already have a jump ring attached to the top loop. If you have a charm like this, simply slip it onto the memory wire.

, Like before, use your round nose pliers to pinch the end of the memory wire. Twist the memory wire against the curve of the memory wire, then slide them out.

, To attach the charm, simply pull the ring apart slightly, and push it onto the stem of your wine glass. The memory wire will naturally keep its shape, so you do not need to use the loops you made to close the ring.

Brainstorm your design.,
Select a label size.,
Sketch your label on plain paper.,
Use transfer paper to imprint your template onto your labels.,
Trace your design with permanent marker.,
Stick your label on your wine bottle.,
Seal your label to prevent water damage.,
Repeat this process for additional wine bottles.",How to Make Wine Labels1," Take some time to think about your wine and what you want your wine label to accomplish. Is the wine is for an occasion, like a wedding or Christmas? Or is it an all-season wine? Do you want the wine to be perceived as serious or fun? Make a list of any visual images that come to mind that you’d like to incorporate in your design.It can be helpful to visit your local wine store and take note of any labels you feel particularly drawn to. Note what you like about them and take a few pictures for inspiration.
You can also explore wine merchants and check out labels for inspiration online.;
, Wine label paper comes in any number of sizes up to standard letter (8.5 in by 11 in or 26 cm by 28 cm). This is much larger than any potential wine bottle. Experiment with different size labels by buying a full sheet of labeling paper and cutting out sample labels of different dimensions. This will help you determine the size and shape of label you like best., Draw a “label” of the shape and dimensions you’ve determined are best on a sheet of blank letter paper. Sketch a design based on the ideas you brainstormed. You can try experimenting with a few designs to narrow down your favorite. Once you’ve determined the direction you want to go, draw a clean copy of your design to the right dimensions.


This will be your template for label creation.

, Use artist tape to secure a piece of graphite transfer paper on top of an actual label you’ll be using for your wine bottles. Ensure all the edges are secured tightly and that there is no movement between the two pieces. Place your design template on top, and begin tracing firmly with a pencil. This will transfer your design to your label seamlessly., Use permanent markers to color in or add wording to your design on the label as desired. This will ensure your label is colorfast., Remove the backing off the wine label to expose the sticky side. Start at one side and press the label smoothly over the surface of the bottle, taking care not to trap any air bubbles.

It can be helpful to let the labels and bottles come to room temperature for the best application., Use a clear acrylic sealant, such as Krylon Crystal Clear, to waterproof your new label. Follow the manufacturer’s directions regarding any ventilation, spraying distance and curing time to ensure the best result. Most sprays take at least two hours to dry completely., Use your template to make more labels as desired. Seal your wine labels to prevent smudging."

Understand the concept behind this method.,
Choose a shoe to work with.,
Avoid trying this method with athletic shoes or high heels.,
Remove the plastic sheathing or foil around the top of the wine bottle.,
Place the wine bottle in the shoe.,
Bang the bottle and sole of the shoe against a brick or stone wall.,
Watch to see if the cork begins to slide out.",How to Open a Wine Bottle with a Shoe," Simple physics provides an explanation of how this method works. For this method, you put the bottle of wine into the shoe and bang the shoe sole on a wall.
The force from the banging will help to loosen the cork and it will start to come out.
The force travels through the liquid and transfers to the cork.
Since the liquid isn't free flowing inside the wine bottle, it acts like a solid and allows the force to transmit to the cork.;
, Don't use just any type of shoes, as anything with a soft sole or high heel won't work. The shoes you choose should have solid, hard soles.
The opening in the shoe should fit a wine bottle nicely.
Make sure the shoes are a good sturdy pair. Shoes that are old and flimsy won't allow the force from the banging to transmit to the wine bottle well.
Men's dress shoes tend to work very well for this method.

, These shoes won't work well for a number of reasons. Athletic shoes have cushioned rubber soles that absorb force.
The soles of athletic shoes are often too padded to transmit force into the wine bottle.
High heels don't have enough surface area on the sole to transmit enough force. They may also snap when you bang the heel against the wall.

, Many wine bottles have a small tab you can pull to remove this. If you leave the foil or plastic top on the bottle, then the cork won't be able to slide out.
It's not necessary to peel all of it off.
Just make sure the top of the cork is fully exposed and that the wine bottle covering isn't impeding it.

, There is no need to pad the bottle if the shoe is loose around the bottle. Remember, you want to use shoes with a hard sole and sturdy sides.
Don't use tennis or athletic shoes.
Men's dress shoes are recommended.

, This requires a good deal of force. Hold the neck of the wine bottle in your left hand. Grasp it firmly.
Don't put your thumb, fingers, or palms over the cork.
Hold the toe end of the shoe in your right hand.
Bang the heel end of the shoe against the wall, holding the wine bottle in firmly.
Bang the shoe against the wall with a lot of force.

, It should do so more with each bang.Once the cork is out about halfway, stop banging.
Remove the wine bottle from the shoe.
Wiggle the cork the rest of the way out using your hands.

Read and understand the process.,
Clear some space.,
Find your grapes.,
Wash your grapes.,
Smash your grapes.,
Test the acid content.,
Adjust the specific gravity.,
Add metabisulphite.,
Check the temperature.",How to Make Wine1," Making wine from scratch is challenging and the end result can vary immensely, especially when performed by an inexperienced wine maker. That being said, don't be deterred from giving it a shot — after all, practice makes perfect!;
, A basement or garage is often ideal. Try to find a space with well regulated temperature.

, Research local grape suppliers. Contact a local vineyard, and arrange for them to sell you grapes. Keep in mind that no vineyard can promise you a due date. Grapes are ripe, when they are ripe. Therefore, you must be ready when the grapes are.


Alternatively, you may order concentrated grape juice online, which is made explicitly for wine making. If you do this you may skip to the ""Test the acid content"" step.
Wine grapes are different than your grocery store or table grapes, do not try to substitute.
You will want about 70-80 pounds of grapes for each carboy of wine you plan to make. A carboy hold 19 liters or 5 US gallons. That is about 30 bottles of wine.

, Once you have bought your grapes. Wash your grapes and sort them. Remove any rotten or bruised grapes.

, You may smash your grapes with or without the stems, which contain tannins. It depends on what flavor profile you are after. You may smash your grapes by hand, foot, or with a crushing machine. The resulting mass of pulp and juice is called ""must"".

, Follow the instructions that came with your acid testing kit to test the acidity of your must. Most likely your acid content will be too low, and the sugar content will be too high. Use the acid blend in your kit until it reaches 65%.

, Measure the specific gravity of your must using your hydrometer. Adjust the specific gravity of your must with water until you reach 1.095.

, Add 1 gram of metabisulphite for each 10 pounds of grapes. Mix. The metabisulphite will form sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) in the must. This will prevent most wild microorganisms from growing. Metabisulphite acts as an antioxidant.


Note: Some people are allergic to sulfites. If so, you may want to skip this step, but know you run a higher risk of contaminated wine.

, The must should be between 68–80 °F (20–27 °C). If it is too warm, add a bag of ice to the middle. Stir and check again. If it gets too cool, toss a warm water bottle in the middle. Stir and check again.

Get some ¾ to 1-inch (1.91 to 2.54-centimeter) earring hoops or earring wires.,
Add your bead(s), if desired.,
Consider adding a charm instead.,
Turn the normal end of the wire up by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) to secure the beads.,
Close the wine glass charm.,
Use the charm.",How to Make Wine Glass Charms2," You can find these in the jewelry findings section of your local craft store or bead shop. The type that you specifically need look like a split ring. One of the ends of the wire is normal, while the other end is flattened and has a hole punched through it.Alternatively, you can also use the type of earring hoop or earring wire that has a looped end (instead of a flattened/punched end)., You can use one big bead or a bunch of smaller beads. You can also do a combination of both, with a big bead in the middle, and some smaller beads to either side of it. Slip however many beads you want onto the wire, but leave about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) so that you can turn the wire.

, Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pull open a jump ring. Pull the ends of the ring past each other instead of away from each other. Slip the jump ring through the loop part of your charm, then close the jump ring. Slide the jump ring onto the earring hoop.


You can use the charm by itself or with some small beads to either side of it.
If the ends of the jump ring aren't flush with each other, pinch the jump until the ends touch.
Some charms may already have a jump ring attached. If you have a charm like this, simply slip it onto the earring hoop.

, Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of needle nose pliers. Bend the tip of the wire upwards at a 90 degree angle., In order to close the charm, place the turned end of the wire under the flattened end. Push the wire through the punched hole. If it doesn't hold, carefully pull the charm at the sides. This will create more tension., Simply lift the flat end of the charm up and away, then slide the ring onto the stem of your wine glass. Push the flat end of the charm back onto the bent end to close it.

Seal your label to prevent damage.",How to Make Wine Labels2," Brainstorm about what kind of label would be the best fit for your wine. This can be driven by the style of wine, whether it’s been made for a special occasion, and the impression you’d like the wine to impart. Make a list of any visual images that come to mind that you’d like to incorporate in your design.Check out other wine labels to get design ideas. You can take photos of your favorites to note any cool color combinations or themes.

, Use design software, such as Adobe InDesign or Print Artist Platinum Plus, to craft a label. There are lots of online tutorials specific to wine-label making that can help you create the exact effects you want. Since you’re creating your labels with software, you also have the option of incorporating photos and other interesting graphics.Make sure you have the rights to any graphic images you decide to use. You can purchase rights to images on many photo sites such as Getty Images and Corbis.

, Online wine product stores, such as Grapestompers.com, provide many different colors and sizes of wine labels made to be printed on with a home printer. You can purchase labels that are already cut or a large sheets that can be tailored to unusual shapes or sizes., Load the labels into your printer, previewing your print beforehand to ensure proper alignment. Print the labels, letting them dry completely before handling.

, Expose the sticky side of the wine label by removing the protective backing. Start at one side of the label and press it smoothly over the surface of the bottle. Be careful not to trap any air bubbles as you smooth.

For the best application, let the labels and bottles come to room temperature first., Follow the manufacturer’s directions on a clear acrylic sealant, such as Krylon Crystal Clear, to spray your printed label. These sealants are sold in most craft stores. Many sealants take an hour or two to cure fully, so wait at least that long before handling your labels."

Add yeast to your must.,
Inspect and stir daily.,

Cap the carboy.,
Wait.,
Rack the wine into a new clean carboy.,
Adjust the specific gravity again.,
Clear the wine, day one.,
Clear the wine, day two.,
Rack the wine into a new clean carboy.",How to Make Wine2," Once the temperature is ideal (between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit) and stable, it is time to add your yeast. The yeast will metabolize the natural sugar found in the grapes into ethanol (alcohol). The amount of yeast you need will be specified to your yeast package, but it is usually one yeast package per one carboy or 70 pounds of grapes.


Note: Wine yeast is different than common bread yeast. Do not attempt to substitute.

, If not already in your fermenter, move the yeast/must combination into the fermenter. Once transferred, stir your fermenting must daily. Keep in mind that the fermentation process releases heat, so be sure to keep the wine in a cool place. Otherwise, your yeast may prematurely die.


The longer you let your wine ferment the darker it will be and the more tannins you will have. Do not ferment for longer than a week.

, Press the remaining must in the fermenter to remove all possible juice from the solid grape waste. When done add the extracted juice into the carboy. Fill the carboy to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the top.

, Secure the carboy with a bung and airlock. Now fermentation will begin in earnest. The airlock is filled with water to allow the wine gases to escape but prevent airborne contaminants from entering the fermenter.

, After 10-14 days, the little cap in the air lock will stop popping up and down. When this happens this means that the yeast is no longer fermenting.

, When you siphon the wine into a new clean carboy, leave any sediment behind in the old carboy.

, Measure the specific gravity using your hydrometer. If the specific gravity has reached 0.995 or lower (indicating increased alcohol levels) proceed to the next step.


If your specific gravity is above 0.995, allow your wine to ferment a few more days, and check again.

, Add bentonite to the wine. Bentonite will cling to the dead yeast and any other particulate matter. This will help them settle out of the wine and to the bottom of the carboy. The addition of bentonite also prevents further fermentation. After adding bentonite wait for 24 hours.


Make your bentonite slurry by adding 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of bentonite to 1 US-pint (470 ml) of boiling water. Then add 5–7 tablespoons (73.9–104 ml) of this slurry to each carboy of wine .

, After a day, add 1 ounce of liquid isinglass for every 5 or 6 gallons (one carboy) of wine. Wait ten days.

, At this stage you can let the wine age further, or bottle it now.

Before we rack the wine it is a good idea to ensure that the fermentation has done its job., Take a sample of wine, enough to allow the hydrometer to float. Pinch the top of the hydrometer and spin it to remove any air bubbles sticking to it which may alter the readings.

If the knock sounds like a dull thud, it is underripe. If the knock makes an almost hollow-sounding noise, the watermelon should be ripe.Make sure that the watermelon has a round, regular size and feels heavy. When fruit feels heavy for its size, it means that it has a lot of water inside and is ripe.;
, Wash the watermelon, then lay it on a cutting board. With a large knife, Peel a Watermelon by first cutting off the very top and bottom, then placing the watermelon upright and slicing downward to remove the rind.Make sure to keep your fingers clear of the area of the watermelon you are cutting. Also use a sharp knife so that you don't run the risk of having to use excessive force and accidentally nicking yourself with the knife.
After cutting off the rind, slice off any white strips on the watermelon until you’re left with only the red fruit.

, After you have removed the rind, chop the red fruit into one-inch (2.5 centimeter) pieces. These pieces don’t have to be precise since you’ll be cooking them down, they just have to be relatively small chunks., Place the watermelon chunks and the juices in a large pot and turn the heat to medium. You will cook the watermelon down so it liquefies and can be turned into wine., As the watermelon heats, it should begin breaking down. Help to speed up the process by mashing the fruit with a large spoon and stirring the watermelon frequently. Stop when most of the fruit has broken down, about a half hour, and remove the pot from heat., Carefully pour out 14 cups (3.5 liters) of the watermelon juice through a fine mesh strainer to catch any of the watermelon seeds or large chunks of the fruit.If you have leftover juice after you pour out the 14 cups (3.5 liters), you can reserve it to drink cooled or to use in cocktails. Store the leftover juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to three days.

, After you’ve finished straining out the seeds from the watermelon, pour the 14 cups (3.5 liters) of juice into a large pot. Add the granulated sugar to the pot, and heat until almost boiling. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Then remove the pot from the heat., Wait until the watermelon and sugar mixture cools to room temperature, then add the acid blend and the yeast nutrient. Stir with a whisk until they dissolve, which should take around thirty seconds., Carefully pour the watermelon juice into a 1 gallon (3.7 liters) carboy or another large fermentation container. Then cover the top of the container with a cloth and let it sit for 24 hours.Fermentation containers include heavy-seal plastic bins, glass or plastic carboys, and stainless steel kegs and tanks. The most important aspect of a fermentation container is its ability to seal completely and keep out oxygen.
Before the using the fermentation container and other fermentation equipment, sanitize them by soaking them in a mixture of water and bleach, with 1 tablespoon of bleach to each gallon of water, for at least twenty minutes., After the juice has sat for 24 hours, add the Champagne yeast by sprinkling it over the top of the juice. Then use an airtight lock to seal the fermentation container. Let the juice sit overnight., After you have set your wine aside for one day, you should notice that the surface of the liquid has become bubbly and foamy, and bubbles have formed in the airlock. This means that the juice is starting to ferment into wine.


To rack the wine, place the end of a siphon hose into your fermentation container about an inch from the bottom. Then suck the hose to start the siphoning process. The wine will start to move through the tube once you get it started. Place the other end of your tube in the other fermentation container, then seal the lid when all the wine has transferred.You will notice that some wine sediment has been left behind in the first fermentation container.
After you notice the bubbles and foam, Rack Wine into another 1 gallon fermentation container to leave behind the sediment.Cap the container and let it sit for two months.

, After the three months have passed, repeat the process of racking the wine and place it in a new fermentation container. Cap the wine and leave it two months., After two months has gone by, rack the wine again for the third time. This time, leave the wine for a month or so. By six months of fermenting, the wine should look quite clear., After around six months, there should be no bubbles in the airlock and the wine should look clear. This means that the process of fermentation is over. Rack the wine one last time, but this time transfer the wine into several sanitized bottles. Fill the bottles to one inch below where the bottom of the cork will be., After you have poured the watermelon wine into bottles, soak corks in warm distilled water for 20 minutes. Then place the bottle into the hand corker. Put the cork into the opening of the bottle. Then in one fluid motion, insert the cork into the bottle using the corker.If in doubt of how to use the hand corker, read the instructions on your specific corker.
Be sure to use corks that are 1 ¾ inch long.

, Now that your wine is corked, it is ready to be consumed! If you want a slightly more nuanced flavor, you can store the wine in a cool dark place for six months to a year. Otherwise, uncork a bottle on a warm summer night and drink it chilled or at room temperature."

This could make you sick, and prevent the wine from fermenting properly. Mix a cleaning solution with water and thoroughly scrub all tools and equipment with a non-abrasive pad or cloth.

Good cleaning products for winemaking equipment include Pro-Zyme, Sparkle Brite (also called Diversol), P.B.W., B-Brite, and Straight A.To clean demijohns, fill the container halfway with cleaning solution, plug the hole, and shake and tip the demijohn back and forth to slosh the solution around.;
, Once the tools and equipment have been cleaned, you must still sanitize them by soaking them in a solution of water and cleaner. Mix your sanitizing cleaner with water and soak all tools and equipment for between five and 30 minutes, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Good sanitizing products for wine equipment include sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, and iodophor.For equipment that you aren't using right away, clean and sanitize the equipment right before you need it.
When the soaking time is up, remove the equipment from the solution and allow it to drip dry.

, The best grape juice to make wine is a preservative-free juice with no additional ingredients.The ingredients should be 100 percent juice. Pour the juice into the sanitized wine fermenter, which is a special plastic bucket with an airtight lid, tap, and built-in hole for an airlock.

After soaking
To make more wine, simply increase the quantities of all the ingredients equally, with the exception of the yeast.
You can also use a demijohn (also called a carboy) for the first fermentation. You will need two demijohns to make the wine in that case.
Do not use polyethylene containers or blue water bottles to make wine., Reserve 1 tablespoon (14 g) of sugar and pour the rest into the fermenter with the juice. Stir the sugar with a sanitized spoon to mix it into the juice. The yeast will eat the sugar and convert the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is known as fermentation.

Granulated white sugar is the most common sugar to use for wine. You can use other sugars, such as brown sugar, but this may change the flavor of the wine.
Do not use confectioner’s sugar to make wine, as it contains corn starch as well as sugar.

, Campden tablets are sulfur-based tablets that can be used to sterilize juice, wine, cider, beer, and beverage-making equipment. They kill bacteria and prevent mold and yeast growth. Add one tablet to the juice and let it dissolve.

Use one tablet per gallon (3.8 L) of juice., Cover the top of the fermenter with a clean, lightweight towel or piece of cheesecloth. Secure the towel in place with an elastic around the outside of the fermenter. Leave the fermenter somewhere out of the way at room temperature for the next 24 hours.

It’s important to wait 24 hours before adding the yeast to the juice, because the Campden tablet is creating an environment that would kill the yeast if you added it right away., In a small, clean bowl, combine the package of yeast, the remaining 1 tablespoon (14 g) of sugar, and the lukewarm water. Let it sit for five minutes. During this time, the yeast will activate and become frothy and bubbly.A single package of wine yeast is sufficient for up to 5 gallons (19 L) of juice.

, Remove the towel from the top of the fermenter. When the yeast is frothy and foamy, pour the mixture into the juice. Stir the mixture with a sanitized spoon to incorporate the yeast mixture into the juice.Place a clean towel or cheesecloth on top of the fermenter and secure it in place with an elastic.

, Place the fermenter in a warm place in your house. Let the wine ferment, undisturbed, for five to seven days. During this time, the juice will begin to bubble as the yeast converts the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide.The initial fermentation is complete when the bubbles start to slow and signs of fermentation die down.

, Place a sanitized funnel into the mouth of a sanitized demijohn. Remove the towel from the fermenter. Pick up the fermenter, being careful not to agitate the contents. Slowly and carefully the liquid from the fermenter into the demijohn through the funnel.

Stop pouring just before the fermenter is empty to leave the layer of sediment in the bottom of the fermenter.
This process is known as racking. The purpose of it is to eliminate sediment that’s settled on the bottom of the fermenter. Each time you rack the wine, you'll remove more sediment, which will result in a clearer wine.
Demijohns for winemaking should be made of glass or PET plastic.If you're making more than a single gallon of wine, make sure there's plenty of headroom inside the demijohn. Divide the wine between two demijohns if necessary.

, Place the wine airlock into the mouth of the demijohn. Fill the airlock halfway with water. This device will allow gasses to escape from the demijohn, but will not let yeast, bacteria, or oxygen into the wine., Place the demijohn somewhere that’s room temperature and let it sit for another five weeks. The winemaking process usually takes six weeks in total, so it still needs another five for the fermentation process to complete.If you're in a rush, you can get away with leaving the wine for just three weeks, but it may not be as strong and the flavors won’t be as developed.

, Fill a bowl with a pint (473 ml) of water. Add ⅛ teaspoon of sodium metabisulfite and stir to combine. Add the corks to the bowl and let them soak for one to two hours, until they become slightly soft. This will sanitize the corks and prevent them from contaminating the wine.When the corks are soft, but not spongy, remove them from the cleaning mixture and transfer them to a colander to drain.
T-corks are the easiest to use for home winemaking, because they don’t require a corking device.

, After the five weeks are up, remove the airlock from the demijohn. Pick up the demijohn carefully to avoid agitating the sediment on the bottom. Slowly pour the wine into the re-sanitized fermenter.

Leave the bottom inch or so in the demijohn to keep the wine clear of sediment., Crush a Campden tablet into a fine powder. Add the powder to the wine and use a long spoon to stir it in. This will kill any bacteria or organisms that could spoil the wine after bottling., Place a sanitized bottle under the tap on the fermenter. Turn on the tap and let the wine run until the bottle is nearly full. Turn off the tap.Leave at least an inch of headroom for the cork. Push a sanitized cork all the way into the mouth of the bottle. Repeat until all the bottles have been filled and corked.

Five 25.3-ounce (750-ml) bottles should be sufficient for a gallon (3.8 L) of wine, because some liquid will have been lost during racking.

Make sure you have a clean set of wine-making supplies.,
Wash and remove the stems from the 4-5 pounds of fresh strawberries.,
Coarsely chop the strawberries with a knife.,
Mash the berries to a pulp in a large, food-grade bucket.,
Add enough water to cover the strawberries, plus two pounds of sugar, then stir.,
Add a sterilizing tablet, pectin enzyme, tannins, and an acid blend if making professional-style strawberry wine.,
Cover the top of the bucket with a clean towel and let it sit for 1-2 days.,
After two days sitting, add a packet of wine yeast and 1 tsp of yeast nutrient.,
Re-cover the mash with a towel and let the yeasted mixture sit for a week, stirring 3-4 times a day.,
Siphon the liquid into your carboy, removing as much sediment and pulp as possible.,
Cap the carboy with an airlock and wait until fermentation is complete.,
Rack the wine one more time, moving to a clean carboy and sealing with an airlock.,
Taste the wine, adding a bit of honey to sweeten it if need be.,
Use a ratio of 2:1 when planning the weight of fruit and sugars.,
Keeping the total level below 1 teaspoon per 20lbs of berries, use more wine tannin with fewer strawberries for a drier taste.,
Use 1/16lb of Sodium Bisulfate for each 8lbs of strawberries.,
Add an extra teaspoon of yeast nutrient for each 4lbs of berries, up to 5 teaspoons total.,
Consider trying out a ""wild yeast"" version by ignoring all sterilizers entirely.,
Add other fruits for new flavors without having to adjust the recipe.",How to Make Strawberry Wine," Making wine is the process of fermenting fruit, which is when you use the controlled use of yeast to create alcohol. Doing so, however, requires specialized fermentation equipment. Luckily, most of it is inexpensive and easy to procure at your local kitchen supply store:

2 gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar, sealable
1 gallon (3.8 L) carboy
1 airlock top
1 thin tube for siphoning
Clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps for storage of final product
Campden tablets.;
, The fresher your strawberries and the stronger the taste, the more you can use. While this article will touch on ways to modify, adjust, and personalize your wine recipe later, first time winemakers should focus on this easy 1-gallon recipe first. Rinse the berries in cool water and then cut away all the greenery to prep the fruit.If the strawberries were frozen, completely thaw them before proceeding.

, You don't want to crush them or get them too small just yet, even cutting into halves or quarters will make your life easier later. Try not to push or smash the berries as you cut -- you want as much of the juice as possible, and you'll be crushing the berries later to extract the juices.

This step is not explicitly necessary. However, as you make bigger batches with 15-20 pounds of berries you'll realize that they are much, much easier to crush into a pulp later on when they're cut beforehand., If you're only making a gallon, a large sauce-pot will do. However, remember that you're eventually adding another two pounds of sugar and a gallon of water -- so you'll need plenty of room at the top. Use a potato masher, or even well-cleaned hands, to gently crush the strawberries into a mash. They don't need to be pulverized, just mashed enough to release the juices inside.If you're looking to work professionally, you should invest in a ""primary fermenter,"" a specialty bucket used to prep your fruit for winemaking., The sugar is food for the yeast -- which turns it into alcohol -- so don't worry about the final drink tasting like a sugar cube. Cover the strawberries with water, then add roughly half the amount of sugar as you added berries -- if you used 8lbs of strawberries, you want roughly 4lbs of sugar.

In general, you can sweeten the wine to taste later on in the process. For now, just add the sugar to help your alcohol ferment.
If you have a wine-making hydrometer, you can check the Specific Gravity (S.G.) to get the perfect sugar amount for your desired alcohol content. A good SG to aim for is 1.086., The ingredients above, with the potential exception of the sterilizing tablet, are all optional ingredients used by professionals to make high-quality, easily standardized wines. Use the following amounts for your 1 gallon of wine, adjusting for larger quantities as necessary:Sterilizing Agents: You can use one Campden Tablet or 1/4 teaspoon metabisulfite or sodium bisulfate. Unless you are making wild-yeast wine, you must sterilize the fruit mash.


Pectin Enzyme: Helps extract juices and flavor, and prevent a milky or cloudy final color. Use 1/4-1/2 tsp per final planned gallon of wine, whatever your enzyme bottle calls for.

Wine Tannins: Tannins give a wine that slight pucker, or dryness. Add 1/8-1/4 tsp or so per gallon, depending on taste.

Acid Blend: Used to balance the pH of the wine for better fermentation and flavor. Mostly for serious winemakers, Use a wine-specific titration kit to get your acid level to .60% tartaric., You need air to be able to pass through, but not bugs or dust. A cheesecloth or towel rubber-banded to the top of the bucket will suffice. Check it each day -- you should see bubbles forming regularly. As they die down and form less often, usually around the end of day two, you're ready to move on.

This mixture is called a ""must.""
Many people like to stir this mixture gently once when checking it each day., Both of these can be found online or in many specialty stores/supermarkets. You can experiment with different types of wine yeast to find the flavor you love -- many wine-makers use Champagne yeast, others use specific wine yeasts like Côte de Blanc. Stir everything in well.

Be sure to follow the instructions on the back of the specific yeast for activation. Some yeasts may need to be mixed with warm water before they can be added.

, Stirring keeps the yeast moving, accessing other sugars and promoting air flow. Each day you should notice bubbles, and a yeasty, alcoholic smell growing as they days go by. By the seventh day, this activity will likely slow down, meaning you're ready to move on to the next step., Transfer the mixture to your glass carboys for storage. If you don't have a siphon, you can pour your mixture over a new, clean cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer. If you do use a cloth, keep the pulp in the towel, then run 1/2 a gallon of water through the pulp to get the last bits of juice, sugar, and yeast.Siphoning off the liquid, removing sediment and pulp, is known in wine-making as ""racking.""

, Close off the carboy and set the bottle aside in a dark, room-temperature place. Check every single day -- fermentation is complete when there are no more small bubbles rising their way to the surface.Note that fermentation can cause the liquid level to rise, causing overflow. Place a towel or bucket under your bottles to prevent a mess., This last stage usually takes only 1-2 weeks, and is over when the wine clears up in color and flavor. When siphoning, take care not to get any of the sediment (small, natural particles in the wine) from the bottom, keeping the hose an inch or so above the bottom to avoid sucking it up. It is okay to waste a little wine at the bottom to avoid adding sediments, though it is impossible to miss them all., Once your wine has cleared in its second carboy, you're ready to start drinking! If this is your first bottle, or you simply want to adjust the flavor, you can add some sweeteners now, usually honey.Note, however, that adding sweeteners may change the appearance of the wine unless a stabilizer, like Potassium Sorbate or a filtration system, is used as well. It is not a big deal, but worth noting for burgeoning professionals., This is the first ratio to remember -- you always want roughly half the amount of sugar as strawberries. So, if you have 20lbs of berries, you want roughly 10lbs of sugar. While you might use 9lbs for sweeter strawberries, or 11lbs for tougher ones, you want to hew close to this 2:1 ratio.

Always measure in weight, not cups or liters -- sugar packs tightly without air holes in a measurement cup, strawberries don't.
Purchase a wine-making hydrometer to ensure the correct sugar levels -- anything from an S.G. of 1.06 - 1.09 is generally acceptable. More sugar means more alcohol later.

, Fruit naturally contains tannins, so less is more when using lots of berries. The exact level is not crucial, however, and mostly comes down to taste. As long as you use less than a teaspoon total your wine will be fine., For large batches, dispense with the Campden tablets and use Sodium Bisulfate instead. This sterilizes the wine as you make it, eliminating competing yeasts and bacteria from your mix so the wine yeast can do it's job., If you're making over 25lbs of wine, you'll need to adapt this entire recipe for mass production. Anything less than that should be fine with 1 teaspoon per 4lbs or so, sticking to one full packet of wine yeast the entire time., This uses naturally occurring yeasts in the air and fruit for fermentation. If you do, know you must extend your first fermentation from 1-2 days to one full week., As long as you strawberries are the key fruit, you shouldn't have to adjust the recipe much, other than adding a little more or less sugar depending on your preferences. All of these fruits are added with the strawberries. While any fruit can be used to make wine, some popular additions with strawberries include:

Substitute 1lb of blueberries, apples, cherries, or pears
Add 1-2tb of fresh lemon or orange peel."

Enjoy your wine.",How to Make Rice Wine," Measure out 2 cups (24 ounces) of rice in a measuring cup. Then rinse the rice several times in a large bowl until the water is clear as opposed to murky. Try to use sticky or glutinous rice, which is more authentic and creates a slightly different flavor than regular rice., After rinsing, soak your rice in hot water for about an hour, as sticky rice cooks better after it has been soaked. Then use a strainer or sieve to strain the rice and remove the water., Pour around two cups of water in the bottom of a steamer. Bring the water to a boil. If you don’t have a steamer, you can simply boil water in a medium sized pot.

, After the water begins to boil, place the rice in the top compartment of a steamer and let it steam for around 25 minutes.If you don’t have a steamer, place the sieve of rice above the boiling water, making sure that the rice doesn’t touch the boiling water. Cover the top of the sieve with a pot lid and steam for 25 minutes., After 25 minutes, take off the lid of the steamer and taste the rice. If it is still hard or slightly crunchy, use a spoon to flip the rice over and let it steam more, checking every five minutes or so to see if it’s done. Once the rice has finished steaming, remove it from the heat., After the rice has finished steaming, spoon it out onto a cooking sheet and spread it in a thin layer to help it cool. It’s essential to let the rice cool before beginning the fermentation process, and spreading the rice helps it to lose heat more rapidly., Take the yeast ball and place it in a small bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a large spoon to crush the yeast ball. Break apart the ball until it has become a fine powder., After you have finished crushing the yeast, sprinkle it evenly over the rice. Toss using your hands or a spoon to integrate and combine the yeast with the rice.Make sure that the rice has cooled and is just slightly warmer than room temperature.

, After you have mixed the yeast and the rice, it’s time to start the process of storing and fermenting the rice! Place the rice in an airtight container, or several airtight containers depending on the size of the containers you are using., Do your best to keep the rice warm for a few days. You can keep the container of rice in the oven on low heat (100 degrees F or 37.7 degrees C), or simply place a heating pad around the jar. The heat helps to encourage the process of fermentation., After a few days, you should notice liquid is accumulating at the bottom of the container. This is the rice wine. The wine is ready to drink as soon as it forms, so you can try the wine as soon as you see it accumulating.If you like the taste, pour out the liquid from the container and keep the rice mixture inside. You can use the small amount of wine you made in recipes, or simply drink it by itself.
The taste of the wine changes the longer it ferments. When the wine first appears at the bottom of the container, it will taste fruity and slightly zingy. As you let the wine ferment, it becomes less effervescent and more sweet and smooth., Store the rice in a warm and dry place for around a month. You don’t need to keep it in the oven or in the heating pad past a few days, as long as the weather is warm or you store it in a relatively warm place in your house.


You will notice that the longer you ferment your wine, the clearer and less cloudy it will become.

, After a month, the fermentation process will be complete. Use a piece of cheesecloth or a very fine strainer to strain the wine, and collect the liquid in a jar or container. This will get rid of any excess rice grains or hulls still in your fermentation container.You can drink or use your rice wine as soon as you wish, so if you want to enjoy it as soon as you strain it, you can do so!

, After you have poured the rice wine into a container, seal the top and place it in the refrigerator. Although you can drink rice wine at room temperature, always store it in the fridge, as this will help it to last longer., A few days after you put it in the refrigerator, you should notice that a layer of sediment forms at the bottom of the wine container. It is not necessary to remove this sediment, but some choose to do so to improve the appearance of the wine and make the texture of the liquid more uniform.If you wish, pour the clarified wine out of the container and leave the sediment on the bottom behind. Then pour the sediment down the sink and pour the clarified wine back into the container.

, Use your wine in cooking, drink it by itself, or keep it in the fridge to alter and mature the flavor! Don’t worry if you see the wine becoming darker the longer you age it; this is perfectly normal. Use the wine in savory dishes, desserts, or enjoy a glassful for a delicious departure from the usual grape-based wine."

Plan in advance.,
Assign a designated driver.,
Leave your car at home.,
Leave the venue with your designated driver.",How to Avoid Drinking and Driving1," Designating a driver is a very popular tactic to avoid drinking and driving.It is important to plan in advance, because your brain function will slow down and your decision making skills will be impaired once you start drinking.Decide before you begin drinking that you will not drive. Figure out who will be getting you home before you leave.;
, Make sure this person is responsible and keep them in your sight while you are drinking. Have their contact information handy in case you can’t find them when you are ready to leave.


Choose a friend who doesn’t drink alcohol. You likely have someone in your friend group who doesn’t drink. This person is the most likely to remain sober.
Decide on one person who will remain sober. You can take turns within your friend group, alternating who will be the designated driver on each occasion. Be sure that the designated driver actually remains sober. The person who has drank the least is still not sober.

, If you don’t have your car with you, you can guarantee that you won’t make the choice to drive it home.


If you are drinking at your home. Give your keys to a responsible friend to ensure that you don't choose to drive somewhere after you have been drinking.

, It may be tempting to stay longer or leave with someone else. Stick to the plan you made in advance and only leave with your sober, designated driver.


Keep the phone number of your driver handy in case you can't find them when you are ready to leave.
If your designated driver drinks alcohol, find alternate transportation to get home.

"
"
Walk to the venue where you will be drinking if it is close enough.,
Take public transit.,
Show up in style by hiring a limo or black car service.,
Flag a taxi cab for a convenient option to get where you’re going.,
Request a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft using an app on your phone.You can share a ride with your friends, or other people using the app at the same moment.,
Reserve a designated driver service.",How to Avoid Drinking and Driving2," make sure that the area is a safe place, especially if you plan on walking home at night. It’s always a good idea to practice the buddy system. Have a friend meet up and walk with you.

, Research the bus, train, or streetcar routes available in your area to find safe and affordable travel to your destination.


Make sure you check the schedule for your outgoing and return travel. Some public transportation will cease to run late at night. Be sure if you take public transportation to the venue that you will also be able to get home late at night.
Check the routes. Even if some public transit is still running late at night, the routing may change. Some may run express past many of the stops, or not travel all the way to the ends. Be sure that your stop will still be available when you need it for your return trip.
If you are taking public transit in a vulnerable state after drinking, it is always a good idea to travel in groups. Having friends available is a good way to stay safe and make sure that you reach your destination.

, This is more expensive option than a taxi or ride share service, but could be a fun and fancy way to stay safe and ensure that you will have a ride home.


Plan this service in advance with a scheduled time to pick you up from your home and the venue. You want to be sure that the service will still be available when you need to get home.

, This may be easy in a large city, but taxis may be less frequent in smaller towns. This is especially true late at night, so this is a less reliable option than scheduling a ride in advance.


Have a friend accompany you and help you flag a cab to make sure you are able to get one.
Set up a plan to call a friend when you get home to make sure that you made it safely to your destination.
If there are no taxis readily available call a local service to send a car to pick you up.

,


If you are in a vulnerable state it is best to share the ride with your friends to make sure you get home safe.
You can request the car to yourself rather than sharing rides with strangers.
If you travel home on your own or are the last of your group to be dropped off, make plans to call a friend when you get home so they know you made it safely to your destination.

, There may be a designated driver service in your area which can chauffeur your group.Make reservations with them in advance and keep their contact information handy while you are drinking.

Pay attention to your body.,
Give up your keys.,
Listen to other people.,
Accept help.,
Stay where you are.,
Have an emergency back-up plan.,
Make sure that your phone is charged.",How to Avoid Drinking and Driving3," If you have been drinking at all you are at least on the spectrum of drunkenness. You could be showing signs of impairment and slower brain function including lack of motor skills and slower reaction time,leading to the inability to operate a motor vehicle.Some of these signs could be:


Poor balance or stumbling.Difficulty speaking clearly and slurred words.Abnormal behavior leading to you doing things you wouldn’t normally do if you were sober., As soon as you notice that you are showing signs of impairment, give your keys to a friend, the host or the bartender to ensure that you won’t drive until you are sober. Make sure to only give them your car key. Hold onto your house keys.

, If your friend, the host or the bartender are advising you not to drive, you are likely too drunk. Listen to their advice and acknowledge that they are trying to help you.

, Bystander intervention is common when it comes to drinking and driving.Many people will be willing to step in, take your keys and help you get home safely. If no one if offering to help, you may need to ask.


Take a ride from a sober friend. It is best to get in a car with someone you trust when you are in this vulnerable state.
Allow the host or bartender to call a cab or car service to take you home.

, If you are having a difficult time finding a safe way to get home, find a place to stay which does not involve you driving.


Ask the host of the party if there is a place you can sleep. Give them your keys and ask that they keep them in a safe place until the morning.
Stay with a friend if they live nearby and are on their way home.
Find a hotel within walking distance. Call them to book a room, or have a friend help you secure one. Ask the friend if they will walk you to the hotel and make sure you get checked in safely.

, There are people in your life who care about you and want to be sure that you are safe. It may seem scary or embarrassing to call your parents or your siblings if you are too drunk to drive, but they will be glad you did. Your safety is the most important.

, You may need your phone to call someone for a ride or get help from a friend. Be sure to charge your phone before you leave the house.


It is also a good idea to bring a charger with you in case your battery dies before the end of the night or you end up staying where you are and need to get home the next morning.
You may also want to invest in a portable battery charger for your phone should there not be a power outlet available.Make sure it is fully charged before you leave your house. Keep it handy in your pocket or your bag throughout the night.

Keep bottles and cans sealed.,
Drink from unmarked containers.,
Stay within established boundaries.,
Don't engage in dangerous or disruptive behavior.,
Learn local rules.",How to Avoid Open Container Law Violations1," In places where open consumption of alcohol is not permitted, containers of alcohol should be kept sealed. If previously opened, the top should be replaced and sealed.In some states, you are allowed to take home an unfinished bottle of wine or liquor that you purchased at a restaurant or bar. The establishment will re-cork and seal the bottle before you leave.
The seal that covers the bottle typically changes color or otherwise indicates if the seal has been removed or tampered with.
If you're taking a bottle home from someone else's house, make sure it's sealed tightly and put the bottle itself inside a bag – don't just carry the bottle down the street.;
, Some cities allow people to drink alcoholic beverages in public, but your drink must be in a plain plastic cup. You also may be able to drink beer out of a can, but glass bottles are prohibited for safety reasons.You typically can figure out what types of containers are allowed by observing people around you. For example, if you see people in the streets all drinking out of red plastic cups, you can deduce that you need a red plastic cup to drink alcohol.
If you're on a beach or in a park, keep in mind that glass bottles of any sort typically aren't permitted. This has nothing to do with alcohol specifically, but is designed to avoid broken glass that could injure people and wildlife.
If you're unsure about the open container laws in a particular location, the safest way to avoid an open container citation is to not drink alcoholic beverages.
However, if for some reason you do have an alcoholic beverage, drinking it from an unmarked cup or bottle can avoid unnecessary attention to whatever you're drinking.

, Drinking may be permitted only in specific zones, but prohibited elsewhere. Typically there will be signs or visible barriers that mark specifically where you can carry an open container of alcohol in public.For example, the city may not permit people to drink on public sidewalks. However, you may be allowed to drink alcoholic beverages if you are a patron of a sidewalk café or bar – provided you stay within the established boundaries for the establishment's sidewalk seating area.
Another situation in which this restriction may occur is if you're attending a block party or street festival.
Drinking may be allowed on the street in the areas blocked off for the party or festival, but you risk an open container citation if you take your drink and walk to another section of town.

, Regardless of whether open containers are permitted where you are, other state and local laws are still enforced. If you and your friends are acting disorderly, that's a sure way to draw attention to yourselves and risk open container or other citations.This is particularly important if you're in an area where you're unsure about the public consumption laws.
If you're walking down the sidewalk in an orderly fashion, obeying all laws, you're unlikely to get stopped for drinking from a plain cup or water bottle.
Keep in mind that in areas where open consumption of alcohol is permitted, police officers may be more strict about enforcing other laws designed to ensure public health and safety.

, Open container laws vary widely among states, as well as within individual cities. If you're in an unfamiliar area and want to avoid open container law violations, ask someone what the rules are there.The easiest thing to do is find a uniformed police officer and ask them. However, if you're nervous or intimidated about speaking to police officers, you can ask someone else in a position of authority.
For example, if you're on a beach, ask a lifeguard. They typically know the public consumption rules for the beach where they work.
You also can ask vendors, people who work in restaurants, or clerks in stores that sell beer or other alcoholic beverages.

Don't drink and drive.,
Store open containers in the trunk.,
Throw away empty cans or bottles promptly.,
Follow the rules of the road.",How to Avoid Open Container Law Violations2," Driving under the influence is illegal in all 50 states. Even if you haven't consumed enough alcohol to be considered legally intoxicated, drinking alcohol while driving is a dangerous act you should never attempt.In addition, drinking alcoholic beverages while driving is illegal in all states but Mississippi. Even if you aren't legally intoxicated, you still can be charged with an open container law violation.
Mississippi does not have any laws against anyone drinking alcoholic beverages in a car. However, if you are driving you still cannot drink to the point of legal intoxication (or beyond).
If you get pulled over with an open container of alcohol in your car, the officer must connect it to you as the driver.
This means even if your passenger has a can of beer, if she put it in the cup holder where you can easily reach it while driving, you can be charged with the violation.

, If you have previously opened containers of alcohol that you need to transport from one place to another, close them tightly and keep them locked away in a part of your car or truck that you cannot access while driving.Keep in mind that in some states it's illegal to have an open container in the car at all. Even if the open container happens to be in the hand of a backseat passenger, you can still get charged with a violation as the driver for allowing the open container in your car.
There are occasions in which you're merely transporting unfinished bottles from one place to another, and generally speaking this isn't illegal.
However, these bottles must be closed tightly and placed in an area where neither you or any passengers can access the alcohol while the car is in motion. In most states, this means putting the bottles in the trunk.
In some states, you may be able to get away with keeping small opened bottles in a locked glove compartment or other locked storage box inside the passenger compartment of your vehicle.

, The floorboard of your car is not a trash can. If you're pulled over and have empty cans or bottles in your car, you can get a citation for violating the open container law. This is true even if the alcohol was consumed a long time ago or by someone else.If you have an empty bottle that you want to keep for souvenir or sentimental reasons, rinse it out completely before you put it in your car. Put the rinsed bottle in a bag and fold over or close up the top of the bag.
Generally, you can be cited for a violation of an open container law if there is any amount of alcohol in the bottle – even a drop.
If you have to drive empty alcohol containers to a dumpster or recycling facility, put them in a closed bag and put the bag in the trunk.

, The simplest way to avoid open container law violations when driving is not to draw attention to your car in the first place. This means obeying the speed limit and all other traffic laws. Don't give a police officer a reason to pull you over.Keep in mind that if an officer pulls you over for some other reason and observes open containers in your vehicle, they have the ability to cite you for an open container violation as well.
Unless you know specifically that passengers in moving vehicles are permitted to drink alcohol where you're driving, don't let your passengers drink.
When in doubt, keep all alcohol bottles in a closed bag in the trunk of your car.

Pour your drink into an unmarked container.,
Fasten your seat belt.,
Don't distract the driver.,
Keep open containers between your feet.",How to Avoid Open Container Law Violations3," Some states allow passengers in a vehicle to have open containers of alcohol. However, you'll typically draw less attention to yourself if you're drinking out of a plain glass or plastic cup.Keep in mind that drinking from a plastic cup is no guarantee that you won't get cited for an open container violation if the car gets pulled over.
If you're riding in a car in an area where open containers in vehicles are prohibited, You can be cited for violating this law – even if you weren't aware of the law.
However, if you're just bringing along a drink you started at a bar or party, a plastic cup is less suspicious and less likely to draw questions than if you're drinking from a beer can.

, Particularly if you're driving on city streets or through an entertainment district, police officers will often observe traffic and pull over cars where people are not wearing their seat belts. In addition to a ticket for riding without a seat belt, you may end up with an open container violation if you're also drinking.Even if you're not drinking out of the open container you have, you can still get cited for an open container violation if a police officer pulls the car over because you aren't wearing your seat belt and sees the open container in the car.
In some states, the driver also can be charged with a violation of the open container law – even if you had the open container with you in the backseat.
In these states, the driver of the car has the responsibility not to allow passengers to bring open containers inside the vehicle with them.

, The driver is trying to obey traffic laws and avoid getting stopped. Distracting the driver or engaging in horseplay with other passengers can cause the driver to swerve, endangering other cars on the road.This is something you should avoid doing at any time, regardless of whether there are open containers in the car.
However, this also is a way to avoid open container law violations. Basically, allow the driver to concentrate on driving, and don't do anything that would draw attention to the car or cause danger to others on the road.
If a police officer sees the driver operating the vehicle erratically, stopping abruptly, or swerving, they may pull the car over, which would mean they'd see the open containers.

, Ideally, passengers in a car who have open containers of alcohol should cover them to avoid spills and keep them in the floor while the car is moving, rather than drinking while the car is in motion.There's no legitimate reason why you need to drink an alcoholic beverage while you're riding in a car. However, you may have legitimate reasons to transport an open bottle.
For example, you may be getting a ride home from a party. Before you left, the host gave you the remainder of a bottle of wine.
Make sure the cork is tight in the bottle, and put the bottle in a paper or plastic bag if possible.
Ideally, you want to put the bottle in the trunk – but if your friend is just dropping you off, this may not be an option.
While the car is in motion, keep the bottle in the floorboard rather than holding it in your hands.

Consider “hair of the dog” only as a last resort.,
Remember how your hangover feels.,
Plan ahead for next time.,
Don’t be afraid to seek help.",How to Deal With a Hangover the Day After," Whether this can truly shorten or lessen a hangover or not, it is a fact that alcohol consumption does contribute to fluid loss and that re-hydrating is essential to getting your body back into balance.Drink lots of water the day after a night of drinking. Try carrying a refillable bottle around with you. It’s a good habit to get into even when you’re not hungover.
Sports drinks are also a good choice because they provide electrolytes and sodium, which are at less-than-optimal levels during dehydration.
Your blood sugar level can also be lowered by dehydration due to alcohol consumption, so also consider fruit juices, which provide ample amounts of fructose.;
, There are plenty of supposed one-pill hangover cures out there, but none of them have rigorous scientific evidence of efficacy. It is wiser to stick with tried-and-true medications.Painkillers can be helpful if you have body aches or a throbbing headache, but take precautions with the most typical choices.


Aspirin-based painkillers, along with those containing ibuprofen, may irritate an already-irritated stomach, so use them in moderation.
Painkillers containing acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol), such as Tylenol, must also be taken with care. They can be hard on your liver, which is already in a weakened state while trying to clear the alcohol toxins from your body. Talk to your physician if you regularly consume alcohol or have existing liver issues.
Antacids may be helpful with a hangover-induced upset stomach, and multivitamins can help replenish your levels of key vitamins and nutrients.

, Some people insist that a big, greasy breakfast, or lots of carbs that will “soak up” the alcohol in your body, are the key to curing a hangover. In reality, though, replenishing diminished nutrient levels should be your main goal.Thin, broth-based soups provide nutrients and sodium while being easy on the stomach.
Bland foods like toast and crackers can also be a good choice if your stomach is upset, and they can help raise your blood sugar level as well.
Potassium is a key nutrient that is lost with dehydration, so choosing foods rich in it — bananas being the most well-known, but also potatoes, leafy greens, and others — can help restore your level.
The bacon and sausage of the big, greasy breakfast that some swear by are more likely to further upset your stomach. The eggs, however, are full of protein and nutrients and may be of benefit.

, Take these remedies, and any others you come across, with a grain of salt, however. The truth is that there is little scientific evidence that anything other than time — that is, waiting for it to pass — is truly effective in treating a hangover., Giving your body a sufficient period of rest in which to clear the body of toxins, restore hydration and nutrient levels, and alleviate discomfort is the most sensible way to deal with a hangover the day after.Keep in mind that hangovers can last for up to 72 hours; basically, the more you play, the more you'll pay.
You probably don’t have the luxury of dedicating a whole day (or more) to resting through a hangover, but even short periods of rest or “power naps” can benefit your healing process., If you’ve experienced a hangover before, the common symptoms will be all too familiar. These can include headache, sluggishness, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and sensitivity to light, sound, and motion, among others.


Keep in mind, however, that you are also likely to experience a decrease in your coordination, memory, reaction time, visual and spatial recognition, and attention span as well.So, you might be able to go into work with a hangover, but don’t expect to function at peak performance. Also, take care driving and doing delicate or hazardous tasks.

, Taking deep breaths of clean air is never a bad idea, and can only help in your body’s recuperation. If it’s a beautiful sunny day, grab some dark glasses to ward off any light sensitivity and let your sour hangover mood be enhanced by the great outdoors.


Light exercise, like taking a walk, can raise your metabolism and help the “flushing out” process. Remember that you’re still at least slightly dehydrated, though, so keep drinking water and don’t over-exert yourself.Carry a water bottle with you throughout the day to keep hydrating.

, Monday is a common “hangover day,” which means heading into work for many, raging headache and sour stomach or not.


If you have some flexibility, this would be a good day to go in a little later than usual. Any additional rest you can take will help your body recharge and repair.For that matter, if you can manage a “power nap” or two at work — without finding a termination notice stuck to your sleeve when you wake up — that can help as well.
You’re not going to earn that promotion today, but pushing through your daily routine (with sensibly lowered expectations) might help you deal with your hangover.

, Whether you’re struggling through a day at work or battling your hangover at home, finding engaging tasks that keep you busy can help take your mind off your discomfort.Tasks around home like cleaning might be a welcome distraction to pass the time, but unless you really enjoy vacuuming, you may want to find tasks that both keep you busy and interested, perhaps like doing puzzles or gardening.
If you have options at your job — preparing a presentation versus completing a stack of HR forms, for instance — try to choose what will energize your mind and body.
Try to avoid making key decisions, however; remember that you mind is not at 100%.

, Some believe the best way to cure a hangover is to start drinking again. All you’re doing is delaying (and intensifying) the inevitable pain, but if you need to feel a bit better soon and for a short while, maybe — just maybe — consider this.


By the way, the phrase “hair of the dog” comes from an old belief that covering a wound with hairs from the dog that bit you would ward off rabies. In both cases, you are using what hurt you to cure you.Also, each cure is about equally effective (meaning it's not really effective).
Keep in mind, however, that a strong urge to drink again after a binge the previous night may be a sign of a drinking problem., If you had a great time on Saturday, and suffered the consequences on Sunday, perhaps Monday is the day to do a more rational analysis of whether you want to undertake the overindulgence-to-hangover cycle again next weekend.


Would your night out have been significantly less enjoyable if you had consumed alcohol in moderation? Give it a try next time and see — and compare how you feel the day after as well.
A hangover is, like a stomach-ache after eating too much or sore muscles after over-exertion, your body’s way of signaling that you have overdone it. Think about whether you and your body would be better served by moderation.

, If you are heading back out there next weekend, there are some strategies you can employ, other than just avoiding or limiting alcohol intake, to possibly limit the severity of your next hangover.


Eat food and drink water. This has less to do with absorbing or diluting the alcohol content in your body, as some may assume, and more about simply filling up space with something other than alcohol. By eating and drinking a glass of water between each round of alcohol, you are likely to markedly decrease the amount of alcohol you consume.Try to drink a glass of water before crashing into bed as well, to help deal with dehydration.
Consider changing what you drink as well as how much you drink. Your body may react differently to the different compounds in various alcoholic beverages, for reasons such as a food intolerance. See if it helps to switch up your drinks of choice.But remember, alcohol is alcohol, whatever the type or brand, and your body has to work to get rid of it.

, If don’t feel able to moderate your drinking to prevent your next hangover, or if your frequent hangovers are affecting your job or your social relationships, know that there are a multitude of organizations, people, and programs that can and will help you deal with your problems with alcohol.

Determine your current alcohol tolerance.,
Gradually consume more alcohol in a safe and responsible way.,
Stay within sensible drinking guidelines.,
Know when to stop.,
Have alcohol-free days every week.,
Know the dangers of alcohol consumption.",How to Improve Your Alcohol Tolerance1," Although there is a relationship between alcohol tolerance and dependence, they are not the same thing. A person can increase their alcohol tolerance without becoming dependent, though having too high an alcohol tolerance likely means you are also dependent.Tolerance means that your body adapts to the consumption of a specific amount of alcohol, even in amounts such as one beer or one glass of wine.Dependence means that you consistently and compulsively consume alcohol and need it to function, a dangerous state you want to avoid.If your alcohol tolerance becomes too high, it's likely a sign that you're dependent, which can be dangerous not only for you, but also the people around you.;
, Not all alcoholic drinks are equal in alcohol strength, and even the type of drink may be handled differently by different individuals.


In general, the smaller the typical serving size, the stronger the drink. A shot of whiskey can have as much alcohol as an entire light beer.
In many countries, the alcohol content is labelled on the container. The higher the content, the higher the effect.
Sweet fruity drinks and/or cocktails can be very difficult to judge on alcoholic content--especially for a novice. Since these can vary widely based on the bartender, there is no one standard.
Not all types of drinks are standardized. A typical lager-style beer is usually about 5% alcohol, but some craft beers are 20% or more.
Different drinks may produce different effects. Be aware that while inebriation has common effects, different types of drinks may cause slightly different effects. For example, a person may be much more mellow drinking wine than after having tequila.

, Before you start to increase your consumption, estimate what your current tolerance is. This will help you figure out the safest way to consume more alcohol.


Have one drink, then perhaps another in a safe environment with responsible drinkers. Do not put yourself in a situation where impairment is inherently dangerous, or with people who are irresponsible and are likely to push you past your comfort zone.
If you do not normally consume alcohol, or have one or two drinks once a week, your tolerance will be comparatively low. If you consume two drinks five days a week, your tolerance will be accordingly higher.

, The easiest way to increase your tolerance for alcohol is to drink more of it. You’ll want to do this without harming yourself- or anyone else. It is important to realize that alcohol consumption is never risk-free and that while you may not feel the effects of alcohol consumption, you may nevertheless be too impaired to function normally.


Go slowly. For example, consume only one additional drink than you normally would. If you never drink, start with one, or even a half of, alcoholic beverage. If you usually have one glass of wine or one spirit, have one and a half or two drinks. This will ensure that you do not consume too much alcohol as you increase your tolerance.
Consider having one glass of water in between drinks to help yourself consume drinks slowly.
Eat while drinking. Consuming food while drinking helps keep the alcohol from having quite as strong an effect. Drinking on an empty stomach will cause much more inebriation than on a full one.

, Remember, you are increasing your tolerance and avoiding dependence. By consuming alcohol within sensible guidelines, you will run less risk of becoming dependent or harming yourself.


Remember that your judgement will be impaired on alcohol--you can be drunk and not think you are. For this reason, it is often good to have a friend to keep tabs on your drinking, and help you to stay within the sensible guidelines for drinking.
Alcohol units are based on the percentage alcohol in a beverage and the amount of alcohol consumed. One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol.Since most alcohol beverages are not pure alcohol, the percentage of alcohol in the drink is a factor in the number of units.For reference, a bottle of wine has 9-10 units.
For example, one pint of beer with a 4% alcohol volume 2.3 units.If you prefer spirits, such as scotch, a ""single"" scotch of 25ml has one unit.Or maybe you prefer wine, in which case, one 175ml glass has 2.3 units.The guidelines for sensible drinking recommend no more than 2-3 units of alcohol a day for women. This would be the equivalent of approximately one beer or glass of wine per day, or two to three single spirits.The guidelines for sensible drinking recommend no more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day for men. This would be the equivalent of approximately 1-2 beers or glasses of wine, or 3-4 spirits per day., As your alcohol tolerance increases, it may be difficult to figure out when you’ve had too much to drink. Making sure you know how much you’ve consumed will help you avoid getting drunk, alcohol poisoning, or possibly worse.

, It’s a good idea to have at least two alcohol free days per week. This will keep you from becoming dependent on alcohol and help your body recover from previous consumption.


If you find that you can’t go a day without alcohol consumption, this is a sign that you are dependent.If this is the case, seek professional help.

, Any time you consume an alcoholic beverage, you run the risk of harming your body. The only risk-free alcohol consumption is not drinking at all, and the more you drink, the greater your risk.Tolerance will not protect you from the dangers of alcohol.
In the short term, alcohol consumption can cause the following health problems: weight gain, depression, skin problems, and memory loss.
In the long term, alcohol consumption can cause the following health problems: high blood pressure, chronic liver disease, and breast cancer.

Understand how different bodily factors affect tolerance.,
Control manageable factors of alcohol tolerance.,
Gain weight.,
Have a meal.,
Make sure you’re hydrated.,
Make sure you’re rested and healthy.,
Remember to follow the sensible guidelines for alcohol consumption.",How to Improve Your Alcohol Tolerance2," How a person tolerates alcohol is affected by several factors, some of which are manageable. Your gender, body type, weight, use of medication, food consumption, and fatigue are just a few examples of elements that influence your alcohol tolerance.Woman, who generally have more body fat and less water percentage in their blood, have a lower tolerance level than men. This is because they do not have as much water to dilute the alcohol in their blood., While you cannot control elements like your gender, if you want to increase your alcohol tolerance, controlling manageable factors such as weight, fatigue, hydration, and food consumption can help increase your tolerance., One simple way to increase your tolerance is by gaining weight. The more fat a body contains, the more quickly it can absorb alcohol, making your level of tolerance higher.If you want to gain weight, remember to do so safely. Adding even 10 pounds to your weight will help increase your alcohol tolerance. But remember that just as alcohol consumption comes with risk factors, so does increased weight. In conjunction, for example, they can lead to high blood pressure.

, If you have food in your stomach, alcohol will absorb less quickly, making the effects of alcohol less noticeable. Likewise, having nothing in your stomach will lower your tolerance. The size of the meal you have matters. For example, if you consume a larger meal, it will slow the absorption of alcohol into your blood, making your tolerance temporarily increase.The amount of time between food and alcohol consumption also affects your tolerance. For example, if you consume a large meal either just before or during alcohol consumption, your tolerance will be greater. If you have a smaller meal and wait to drink, your tolerance will be correspondingly lower.Remember that food only delays the absorption of alcohol into your system. You won’t necessarily be able to consume much more alcohol than you usually do, so it’s best to err on the side of caution and not go overboard., Consuming alcoholic beverages when you’re dehydrated leads to decreased tolerance because there is less water in your blood to dilute the alcohol.For example, before you consume an alcoholic beverage, consider having a glass of water to make sure you are somewhat hydrated.
Consider having a glass of water in between each drink. This will help you stay hydrated and ensure that you do not consume more than the sensible guidelines suggest.

, If you’re fatigued and/ or ill, your body is less efficient at processing and eliminating alcohol.If you haven’t been sleeping or are fatigued from stress at work, consider having an alcohol free day. This will help your body recover and ensure you don’t consume too much alcohol.
If you are ill and taking medications, know that they can interact with alcohol by increasing the effects of alcohol.If you are sick, consider having an alcohol free day. This will help your body recover, and ensure that you do not consume too much alcohol or experience any negative reactions from combining medication with alcohol.

, Even if you decide to increase your tolerance through controlling manageable factors such as weight, fatigue, illness, and food consumption, you still need to follow the sensible guidelines for alcohol consumption.


Doing so will help ensure that you do not harm yourself, including becoming dependent on alcohol.

If you're out on your own and have no one looking out for you, you can get in all kinds of trouble without anyone even knowing something's wrong. Whether you're heading to a party or out to the bars, always make sure to drink with a group of people you like and trust.


Don't drink with people who encourage binge drinking or look down on you for not drinking, or for not ""keeping up"" and drinking a lot. You should be comfortable to drink at your own pace.
Don't go out with people who have a reputation for running off to hook up with someone they meet at a bar or just disappearing in the middle of the night. Make sure you go with people you can rely on.;
, When you go out with friends, at least one of them should be a person who knows her own limit, or even who doesn't drink very much, and will be willing to watch out for you and to tell you when it looks like you've had enough. Sometimes, you could be drinking way over your limit while being too stubborn to admit it, and this friend can let you know when it's time to switch to water.


This friend can tell you when you've had enough, keep you from driving, and be prepared to take you home if you're having a rough night.
Don't abuse the ""buddy system"" -- if you're always that girl, no one will want to go out with you. You should be able to look out for your friend while she looks out for you.

, Before all else, know yourself and your own limits. It doesn't take long to learn how little or how much alcohol you can tolerate and every body is unique in its ability to tolerate alcohol. Listen to your body and respond in a way that nurtures it rather than abuses it. The first time you drink, you should drink with close friends in the comfort of your own home or their homes, so that you don't get socially overwhelmed. This will help you get a sense of what you can and can not handle.


You can set your limits very concretely. Your limits could be ""four glasses of wine in six hours,"" ""four beers a night,"" or ""two mixed drinks a night"" (depending on what's in them). Tell yourself what your limits are before you leave so that you're more likely to stick to them throughout the night.
If it's your first time out drinking, it's important to adopt a steady and slow pace, so that you can come to learn your alcohol tolerance.

, If you're going out with friends, you should know exactly how you're getting home the night before. There are a few options: the easiest is to have a designated driver before you go out, so you have a person who will forgo alcohol that night and gets you home safely. You can also get home by taking a bus or other forms of public transportation or just call a cab or walk if you're close enough to the bar. Any of these plans are fine.


What you should not do is drive to the bar and hope that one of your friends can drive you home, or let someone who you know will drink a lot drive you there, hoping that someone else can take over the car later.
If you don't drive or have access to a car, regardless of the circumstance, never get into a car driven by someone else who has had too much to drink.
Never get into a car with a stranger if you're intoxicated. Alcohol affects your senses and judgment. Get his or her number and wait until you are sober before you decide to pursue him or her further.






Even if you're desperate to get home, it's better to pay for a cab or call a trusted friend to pick you up than to get in the car with someone who is drunk or a stranger just because it's more convenient.

Never drive drunk. Don't drive if you're even tipsy. Just one drink per hour can put you over the legal limit for driving. Even if you think you ""feel fine,"" your BAC may indicate otherwise.







, If you're in the United States, that means 21, and if you're in other parts of the world, that age can typically range from 16-18. Don't go out with a fake ID or drink on a college campus if you're under 21, unless you're prepared to deal with the legal repercussions. If you're breaking the law, you're not being responsible.

, Alcohol is a depressant, so if you're already feeling angry, upset, or just unstable, it is very likely to make you feel worse. Though you may think that drinking will make you have the time of your life and forget all of your problems, it'll actually make you feel much worse. You may feel an initial buzz and relief after your first drink or two, but you'll drink yourself into a much worse mood than you started with.


You should make a rule of only drinking when you're happy, not when you want to cope with your sadness.
Don't ever use drinking as a way to deal with your problems. You'll have to be sober to do that.
Don't go out and drink with someone you're mad at. The alcohol will make your anger come out, and you'll be much better off if you settle your conflicts when you're in a lucid frame of mind.

, You will feel the effects of alcohol a lot faster if you drink on an empty stomach and increase the likelihood of feeling sick. Most food is better than none at all, but you should try to eat a more hearty meal that is rich in carbs and proteins that can help you absorb the alcohol, instead of just eating some fruit or a salad. Having a meal before you go out will make you much less likely to drink over your limit very quickly.


If you've arrived at a bar and realize you haven't eaten, order some food and have a quick bite to eat before you start drinking. Don't worry if this is a bit inconvenient or if it keeps you from drinking for a little while. It'll be worth it.

, If you're on a prescription medication, check with your doctor to make sure that you can drink alcohol on the same day when you took it. It varies by medication, so make sure that you know if your prescription will have any negative interactions with alcohol before you start drinking., If you're running on two or three hours of sleep, you'll be much better off hitting the hay than hitting up a bar. Alcohol will affect you much more intensely if you're already feeling woozy, tired, and not in control of your own mind and body because you're exhausted.


You may have stayed up studying for an exam the night before and could be dying for a celebratory drink with your friends, but you should hold off for another night until you feel well-rested.
Don't think that having a super dose of caffeine by chugging three cups of coffee or downing an energy drink will make things better. In fact, mixing a lot of caffeine and alcohol will make you feel even worse and more likely to crash.







, Alcohol dehydrates and draws vitamins and minerals out of your body. Drink water, soda or water with added vitamins to restore your lost vitamins.


Drinking a one to one ratio of non-alcoholic to alcoholic beverages is a good policy – that's one serving of water for every serving of alcohol. It's always preferable to have a greater ratio of non-alcohol to alcohol.

, While it's good to try something out for the first time, like a ""Sex On The Beach"" or a beer you've never had before, be aware of its alcohol content before stocking up on more than one. You may not always be able to detect the strength of the alcohol in your drink owing to sweeteners, milk or cream or other fillers that cover the alcohol. Moreover, your own personal reaction to an unfamiliar drink may be faster inebriation than with your usual drinks.


Some contents of mixed drinks can bring up your Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) more quickly than others, depending on your weight. Alcohol tolerance, like many believe, will not result in a lower BAC compared to a person who doesn't have tolerance built up.
It's true that beers are a safer choice than a mixed drink, but you should know the alcohol content of the beer you're drinking. Though many have an alcohol content of 4-5%, some beers can have an alcohol content of 8-9% or more, which can make a big difference.

, If you want to drink responsibly, then you should have no more than one drink per hour. ""One drink"" means one 12 oz. beer, one 5 oz. a glass of wine, or one 1.5 oz. shot of 40% alcohol per hour. It may be tough to stick to this limit when your friends are drinking much more, but this is the way to be safe. Sipping on a beer or nursing a glass of wine will take longer than taking a shot and is recommended because the alcohol won't hit you all at once.People often have more than one drink per hour just because they have nothing to do with their hands and start fidgeting or feeling nervous when they're not holding a drink. If this is the case with you, just hold onto a water or a club soda in between drinks so there's always something in your hands.

, It's important to keep a steady pace when you're drinking. It can take time for alcohol to take its effect. You might feel okay for another shot after a couple of minutes, but keep in mind that you probably haven't felt its effects just yet. Nibble on some food or drink some water in the meantime, to allow the alcohol to diffuse through your body.

, Though drinking games like bullshit, kings, beer pong, and flip-cup may be a great way to pass time at a party and make some friends you'll never remember, these games encourage extreme binge drinking and are guaranteed to make you forget where you are in just a few minutes.


You can also play these games by discreetly pouring out the alcohol you ""should"" drink, or passing it on to a friend who hasn't had a lot to drink.

, If you're at a house party, get acquainted with the people who own the house and its facilities. Know where the bathroom is. Find a secluded place and choose to keep your shoes or coat there (but never your purse or wallet). If you find that you are losing control, quickly make an excuse (""I left my phone in my coat pocket!"") and go to that secluded place to calm down and/or to dump drinks. If you need to get home, find the house owners and ask them to call a taxi or to arrange for a sober person to take you home.


If you're in a public place, make note of all of the exits upon your arrival. You should do this instinctively in case of an emergency such as a fire outbreak so that you know in advance the closest point of exit. It is also helpful to know where the nearest cab rank or public transportation stop is located to the place you're at. Don't make things harder for yourself; always have an exit strategy.
Make sure you know how to get home by heart. If you get drunk to the point of losing your memory, your self-preservation will be as impaired as your inhibitions and you may become easily lost. If you don't know how to get home, you probably shouldn't go out drinking.

, Always remember that you're drinking to enjoy and have fun, not to show off. The whole point of drinking is to enjoy the drink, enjoy the company and feel free. You don't need to ""keep up,"" or engage in stupid competitions that could ruin the night and even friendships. If you're hanging out with people who encourage you to drink more even though you don't want to, then you're hanging out with the wrong people.


If you really want people to stop bugging you about why you're not drinking more, hold a club soda or Coke in your hands and put a lime in it so people will think you're driving and will leave you alone. This is a good short-term solution; the long-term solution is to stay away from people who put unwanted pressure on you.

, Symptoms of intoxication include feeling a loss of control over your thoughts, blurry vision, slurred speech, and difficulty with maintaining your balance.

, While this is generally a given, it's important that you don't attempt to drink any more alcohol, even if you feel ""better"" once you've thrown up. Vomiting is a signal that your body can't take the amount of alcohol that you have consumed and the rejection is your body's last line of defense coming into play. At this stage, you have truly overdone it and it's now time to care about your health rather than your partying.


If you feel the urge to vomit, then you should go to a bathroom and do it. Vomiting is a way for your body to release the excess of alcohol that doesn't belong in your system. You shouldn't force yourself to vomit, but you shouldn't hold it in, either.

, Whether you've thrown up, feel like you might throw up, or just feel terrible, you should lie down on your side to prevent yourself from choking on your vomit if you're lying on your back. Keep a bucket by your mouth and be prepared to throw up if it's necessary. If you find yourself in this unpleasant state, don't go home by yourself -- have a trusted friend stay the night so she can watch over you when you need help.


If you are feeling sick, experiencing headaches or anything feels wrong, tell someone. A responsible person needs to keep a watch over you in case you've developed alcohol poisoning and need medical intervention quickly.
If you see someone else who is really sick lying down, make sure to turn that person over on his or her side, too.

, Though you may think that alcohol may give you some liquid courage to finally talk to, or to hook up with your crush, it can actually impair your decision-making process and can lead you to do something you'll deeply regret later. You can flirt a little, get a guy or girl's number, and check back in when you're sober, but you should avoid going home with anyone you just met, or even just making out at a bar -- it's not classy behavior, and you won't be proud of yourself later.

, If you've walked into a party and a guy offers you a drink right away, don't accept it unless you see him make it or grab it for you so you know exactly what it's the drink. If the guy just grabs you a beer from a cooler, then that's fine, but if he disappears into the kitchen and returns with a ""mystery drink"" that may be filled with alcohol or even date-rape drugs, then you'll be in the middle of a very dangerous situation.


You don't have to be rude about declining the drink. Just be honest about your reasoning. It's better to look unfriendly than to be in danger.

, Your drink should be in your hand or at least in your sight at all times, whether you're at a party or at a bar. If you set your drink down and walk away, someone could mess with your drink, or you could even end up picking up a stronger drink by mistake, thinking it was yours.


If you get up to go to the restroom, get a close friend to hold your drink for you or take it with you. This will help you avoid anyone tampering with your drink.

Drink your Jagermeister straight up.,
Limit the amount you drink.",How to Stay Lucid While Drinking Jaegermeister1," Alcohol dehydrates you, and since Jagermeister has such high alcohol by volume, it dehydrates you very quickly. Try alternating a full glass of water with every drink of Jager you take. The water will slow down the dehydration process and keep you from getting too drunk.Understand that because you are drinking so much water, you will be running to the bathroom quite frequently.
The more alcohol you drink, the less water you will remember to consume. Drink a couple glasses of water before you start drinking alcohol to help level the playing field.
If a room is especially warm, you may find yourself dehydrated sooner rather than later. If you’re sweating more than you normally do, drink even more water to avoid becoming too drunk.;
, Going to the bathroom frequently doesn’t just dehydrate your body – it also depletes it of necessary nutrients. This loss of nutrients is partially responsible for the hangover you feel the next day. To counteract this, drink plenty of electrolytes while drinking Jagermeister.Keep packets of Emergen-C handy, so you can mix them into water and drink them between glasses of Jager.
Buy a bottle of Gatorade and chug that between drinks of Jager.

, Drinking from a curved or round glass can result in you drinking more alcohol, because it’s tougher to gauge how much alcohol you’ve consumed. Keep track of how many drinks you’ve had (and if you can, how many ounces are in each drink). This will keep you from drinking too much too quickly.Standard drink size for Jagermeister is usually 1.5 fluid ounces.Standard drink size for a glass of wine is 5 fluid ounces. For beer, it's 12 ounces.

, Ask for your Jagermeister neat or on the rocks. Mixing Jager with sugar will only increase your chances of getting dehydrated. And if you are drinking Jagermeister, stick to Jagermeister. Mixing different types of alcohol is the easiest way to get sick or too drunk.


If you plan on mixing your Jager with sugary drinks, decrease your sugar intake earlier in the day to help your body maintain balance.Sugary drinks go down easier and faster, so removing sugar from your drink is a great way to help nurse your drink longer.

, Moderate drinking for men is described as 2 drinks per day and 14 drinks per week. For women, moderate drinking consists of 1 drink per day and 7 drinks per week. Decide ahead of time how buzzed you want to get while drinking, set a concrete number of drinks you're allowed to have and stick to that number.No-risk drinking for men consists of 3-4 drinks per day. For women, it's 2-3 drinks per day.
Low-risk drinking for men consists of 5-7 drinks per day. For women, it's 4-5 drinks per day.

It is not recommended that people who do not drink begin drinking. If you do drink alcoholic beverages, follow the steps below.


If you frequently find yourself in social situations where you feel obliged to consume alcohol, see How to Turn Down a Drink.;
, It is accepted that one serving of alcohol is an approximation, and may vary slightly. However, there is general agreement that one serving of alcohol contains about 0.5 fluid ounces (or 14.8ml) of pure alcohol (ethanol).

, This is usually expressed as the percentage of alcohol by volume. The alcohol content of alcoholic beverages can vary greatly. Certain types of commonly available alcoholic drinks contain relatively similar amounts of alcohol, and for each type of drink there will be some variation. Unfortunately, the alcohol content may not be listed on the labels of alcoholic beverages.



Regular bottled beer generally has an alcohol content of about 5 percent by volume, while light beer is approximately 4 percent alcohol. Strong specialty beers and malt liquors may have an alcohol content of up to about 8 or even 10 percent, while “session” beers and draught-style stouts may have an alcohol content that ranges from about 3 to 4.5 percent. It is a misconception that all dark beers such as stouts are high in alcohol, although certain dark beers such as imperial stouts can have high alcohol content.

Wine generally has an alcohol content that ranges from 8 to 14 percent. Table wine has a range of about 8 to 14 percent, and the alcohol content of sparkling wine ranges from about 8 to 12 percent. Even if one of these types of wine is labeled as containing a specific percentage of alcohol, it may actually contain somewhat more or less alcohol. The allowed variance differs for specific countries, but in the US the listed percentage may be about 1.5 percent different than the actual alcohol content.
Fortified wines (such as dessert wines, Sherry, and Port) tend to contain between 17 and 22 percent alcohol.
Hard liquors such as vodka, whiskey, tequila, and rum usually have an alcohol content of about 40 percent (80 proof). Some versions of hard liquors have a higher or lower alcohol content, so check the alcohol percentage or proof that will be listed on the label. The alcohol percentage is half of the proof.
Liqueurs usually have an alcohol content that ranges from 15 to 30 percent. The alcohol content may be much higher, however, and labels must be checked to determine the alcohol content. Liqueurs may also contain high levels of ingredients such as sugar and even cream that may cause health problems regardless of the alcohol content.

, The volume of the drink that makes up one serving is based on the alcohol content of the beverage. To calculate the fluid ounces of pure alcohol in a drink, multiply the total fluid ounces of the drink by the alcohol percentage (percent alcohol by volume) of the drink. To get milliliters of alcohol, multiply the total milliliters of the drink by the alcohol percentage (percent alcohol by volume). Because alcohol contents for specific types of drinks are slightly variable and servings need not be completely exact, the volume that makes up one serving for specific beverages can be roughly estimated.


For regular commercial beer (about 5% alcohol) and light beer (about 4% alcohol), one serving is equivalent to 12 fluid ounces (355ml).

Strong specialty beer and malt liquor may have up to about twice as much alcohol as regular and light beer. If this type of beer is 8 to 10 percent alcohol, then one serving will be about 6 fluid ounces (180ml). These types of beer are commonly sold in large bottles and cans, and each container may greatly exceed the equivalent of two servings. One 24oz (700ml) can of 8-percent alcohol malt liquor will be equivalent to about four servings. Microbrewed beer that is commonly available in 22oz (650ml) bottles commonly has an alcohol content of about 7 percent. One 22oz (650ml) bottle of 7 percent alcohol beer will be almost exactly equivalent to three servings. Try sharing strong beer that is packaged in large containers with one or more friends.


For table wine (red and white) and sparkling wine, one serving is equivalent to 4 or 5 fluid ounces (use a smaller serving for strong wine). Five fluid ounces is about 150 milliliters or two-thirds of a cup.
The serving size for dessert wines is about 3 fluid ounces (about 90ml).
For 80-proof liquor (40% alcohol), it is generally accepted that one serving is equivalent to 1.5 fluid ounces (45ml). This is the same as one standard shot. However, 1.5oz should actually provide 0.6oz of pure alcohol, provided that every drop of the liquor is consumed. In reality, some of the liquor may not make it into the body. However, since hard liquor is a very concentrated source of alcohol, it may be beneficial to be conservative and consider that slightly less than 1.5oz of 80 proof liquor (between 1.2 and 1.3oz) actually provides 0.5oz of pure alcohol.
The volume that makes up one serving for liqueurs can be highly variable due to variable alcohol contents. Kahlua may contain anywhere from 20 percent to 35 percent alcohol, depending on the region. It is typically 26 percent alcohol. For this alcohol percentage, two ounces are equivalent to one serving. Another common liqueur, Baileys Irish Cream, contains 17 percent alcohol. This means that 3oz of Baileys is equivalent to one serving.

Mixed drinks can contain liquors as well as liqueurs with variable alcohol contents. Any mixed drink that is equivalent to one serving contains the equivalent of 1.5oz (45ml) of 80 proof (40 percent) alcohol. It can be difficult to determine exactly how much alcohol a mixed drink contains, as the drink may be made with various different alcoholic ingredients that each have different alcohol contents. It is easiest to choose mixed drinks that are made with only one type of alcoholic ingredient, or are made with multiple different alcoholic ingredients that contain the same amount of alcohol. Luckily, the specific serving equivalents for some common drinks have already been determined (see the sections below), but keep in mind that the servings can vary greatly if the recipes are slightly adjusted because hard liquor is such a concentrated source of alcohol.

, This can be done by you or by an experienced bartender or sommelier. However, be sure to tell your server exactly how much of each type of beverage you want to drink. Beverages such as bottled beers that are already available in the quantity that is equivalent to one serving may be most convenient. It can be very difficult to tell what the capacity of a glass is just by looking at it, and with concentrated sources of alcohol a small variation can mean a huge difference in the actual number of servings.


Beer is typically available in 12oz (355ml) cans and bottles. However, US pint glasses hold 16oz (about 475ml), and British (Imperial) pint glasses hold 20oz (almost 600ml).
Wine glasses have a capacity that is larger than five ounces (150ml), but are actually meant to hold only 5oz of wine. Wine glasses are also available in many different shapes and actual sizes. It is not desirable to first pour wine into a measuring vessel before pouring it into a glass, so it can be useful to determine what five ounces of liquid looks like in particular wine glasses using measured volumes of water or juice. Small 187ml bottles of wine can also be purchased instead of standard 750ml bottles of wine. While 187ml bottles provide somewhat more than one serving, they are well under two servings and offer an easy alternative to measuring or estimating the amount of wine that is poured from a large bottle.
For hard liquor and liqueurs, shot glasses of a specific capacity can be used. Jiggers can also be used to measure out the desired volume. Bartenders may free pour certain quantities. If so, ask them what volume they are pouring to make sure that they are not giving you too much alcohol. It may be best to use miniature 50ml bottles of hard liquor. A mini bottle of 80 proof (40%) liquor is just 5ml more than the recommended 45ml serving. 50ml is equivalent to 1.69oz. 1.69oz of liquor that is 40% alcohol contains 0.68oz of pure alcohol, which is about 1.5 servings of alcohol. A mini bottle that contains liquor or liqueur that is 30% alcohol provides 15ml of pure alcohol, or just about one exact serving of alcohol.

, If you are unsure of the alcohol content of a beverage or the volume of the glass that it is served in, avoid it until you know enough to establish correct serving sizes.

, Dark, flavorful beers and wines can satisfy after a serving or two, encourage slow savoring rather than rapid thirst-quenching (which doesn't work and feeds on itself because alcohol is a diuretic), and even taste harsh if drunk quickly or in quantity. Tastes great...more filling!


Dark beer often has somewhat more alcohol than light beer.

, For many people, especially women, it may be healthier to drink one or two drinks only a few times per week instead of every day.

, Nonalcoholic beverages can be great substitutes for alcoholic beverages. They look and taste similar to alcoholic beverages, and enable one to drink with others who are drinking similar alcoholic beverages. One can also drink nonalcoholic beverages after one has consumed the daily limit of two or less servings of actual alcoholic beverages. Keep in mind that nonalcoholic beer does contain a very small amount of alcohol, while virgin cocktails should not contain any alcohol.

Eat dry yeast.,
Don’t drink on an empty stomach.,
Get a good night sleep the night before.",How to Stay Lucid While Drinking Jaegermeister2," Dry yeast has an enzyme in it that is able to break down alcohol molecules, similar to how your liver metabolizes alcohol. By consuming dry yeast prior to drinking, the enzymes are able to help lessen the effects of alcohol, thus keeping you more lucid.Try mixing the dry yeast into a cup of yogurt to make it more palatable.
You can buy dry yeast at your local grocery store. Fleischmann’s is a great brand.

, Have a big meal before you start drinking. Concentrate on eating a lot of carbs, proteins and fats, as these take longer to digest. If possible, eat a burger or BLT, to help soak up all the alcohol (a sandwich with meat and avocado on it is also a great option.)If there’s food available at the place you’re drinking, try to alternate between eating and drinking. Appetizers and hors d’oeuvres will be your best friend.
If you know you won’t have time to eat prior to drinking, plan ahead and bring a sandwich or protein bar with you.

, The more tired you are, the worse your liver becomes at processing alcohol. That’s why when you’re tired, one drink will sometimes hit you three times as hard. Avoid this pitfall altogether by getting a good night’s sleep the night before you intend to consume a lot of Jager.If you have time, take a nap before going out drinking.
Avoid drinking caffeine while drinking alcohol. It will trick your body into thinking it’s more awake than it actually is, and it’s also a diuretic.

Be aware of your tolerance.,
Pace yourself.,
Drink for your body size and type.",How to Stay Lucid While Drinking Jaegermeister3," If you’re a seasoned drinker, your body is more practiced at breaking down and metabolizing alcohol, which means you can drink more with fewer side effects. If you’re a newer drinker, the same will not hold true. Listen to your body and stop drinking as soon as you start to feel buzzed.It is possible, although not always recommended, to increase your tolerance through practice and repetition. Make sure to always drink responsibly.
If you take a break from drinking, your tolerance will not be the same. Be aware of what your tolerance is at the time, and drink based on that.

, Drinking is a marathon, not a sprint. Try to spread your drinks out throughout the evening, as opposed to lining them up one after another. See how long you can nurse one drink. Take a break to order dinner or a snack. Pacing yourself is not only good for your brain, it’s also good for your wallet. The fewer drinks you buy, the less money you’ll spend. Try bringing a set amount of money to a bar, so that you can only spend a predetermined amount of cash on drinks.
Try only allowing yourself one drink per hour. This will make it easier for you to remember how many drinks you’ve had throughout the evening and will keep you from getting too drunk too quickly.

, Different people are built differently, so it stands to reason that alcohol will affect different people in different ways. A 5’2” woman will not (generally) be able to hold her liquor as well as a 6’5” man. Don’t try to keep up with other drinkers; listen to your own body and go at your own speed.Alcohol absorption is dependent on fat levels. The more fat you have, the slower your alcohol will absorb.
If your blood alcohol level is at .08 (the legal limit) it will take five hours for you to burn off the alcohol completely.

Know what you're drinking.",How to Avoid Getting Drunk1," A drink could be a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a mixed drink. Whatever it is, try and only drink one per hour. This will prevent you from getting drunk, since your liver can metabolize the alcohol and get it out of your system in an hour.If you stick to this schedule you'll be able to drink casually but stay sober.


Sip your drink slowly. Try and enjoy it slowly instead of downing it.;
, Set your limit well in advance and stick to it. If you know that you're drunk after 3 beers, then you need to space those beers out far enough to avoid getting wasted. Everyone handles alcohol differently, so there is no perfect number to stick to. When in doubt, know that the recommended amounts are 3 drinks for men and 2 for women.Bring cash to the bar instead of a card, forcing you to stop drinking when you run out of money.
Women will get drunk faster than men due to differences in body type.The more you weigh, the more alcohol you can generally consume before feeling drunk., Drink for taste, not inebriation. Savor both the flavor and the aroma of the alcohol instead of downing it. Splurge on an expensive but extremely enjoyable drink, because it's going to be the only drink of the night. Whatever it is, appreciate its nuances slowly.


Bring the glass to your lips every now and then and tilt it. Instead of drinking, however, simply inhale the aroma.
Taste the drink as you swallow it. If it's not worth tasting then it's not worth drinking.
Everyone has a different alcohol tolerance, so drink for yourself, not to prove something or keep up with a buddy.

, Water is proven to help alcohol absorption and breakdown and gives you something to drink before refilling your cup.Aim to drink a glass of water before each drink, then have a glass between drinks as well.


Sip the water slowly to put more time between alcoholic drinks.

, Food, contrary to popular belief, does not prevent you from getting drunk. It can, however, slow down the time it takes the booze to make it to your brain. Eating also fills you up and prevents you from downing drinks in the interim., When drinking, stick to mixed drinks that you can control. You can, for example, use a half shot of alcohol instead of a full shot and fill the rest up with soda or mixer. This helps you stay involved in the party but prevents you from drinking too much too fast.Try a ""shandy,"" which is a light beer mixed with lemonade, to enjoy a little bit of alcohol responsibly.

, See if a buddy is looking to drink the same amount as you and avoid getting drunk. You can look out for each other, gently cutting the other off if things seem to get out of hand. It also makes it easier to stay sober if everyone around you is getting sober, but you have your buddy on your level.

, Do not just accept drinks, especially at parties. While one drink an hour is normally a good guideline, mixed drinks at house parties and events can vary wildly in strength. They are also sweetened so much that the actual alcohol content is masked. If you find yourself in this situation, stick to beer, wine, or mixing your own drinks.


Don't mix types of alcohol, like liquor, beer, and wine, in the same night. It makes it much harder to know how much actual alcohol you're consuming."
"
Make moderation your best friend.,
Eat greasy, fatty snacks while drinking.,
Eat a spoonful of yeast to negate some effects of the alcohol.,
Build up a tolerance to alcohol over time.,
Water down your drinks, especially mixed drinks.,
Have a glass of milk before drinking, and another in the middle of the night.",How to Avoid Getting Drunk2," At the end of the day, if alcohol is going into your body, you will get drunk. Once the chemicals are in your body, they have to naturally filter out through your liver, and they will head to the brain on the way through your blood. Drinking responsibly is your best bet. That said, the following tips should help you mitigate the effects a bit and prevent getting sloshed after a few beers., Keep on knocking back some snacks, as the fat will help form a buffer against the alcohol. This makes the alcohol enter your body more slowly. Your waistline won't thank you, but your brain will.Good options include:

Fast Food
Nuts
Pizza
Ice cream and milkshakes (dairy may also help slow down alcohol).

, A small spoonful of baker's yeast has been shown to break down alcohol the same way your liver does, preventing you from getting as drunk as you would without it.Simply mix the yeast in with water or yogurt and down it before you start drinking. While the effects aren't enormous, they can potentially lower your blood alcohol content by 20-30%.This will keep you from absorbing some of the alcohol, but it will not keep you from getting drunk by itself.
Note, however, that there is some scientific debate about the effectiveness of using yeast.

, The more regularly you drink, the faster your body will get used to the feeling of drunkenness. It will take more booze to feel drunk, allowing you to knock a few more back before feeling the spins. The more you drink, the greater your tolerance will be. Having a 1-2 glasses each night may make it easier to stay sober when drinking.

Due to a wide variety of physical, mental, and social affects, it is not recommended that you drink purely to raise your tolerance. It can lead to health problems and alcohol addiction quickly., Put in more liquid and less alcohol. You'll still be able to drink, but you'll be able to space out the actual alcohol, keeping you soberer. You can even water down beer by mixing it with lemonade, crafting a ""shandy"" instead of a straight beer., Dairy lines your stomach, making it less able to absorb alcohol. It will get into your body eventually, of course, but it will take a bit longer, allowing your liver to eliminate some of it before the rest hits your system.

Carbonated beverages may disrupt this stomach lining, so it may not work with beer and cocktails with soda.
Like many other methods, there is scientific debate on the effectiveness. But many stories attest to milk's positive effects."
"
Be confident in your decision not to drink.,
Avoid situations which frequently lead to drinking.,
Learn to say no quickly and confidently.,
Hold another drink in your hand.,
Find activities other than simply ""getting drunk."",
Remove yourself from the situation if the pressure becomes too much.,
Find ways to avoid temptation.",How to Avoid Getting Drunk3," Alcohol isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't a ""healthy life choice."" So don't feel like you are lame or unexciting because you don't want to drink. Understanding your own reasons not to drink will help you say no in even the trickiest situations.


If you've made a decision not to drink, for whatever reason, stick to it. ""Just one drink"" is often the recipe for an unpleasant night.
You do not owe anyone an explanation for why you don't want to drink. Alcohol is a recreational drug, not a way of life or philosophy. If you don't want to drink, then so be it.

, Going to bars or house parties is like asking for temptation, especially if you are trying to quit drinking or are easily pressured. Suggest alternative events for your friends, find new places to hang out, and try and plan activities to do other than just sitting and drinking.You do not have to avoid all people who drink. Rather, make sure there won't be a strong drinking culture that could tempt you or lead others to pressure you to ""join the gang.""
Let your close friends know in advance that you are not drinking. Let them know why and ask them to help you stay sober so that they are on your side before the party starts., When someone asks if you'd like a drink,the best response is a simple, firm ""No thank you."" While this should be enough, oftentimes people will push you for an explanation or reason, or will plead with you to have a drink with them. You want a quick, direct, and honest ""no"" ready when offered. Make sure you make good eye contact and say your words clearly and firmly:""I don't drink anymore, thank you.""
""I'm the designated driver tonight.""
""I'm allergic to alcohol!"" is a great, joking way to lighten the mood when refusing., This is often enough to convince people not to ask you to drink. It doesn't matter what it is, but sodas and other fizzy drinks are often great ways to imply that you're drinking without actually imbibing.


Talk to the bartender ahead of time and let him know that you won't be drinking alcohol. Tip him/her anyway and thank them for soda and water.
If someone is super persistent, just take the drink and leave it in your hand. Once you have the drink you should feel free to leave it without drinking, and most people won't know that it isn't simply a refilled glass

, You're likely to drink a whole lot less when you're in a place with distractions such as food, games like bowling, darts or billiards, or going out to a show of concert. You're also more likely to forgo drinks if the lighting is up, the place isn't crowded, and you feel comfortable. Make sure people have something else to do or talk about and drinking will become a background activity, not the main event.

, If the constant badgering to have a drink is beginning to ruin your night, it's time to go. Alcohol is not, and should not be, an activity by itself. If the only thing people are doing is getting drunk and they do not respect your decision to stay sober then you should leave.

, If you know you're going to want to drink more than you should, implement some methods to remind yourself to stop. Remember the reasons why you don't want to get drunk, and think about why a sober night is important to you. Some suggestions include:


Use the rubber band flick trick. Wear a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you feel the temptation to drink, flick yourself back into making a conscious choice not to.
Have a buddy remind you when enough is enough. This might be a buddy who doesn't drink or is good at knowing his or her own limits and stopping. Or it could be a family member.
Distract yourself. Get up and dance, talk to someone for a while, or play a game of pool.
Allow yourself different rewards, like a shopping spree, a favorite item of food, seeing a movie, or calling a friend long-distance, if you're able to refrain from alcohol."

Prepare garnishes or decorations.,

Prepare the glass.,
Learn the essential techniques of bartending.,
Learn that measuring is the key.,
Experiment with different flavors.",How to Understand Basic Bartending Techniques," These objects create a brighter ""image"" of cocktails and blended drinks, such as Pina Coladas. Garnishes can be anything from edible fruit to plastic swords. The most common types of fruit used are strawberries, oranges, limes, lemons, and cherries. Garnishes can be decorated by cutting into slices and hanging them on the side of the glass, twisting a piece of zest or a fruit slice, or inserting a straw or swizzle stick in the drink.
, While shooter and shot drinks are normally created by free pouring, most cocktail drinks recommend that you prepare the glass before pouring the contents in it.

The most common glass preparation is by chilling the glass. A person can either place a glass in the freezer until chilled or add ice cubes in the glass until the drink is ready to be served. Depending on the drink, the ice cubes are removed or the drink is directly poured on it.
Frosting glasses are more seen on margaritas and some cocktail drinks.

, These are the actions of creating drinks.


Building: Easiest technique to do. When making a drink, one should follow a recipe's ingredient list. Also when building, usually the ingredients float on top of each other, but can be mixed with a swizzle stick.






Stirring: Using a long metal or glass rod spoon, ingredients are stirred together, mainly using an old fashioned or highball glass. Some recommend using a method of making six full 360 degree circles while stirring.

Shaking and Straining: Shaking is the most efficient and fastest method to mix and chill a drink at the same time. Usually ice is added to a shaker, followed by the ingredients. Fast and quick shakes should build up condense on the sides of the shaker. When straining ingredients into a glass, a shaker strainer is used or one is clasped on the shaker.






Muddling: As weird as it sounds, muddling is the action of ""crushing"" ingredients, such as mint leaves with a muddle, fork, pestle, or the back of a spoon. Depending on the drink, the crushed pieces are left in the glass and the drink is poured onto them.






Layering: When done correctly, this method creates the most gorgeous mixed drinks. One of the most known layered drink is the B-52. Ingredients are measured and poured against the back of a tablespoon, spoon, or down the handle of a bar spoon.
Blending: An alternative to shaking drinks, this method creates iced blended drinks. Crushed ice may be more recommended to use rather than regular sized ice cubes.






Flaming: Although the most dangerous technique to creating drinks, it enhances the flavors of the drink. The flames should be extinguished before consuming the drink.

, To get the right amounts of a balanced drink, measuring is very important. Never free-pour something if you're not sure, guessing, or just to fill a glass up. Over or under pouring an ingredient will throw everything off., Explore combinations with a variety of spices, fruits, and different tastes. A suggested fruit list can be found here. You may even find yourself making a new concoction."
"
Decide if you want to throw a themed cocktail party, as you may want to serve themed drinks.,
Work out your budget for the cocktail party.,
Choose the location for your bar.,
Protect the bar area by laying down place mats on the counter or table and rugs on any carpeted or hard-to-clean floor.,
Decide if you prefer a self-serve bar or a bartender.,
Choose a signature drink, if you want to provide drink that matches the theme of your party.,
Make a list of the liquors, beer and wine you want to provide.,
Make or buy plenty of ice.,
Assemble the necessary glasses, such as wine glasses, martini/cocktail glasses, highball glasses and rocks glasses to serve whiskey on the rocks.

,
Set out the appropriate tools.,
Pre-cut fruit garnishes like lime wedges and orange peel about an hour before the party.,
Set a trash can underneath your bar.

,
Set up your bar to have the following layout of 4 rows, starting from the back:


The first row should have liquor bottles, red wine and white wine, in order from left to right.,
Set glasses to the side of the bar layout.

,
Place beer in a bucket full of ice to the other side of the liquor layout, or beside the table for easy access.

,
Refill the ice, garnishes, beer and bottles throughout the night.

",How to Set up a Bar for a Cocktail Party," For example, if you are having a tiki cocktail party, you may want to serve a rum punch or a Blue Hawaiian, which require different ingredients than a normal home bar's stock.;
, It is not essential that you provide a full bar. As long as you have a variety of spirits, wine, beer and non-alcoholic drinks, the guests will most likely be content.

, You want to make sure there is a flow of people past the cocktail bar and into standing or seating areas. Place the bar away from the appetizers or other food and away from the entryway, to avoid a bottleneck.


If possible, place your bar in the kitchen, because it is easier to clean spills off counters and tile than off carpet.

, If the bar will be away from the kitchen, make sure you have a nearby source of water and kitchen towels for spills. Lay a tablecloth over the table.


If you are putting up a collapsible table for your bar, make sure it is about 30 inches (76 cm) wide and 6 feet (182 cm) long, to avoid a long wait for drinks.

, Hire a bartender a month to a few weeks in advance, as the good freelance bartenders book up early.

, This can be mixed in advance. For example, if it is a winter cocktail party, you can mix eggnog in advance and have it available for guests.


If you are going to have a punch bowl, consider putting it on a table of its own, since the punchbowl and glasses can take up a lot of space.

, If you want to have wine, choose a white and a red, but stay with the same type of wine so that the guests do not have to make more decisions.


Consider stocking these staples that are common to a self-serve bar: vodka, rye whiskey, tequila, white rum, gin, and scotch or bourbon. If you are serving themed-drinks, buy other ingredients, such as Blue Curacao or Irish Cream.
Buy mixers, such as tonic water, club soda, cola, cranberry juice and other sodas.

, You can never have too much ice at a cocktail party. Place a full ice bucket out and refill it throughout the night.

,, These include: a long spoon for stirring, a metal drink shaker with a strainer, tongs for the ice bucket, a bottle opener, a wine corkscrew and at least 2 small measuring cups, known as jiggers.

, Set them out, including toothpicks and bowls of cherries and olives right before the party.

,,
The second row should have a water jug, juices and garnishes.
The third row should have soft drinks, jiggers and other bar tools and openers.
The fourth and front row should have napkins, an ice bucket and tongs.
Only keep 1 or 2 bottles of each liquor or wine out at once and restock as the night goes on.

Decide what fruit you’d like to use to make wine.,
Visit a homebrew store to purchase wine yeast.,
Wash everything thoroughly.,
Remove rotten fruit.,
Set up a fruit press.,
Add a packet of wine yeast that is dissolved into water.,
Insert your hydrometer into the mixture.,
Cover the pail with a layer of cheesecloth.,
Strain the liquid through a funnel wrapped in cheesecloth to remove the sediment.,
Insert an airlock at the top of the container.,
Bottle the wine after two to three months.",How to Make Alcohol1," You can use grapes, strawberries, cherries or even apples (cider) with this process. You will need between 12 and 18 lbs. (5.4 to 8.2 kg) of ripe fruit.


Most people suggest that you go the extra step to find organic and/or locally produced fruit. Insecticides and fertilizers can impart an unpleasant taste to homemade alcohol.

If you don’t have fresh fruit, purchase some 100 percent fruit juice. It should have a sugar content of 20 percent or more. Buy a gallon (3.8 l) of juice and skip the next few steps. You will start with adding the yeast.
;
, You will also need two glass gallon (3.8 l) containers, a hydrometer, equipment sanitizer, corks, a corker, a sanitized food pail, airlocks and tubing.


If you want to make apple cider inquire about renting a cider press. Some presses are available for rent and are necessary for getting the fresh apple juice out of the apples.

Purchase champagne yeast if you are going to make cider or wine from fruit juice.

, Fill your sink with professional sanitizer and wash all the equipment according to package directions just before you use it. Consider buying a special produce wash to ensure the fruit is very clean before it is used.

, Pick off stems. Leaving them in the mix will create bitter wine.

, If you don’t have access to one, you can hand crush your grapes or other soft fruit. Try using a sanitized metal ricer or masher to press the juice out of the pulp.Press the fruit into a two to four gallon (7.6 to 15.1 l) food grade pail. This is where your initial fermentation will take place.

The act of pressing the fruit releases juice, referred to as “must” in winemaking.

, Mix well. If you are using fruit juice, you can pour out some juice and add the packet of yeast strait into the gallon fruit juice bottle.

, You will need a reading of 1.010 (22 degrees Brix) or higher to make the wine. If it is lower than that, make sugar syrup and mix it in until the hydrometer registers an adequate amount of sugar content.


Make the syrup by dissolving granulated sugar into distilled water on the stove. Let it cool slightly, then add it by the tbsp. (14.8 ml) until your reading is high enough.
If you are using juice with high sugar content, you will not need to use a hydrometer or add extra sugar.
If your sugar content is too high, you can dilute it with distilled water.

, This will allow the CO2 to leave during the fermentation process. Leave it for seven to 10 days.


Your mixture will need a temperature of approximately 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 Celsius) to ferment. If your initial fermentation mixture is too cool, wrap an electric blanket around the pail to heat it up gently.

To cool the temperature of the mixture, wrap ice packs around the pail for a little while.
White wines require approximately 55 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 Celsius).

, Pour the contents of the pail into a sanitized glass gallon bucket. Fill it to the very top.

, Let the jug sit for two weeks. Then, siphon the wine every few weeks to remove further sediment.


Siphoning, or “racking,” wine requires you to place an empty bottle lower than the current fermentation bottle. Use plastic tubing to create a siphon and allow it to pour into the clean bottle. Make sure the tubing sits above the sediment, so that you are purifying your wine.If you are making wine from store-bought juice, you will pour in the yeast and insert the airlock. Wait three days to two weeks to produce alcohol you can bottle., One gallon of wine will make almost five bottles. Leave a half-inch of space at the top. Insert your corks with a corker.


Store the wine bottles upright for three days. Then, store them on their side.
At 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius), red wine can be stored for up to one year and white wine can be stored for up to six months."

Choose a consistency and base: slushy, thick, or creamy


A base of crushed ice (which can come from blending ice cubes) in a relatively large amount of watery and/or alcoholic liquid produces a cold, dense-feeling, but free-flowing slush of ice particles.,
Reduce dilution by plain ice for rich drinks.,
Use crushed ice, often supplied by a fancy refrigerator through the door, instead of regular ice cubes.,
Mix sugars in thoroughly.,
Add the fruit first and ice last.,
Blend.,
Double check on the texture of the drink before pouring into glasses.,
Reduce melting in the glasses.",How to Make Frozen Cocktails," (Crushed ice in a relatively small amount of liquid tends to crystallize into a stiff mass, not very drinkable, which is why quiescently frozen confections like popsicles need things like sugar--not just to taste sweet.) Like simple iced drinks, slushy ones work well with mild and sour flavors and to drink quickly on cold days. Thawing them absorbs a lot more heat than simply warming cool drinks, so they taste very cool but can cause ""brain freeze"" if consumed too quickly.
A base of crushed ice (some or all from frozen fruity ingredients) in a relatively small of watery and/or alcoholic liquid, accompanied by a large quantity of complex molecules such as sugar, fiber, protein or fat produces a thick but flowing, smooth slush like a smoothie, approaching a sorbet. This is great for sweet drinks such as pina coladas: the cold taste and texture will balance the sweetness.
A base of rich dairy products like ice cream or condensed milk produces a creamy, milkshake-like drink. The smooth feel is great with spicy ingredients--consider coffee and chocolate milkshakes--but the solids could be damaged by much acid, which ""curdles"" milk. The blender's practical requirement for the ingredients to recirculate to the cutting blades limits how thick the drink can be.

An ice cream base is used for creamy grasshoppers and frozen mudslides.
Combining ice and ice cream is generally not recommended: watery milky flavor is often not appealing.

;
,


Use fresh fruit instead of juices. Like fruit smoothies, it enriches a ""healthier"" balance in the drink and adds a stronger fruit taste. You can also use frozen fruit, as this helps the ""freezing"" of the drink. Chopped frozen fruit can save money, because it is an efficient way to use fruit that may have had a few bad spots to come out.
Frozen concentrated juice can even reverse dilution. Bear in mind when proportioning other ingredients that orange juice is very sweet, and lemonade and limeade concentrates are mostly added syrup.

, Having crushed ice on hand makes it easier on the blender itself, such as less wear and tear and more drinks can be made in a shorter amount of time.


If you are planning to make lots of blended drinks, it's best to invest in pre-bagged crushed ice bags. These can be easily found in supermarkets.

, Sugar gives a sweet taste and allows the mixture to flow smoothly. If it's not mixed in well, it can't do its work (but still has its calories). Sugar doesn't dissolve quickly in cold water, but dissolves in almost any proportion with hot water. Mix the sugar with a little hot water, or with cold water and microwave until it dissolves. Syrup can be dangerously hot and sticky! Let it cool to lukewarm before adding to the blender and/or dribble over ice so a temperature difference doesn't break the glass carafe.


This ""simple syrup"", if thick, will keep at room temperature.
Corn syrup crystallizes even less readily than regular sugar, so it can work even better.

, Cut any fruit into 1 inch (2.54 cm) chunks. Building the mixture with the ice last ensures that any fruit/liquid gets evenly blended along with the ice.

, Start on a slow speed, then increase. Short pulses are excellent for the fruit and ice. Allow the mixture to thoroughly blend until you do not hear any ice churning.


If the mixture does not recirculate to the blender blades, it needs more water, or, if compatible with the recipe, more sugar to lubricate a dense mixture.

, When ice is used, make sure that it is well combined and crushed. If the mixture is too thick, add more fruit or liquid. If the mixture is too thin, add more ice.


Extended blending can make the ice so fine that particles are not shards of preexisting cubes, but delicate, smoothly flavored crystals refreezing in equilibrium from the mass of drink, as can happen when a supercooled soda is opened and the reduction in pressure allows crystallization.This can take about 30 seconds. Delicious!

, Use chilled or frozen glassware instead of room temperature items. Putting a frozen drink into a warm glass tends to melt the drink faster. Or use plastic glasses, which don't store much heat themselves or conduct heat well from the outside.

Pour two quarts of water into your pot.,
Make an ice bath in your sink.,
Pour the room temperature starter wort into your sanitized gallon container using a funnel.,
Insert an airlock.,
Boil 1 oz.,
Siphon the beer from the sediment into a bottling bucket.,
Siphon the beer from the bucket into sanitized bottles.",How to Make Alcohol2," They are available at home brew stores and online. It will provide you with tubing, a clamp, a fermenting bucket or carboy, a thermometer, an airlock and stopper and several ingredients, such as malt extract, hops and yeast.


In addition, you should purchase sanitizing solution, bottle caps, a bottle capper and a bottle brush.

, This is how you will cook the brew. Larger pots may be necessary if you are making a larger batch of beer.

, You can purchase a no-rinse sterilizing liquid from the homebrew store. Make sure to do this before each step of the process.

, Add six ounces of dry malt extract. Bring it to a boil for 10 minutes to create your “wort.”


More experienced brewers will want to use steeped grains and hops and boil it together for an hour to brew the wort.Making the beer from grains and hops requires a more sterilized environment and several additional steps to steep the grains and boil the hops.

, Place the pot inside the bath until it cools to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius).
, Add one package of liquid yeast. This is called “pitching the yeast.”

, You can also use a lock with tubing and submerge the other end in water. This will allow carbon dioxide to escape during the two weeks that it is stored.

, (28 g) of corn sugar in one pint of water for 15 minutes. This is what makes the beer bubbly as it comes out of the bottle. It is called “priming sugar.”

, You will need to place your bucket below the level of the gallon bottle and run tubing between the two containers. Add your corn sugar syrup to the bucket.

, Cap them securely. Wait six weeks to two months to open and drink your beer."

Check with your county or state guidelines to see if it is legal to distill alcohol in your area.

,
Order a two liter copper alembic pot still.,
Create a slow, steady heat source.,
Sterilize your glasses and jars before you use them.,
Set your still on the heat source or in the water bath on the heat source.,
Fill the distillate with the wine you want to distill into spirits.,
Put the lid on the distillation pot.,
Place a sterilized glass below the spout.,
Turn on your heat source.,
Practice by learning the smell of the fore shots, heads, hearts and tails.,
Leave the hearts in a class for a few days, covered in cheesecloth.,
Age the alcohol in sanitized jars until you are ready to drink it.",How to Make Alcohol3,", If you want to brew larger batches, you can purchase stills up to five gallons (25 l). They constitute a more significant investment.

, Natural gas and propane are often used as heat sources. Ensure that your heat source is up to fire code and is in an area cleared of other objects or materials.


You can also place a water bath on the heat source to improve the quality of your distillate.

, You can clean your still by warming it slightly and pouring 1/4 cup (59 ml) of vinegar into the still. Add a tbsp. (18 g) of salt and insert a sponge to clean the interior of the still.


Rinse it well with distilled water before using the still.
Unused copper will oxidize, so copper pots should be cleaned regularly.

, It should be three-fourths submerged.

, It should fill the still approximately three-fourths full.

, Run a tube from the lid to the condenser coil. Place cold water in the condenser.

, Screw all the fittings on tight when your still is assembled. You can seal the connections with a paste made of flour and water if they don’t fit tightly.


Cover the water bath, such as a Dutch oven, with aluminum foil to minimize evaporation.

, Your water bath should heat to a full boil. Aim for the spout to drip once per second once it begins the distillation process.


Adjust your heat until the alcohol flows at this speed.

, It is best to learn by example from an experienced distiller. The following are good guidelines, made safe through practice:
“The fore shots” are the alcohol that comes out first. They are high in acetone and methyl alcohol and are considered poisonous. They have a bad smell and you should discard them and the glass they are in. Combined with the heads, they are usually the first 50 - 100 mL of spirit to come out of the still.
“The heads” is a mix of unusable alcohol. It can be saved to distill two or three times to make it usable.
“The hearts” are the next glass. They are composed of ethanol. Aim to collect it at one drop every one to two seconds. Remove it in shot glass quantities to use. The hearts should smell pure.
“The tails” are the ethanol diluted with water. They smell less pure and pleasant. You can save them to distill like you dead the heads., Extra acetone and methyl alcohol will evaporate.
, Redistillation can make a purer alcohol, but it is less safe, since the alcohol is highly flammable.

Start small. You can always build a bigger and better bar as you need.;
, Different alcohol types will require different storage methods. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight should be kept to a minimum. You will need to acquire a refrigerator that is an appropriate size for the bar you have planned. You could also create space in a refrigerator you already own. Opened wine bottles need to be kept cold to prevent flavor from altering.
Beer can be enjoyed at room temperature, however, it is commonly kept cold.
Many liqueurs are refrigerated.
Champagne is nearly always kept chilled.
Any older stock you have that is lower in alcohol content should be refrigerated to preserve flavor.
Most highly alcoholic liquors do not require refrigeration.

, It might be tempting to purchase the highest quality alcohol and liquor, but it's not always necessary to do so. Some liquors are used mainly in mixed drinks, so their flavor isn't as critical as other liquors that are enjoyed alone, without mixing. Lower cost can mean lower quality ingredients, different taste, and different distillation techniques than more expensive brands.
Higher cost does not always entail a better taste!
All alcohol will have the same intoxicating effect, regardless of price.

Choose a recipe.,
Refer to a gravity chart to determine the order in which to pour the liquids.,
Pour the first liquid.,
Float the next liquid on top of the higher-density liquid.,
Clean the spoon or syringe thoroughly.,
Repeat the floating step until your layered drink is completely poured.

,
Finished.

",How to Layer Drinks," You may find a variety of layered drink recipes online or in bartending books.;
, The heaviest, or highest density, liquid should be poured first, followed by the next heaviest and so forth.

, A layered drink in a shooter should be poured to within 0.08 inch (2 mm) of the top of the glass. To determine your pour amount, divide the part of the glass you will be pouring into by the number of liquids that comprise the drink. For example, if your layered drink is made of 3 liquids, then visually divide the glass into 3 parts and pour each liquid accordingly.

, There are 2 methods you may use to float the remaining layers. Whichever method you use, the most important thing you must do is to pour very slowly and carefully, so as to avoid mixing the liquids.

Spoon method. Place the back of a bar spoon or a tablespoon against the inside of the glass so that its tip is directly above the surface of the existing liquid. Slowly pour the lower-density layer over the back of the spoon so that it sits atop the higher density layer.






Syringe method. Fill a syringe that is meant for dispensing liquid oral medications with the desired liquid. Hold the tip of the syringe against the inside of the glass, right above the lower layer, and slowly dispense the new layer so that it floats on top.







, You want to avoid mixing the liquids when you layer drinks, so it is important that you rinse and dry your tool of choice before you float the next liquid.

Sprinkle a tablespoon or two of coarse salt into a small serving plate.,
Wet the rim (or lip) of the glass with a fruit wedge.,
Turn the glass upside down.

,
Dip all sides of the rim into the salt by lightly swirling the glass.

,
Turn the glass upright.",How to Get Salt to Stick to Margarita Glasses," You can also measure a 50-50 ratio of salt and sugar, as this gives a sweet taste., The most popular choice to use are limes, mainly for margaritas. Lemons, oranges, and other citrus fruits can also be used.

,,, Pour your drink into the salted rim glass, garnish it with additional fruit wedges, and enjoy.

Acquire additional equipment.",How to Buy a Keg," Depending on the type of event you are hosting, you need to figure out how much beer you will need. Estimate that party guests will have 1-2 drinks per hour. There are several different sizes of kegs to consider:


Mini keg: A mini keg holds about 5 liters, which is a good amount for bringing to a tailgate party or camping trip.Cornelius keg: A Cornelius keg is a tall, round keg that is commonly used for soft drinks, but they have also been adapted by home brewers to use for beer as well.Log keg (sixth barrel): A log keg holds about 5 gallons, which equals about 55 12-ounce servings, or 41 pints.
Pony keg (quarter barrel): A pony keg holds about 7.5 gallons, which equals about 82 12-ounce servings, or 62 pints.Full keg (half barrel): A full keg holds about 15 gallons, which equals about 165 12-ounce servings, or 124 pints. The full keg is the most common size of keg.;
, There are many places that sell kegs, such as liquor stores, breweries, wineries, and even some restaurants. Choose a place that is close to your party and that sells the type of beer you'd like to buy.

, Planning in advance will ensure that your order will be fulfilled to your specifications. Planning at least 10 days in advance is a good idea.


Some places do have kegs available for last-minute orders, but these may be limited in selection and size.

, If you are planning to serve beer from a keg at a wedding, fundraiser or other special event, you need to get the correct type of permit. These permits are typically issued by your state’s liquor control board.


For private parties such as weddings or holiday parties, apply for a banquet permit. Typically, you will fill out a form, giving information about the event, and pay a fee (around $50).
Nonprofit organizations need a special occasion permit in order to serve beer from a keg at a special event.These are also issued by your state’s liquor control board. They also need a licensed bartender to serve the beer. Be sure to have proof of the bartender’s license with you at the function.

, You will be required to show proof of age when you pick up the keg. This must be government-issued identification, such as your driver’s license, non-driver ID card, military ID, or passport.


You must be at least 21 years old to purchase alcohol in the United States.

, Anyone who accompanies you to pick up the keg, even if they are just in the car, will be required to show proof that they are 21 or older., If you are the person renting the keg and signing the form, you are the one who is responsible for what happens with the beer inside the keg. You are therefore responsible for making sure no minors drink the beer, and those who do drink the beer are also responsible in their behavior.You are also responsible for ensuring that the keg and other items are returned in the same condition as when you rented them.
Some places might require that you provide the address where the keg is going to, the approximate date and time of the beer’s consumption, and your vehicle’s license plate., The store will likely ask for the name of the person who will be returning the keg. This is partly to ensure that the keg is responsibly used and returned in a timely manner by someone 21 years of age or older., You will be charged a refundable deposit fee for the keg itself in addition to the charge for the actual beer. The beer cost will vary depending on the type of beer, how much you are ordering, and where you’re located.


Bring a credit card with you. Even if you pay the fees in cash, you’ll need a credit card for the deposit, which will be charged additional fees if you do not return the keg.
Keg deposits can range from approximately $30 to $75 or more. You may also be charged a nonrefundable keg cleaning fee.
Beers like Budweiser, Miller and Coors are usually cheaper than microbrews, with Budweiser costing $100 for a full keg and other beers like Dogfish Head running about $225 for a full keg.

, Before you leave the store, ask for instructions on how to use the keg. You might be familiar, but it's a good idea to make sure you're clear on how to attach the tap and get the best quality beer from the keg.

, Kegs that are full of beer are heavy. A full keg weighs roughly 162 pounds. Use a dolly if possible, and have a friend help you lift the keg in and out of your vehicle.


Kegs are usually only delivered to licensed establishments, not private residences.

, A tap is needed to attach to the keg in order to dispense the beer. If you don’t already have a tap, you’ll need to rent one. Most places require a refundable tap rental fee (around $50) and a nonrefundable tap cleaning fee (around $10-$15).

, Many establishments have chilling buckets available for rental. These are garbage can sized buckets that the keg will go into, along with ice for keeping the keg cold., A kegerator is a refrigerator that is specially designed to hold a keg and to allow for easy beer dispensing. Many places will rent kegerators by the day, week, month or even on a rent-to-own plan.If you are hosting a special event or are planning to regularly have kegs, a kegerator may be a classier, more versatile option for you.

, A jockey box is a mini cooler that has tubing through which beer will flow to a tap. Hook up your keg to the jockey box, along with a carbon dioxide unit, and this will produce instantly cold beer on tap for your guests.Jockey boxes can be rented with 1, 2 or 4 taps in one unit.

, The beer should be served at about 38 degrees Fahrenheit, but that requires that you keep the beer cold.Use a chilling bucket filled with ice or a kegerator (a refrigerator specially designed for kegs).


Alternately, you can place the keg inside a large garbage bag and fill the bag with ice.
Do not allow the beer to go above 55 degrees F or below 28 degrees F. Beer that is too warm will produce bacterial growth. Beer that has frozen will have reduced quality of flavor and aroma.

, After the keg has arrived at your house, you need to give it time to settle down so the beer is of optimal quality. Situate the keg in the desired location for your event and leave it there for at least an hour before tapping the keg., , Depending on the type of tap you use on the keg, you may need to finish the beer sooner than later.


A manual pump (the kind most often used at a party, for example) will reduce the quality of the beer’s taste rather quickly. In this case, drink the beer within 8 hours. You may be able to stretch this out to one day.Using a kegerator and CO2 to dispense your beer will prolong the quality and freshness of the beer. In this case, pasteurized beer can last up to 3 months. Unpasteurized beer might last about 2 months., Remove all the beer in the keg before you return it. Some places ask that the kegs be returned empty. You are paying for the beer, so you might as well drink it or store it in growlers (large bottles for beer).


You will not get any refund on the keg once it leaves the store where you bought it. Even if the keg is entirely full, you have purchased it and will receive no refund if you request one.

, Before you transport the keg in your vehicle, make sure to remove the tap from the keg. Otherwise, the keg could be considered an open container, which is illegal to have in a moving vehicle in the U.S., When you rented the keg, you should have given the establishment the name of the person returning the keg. This will likely be the same person who rented the keg. This person is the one who will receive the refundable deposit back.


The store might refuse to accept the keg and equipment if the wrong person tries to return them., You don’t have to bring the keg back the morning after a party, but you do need to bring it back in a timely manner. Most places will give a deadline by which the keg needs to be returned. Sometimes this is 5 days, while other places give you up to 2 weeks to return a keg.

, If you rented a tap or a bucket for chilling the keg, be sure to return these with the keg. Then you will receive any refundable fees associated with the keg and accessories.

, The store where you picked up the keg will place an identifying sticker on the keg. They will need this information to make sure the returned keg is the one that was rented., There are strict laws governing the sale of alcohol in the U.S., and some states regulate the sale and storage of beer in kegs. There are some restrictions on keg size and type, so be informed about what your state allows.Check with your state’s liquor control board to find out specifics regarding liquor regulations in your area.

, Kegs can be filled through valves that are either located on the side (open system), which can be easily accessed and filled, or through a closed system valve that requires automated equipment for filling.Closed system kegs are typically more expensive, but they are usually preferred by distributors and breweries that might carry your beer.

, Keg sizes are varied, and the most common sizes are sixth barrel, quarter barrel and half barrel. Consider who you are selling your beer to, and how frequently, when deciding on keg size and number. Will the brewery or distributor ask for smaller sized kegs to start? Or, on the other hand, should you start with larger kegs so that your customers don’t have to change their kegs so often? Knowing your market will go a long way to knowing what size and number of kegs to buy., You can find new and used kegs, and used kegs are certainly a cheaper option. New kegs look better and can be imprinted with your company’s logo, while used kegs may have the former owner’s logo on them. New kegs are usually more easily sanitized, while older kegs can potentially have build-up (called beerstone).If you are buying a used keg, make sure to consider the following:


Make sure the keg does not leak.
Make sure the keg is sanitized and able to be cleaned.
Make sure the keg is not dented (verify that the keg will hold the correct amount of beer and any dents do not subtract from the correct amount)., You don’t have to buy a keg for your business. There are leasing companies that charge a monthly fee per keg. Many of these companies have multi-year contracts (such as 5-year contracts). A typical rate is $1.70 per keg per month , Kegs can be filled through valves that are either located on the side (open system), which can be easily accessed and filled, or through a closed system valve that requires automated equipment for filling.Closed system kegs are typically more expensive and will likely require additional equipment that can run from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars.

, Keg sizes are varied, and the most common sizes are sixth barrel, quarter barrel and half barrel. Consider how much beer you will be brewing and how quickly it will be consumed when deciding on keg size and number.The most common keg for the home brewer is the Cornelius keg (also called a “Corny keg”). These are the same tall, thin shape that is used to hold soda.

, You can find new and used kegs, and used kegs are certainly a cheaper option. New kegs look better, while used kegs may have the former owner’s logo on them. New kegs are usually more easily sanitized, while older kegs can potentially have build-up (called beerstone).If you are buying a used keg, make sure to consider the following:


Make sure the keg does not leak.
Make sure the keg is sanitized and able to be cleaned.
Make sure the keg is not dented (verify that the keg will hold the correct amount of beer and any dents do not subtract from the correct amount)., Storing your beer and dispensing it from kegs may require additional equipment.This equipment includes:


CO2 tank: A high pressure CO2 tank will provide carbonation and enable you to dispense the beer from the keg. Purchase one from a welding supply store or online.
Pressure regulator: This instrument will regulate how much CO2 is going into your keg, and consequently, how carbonated your beer will be.
Connection lines: You will need connectors to hook up the CO2 tank to the keg. Get two quick disconnects, a gas line and a picnic faucet.

Include the most common liquors.,
Add cocktail mixers and liqueurs.,
Make room for accents and garnish.",How to Stock a Bar Cart1," Most cocktails can be made with one of the following base spirits: gin, white rum, vodka, bourbon, tequila and brandy. One bottle of each should be the foundation of any well-stocked bar cart. It’s not uncommon to include more than one bottle of each, especially if you already know which liquors you use the most frequently.You could expand the basics by including two bottles of each liquor – an average brand and a top shelf brand. The difference between them is, of course, the price. Top shelf liquors are more expensive than other brands.
Flavored liquors are popular, but they aren’t essential for a basic set up since their uses can be fairly limited.;
, You can make most cocktails with one of the following base mixers: dry vermouth, sweet vermouth or Lillet, Cointreau or triple sec and bitters (angostura, orange, etc.). One bottle of each mixer is fine. If you have favorites or anticipate using one of them frequently, go ahead and get a second bottle. The most common liqueurs and cordials to have on hand are limoncello, Bailey’s Irish Crème and Grand Marnier. One of each is plenty.Keep basic grocery store mixers on hand. Coke, orange juice, ginger ale and tonic are all very popular in cocktails.To avoid wasting mixers, buy the tiny bottles and cans. You can use these individually as needed.

, You won’t need these items for every cocktail you make, but it’s standard to provide fresh lemon and lime wedges with drinks. Cocktail cherries, olives and/or onions and simple syrup should be in any well-stocked bar cart. Keep a small, preferably covered bin or section in your cart set aside for these items.Don’t forget about cocktail sticks, which are essential for holding garnishes. Some people like to have them just for decoration.Straws and swivel sticks are also good to have in your bar cart.

Buy local.,
Go to a natural foods store.,
Try a supermarket.,
Visit a restaurant with a large selection of beer.,
Attend an organic foods trade show.,
Shop online.",How to Buy Organic Beer1," Nowadays, advancements in home brewing have made it possible for small brewing companies to pop up locally. Many of these small brewing companies do not use many or any chemical additives, partially to appeal to the organic niche, but also to cut down on costs. Look in a phone book or local directory for nearby brewing companies. Contact any companies you do find and inquire about whether they have any organic brews.


You can also try looking at a local farmer’s market. Beer is a product made from natural ingredients, after all, and many farmer’s markets sell food and drink products made from locally grown crops as well as the crops themselves. These markets are a good place to look for organic goods to begin with, since many small farmers run organic farms.;
, Not every product in a natural foods store is organic, but many are and many others at least contain organic components. Since these stores are naturally small, the selection of beer or other alcoholic beverages there might be limited. If the store owner did not get a state permit to sell alcohol, it may not even carry any. Many natural food stores do have organic beer, though, and the selection will likely be large enough to give you a basic selection.

, Recent changes in U.S. law have led to an increase in organic breweries and brews.Moreover, the interest in organic food and drink only seems to be increasing as time goes on. As a result, it will be much easier to find organic beer at your local supermarket now than it would have been five years ago. The selection of organic beers will probably be notably less than the selection of non-organic beers, but you should at least be able to find something.

, A restaurant that has a wide selection of beer will likely include one or two organic brands. While you will not be able to buy them by the caseload at a restaurant, trying an organic brew or two at a restaurant is a good way to figure out what you like before you invest in a large amount of it.

, Every so often, an organization that promotes organic food, like the Organic Trade Association, will hold an expo, trade show, or conference to promote the organic lifestyle and awareness of organic brands. These events often have an area in which producers of organic goods can sell their products to interested buyers. These goods can include organic beer.

, As with any other hard-to-find or specialty product, the Internet is the organic beer buyer’s best friend. You can buy directly from organic breweries or through organic grocer websites. One notable benefit of buying online is that you can comparison shop much easier, and you can also look up reviews to determine what the flavor and quality of the beer is like as well as the reputation of the company.

Invest in four to five basic types of glassware.,
Stock at least one cocktail shaker, mixing glass and strainer at all times.,
Keep multiple jiggers and bar spoons within easy reach.,
Include a corkscrew, paring knife, cutting board and ice bucket.",How to Stock a Bar Cart2," Glassware can get really elaborate and fancy, but a well-stocked bar cart should have a variety of short glasses and a variety of tall glasses.Short glasses include shot glasses and lowballs. The essential taller glasses are pint glasses, highballs and martini glasses.Six to eight of each is ideal for a basic set up.


If you’re serving wine, you’ll need to have wine glasses on hand. At minimum you should have one type that will hold any wine you plan to serve. However, most bartenders believe reds and whites should have different glasses. That choice is up to you.

, One of each is the minimum requirement for a basic set up. If you’re having a big party or plan to make lots of different kinds of cocktails, you should have two or three of each stocked on the cart. Many cocktail shakers come equipped with a strainer device on the top, but it’s wise to have a separate strainer around., Jiggers are small glasses used to measure different amounts of liquor. Some people like to mix drinks by eyeballing the liquor as they pour, but this isn’t recommended. Jiggers allow you to measure exactly. Bar spoons have thin handles that are long enough to reach the bottom of a shaker. You will use these constantly to stir, mix and layer cocktails.If you are a bartender for someone else, or if you're setting up someone else's bar cart, you definitely need to include several jiggers.
Jiggers and bar spoons take up relatively little space, so try to keep at least six to eight of each stocked in the cart.

, It’s important to have these items on hand, although they tend to be the most easily forgotten ones! If you’re serving wine, at least one quality corkscrew is absolutely necessary. The paring knife and cutting board are mostly for keeping up with garnishes, so at minimum have one of each.If your bar cart doesn’t come equipped with a mini fridge (most don’t), then an ice bucket is imperative. If you serve a lot of wine, spend a little extra money and invest in a good corkscrew that can pull corks quickly without breaking them.

Create a theme.,
Arrange the bottles and equipment the way you want to.,
Keep a book or list of your favorite cocktail recipes handy.",How to Stock a Bar Cart3," If you’re stocking your home bar cart, take a little time to personalize it and make it your own. Themed carts are becoming popular in some circles. One favorite is a vintage-themed bar cart. You could stock it with vintage glassware and vintage-style tools. You could even go all-out and invest in a bar cart that is vintage.Sports-themed bar carts are also popular. You could deck yours out with team-themed drinks, napkins in team colors and a decal of your favorite team’s logo right on the cart.
You could also base your theme around a particular type of drink and stock the bar with only the items needed for that. For example, you could set up a martini-themed bar cart for a party.

, There are no rules about specific bar cart set ups. You can arrange yours however you’d like. You could take the practical approach and organize yours according to what you use the most. On the other hand, perhaps you have some really beautiful bottles or rare vintages – in that case, arrange your cart to showcase them.

, A basic book of cocktail recipes is good to have on hand no matter what. Of course, these days you can just keep one stored digitally in your smartphone, but traditionally every bar set up includes one of these books. Home bar set ups often have personalized recipe books, sometimes even leather-bound and monogrammed.


If you’re having a party, whip up a few signature cocktails for the event and keep the recipes listed nearby, just in case you need a reference point.

Know the difference between natural and organic.,
Know the difference between ""100% organic"" and ""organic.,
Glance at the ingredients.,
Check out third-party reviews.,
Research the company's brewing policies and practices.",How to Buy Organic Beer2," Natural products can contain natural ingredients that were grown using chemical pesticides, and as such, there may be higher traces of chemicals in a non-organic natural beer than in an organic natural beer. All organic beers will also be natural beers, however, since organic beer is made with natural ingredients.

,""The USDA has specific guidelines about what products can be labeled with an organic seal. A product labeled as “100% organic” uses all natural ingredients that have been organically produced, and the product itself contains no chemicals. A product simply labeled as “organic” is at least 95 percent organic, but less than 100 percent. Usually, this means that some small trace of chemical was used during the bottling process.


Note that beers containing less than 95 percent organic ingredients but more than 70 percent can also say ""made with organic ingredients"" on the label, but any food or drink containing less than 70 percent cannot use the word ""organic"" on the label at all.

, If you are uncertain about whether or not the product is organic, a quick glance at the ingredients should give you a good idea of what you are getting into. If you spot any ingredient on the list that you are uncertain about, look it up to determine if it is natural or chemical before making your purchase.

, Reviews are helpful in two ways. Firstly, if another customer finds out that the beer is not truly organic, a review stating such will likely be posted. Secondly, reviews also give you a good idea about the taste of the beer. Buying organic is great, but that is no reason to give up on taste. Checking out reviews before you buy will give you a good idea of what to expect as far as flavor is concerned.


Go to a website that sells or reviews beer, but do not rely solely on the brewing company’s website to provide you with accurate reviews.The reviews on a brewing company’s website could be filtered or skewed.

, Read about what the company believes and how dedicated it is to producing a high-quality, organic product. A dedicated organic brewery will likely be active and informative, while a more lax company is more likely to provided limited information. The more information a brewery provides, the more trusted it proves itself, typically speaking.

Assess your budget.,
Evaluate your space considerations.,
Browse beer making kits from several suppliers.,
Walk yourself through the brewing process to ensure you have everything needed.",How to Buy a Beer Making Kit," Beer making supplies tend to make up for their own cost quickly through the lowered cost of brewing beer yourself. However, high-end kits can still represent a major investment. As a novice brewer, it may be best to buy an inexpensive kit, as you can always expand your equipment later.


Low-cost brewing kits often exclude equipment that you might be expected to own already, such as a large stockpot for boiling the wort. Also, you can re-use bottles from store-bought beer to bottle your own brews.
There are some compromises involved when buying less expensive equipment. Plastic bucket fermenters (when compared to their more expensive glass counterparts) pose a risk of developing scratches that can harbor bacteria that can ruin your beer. In addition, using a simple ice bath to chill your wort (rather than an immersion chiller) chills the wort more slowly, giving unwanted bacteria more time to develop.;
, The space in which you plan to brew will determine which brewing kit is best for you.


Those working with limited space, such as apartment dwellers, should look for space-saving options like stackable plastic buckets for fermenting and bottling.
If you don't have access to a lawn outside your home, you won't be able to run the exhaust water from an immersion chiller to the outdoors. In this case, chilling the wort using an ice bath is best.
The size of your stove burners is also an important consideration. If you have small, less powerful burners, you may want to use a kit that calls for only a partial boil - typically 3 gallons (11 L). Larger 5 or 10 gallon (18.9 or 37.9 L) boils will be difficult on a small stove.

, There are several major online retailers selling home brewing equipment, most notably Mr. Beer, MoreBeer, and Northern Brewer. If you live in an urban area, you may also be able to visit a home brewing supply store.


Buying online has the advantage of letting you read customer reviews and compare kits from different manufacturers side by side. Buying in-store gives you the benefit of personal advice and allows you to avoid shipping costs.

, Before brewing for the first time with your new kit, walk yourself through the process. Make sure you have everything you'll need, including additional items like towels for maintaining a clean, dry work area. Attempting to brew with an incomplete setup may lead you to have to throw out your half-finished beer.

Develop the concept.,
Hire an experienced mixologist to help design, execute and promote the menu.,
Take into account seasonal climate changes and regionally celebrated festivities.,
Consider the number of items to include on the menu.,
Place your most profitable specialty drinks near the top of the menu.,
Cost the menu properly.",How to Create a Cocktail Menu," Industry trends over the last decade or so have significantly expanded the range of possibilities in terms choosing a concept for your cocktail menu. The single-style bar concept, such as a martini bar, focuses a particular type of cocktail, while single-spirit bars focus on a particular variety of premium or regionally fashionable spirits, such as single-malt whiskey, schnapps or micro-brews. While progressive concepts like these have proven to be successful in certain markets, the variety concept, designed to please a broad range of tastes and preferences, remains the most popularly employed.


Consider the regular clientele when creating a cocktail menu. Ultimately, success or failure will largely be tied to how well the needs of the customer are met. For that reason, knowing your customer base is vital. Begin by performing a demographics study to better understand the clientele that frequents your establishment. For example, the cocktail menu for a college bar will differ from that of an upscale lounge or a neighborhood bar. Conversely, a restaurant bar's clientele will typically vary from that of a pub or tavern. Develop an intimate knowledge of who you are serving and cater to their preferences as much as possible in order to help ensure the success of your new cocktail menu.
Consider the style and motif of the venue when creating a cocktail menu. Tailoring the menu to suit the theme of the venue adds an element of authenticity and consistency to an establishment. For example, a long list of specialty martinis might seem out of place in a sports bar, as would boilermakers, jello shots and Long Island iced teas at a martini bar.;
, Certain types of venues will benefit significantly from following this current industry trend. The role of the modern bartender has evolved in recent years such that the position more closely resembles an artisan or a sommelier, as opposed to your average, neighborhood beer jockey. Choose a head bartender with the passion and talent to drive up sales, and allow him to lend his expertise to the design of your cocktail menu.


Seek out talent with a proven track-record of success. Recruiting high quality bar staff locally has long been considered a good practice, given the customer base often will follow local talent from one venue to another. Gambling on inexperienced, unproven talent is generally considered a risk.

, Certain cocktails may seem misplaced when served during the wrong time of year or in poorly suited locations. For example, a venue in Florida will sell more mint juleps during the middle of July than Irish coffees or hot-buttered rums. Likewise, daiquiris or margaritas are a hard sell in February, especially in locations that experience harsh winters.


Consider the seasonal availability of your ingredients. Cocktails that include tropical fruits and other seasonably available ingredients will impact the cost of doing business. These seasonal fluctuations should be taken into account when costing your menu.

, While you may be inclined to limit the size of the menu out of logistical concerns, keep in mind the high degree of interchangeability of ingredients inherent in the typical cocktail menu. That said, limiting the amount of cocktails served will have a positive influence in terms of reducing labor intensity and inventory. Limit the amount of items that require a specific ingredient not used on other cocktails, or create additional cocktails that make use of rarely used ingredients in order to maintain the interchangeability of your menu.

, Typically, the first 2 or 3 items on any menu will be among the sales leaders, regardless of customer preference. Listing your most profitable items first is a well-established, widely used technique that is effective in countering the average customers' tendency towards price shopping.

, The industry standard for determining the mark-up of cocktails is 4 to 1. In other words, the cost of sales of a given menu item should be close to 25% of the set price. Although some specialty cocktails may be difficult to price within these parameters due to the cost of ingredients, pricing other menu items higher than the standard mark-up can help to offset this issue.

Choose a room to set up your bar in.,
Clear some bookshelf space for a small bar.,
Turn a vintage armoire into a full service bar.,
Choose a bar cart to make any space into a makeshift bar.,
Place a makeshift counter in an unused corner.,
Repurpose a vintage suitcase or trunk into a mini bar.",How to Create a Home Bar in a Small Space1," Look around your house and pick the room where you are most likely to entertain guests or spend a lot of time hanging out. If you have a furnished basement, it’s a great spot for a bar. If you entertain in your living room, set your bar up there. It’s also easy to set your bar up in or near the kitchen so you have access to water.


Bar carts will be explained more later, but these allow you to set the bar up anywhere. Bar carts are versatile because you can change which room the bar is in each day, if you want to.;
, Use an existing bookshelf, or set up a new one. This is helpful because it uses available vertical space, and it doesn’t have much width or depth. Clear two or three shelves on a bookshelf in the bar area.Use one shelf for drinks, one shelf for glassware, and one shelf for extras like shakers or an ice bucket.
For an existing bookshelf, leave the rest of it full of books or anything else to add a bit of atmosphere to the bar area.
If you set up a new bookshelf, make the whole thing into an extensive bar or use some of the space for decorations.

, Use an old armoire that is already taking up space in your house by moving it into the bar area. Fill it with your drinks, glassware, and other bar tools. The benefit of an armoire is that you can open and close it as needed.When the bar is not in use, close it up so it looks like any other piece of furniture.

, Bar carts are perfect for extra small bars because they hardly take up any space. You have many options in terms of size and design. Make sure you choose a cart with at least two levels, one for alcohol and one for glassware.Bar carts are easily moved, so it’s possible to set up a bar for a short time and move the cart when you don’t need it anymore. Move it out to the patio or deck for summer cookouts.
If possible, be sure to choose a cart that comes at least up to your waist. You and your guests don’t want to have to bend over to mix up a drink.

, Setting up a free-standing bar, an island, or even a TV tray can turn any unused corner into a bar. Find a corner in the bar room that has nothing in it and set up a counter. Make sure is out of the primary walking path of the room.Choose a bar or an island that has the counter space you want and also has some storage under the counter. You’ll find many options to fit the decor of the room.
If you use a TV tray for the bar, you’ll want to have some kind of shelving or cabinet nearby for extra storage space.

, Take an old piece of luggage that you can’t get rid of, or one you found at a thrift shop, and set it up on a stand as a makeshift bar. Leave the lid open and stock it with as many bottle and glasses as you can. This can be set out on an island for display or can be your whole bar.Take out any upholstery or straps so you have only the suitcase shell. This will make it easier to store everything you want.
Combine the TV tray idea with the suitcase for a stylish and space-saving option.

Buy liquor that you know you will drink.,
Include a handful of mixers in your drink selection.,
Select a variety of glasses.",How to Create a Home Bar in a Small Space2," When you have limited space, you can’t stock your bar with every liquor available. Choose a variety of liquor so guests have options, but remember you will be the one most often using the bar. Stock one kind of the basic alcohols, including vodka, rum, gin, tequila, and whiskey.Wine and beer are also good to have on hand, but may need to be kept chilled.
A small space won’t allow you to have four or five kinds of every type of alcohol. One of each, or two of some, is enough to give people multiple drink options.

, While some people take their alcohol straight, others prefer to cut their alcohol with something gentler or mix cocktails. Club soda, orange or cranberry juice, tonic water, 7 Up, and Coke are common mixers to have on hand.If necessary, you can store these in the kitchen and only set them out when necessary.
Since some mixers must be kept cold and don’t last a long time, you don’t need to always keep these stocked. Buy them when you know you have guests coming over.

, Different alcohols are traditionally served in different glassware. Beer is often served in a mug or pilsner glass. Whiskey is served in a short rocks glass. Cocktails are often served in tall glasses. Include an efficient selection of glassware in your home bar. You don’t need a dozen of every glass, but stock at least a few of each.It also depends on how often you entertain guests and how many there are likely to be. For personal use, one glass each of five or six types is plenty. Store extras for guests somewhere else and only get them out when you need to.

Hang a shelf or rack for wall storage.,
Organize drinks and glasses on trays.,
Set out some basic bar tools.,
Store utensil-like bar tools in a jar or canister.,
Keep a couple of towels at the bar at all times.",How to Create a Home Bar in a Small Space3," You may not have room for a large set of cabinets. Instead, hang a couple of shelves on the wall for drink and glass storage. Add a rack that hangs glassware upside down to existing cabinetry for more storage.


Hang shelving at about chest level so it is easy to access. Shelves don’t need to be large. A two foot long shelf that’s six inches deep will hold more than you might think.
Look at antique stores or home improvement stores for wall-mount storage options.
Using an old medicine cabinet will give you a good amount of storage and won’t take up much room on the wall. You also have the option to keep it closed when the bar is not in use.

, No matter what type of bar you set up, trays are a great way to keep the area organized. Use basic wooden serving trays or shiny metal ones, depending on the look you want. Trays are easily moved, so they’re great for setting up a short-term bar for an event.When you have room, set up a tray for drinks, a tray for glassware, and a tray for extra stuff, like stirrers and shakers.
Keep an extra tray or two on hand to use for carrying drinks to serve to guests.

, Get a bar spoon, which is extra long, or a swizzle stick for mixing cocktails. Have a couple of shot glasses or small measuring cups for measuring out ingredients. Have a paring knife for cutting fruit. Have a shaker and strainer for mixing shaken cocktails., Place tools for stirring, crushing, or measuring in an open-top container. Make sure you don’t cram them too tightly or they will be hard to get out. Set them somewhere in plain sight on the bar so any time you have guests they’ll be easy to find.Jiggers, shakers, and other larger items won’t fit in the container. Set them right next to it to maintain an orderly setup.

, Think about how often you spill something in the kitchen, then translate that to a place where the sole activity is pouring liquids. Keeping towels at your bar will help keep messes contained. Without a towel, you’ll waste time running to find one frequently.If your bar setup allows for a towel rack, this is always helpful. If not, set towels on the shelf where your assorted bar tools are kept.

Purchase gluten-free beer at local retail shops, microbreweries and online.,
Assess the ingredients to determine if the beer is gluten free.,
Examine the beer label for gluten levels.,
Look for popular substitutions for the gluten-rich grains found in beer.",How to Buy Gluten Free Beer,"


Shop for gluten-free beer at local beer and wine shops. Because select national distributors are now making gluten-free beer, it is often available at local retail stores and even supermarkets. Look in the beer section of your local market. If the store has a specified gluten-free section, check there as well.
Purchase gluten-free beer at organic markets. Many stores specializing in organic merchandise offer gluten-free beer, in addition to other gluten-free products.
Buy gluten-free beer at microbreweries. Some microbreweries are branching out into gluten-free products. Because microbreweries brew smaller amounts of specialized beers, it is typically more cost effective for small breweries to offer gluten-free beers than large distributors.
Purchase gluten-free beer online. Several websites offer listings of domestic and international gluten-free beers, and some include reviews of the beers. Search for ""gluten-free beer"" to access several lists of online distributors.;
, Avoid any beer that contains wheat or barley. Several beer products that are advertised as ""gluten free"" are actually low in gluten, not 100% gluten free. Some brewing companies claim their filtering processes make gluten undetectable. However, if the product contains even small amounts of barley or wheat, it is not gluten free. The only way to be sure that the beer is truly gluten free is to carefully examine the list of ingredients.

, Beer distributors who brew low-gluten and gluten-free beers are required to test and record gluten levels in each batch of beer. The levels are recorded in parts per million (ppm). There are no international standards for gluten-free products, so the ppm records provide a comparison for products. For example, in Australia, only a beer with no detectable gluten can be advertised as gluten free. However, in England, a beer with less than 20 ppm is considered gluten free.

, Buckwheat and sorghum are the most common substitutions for barley and wheat in gluten-free beers. Other gluten-free ingredients used in beer may include corn, maize, rice, sunflower, flax, quinoa, millet, soybean, amaranth, tef and raggi.

Sanitize all of your equipment, especially your Carboy, either with some sterilizing solution or with hot, soapy water--but make sure you don't damage the Carboy.,
Rinse Carboy and pour in apple juice.,Put the 500g of sugar into the heatproof jug and fill it up to about a liter with hot water from the kettle, stir until all the sugar has dissolved then add it to the apple juice

,
Add the yeast and put the rubber bung and air trap on.,
Leave for a few days.

,
Using your hydrometer, ;;;wait until it has a SG level of 1030;;;, then you add the finings and wait until all the yeast has settled to the bottom and the cider is crystal clear.

,
Be sure to get rid of all the yeast.,
Now it's time to bottle your cider, by simply siphoning the cider into sterilized bottles which you can sterilize like you did with the Carboy.,
You can now either enjoy your still cider or try to achieve secondary fermentation which will be explained now.,
Put a few teaspoons of sugar into both bottles, then just a little bit of yeast from the Carboy and screw the caps on tightly, leave for several weeks and Voila you have fizzy cider!

",How to Brew Cheap Cider," An excellent sanitizing solution is 2 tbs (un-perfumed) bleach per 5 gallons of water.;
, After rinsing out the Carboy to get rid of the soap or sterilizing solution, pour the apple juice into the Carboy.

,, Remember to fill the air trap just under halfway with water

,,, If you have the benefit of a wine filter you should use that to get rid of the last remnants of yeast but don't worry if you don't because all it means is that you have to be a bit more careful when siphoning the cider off into the large vessel, e.g. a bowl or saucepan, but remember to keep the yeast at the bottom of the Carboy if you want to try secondary fermentation.

, if there is any left over just drink it or put it in a smaller bottle.

Be good with customer service.,
Have solid mixology skills.,
Be technologically competent.,
Be organized and prepared at all times.,
Compare several schools.,
If the school will allow you, sit in on a class when the students are taking their final test.,
Steer away from unlicensed schools, online courses, and bartending schools that pitch job guarantees, or use pressure tactics to register you.,
Read testimonies online about the schools you're checking out.,
Consider the costs involved.",How to Choose a Bartending School," You'll need to learn to interact well with customers, including learning standard conflict resolution skills. A bartending school should include this in its training.;
, The standards of bartending have been turned up a notch. On top of the classic drinks, today’s bartenders need to be up on the modern drinks that are served in the trendy bars and clubs. There are more liquor brands, more flavors, and more high-end spirits on the market today than ever before.


A bartender needs to know more about wine knowledge and service nowadays – customers are more wine savvy.

, Cash registers are out, and the modern POS (point of sales) registers are in. The course you choose must include proper training on how to use this technology efficiently and well.

, Speed, efficiency, and the ability to multitask is more of a requirement of the bartender than it ever has been before.

, Sit in on a class and see what is being discussed. Check out the instruction manual (for example, no one is drinking ‘Pink Squirrels’ and ‘Grasshoppers’ anymore, so if these sorts of drinks are in there, it's dated). Talk to the instructors and students and see what sort of vibe you get.

, That way, you can talk to graduates that have completed the entire course – at the end of the course.

, Take your time, do your research and always compare the facilities and training of several schools before you make a final decision.

, What things do former students say about the school? What sorts of work have former students being able to find after doing the course?

, Is the course something you're willing to outlay money for and do you have confidence that you'll recoup that money quickly afterward? Find out about refunds should you start the course but decide it just isn't for you; it happens.

Drink your creation.",How to Brew Beer Using All Grain Method," Beer by definition has to contain at least 60% malted barley which is the base malt for all the world's beers. Other types of grains can be added (oats, rye, wheat, etc.). These are called adjuncts and should only make up to 30% of your grain bill. Malted barley is made by partially germinating the barley in warm water, then drying/cooking it before the seed splits. The barley is processed in different ways to get different characteristics. Typically you want around 8-15 lbs (4-7 Kg) base malt per 5 gallons (21 L), depending on the type of beer you're brewing. 2-row British pale malt is great to start off with. Add 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 Kg) of specialty grains (crystal, caramel, etc.) to get some good flavor. Lighter crystals are good to add sweetness. Toasted malts will create more of a malty body. Taste the grain as you formulate the recipe. This is a great indicator on the quality of the grain.;
, The grain needs to be cracked open to gain access to the starches and enzymes inside. The home brew shop should have a mill to use if not one can be purchased or constructed. Usually these are two rollers about .045"" apart that the grain is fed into.

, The grain contains mostly starch that needs to be converted to sugar so that the yeast will have something to ferment. The enzymes in the grain are going to do this and they do it well. The mash tun will hold the grain at 68 degrees Celsius for 1-2 hours. The mash tun can be made in different ways but a 6 gallon (22 L) bucket with a false bottom (a mesh at the bottom for drainage) will be the cheapest. A good recommendation for a cheap better quality mash tun would be converting a cooler. 10 gallon (40 L) round Igloo or Gatorade coolers work the best. False bottoms are sold for cheap and easy to install, or make your own. To make your own, get a 12"" toilet water line with stainless braiding on it and cut the ends off. Remove the stainless braid. Crimp one end closed with pliers and attach the other end to a 3/8"" flex copper piece with a hose clamp. Use a drilled rubber stopper where the hole is near the bottom of the cooler to prevent leaking. A valve or vinyl hose clamp can be used to control the flow of your hot liquor after the mash.

, For every 1 pound (0.5 Kg) of grain heat 1 quart (1/4 gallon, 1 L) of water to 170 degrees (76ºC). Pour the 170 degree (76ºC) water along with the grains stirring as you go. You want to uniformly add the grain along with the water so it doesn't get too hot or form clumps. The temperature should be anywhere from 148-158 degrees (64-70ºC). If it is somewhere in the middle you're golden. The beta amylase enzymes are active toward the 145 degree (63ºC) end, which make fermentable sugars, making a dry beer. The alpha amylase enzymes are active toward the 160 degree (71ºC) end, making unfermentable sugars, making a sweet beer. The balance -mash temperature - is up to the brewer and the type of beer you're making. Insulate the mash tun by wrapping it up in a blanket or sleeping bag or jackets (not necessary with a cooler mash tun). While you are mashing, start heating up 2 quarts (1/2 gallon, 2 L) of water per pound (0.5 Kg).

, After about an hour the conversion from starch to sugar will be complete. You can test this with iodine. Put a small amount of wort on a white surface (like a plate) and add a drop of iodine. If it turns black starches still exist and it needs to sit longer. NOTE: Discard the wort with the iodine do not put it back in the wort. If it doesn't change color at all the conversion is complete. Start draining off the wort from the grain bed SLOWLY.

, Sparging is the process of rinsing the hot liquid off of the grain bed. The best no nonsense method is to do it in 2 steps. When the hot liquid is done draining, add half the sparge water at 180-190 degrees (80-90ºC) and let it sit 20 minutes. Drain. Then do it again. You want around 6 1/2 gallons (25 L) of hot liquid in the end. This is the beer wort. The most efficient way to sparge is called continuous sparging. With this method you control a slow run off of your hot liquid while adding 170 degree water to the top of the grain bed at the same rate. Take the first couple quarts of hot liquid and pour back on to the grain bed to filter out husks which cause off flavors when boiled. Continue sparging until your pre-boil volume is reached -usually about 6 gallons (23L) for a 60 minute boil 5 gallon (21L) batch.

, Bring the temperature up to boiling.

, Hops are a green flower from a hop vine. They add bitterness to the beer which provides a balance against the sweetness of the sugars. Hops also add aroma and flavor. There are many different varieties. Fuggle, East Kent Golding, and Cascade are good varieties you can't go wrong with. The higher the alpha acid percentage and time boiled, the more bitter it will be. 4-5% is about average and 10-12% is high. There are calculations to figure out the IBU's (International Bitterness Units) to get a more exact bittering estimate. 10-20 IBU is low to average bitterness (think light lager) 40 is moderately high (think pale ale) and 50-60+ is very bitter (think IPA). Some IPA recipes boast over 100 IBUs. The longer the hop boils the more bitterness will be extracted.

, The cheapest fermentor is a 6 gallon (22.7 L) bucket with an airlock on the top. An airlock is a device that only lets air out and not in. They should be cleaned of any crud from the previous ferment and sanitized with Iodophor solution (check your local homebrew shop) or a bleach solution, two tablespoons per 5 gallons (18.9 L) of COLD water. DO NOT SCRUB PLASTIC FERMENTERS! Microscopic scratches in plastic harbor wild yeast and bacteria that will destroy your beer! Let this sit for 20 minutes then rinse with clean filtered water twice. This sanitizing step is best done while the wort is boiling, otherwise its an hour spent waiting not getting anything else accomplished.

, Boil the wort for at least 1 hour at a rolling boil. The more vigorous a boil the better. Once the wort is boiling add the flavoring hops. 1 oz of pellets is good to start with. Make sure to stir wort while it is getting up to temperature. While the wort is boiling make sure the fermenters are clean and ready. 10-15 minutes before the end of the hour add the flavoring hops usually about 1/2 oz (15g). 5 minutes from the end add the aroma hops 1/2 oz (15g). Aroma hops can also be added to the wort BEFORE boiling, when you transfer the beer wort from the mash tun to the kettle (this is called First Wort Hopping). This allows the aromas to nestle their way into the beer at an early stage. They will not boil off like a lot of the aromas do when added to the boil 5-10 mins before the boil ends.

, You can purchase a wort chiller but it is unnecessary if you have boiled less than 3 gallons (11.4 L). The chiller will cool the wort down to 70-75 (20-24ºC) so you can pitch the yeast. Without a chiller you can still get good results by placing the wort boiling pot into an ice bath, either in a large sink, or the bathtub. It is imperative to chill the boiling wort down to below 80 degrees as fast as possible. Beer is the most susceptible to infection at, or around, 140 degrees. It is very important to go from 212 to 70 degrees as fast as possible.

, Pour the finished wort through a strainer to remove the hops into the fermentation bucket. If needed, add only pure clean water to top the fermenter off at a little over 5 gallons (18.9 L). Seal it up and shake the heck out of it to incorporate much-needed oxygen into the wort. This is safe to do now that the wort is chilled and very important since it provides the initial oxygen for aerobic yeast reproduction. When the wort is 70-75 degrees (20-24ºC) pitch the yeast. Using a filter is not necessary if a whirlpool is used. A whirlpool is simply when you stir the wort hard and let it spin in the boil kettle for 10 minutes right at flame out (don't worry, the wort is still around 195 degrees, but still keep the lid on while it's spinning to avoid contamination). This process uses centrifugal force to separate solids from the wort just like a centrifuge in a chemistry lab. If the wort is drained off from the side of the pot, no hops or trub will be poured into the fermenter.

, If using a liquid yeast, a starter is recommended for healthier pitching rates, although not necessary. If using dry yeast, rehydrate with warm water before pitching.

, After 1-2 weeks of primary fermentation transfer to a clean and sanitized secondary to clear the beer up and let it condition. Use a sanitized siphon to get the beer from the primary to the secondary. The beer will have most of the alcohol in it already so it will be more resistant to nasties in the air. Tips: Avoid sucking on the siphon and getting mouth germs into the beer. Definitely avoid splashing at this stage, since alcohol is easily oxidized and will make the beer funky. If you can pump some CO2 gas (paintball cartridge size will do) into and fill the secondary beforehand you are an ace and will have the best beer transfer possible. Be careful, but realize you aren't getting ready to do surgery or anything.

, Kegging much easier than bottling. It costs more money, but in the end it saves you a lot of time. Soda kegs are used with a CO2 tank to pressurize. Clean and sanitize the keg. Fill it with CO2 gas to provide a protective blanket (CO2 is heavier than Oxygen and sinks, thus preventing the alcohol present from oxidizing) and gently siphon the beer in. Seal the lid and chill it in your fridge down to at least 40 degrees. (this is not necessary to chill it but the colder it is the more gas will dissolve into it). Hook it up to the tank to pressurize to 20 psi. It will take about 1 hour of rolling the keg around under pressure (while purging off excess pressure that builds up) to get the CO2 in the beer if you want to drink it right away. Otherwise, let it sit for a couple days at 30 psi. If bottling is your method of choice, soak bottles in PBW or your preferred cleanser for a few hours to remove organics and make peeling off labels easier. Rinse well, then soak in Iodaphor or your preferred sanitizer for at least 5 minutes. Do not rinse. Place bottles on sanitary dishwasher rack or bottle tree to drip dry. Siphon your beer from the secondary carboy to a bottling bucket along with a pre-boiled sugar water solution (1/3 to 1/2 cup of cane sugar to prime depending on your desired level of carbonation). Cap each bottle with sanitized caps (boiling works fine) and let sit at room temperature for at least 2 weeks, more if you have the patience.

, Lower the pressure to 12 - 15 psi by purging off some gas from the gas inlet. The easiest way to serve is using a cold plate in a cooler. No fridge and it is portable. Run the lines through the cold plate and throw some ice on it. Then run a line with a tap out of the cooler. It is still very important to keep a cold keg cold. Never let your beer warm up unnecessarily.

, Notice how fresh your beer is. Notice how much better your fresh beer is compared with even top micro brews in your area. If not, try again. You'll get there.

Store beer in the correct position.,
Store beer away from light.,
Get the storage temperature right.,
Know how long you can store beer for, especially if you're seeking to age the beer.,
Consider keeping records of beer you've drunk straight after purchase and beer that has been stored.,
Drink opened beer and don't even try storing it.",How to Store Beer," Just like wine, there is a right way and a not-so-good way to store bottles of beer that you're keeping for longer. Stand beer upright instead of putting it on its side during storage – even brewers like Chimay recommend this over side storage.This will ensure that the yeast (sediment) settles at the bottom of the beer bottle, rather than leaving a yeast ring or watermark on the side that won't ever settle or mix in.Also, modern corks don't tend to dry out or soak up air, so that's not a problem when storing beer and not a reason for side bottle storage (particularly since the beer touching the cork over a long period of time can actually taint the taste of the beer). And the best reason for storing beer upright is that it oxidizes less, thereby ensuring it keeps longer!, Choose a dim or dark location for beer storage, as ultra-violet and even blue light soon spoil beer, causing it to be ""light struck"" and to go ""skunked"", meaning that it tastes pretty much like something a skunk might produce.


Green and especially brown bottles help beer from becoming light struck, which risks giving the brew a skunky taste.







, Heat spoils beer over time, so beer is best kept at cool but not frozen temperatures. Although some people enjoy freezing their beer prior to consuming it, frozen beer cells never quite return to the way they used to be and so the beer won't taste as good. Suitable storage places include a beer cellar or the refrigerator, although long-term storage in a refrigerator is not recommended for collectible beers you plan on keeping a very long time, as the dehydrating environment of the refrigerator will eventually impact the cork.The right storage temperature for beer is dependent on the type of beer, so use this handy list as a guide:


Most beers benefit from being stored at a temperature around 50ºF to 55ºF (10°C-12.8°C). Be sure to keep the temperature constant.
Strong, higher alcohol content beers (barleywines, triples, dark ales) benefit from a temperature around 55ºF to 60ºF (12.8°C-15.5°C), which happens to be room temperature.
Standard, mid-range alcohol content ales (bitters, IPAs, lambics, stouts, doppelbocks, etc.) benefit from a storage temperature around 50ºF to 55ºF (10°C-12.8°C), which is cellar temperature.
Lighter alcohol content beers (lagers, pilsners, wheat beers, milds, low-cal, etc.) benefit from a storage temperature around 45ºF to 50ºF (7.2°C-10°C), which is the refrigerated temperature.
Unless you have a dedicated beer cellar or fridge, the best compromise for storage is the 50ºF to 55ºF (10°C-12.8°C) temperature range.Too little storage space? Drink it soon!

, Different types of beers have different use by dates owing to which brewing process was used and whether or not the beer was made for fast consumption or for longer-term keeping or aging. While there will often be a use-by date on beer sold in large commercial quantities, not all brewers will have a good idea of how long their brews can be aged for, and the possibility ranges from 6-8 months to 25 years, dependent on brand, storage methods, and quality of the beer.In other words, unless the brewer provides aging recommendations for the beer in question, you simply have to give it a go. If you're intending to store beer as a collector rather than for simple home consumption, there will definitely be some trial and error involved and it's best to approach it with a sense of exploration and fun; unlike expensive wines, at least if the beer is disgusting after storing it a bit too long, you haven't thrown away a lot of money!


In general, American beer can be stored from four to six months, while imported beers can be stored up to a year.Obviously, check the use-by date as one indicator and use this rule of thumb with caution and skepticism dependent on your own trial and error testing.
Specialist beers made for longer keeping will often make this clear as part of the marketing; indeed, some brews don't even start to develop the flavors intended by the brewer for 2 to 5 years or so. Ask the retailer for advice if you can't see anything on the label.
Beers over 7 percent alcohol tend to fare better for aging purposes.Restore yourself after tasting a bad beer from storage by following it straight up with a good new beer. You'll soon get over the experience!

, Always seek to buy at least two bottles of each type of beer destined for storage. Drink one and make notes on its taste, flavor range, texture and depth, and head quality. Then, do the same when you finally have the stored beer and compare them to see what changes have occurred during the storage period. Has the beer improved or worsened with storage time? Over time you should be able to make some good guesses as to what will store well over time and be improved for storage.

, The carbonation will evaporate and you'll have awful flat beer even if it's only the next day. If you can't drink it, use it in the kitchen or elsewhere. There are some great uses for unused, open beer including:


Make beer bread
Make beer bread with oats
Make English fish and chips with beer batter
Cook deep fried beer
Make beer battered fried vegetables

Make your hair soft with beer.

, Whether you are using pellet hops or full-leaf hops, you will need a way to submerge them into and retrieve them from the boiling wort. The easiest method is to tie the hops into cheesecloth bags; many brewing supply stores sell ""hop bags"" designed specifically for this purpose.

, Aroma hops should be added in the final 15 minutes of the boil or later. Adding them to the wort before this time will cause too many of the hops' volatile oils to evaporate, which will minimize the amount of aroma imparted.


The time at which you add the aroma hops will be specified by your recipe (if using one). In general, the later you add the hops, the fainter but more nuanced the aroma and flavor imparted will be.
Swirl the cheesecloth bag around a bit in the boiling wort to ensure that the hops are soaked through.

, Instead of adding the aroma hops late in the boil, you can actually add them ""at knockout,"" meaning at the point when you turn off your heat source. Doing this will preserve nearly all of the hops' volatile oils, but can also lend the beer a grassy flavor that may clash with the overall flavor profile.

, After turning off the heat (or allowing the hops to steep for a few minutes if added at knockout), remove the cheesecloth bags containing your bittering, flavoring, and aroma hops. You can now chill the wort and prepare to transfer it into your fermenting vessel.

, If you brew beer regularly, you will generate a large amount of used hops. Because these hops are organic matter, they can be readily composted, which helps reduce pressure on landfills.

Locate a microbrewery that you think will be nice to visit.,
Determine when to visit the brewery.,
Enter the brewery.,
Talk to an employee.,
Take a tour if one is given.,
Ask questions about the brewery.,
Taste some beer.,
Exit the brewery in an orderly fashion.",How to Visit a Microbrewery," There are many microbreweries and most people live near one. As such, it may be most convenient to visit the microbrewery that is closest to where you live. It may also be nice to visit a microbrewery that produces a particular beer of interest, or is located in a popular vacation spot. The Beer Mapping Project offers an online resource that can help one to research and find microbreweries.;
, Some microbreweries have designated visiting hours while others do not. Most microbreweries do have websites, however, so it is best to visit breweries' websites and contact breweries ahead of time in order to find out when it is best to visit. Larger microbreweries generally give brewery tours at specific times, while the smaller microbreweries may not have any formal tour hours or days. Brewpubs will, of course, be open to the public most of the time, but the brewery that serves the brewpub may not be readily accessible, or may even located elsewhere. Most microbreweries do offer some kind of formal or informal tour, and it should be possible to schedule a tour. It is recommended that one take a brewery tour, as this will enable one to learn about the brewing methods of the specific brewery, which may be quite different than the methods of other breweries. Tours also enable one to learn about the history of the brewery, as well as ask questions.

, This seems like it should be an easy task, but in some instances it may be somewhat difficult. The larger microbreweries with established tours will of course have established visiting procedures. The smaller microbreweries, however, may not have any formal visiting procedures. For these breweries, one may at first find the the front door or entrance to the brewery locked, or perhaps wide open but with no employees visible. If the entrance is locked, try looking for a back door of some kind. If you see that another door or entrance of some kind is open, try calling to someone who may be in the brewery, but don't enter an area that is not meant for customers or visitors. If the entrance is open but no one is immediately visible, look or listen for activity in the brewery. There will most likely be an an employee working nearby, and it should be easy to get their attention. But be respectful and patient, and do not enter work areas.

, If you will be taking a scheduled tour, and there is a specific employee who handles the tours, merely talk with this employee and do what the employee recommends. If there is no scheduled tour, you will most likely need to initiate a conversation with an employee, and tell them that you are visiting the brewery. From this point on, different things can happen. The employee may be busy brewing or conducting other tasks, and may not have any time to give a tour. Brewery employees tend to be extremely nice people, so at the very least the employee will most likely be able to talk to you about the brewery, beer, and other topics of interest. In any instance, show an interest in the brewery and the beer that they brew.

, It is always a good idea to take a tour if the brewery has one scheduled or if an employee is willing to give a tour. The tour is generally the opportunity for the brewery to provide relevant information about the brewery and show people how the brewery brews beer.

, If there is no established or scheduled tour, you will probably need to ask questions in order to learn about the brewery. It may also be the case that you will be talking with a brewer who may be brewing while you are asking questions. This would be a great time to ask questions about brewing! Oftentimes, one will have the opportunity to talk with the founder or owner of the brewery, and this person may also be the master brewer.

, Many microbreweries will end the brewery tour in the tasting room, where the beer that they brew is usually on tap. Breweries that do not have a formal tasting room will generally have beer on tap or in bottles that can be either tasted for free or purchased. There may also be an opportunity to taste beer taken directly from the fermentation tanks. It may also be quite nice to taste beer while discussing the brewery with an employee.

, When the brewery tour has ended or when you have discussed the brewery adequately, thank the brewery employees and re-enter the world that exists outside of the brewery.

Hold the beer can horizontally, and make sure you're using an aluminum can.,
Puncture a hole on the side of the can, near the bottom.,
Quickly place your mouth over the hole, so that any precious beer-nectar doesn't spill all over the place.,
After you've tilted the beer upright, quickly crack open the beer tab on the top.,
Drink as fast as you can.",How to Shotgun a Beer1," Unfortunately, you can't (yet) shotgun beer out of a bottle; only an aluminum can will work. Tilt the beer can just a little, so that that the bottom is slightly higher than the top.;
, Use a can opener, key, or other sharp object, such as a knife, although you should always be careful with sharp implements. (Obligatory public announcement.) Holding the beer horizontally with the bottom up a bit will mean that there is a small air pocket at the bottom of the can; this means that if you can puncture the hole in the air pocket properly, no beer will shoot out.









Be sure to puncture a big enough hole. Shoot for a hole roughly the size of a quarter. Any smaller and your chugging partners will be cracking open the next brew while you're busy daintily drinking your charge. Remember, shotgunning is about speed as well as enjoyment.
Just in case you miss the air pocket when puncturing the can, it's recommended that you puncture it outdoors or somewhere that can catch the escaping liquid, as Murphy's Law will ensure that on important occasion, beer-worthy or not, there will be a giant mess.
Try to push the sharp edges of the can inside of the can to avoid cuts on your hand and your mouth.

, Then turn the can upright, so that the force of gravity begins to work with you.








, Once the beer is opened on the top, the beer will start running freely through the hole at the bottom of the can.









Why is it that opening the top ""forces"" the beer down your throat? It's physics! Opening the tab at the top of the can allows air into the top. Increased air means increased pressure forcing the drink down into your welcoming stomach. Any vacuum that might have been created is now less present.Let the beer flow straight down your throat; the more you chug and gulp while shotgunning the beer, the longer it will take.

, Air coming in from the top of the can will allow the beer to gush out of the bottom at a very intense rate. Be prepared and, most of all, enjoy!








"
"
Grab any aluminum can filled with beer and place your thumb about an inch above the bottom of the can.,
Place the can angled slightly downwards so that an air bubble forms at the bottom of the can, near where your thumb is positioned.,
Create a small dent in the can by applying pressure.,
Rock your thumb back and forth slightly, applying pressure until the aluminum can breaks.,
Put your mouth over the puncture spot, elevate the can, and pop the top.",How to Shotgun a Beer2," 1"" to 1.5"" inches from the bottom is where you want to shoot for. The blue line at the bottom of a PBR aluminum can is a good place to start if you happen to be drinking this American classic.Use your dominant thumb for best results and visualize your thumb diving down and almost curving back in towards the wall of the can.
What fingernail length should you keep for this exercise? It depends, but neither too long or too short. Too short and you will have more trouble puncturing the can; too long and your nail can bend over when trying to push down (which really hurts). Try keeping about 1/8"" nails for best results.

, Again, the angle is very slight. And even if you happen to hit the air bubble, expect the disruption in pressure to send some beer sparks flying your way. It's only fair.








, Begin pressing down with your dominant hand in order to form a small divot, weakening the aluminum.








, This can take some time to master, but there are a couple things you want to be aware of:









If you can't seem to puncture a particular spot, don't be afraid to move your thumb to the left or right, or up or down, and try again! Use the same procedure. Sometimes, it's just a matter of having your thumb a little too high or too low.
Follow through when you puncture. Jerking your thumb suddenly back up may cause it to come into contact with the sharp aluminum. Not a good combination.
It may take several tries for you to be able to get it and develop the mental fortitude. While it's certainly possible to succeed on the first go, it takes many first-timers days, weeks, or even months to perform the artful thumb shotgun. Stay hungry during this time, like a lion hunting a gazelle. Your patience will pay off, young gun.

, Drink as usual.










Exercise an appropriate amount of caution while performing this trick. Although it should be safe and isn't likely to hurt someone, there's always the possibility of injury here. If you feel uncomfortable or are already inebriated, know that shotgunning with your thumb can end poorly.

Shelter your beer from direct light.,
Buy beer packaged in light-proof containers.,
Select boxed bottled beer.,
Choose beer in brown bottles.,
Reach for beer in the back of the shelf.,
Choose light-stable bottled beer that has been skunk-proofed.,
Buy fresh beer.",How to Prevent Skunky Beer," Store beer in the dark, away from all light sources at all times. The reaction that causes skunkiness can happen so rapidly that beer may become skunky while it is being enjoyed from a glass. Drink beer indoors or in the shade, and don't let your beer sit around too long before drinking it.;
, If light cannot penetrate the beer container, the formation of the skunky compound will be completely prevented in the container. Light cannot penetrate through cans and kegs, and therefore canned and kegged beer cannot become skunky until the beer is poured into a glass.

, Cardboard provides excellent protection from light, so select boxed twelve-packs instead of open six-packs. If choosing bottled beer that is in green bottles or has been in direct sunlight, make sure that the handle cutouts in the box are intact and have not been removed from the box. This will ensure that significant amounts of light will not penetrate the box.

, Brown bottles offer much better protection from harmful light than beer bottled in green or clear bottles, and help greatly to prevent beer from becoming skunky.

, Beer placed towards the front of store shelves or on the top shelf is exposed to more light.

, This type of beer is typically packaged in clear glass bottles, but may be found in green bottles as well. However, many commonly available beers that are available in green bottles are not light-stable. Light-stable beer is made with hop extracts that are essentially stabilized hop alpha acids that can no longer be converted into the skunky compound. The bitter hop alpha acid molecules are reduced by adding hydrogen, which stabilizes the molecule.


To determine if a beer is light-stable, pour it into a glass or leave the bottle in direct sunlight for fifteen to thirty minutes. If the beer is in clear bottles, merely set the bottle in the sunlight. Then smell it in a glass, and compare it to a bottle of beer that has not been exposed to light.

, This beer will have had less of a chance to become skunky during its journey to your glass. Purchase fresh, properly stored beer directly from local breweries that offer direct sales, or buy beer that is known to be produced locally or nearby. Small and large breweries may be situated nearby. Also choose popular beer that is less likely to spend much time on store shelves, and be sure to check the production or freshness date on beers that carry them. Find out when your liquor store expects new deliveries for your desired beer, and buy the beer before it is placed on the shelf. Check the location where the beer is produced as well, as many beers are produced under contract at nearby breweries for other, more distant breweries.

It helps if the dollar bill is new and crisp.;
, Lay the folded dollar bill flat on a surface. From one end of the bill begin folding the bill towards the other end. You can either roll the bill or create several tiny folds. Spend some time getting the folds as tight as you can.









Use the surface top to create pressure in the folds. The surface will help you hold the tightness of the fold.

, Bend the rolled dollar bill in half to maximize the pressure at the bend. You can fold the bill one more time to create a grip for the bottle that is secure.The second fold is optional and you can still open the bottle with the first fold.

While many different types of kettles are good for boiling wort, some are much more efficient and will produce a better-quality product. Some kettles include:

Traditional copper kettles. While this type of kettle isn’t the most efficient, it is relatively cheap and easy to use.
Kettles with external heating jackets. These kettles apply heat from the exterior of the kettle and are much more efficient than copper kettles.
Kettles with internal heating systems. These kettles will apply heat from within, and are one of the most efficient ways to boil wort.;
, Make sure to properly clean all your equipment before you begin the process of boiling wort. You can do this by boiling everything you intend to use. This is important, as any bacteria could contaminate your wort and ruin your final product., When it comes time to boiling your wort, you’ll want to use good water. You can use bottled water, distilled water, or spring water. Ultimately, though, you’ll want water that has low chemical traces and has a smooth and sweet taste., If you plan to add yeast during the boil, let it sit on the counter for a couple hours. This will bring it to room temperature. By warming your yeast to room temperature, you’ll make sure it is more easily absorbed into your boiling water.This is an optional step.

, Depending on your recipe, you’ll need to boil a certain amount of water. Start off by filling your kettle with your water and turning it up to a boil. This first batch of water will be half of the total water you’ll need to boil., After your water has boiled, pour it into a fermenter and allow it to sit and cool. You’ll be using this water to dilute other water and malt extract later., Boil the same amount of water as you did before. Once it comes to a boil, remove it from the heat. Then, add your malt extract. Stir the water and malt extract until the extract has completely dissolved – there should be no clumps left., Stir up any malt that has collected at the bottom. This will make sure you don’t burn any malt extract. Burnt malt could ruin the taste of your final product., Then, bring the pot to a rolling boil. Watch the water/malt extract combination as it begins to heat up. Turn the heat down if the pot boils over. Also, make sure to stir the pot occasionally., After your water/malt mixture boils for a few minutes, foam will begin to appear on the surface of the water. It should appear smooth. The foam should gradually grow thicker until it begins to dissipate. This could take between 5 and 20 minutes., After the foam has disappeared, you should add your hops. When adding hops, make sure to stir them in thoroughly. Boil them for about an hour after adding them. Adding hops is important in making sure your final product has a hoppy taste and sweet aroma.

Be careful that the pot doesn’t boil over after you add your hops. You may need to turn your heat down a little., After your initial hops have been in for half an hour, add more hops. This second addition of hops will add to the aroma and taste of the final product.

If you want, you can add more hops 25 minutes later., After one hour, remove the kettle from the heat. Using oven mitts, carefully submerge the kettle into your sink. Keep the top of the kettle on as you do this.

Your sink should be about half water and half ice -- this will make sure the kettle can submerge without a problem (but will still be kept very cold).
If you are very careful, you can remove the pot and stir the wort. This will help it cool faster., Use a thermometer to take the temperature of the wort. Leave the kettle in the sink until the wort goes below 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). This will take approximately 30 minutes.

The kettle should eventually be slightly warm., If you’re producing more than a few gallons of beer, you may want to consider purchasing and using a copper wort chiller. A copper wort chiller is a coil of copper tubing you insert into the wort as it chills. It helps increase the rate at which the wort cools.After cooling your wort, it’ll be ready for you to begin the fermentation process.

Acquire a used bourbon barrel.,

Check the inside of the barrel.,
Secure the barrel on a stable platform.,
Fill the barrel with beer.,
Seal the bunghole with an airlock.,
Let the beer age in the barrel.,
Remove the beer from the barrel and package it.",How to Oak Beer in a Used Bourbon Barrel," Used barrels can be ordered online or through homebrew shops. Distilleries may have used barrels available. Bourbon is whiskey, with a mash bill of at least 51% corn, made in the United States and aged in charred, new oak barrels. It's fine if the metal banding on the barrel is rusty, but the wood should not be overly deteriorated. There may be residual bourbon in the barrel. It's a good sign if there is, because the oak should stay wet in order to prevent shrinkage of the wood and resulting leaks. The barrel's bunghole should also be securely sealed with a rubber stopper, as this will help to ensure that the inside of the barrel has remained moist and free of external contaminants. A barrel with residual bourbon also probably won’t harbor a large amount of microbes because alcohol is antimicrobial, although wood will always harbor certain microbes that actually give oak beer desirable sensory qualities.;
, A cool basement with a concrete floor is optimal, as this will need to sit several months or years. There is always a chance for leakage, so make sure it's on a surface that can be cleaned.

, Bourbon barrels have a capacity of 53 gallons (200.6 L). If you're a home brewer, you'll most likely need to brew quite a few batches to fill one barrel. This is quite doable, however, since the barrel will be filled with fermented, uncarbonated beer. Just have your full carboys or conical fermenters ready when you're going to fill the barrel, or invite some friends to brew together.

, Invert the barrel and drain the bourbon through the bunghole. The residual bourbon will contain charcoal because the inside of bourbon barrels are charred. The residual bourbon will contain a fair amount of charcoal particles. Removing the residual bourbon serves to remove these charcoal particles, but you'll also end up with some bourbon that you can filter with a cheesecloth and drink or use as desired.

, Use a flashlight to inspect the inside of the barrel for unwanted objects or damage.

, Put the barrel on a platform that, if desired, can be moved with a forklift or pallet jack, such as a small wooden pallet. Screw or otherwise fasten blocks to the platform that will keep the barrel from moving, but never drill, screw, or nail into the barrel itself.

, Fill the barrel with uncarbonated beer using any means that you have available. Use a siphon, sankey-keg filling line, or other such means. Leave a little head space. Use a flashlight to monitor the fill level.


Be sure to sanitize the filling equipment, as you want to prevent as much microbial contamination as possible, even though the beer will become contaminated in the barrel to a certain extent.
Don’t be overly concerned with preventing oxidation, as the beer will oxidize to a certain extent while aging in the barrel (oak barrels are somewhat permeable to the outside air). However, it should be fine to purge the barrel with CO2 in order to prevent initial oxidation, and it's always a good idea to place the end of the filling tube at the bottom of the barrel to prevent splashing, which is a major cause of oxidation.

, Sanitize an airlock and a drilled rubber stopper, and securely set them in the bunghole. Fill the airlock with sanitizer so that the bunghole is sealed from the open air.

, The aging process can last from one month to over one year. If desired, take small samples with sanitized equipment during the aging process to determine when you think it is ready.

, When the beer is ready to keg or bottle, siphon or pump it out and into the kegs or bottles. At this point it may be a good idea to purge kegs and/or bottles with CO2 to prevent additional oxidation and stabilize the beer. Also, be sure to sanitize the bottling equipment, as well as the kegs and/or bottles.

Swirl the sanitizer in the bucket before dumping it to remove any tablet residue on the bottom.
Don’t rinse the tools after sanitizing them.

, You will need 3 pounds (1.3 kilograms) of fresh muscadine grapes, 2.5 pounds (1.13 kilograms) of granulated sugar, a packet of red wine yeast, yeast nutrients, one crushed campden tablet, and a wine stabilizer such as potassium sorbate.Avoid using frozen muscadine grapes as it will negatively affect the flavor.


To find out how much of the red wine yeast, yeast nutrients, and wine stabilizer to add, read the back of the packages. Each brand has a slightly different recommendation.
Remove any leaves, stems, or rotten fruit from the grapes and wash them., You can either cut each grape manually or freeze them to burst the skin. To do so, dump the grapes into a large clean bowl and place it in your freezer for 3-4 hours. Next, allow them to defrost on the counter for an hour or two. Once the grapes are thawed, crush them with a potato masher or smoosh them with your clean hands.

, Pour three quarts (2.8 liters) of water into one of the sanitized brewing bins. Next, add the sugar, crushed campden tablet, yeast nutrients, and the potassium sorbate. Stir the ingredients together until they’re completely absorbed.


Make sure the spoon you use to stir the ingredients is clean and sanitized.
Read the back of the yeast nutrient and potassium sorbate packets to find out how much to add.

, To avoid making a mess, work over the brewing bin. Once the straining bag is full, tie it off and gently rest it in the brewing mixture.


The straining bag will allow you to easily remove the crushed grapes from your wine without having to strain it.

, Find a low-traffic spot to place your brew bin so that no one knocks it over. Let sit undisturbed for 24 hours. During this time the campden tablet will sanitize the wine.Don’t worry if the wine smells strange. The campden tablets release faint sulfuric fumes while processing the wine.

, After the brewing mixture has been sitting for 24 hours, add the red wine yeast. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the wine and stir it in with sanitized spoon. Cover the wine with the towel again and move it to a cool dark spot that stays between 72 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 25 degrees Celsuis.)


Read the back of the yeast packet to find out how much to add.

, Stir the mixture daily, using a sterilized spoon to push the fruit bag to the bottom. While you stir, check for any bubbling in the liquid. After 5 to 7 days, the wine won’t bubble when you stir it. This indicates that the mixture has finished its first fermentation. Remember to store the wine in a cool dark place that that stays between 72 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 25 degrees Celsuis.)

, These two tests help determine what stage a wine is at. However, the high acid content of muscadine grapes makes it unnecessary to monitor this wine like you might monitor other wines. However, if you’d like to use these kits, purchase them online or from a winemaking supply store.


If you use a hydrometer to monitor the wine, the first fermentation is done at 1.030.
If you use an acid testing kit, measure the wine after 24 hours of fermentation and then once daily after that. The acid level should stay below 7 p.p.t. tartaric., First, remove the fruit bag and squeeze out every last drop back into the wine. Discard the squeezed-out fruit bag. Next, loosely secure a cheesecloth over the top of a clean brewing bin using an extra-large rubber band or twine. Pour the contents of the first brewing bin into the second, filtering out any debris with the cheesecloth.


After the wine has been transferred, discard the cheesecloth and any debris inside.

, If necessary, ask a friend to help you do this. First, place a funnel in the demijohn. Next, carefully pour the strained wine into the funnel, stopping a few inches from the top. If you’ve made a lot of wine, you may need two demijohns. Next, tighten the bung and airlock over the demijohn.


If you don’t know how to tighten the bung and airlock, read the manufacturer instructions for the demijohn you purchased.

, Put the demijohn back into the cool dark place you used for the first fermentation. Allow the wine to sit undisturbed for at least three weeks. Every day or so, gently test the airlock and bung to be sure that they’re still secured.


If the airlock or bung wiggle around, tighten them again. Otherwise, bacteria and debris may get into your wine.
Use clean hands when touching the airlock or bung.

, After three weeks, closely examine the wine. If you see little to no foam and a layer of dark sediment on the bottom of the jar, your wine is ready for racking. Otherwise, let it sit for another week and check again.

, Place the wine-filled demijohn on a table or flat chair, being careful not to disturb the sediment at the bottom. Next, place a second demijohn on the ground below the first. Make sure the second demijohn is cleaned and sanitized.


If you disturb the sediment, allow the demijohn to sit undisturbed for a few hours before racking. This will give the sediment a chance to fall back to the bottom.

, Remove the bung and airlock, setting them aside on a clean towel. Next, insert a siphon tube into the jar. The end of the tube should be resting a few inches or centimeters above the sediment.


If the tube is touching the sediment, it will suck sediment into your new demijohn, defeating the purpose of racking.

, Suck on the free end of the tube until you taste wine. Next, quickly place the free end into the second demijohn, filling it with wine. Keep an eye on the tube to make sure it doesn’t suck up any sediment.


If you’re worried about contaminating your wine with mouth bacteria, use a suction bulb to begin siphoning instead.Suction bulbs can be bought online or from a winemaking store.

, Use clean hands to replace the bung and airlock, screwing them on tightly. Put the demijohn back in its cool, dark location to continue fermenting.Clean and sterilize the old demijohn after racking. Otherwise, the sediment may stick to the bottom and become difficult to clean.

, Every three weeks, check the wine for sediment. If you see any, rack the wine and let it sit for another three weeks. This process can take up to nine weeks.Once the wine is sediment-free, it’s ready to bottle.

, Use a clean and sanitized siphon tube to siphon the wine into clean and sanitized wine bottles. Make sure you work in an easy-to-clean spot as bottling wine can become messy.Remember, if you want to avoid contaminating your wine with mouth bacteria, use a suction bulb to siphon the wine., Each brand of corker is different. Therefore, follow the manufacturer instructions to cork bottles. Make sure you have enough corks for every bottle of wine.


If corker has trouble moving, use WD-40 to lubricate moving parts. However, don’t use WD-40 on any parts that will touch the wine or the cork., Use a label maker or paper and tape to create an interesting label for your wine. Include the ingredients and the date of bottling. This will help you determine when your wine is ready to open.


Go into detail when listing ingredients. If you like the wine or want to change it, you will instantly know what recipe you used.

, It’s hard to resist opening a bottle of homemade wine. However, the flavor of this wine is best after two or three years. If you simply can’t wait, the wine is safe to drink at any time, even though the flavor may not be as good.Create a new batch of wine every season to ensure that you have a steady supply of muscadine wine each year.

Home winemaking shouldn't be expensive, so it's not necessary to splurge on special equipment. You will need the following supplies:


A 2 gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar (you can often find these at vintage or secondhand stores, however, be advised that many used crocks may have been used for sauerkraut or pickles and could contaminate your wine.
A 1 gallon (3.8 L) carboy (a glass container with a small neck)
An airlock
A thin plastic tube to be used for siphoning
Clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps
Campden tablets (optional);
, Wine can be made with any type of fruit, though grapes and berries are the most popular choices. Choose fruit at the peak of its flavor. It's best to choose organic fruit that hasn't been treated with chemicals, since you don't want these to end up in your wine. If possible, use fruit you've picked yourself or buy some from a farmer's market. Some retailers also specialize in providing wine grapes to home winemakers (for example, Wine Grapes Direct), which is great if you do not live near vineyards.

, Take off the stems and leaves, and make sure the fruit doesn't have particles of dirt or grit. Rinse the fruit thoroughly and place it in your crock. You can peel the fruit before crushing, but much of the flavor of the wine will come from its skin. Peeling it will result in a much milder wine.


Some winemakers choose not to wash the fruit before crushing. Since fruit has natural yeasts on its skin, it's possible to make wine using only the yeast from the fruit's skin and the air. However, washing the fruit and controlling the yeast you add allows you to ensure that the flavor of the wine will be to your liking; allowing wild yeast to grow can produce foul flavors. If you're up for an experiment, you could make two batches of wine, one with controlled yeast and one with wild, to find out which you like best.

, Using a clean potato masher or your hands, crush and squeeze the fruit to release its juices. Keep doing so until the level of the fruit juice is within 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) of the top of the crock. If you don't have enough fruit and juice to fill the crock almost to the top, top it off with filtered water. Add a Campden tablet, which releases sulphur dioxide into the mixture, killing wild yeast and bacteria.If you're making wild yeast wine, don't take steps to kill the yeast.


As an alternative to using a tablet, you can pour 2 cups of boiling water over the fruit.
Using tap water can affect the taste of your wine, since it contains additives. Be sure to use filtered or spring water., Honey provides food for the yeast and sweetens your wine. The amount of honey you use will directly affect the sweetness of your wine. If you prefer sweeter wine, add more honey. If you don't like it as sweet, limit your honey to 2 cups. Take the type of fruit you're using into account as well. Since grapes have a high sugar content, you don't need to add a lot of honey to grape wine. Berries and other fruits with lower sugar content will need a little more honey.


You can add sugar or brown sugar instead of honey if you'd like.
You can always add more honey later if your wine doesn't come out as sweet as you like.

, If you're using your own yeast, now is the time to add it. Pour it into the crock and stir it into the mixture with a long-handled spoon. This mixture is called a must.


If you're making wild yeast wine, you can skip this step.

, It's important to use a cover that will keep bugs out but allow air to flow in and escape the crock. You can use a crock lid designed for this purpose or stretch a cloth or t-shirt over the opening and secure it in place with a large rubber band. Place the covered crock in a warm area with a temperature around 70 degrees overnight.


Putting the crock in a cool place won't facilitate the growth of the yeast. Storing it in a place that's too warm will kill the yeast. Find a good in-between place in your kitchen.

, The day after you make the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly, and recover. Do this every 4 hours or so the first day, then keep stirring a few times per day for the next 3 days. The mixture should start bubbling as the yeast moves into action. This is the fermentation process that will lead to delicious wine., When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage. Once you've siphoned it into the carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen from coming in and spoiling your wine.


If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon placed over the opening with about 5 pin sized holes in it. Secure it with tape. This will let the gas escape but not let in oxygen.

, It's better if you can let it age for up to nine, during which time the wine will age and mellow, resulting in a much improved taste. If you used extra honey in your wine, it's better to age it on the longer side, or else it will taste too sweet when you drink it.

, To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately. Allow the wine to further age in the bottles or enjoy it immediately.Use dark bottles to preserve the color of red wines.

, People have been making wine for thousands of years, and they've learned a few tricks along the way. Keep the following in mind as you make your own wine for the first time:


Use very clean equipment to prevent bacteria from spoiling your wine.
Keep your first ferment covered but allow for ventilation.
Keep the secondary fermentation air-free.
Keep all bottles full, to minimize oxygen in the bottle.
Keep red wines in dark bottles so they don't lose their appearance.
Make wines too dry instead of too sweet: you can add sugar later.
Taste the wine at intervals to make sure the process is going well.

, Avoiding these common pitfalls can help ensure your success. Do not:


Sell your wine, since this is illegal.
Let vinegar flies come in contact with your wine.
Use metal vessels.
Use tools or containers made out of resinous wood, as they can spoil the wine's flavor.
Try to speed up fermentation by turning up the temperature.
Filter without a reason or too soon.
Store your wine in unsterilized jars or bottles.
Bottle your wine before it has finished fermenting.

But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need:


Immersion blender
Wooden spoon
Large saucepan
Small bowl
One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag
Clean bath towel
Heating pad
Strainer
Cheesecloth
Large bowl
Funnel
Large sterile bottle or jar with lid;
, Combine the apple and orange chunks, plus the fruit cocktail and raisins, in a large saucepan. Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it’s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it.


Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly.

, When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning.


Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present.Continue stirring the mixture regularly.

, After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don’t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly.The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour.

, Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate.As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl.

, Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and stir to fully combine. Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag. Press out as much air as you can, then seal the bag.It’s important to warm the fruit mixture because the yeast will die if it gets too cold.

, Wrap the fruit mixture in a clean bath towel to help keep in the heat. Then place the towel on top of an electric heating pad turned to low temperature. Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet.


If you don’t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold.
The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol.

, As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure.


Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad.
When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days., When the mixture has stopped bloating, it’s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl.To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside.

, Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight.A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle.

One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag
Three clean towels
A large bowl or sink
Hot running water
Spoon or t-shirt

, Break the oranges into wedges and place them in the sealable bag. Add the fruit cocktail and seal the bag tightly. With the fruit sealed inside the bag, squish the fruit between your fingers to break it up into small chunks.The fruit is ready when it becomes the consistency of fruit pulp mixed with paste.
You can substitute some of the orange with apples, peaches, pears, or any other fruit that’s available to you., Open the bag and pour in the water. Then seal the bag again. Place the bag of mashed fruit into a sink or bowl and cover it with the hottest water you can get from the tap. Let the fruit sit in the hot water for 15 minutes.Add fresh hot water every five minutes.


If you don’t have a bowl or a plug for the sink, keep the water from the tap running over the fruit for 15 minutes.

, Once the mixture is good and warm from the water, wrap it in the towels to help keep in the heat. Then transfer the mixture to a dark place for 48 hours.


The heat is necessary for the fermentation process, because otherwise the wild yeast will die instead of converting the sugar to alcohol.

, After two days, unwrap the towels from around the bag. The bag should have ballooned up with gases, so open the bag to release the gas. Add the sugar cubes and ketchup. Seal the bag and let the mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes to let the sugar dissolve.The amount of ketchup you need for this recipe is equivalent to about 3.5 ketchup packets.
If you don’t have access to ketchup, you can also use a piece of bread broken up into small pieces., When the sugar has dissolved, knead the mixture to incorporate the fruit, sugar, and ketchup. Then heat the mixture with hot tap water again.


Let the fruit sit in the hot water (or under running water) for 30 minutes.

, After heating for 30 minutes in the water bath, wrap the mixture in the towels again. Stash it away somewhere dark and let the mixture sit for 24 hours.


Once you get to this point, the mixture will take another 72 hours or so to turn to alcohol.

, Over the next three days, open the bag daily to release the gases and reheat the bag under hot running water for 15 minutes. Then rewrap the bag in the towel and return it to its dark place until the next day.When the bag stops bloating, the pruno is ready.

, After three days or when the bag stops bloating with gases overnight, open the bag and skim off the fruit mash to leave the liquid behind.


If it’s available, use a tea strainer, clean sock, or clean t-shirt to separate the fruit mash and strain the liquid.Transfer the liquid to cups before serving, or return it to the plastic bag and drink straight from the bag.

Clean your equipment and wine bottles before beginning. Avoid using soap when cleaning since this can leave a residue. Instead, use hot water and scrub with a stiff brush. You can also disinfect the equipment with a bleach solution (1/4 cup bleach for every gallon of water). You'll need:A 2-gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar
Long wooden spoon
A 1-gallon (3.8 L) carboy (a glass container with a small neck)
An airlock
A thin plastic tube for siphoning
Clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps;
, Choose pomegranates that are heavy and look deep red. If your pomegranates are small, you may want to use a few more. Wash your pomegranates and cut them in half. Scoop out all of the fruity seeds.Discard the skin and the pith since these can make your wine taste bitter.

, To crush the pomegranate seeds, you may want to pulse them in a blender or food processor. Place the crushed seeds into a fermentation crock or glass jar. You'll also need to sterilize the pomegranates using a Campden tablet. Dissolve one Campden tablet in 2 cups of the crushed pomegranates. Return this mixture to to the rest of the crushed seeds.To give the Campden tablet time to work, wait 4 hours before continuing on and adding other ingredients.

, Pour 1 gallon of boiling water into your container with the crushed pomegranate seeds. You'll also need to add 1 lb (450 grams) of minced raisins (choose organic so you don't get sulfites), 2 lbs (900 grams) of granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons of acid blend, and 1 teaspoon of pectic enzyme. Mix this together and let it stand until the mixture is at room temperature.This mixture containing the sweetened crushed fruit is called must. This will eventually ferment and be strained to create your pomegranate wine.

, Take your teaspoon of yeast nutrient and dissolve it in one cup of liquid strained from your pomegranate mixture. Once you've stirred the yeast completely into the liquid, add the activated wine yeast to the must (the pomegranate mixture).Yeast nutrient is specially formulated to keep yeast healthy throughout fermentation.

, Cover the fermenting container with your must. Place it in a warm place that's around 60 to 70 degrees F. The must should set for about five days. Stir the must two or three times a day so the solids that float to the top are mixed into the rest of the must. During this time, the liquid will begin to take on a red color.You can cover the container with a crock lid or cheesecloth secured with a rubber band. Covering the must will keep bugs out, but should also allow for air flow.

, Once the must doesn't bubble very much, you can strain the solids out and siphon the fermenting pomegranate wine must into a carboy or clear demijohn. After the liquid is in your long-term storage container, fit an airlock on the top. This will release gas and keep oxygen from entering the container (which could ruin your wine). Let your wine set for a month.If you don't have an airlock, you can place a small balloon or latex glove over the opening of your carboy or demijohn. Poke 4 or 5 pin-sized holes in it and tape it over the opening. This way, gas will escape, but not let oxygen into your container.

, You'll need to siphon off your wine into a clean container so that sediment is left behind. Doing this repeatedly while the wine ferments will prevent your wine from appearing cloudy or foggy. Place the syphon on the end of your carboy or demijohn and attach it to a secondary container to rack it. You should rack your wine:For the first time at one month
At four months
At seven months

, Wine bottles will allow you to divide and serve your wine just like a regular winery would. You can store your wine in used wine bottles you have collected. With this in mind, it's good to make a habit of collecting wine bottles over a course of months before bottling your own wine. If you don't have any bottles, you can buy them from brewing supply stores.


The typical wine bottle is 750ml. You'll need roughly five bottles for each gallon of wine you've made., Once your wine has finished fermenting and you've racked it several times so it's clear, bottle your wine. You can usually do this at one year after starting the wine. Use a siphon to move the wine from the fermenting container into your bottles. Fill your bottles partway up the bottleneck and leave a few inches for the cork at the top.Be sure to siphon the wine without agitating or stirring the wine too much. This could cause any sediment to make your wine cloudy.

, Soak your corks in a mixture of water that has a Campden tablet dissolved in it. This will sterilize your corks and make them easier to insert in your wine bottles. You can insert the corks by hand or use a corking machine. If inserting them by hand, soak them for 15 minutes. If inserting them by machine, only soak them for a few minutes. Position the cork over the opening of the bottle and push down firmly using your shoulders.Some brewery supply stores rent corking machines for home use. This may be a good idea if you're trying it out for the first time. You may want to buy one if you're planning on making wine regularly.

, Most wines are drunk within 12 to 18 months of bottling. You should try to drink your wine around a year after bottling it. Although if you've made several bottles, consider opening and trying your wine about 6 months after bottling. You may find that you enjoy the flavor of your pomegranate wine at this point.Wine is not meant to be kept indefinitely. Most fruit wines (including pomegranate wine) should be used within 3 to 5 years of bottling."

Oak your wine!",How to Make Cherry Wine," Make sure you have a large clean counter space to work. You may need to gather some special winemaking supplies to help your wine ferment properly, but they should be relatively inexpensive. You will need:

A 2 gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar
A 1 gallon (3.8 L) carboy (a glass container with a small neck)
An airlock
A thin plastic tube to be used for siphoning
Clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps
Campden tablets (potassium or sodium metabisulfite) (optional);
, You can use fresh or frozen cherries. Here are some things to consider when choosing cherries:

Frozen fruit is the best way to make country wines since it helps break down the fruit and promotes fermentation.However, the cherries are picked when fully ripe and frozen immediately, instead of being allowed to ripen over several days on the store shelves.
Frozen cherries already have the seeds removed, so there will be less work involved when using frozen cherries.
You can also freeze fresh cherries, just make sure to take the seeds out first!
If using frozen cherries, make sure your fruit has been in the freezer for at least 3 days before beginning the process.

, This step is only necessary if you are working with fresh cherries. Take off the stems and leaves and rinse the cherries thoroughly.

Some winemakers choose not to wash the fruit before crushing. Since fruit has natural yeasts on its skin, it's possible to make wine using only the yeast from the fruit's skin and the air. However, washing the fruit and controlling the yeast you add allows you to ensure that the flavor of the wine will be to your liking
Allowing wild yeast to grow can produce foul flavors.
If you're up for an experiment, you could make two batches of wine, one with controlled yeast and one with wild, to find out which you like best.

, Again, this step only applies to those using fresh cherries. Removing the seeds can be tedious, difficult, and time-consuming. If you are using fresh cherries, try these methods to remove the cherry pits:

Use a toothpick, unbent paper clip, hair pin, or orange stick (as for manicures). Insert whichever tool you choose into the stem end of the cherry. You should feel it hit the pit. Twist your tool around the pit and pop it out. This is not easy. Be patient, experiment a bit for the twisting motion that works best for you.
Insert a pastry tip or straw into the stem end of a cherry and push it through. The tip or straw should hit the pit and push it out the other side.

, Place your cherries into a crock and use a potato masher to crush the cherries until the level of the cherry juice is within 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) of the top of the crock.

Top your crock off with filtered water if you don't have enough cherry juice to fill the crock almost to the top.

, This releases sulfur dioxide into the mixture, killing wild yeast and bacteria.If you're starting with fresh cherries and making wild yeast wine, don't do this.

As an alternative to using a tablet, you can pour 2 cups of boiling water over the fruit.
Using tap water can affect the taste of your wine since it contains additives. Be sure to use filtered or spring water., Honey provides food for the yeast and sweetens your wine. The amount of honey you use will directly affect the sweetness of your wine. Here are some things to consider:

If you prefer a sweeter wine, add more honey. If you don't like it as sweet, limit your honey to 2 cups.
You can add sugar or brown sugar instead of honey if you'd like.
You can always add more honey later if your wine doesn't come out as sweet as you like.

, If you're using your own yeast, now is the time to add it. Pour it into the crock and stir it into the mixture with a long-handled spoon.

Only if you're making wild yeast wine can you skip this step.

, The smell of your fermenting wine can attract insects so be sure to close your container enough to keep insects out while still allowing air to flow in and escape. You can use a crock lid designed for this purpose or stretch a cloth or t-shirt over the opening and secure it in place with a large rubber band. Place the covered crock in a warm area with a temperature around 70 degrees overnight.

Putting the crock in a cool place won't facilitate the growth of the yeast. Storing it in a place that's too warm will kill the yeast. The best bet is to store your fermenting wine in a place that is room temperature.

, Now that your wine is fermenting, your winemaking process will move a lot slower. The day after you make the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly before covering it again. Repeat this process every 4 hours or so the first day, then keep stirring a few times per day for the next 3 days.

The mixture should start bubbling as the yeast moves into action.
This is the fermentation process that will lead to delicious wine., When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage.

Once you've siphoned it into the carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen from coming in and spoiling your wine.
If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon placed over the opening. Every few days, pull off the balloon to let out the collected gas and replace it right away.

, Let the wine age for at least one month. It's better if you can let it age for up to nine, during which time the wine will mellow, enriching the taste.

If you used extra honey in your wine, it's better to age it on the longer side, or it may taste overly sweet.

, To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately. Allow the wine to further age in the bottles or enjoy it now!Use dark bottles to preserve the color of red wines.

, There are a few different kinds of cherries on the market these days, and using a particular type will influence the taste of your wine. Here are some things to consider:

Try black cherries or sweet cherries for a sweeter wine.
Morello cherries work well for a dry wine.

, A dry wine is simply a wine that has no residual sugar, meaning it isn’t sweet.To make a dry wine, let your mixture ferment completely, allowing the yeast to consume all of the sugar. Here are some things to consider when making ""dry"" wine:

After about 2 weeks most of the sugar will have been consumed by the yeast and fermentation will slow, making it easier to keep track of the falling sugar level of your wine. Tracking the sugar level will give you an idea of how your fermentation has been progressing.
You may wish to stop the fermentation early and leave a bit of residual sugar in your wine.
The fermentation is considered done when you either reach your desired sugar level or go ""dry"" at 0° Brix on the wine scale.A wine with 0.2% residual sugar contains two grams of sugar in a liter of wine. Dry wines are typically in the 0.2%-0.3% range, off-dry wines in the 1.0%-5.0% range, and sweet dessert wines are normally 5.0%-10%.
There is no ""correct"" sugar level for your wine, it just comes down to your personal preference.

, You can give your wine an intriguing flavor by adding small amounts of oak during the fermenting process. Here are some things to consider:

Use oak powder. This way, you won't risk over-oaking your wine. The oak powder will also sink to the bottom of your crock during fermentation, making siphoning easier.
When adding oak powder to a batch of homemade wine, you'll want to add anywhere from 4 to 20 grams per gallon, depending on the type of wine (white vs. red) and desired flavor. Generally speaking, for six U.S. gallons of wine you would add about 40 to 50 grams of oak powder for a white wine, or 70 to 85 grams of oak powder for a red wine."

Enjoy!",How to Make Homemade Organic Wine with No Additives," The best time to make wine is in early fall season. Outside temperature should be between 18 and 24 Celsius (64-75 Fahrenheit).
, Each type of grape has a different sugar content level which will affect the alcohol content. Examples of grapes and type of wine:



Red: Merlot, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon

White: Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc
If you are still unsure about which grape or wine you would like to make, try visiting a store/market that sells wine grapes. They will help advise you with the right grapes to use. The better the grapes, the better the wine, so this part is crucial!

,, Wash grapes thrall and remove any leaves. Throw away any grapes that look discoloured or rotten or dry grapes. The choice is yours whether to remove the stem from the grapes. Leaving the stem in gives the wine a light bolder taste. Try leaving the stems for the whole process up until you filter the wine. Taking out the stems mid fermentation could lead to a contaminated wine, which you don't want.

This is because the stem has a lot of tannins, which gives the wine a bitter taste if you leave the stem in the wine for too long. This is wine white wine is not as bitter as red, red wine is aged longer with the stems.
Tannins give the wine natural antioxidants, which is why some people like to leave the stems in the wine a little longer. The more tannins in the wine the stronger the headache, so this wine shouldn’t be drank to get too silly or else you will be regretting it next morning.

, It is very important to have all of your utensils clean. This is so that your wine doesn’t get infected and spoiled.

Wash the barrel and the wine crusher with 10-12 L of hot water with one half cup of baking soda. Scrub then rinse the barrel and crusher until both are cleaned.

, Depending on the size of your wine crusher, it is recommended that two people place the wine crusher on the barrel. The wine crusher could be heavy. Also the wine crusher has an awkward size and shape, which could lead one person having troubles placing the wine crusher on the barrel.,, The crusher crank should be turned carefully and constant. This is so the grapes can be sliced evenly and not just squished. If you turn the crank to fast, the grapes will not be opened correctly, causing not all the juices to pour out of them., Make sure that the grapes and juices is actually going into the barrel, Sometimes the barrel can shift and the juices could be dripping down the sides of the barrel. Also keep in mind how much you are filling your barrel., This process is very crucial. It can determine whether the wine turns out good or bad. Since we are not adding any sugars or yeast it is crucial to monitor your grape juice frequently. This is a high risk process, which will lead to a more flavorful and “healthier” wine. This method is called spontaneous fermentation. You must leave the grapes and grape juice together longer than if we added yeast. The risk is that your grapes and juice is more likely to be open for infection from other spoilage organisms and from oxidation. This is why you must constantly be monitoring your wine.

, Best location is in a garage in the fall time or possibly a basement cellar. A hot warm day humid day could ruin the wine! It should take the wine about 5-7 days for the juice to start fermenting and turning into wine, the wine will start making a bubbling cracking noise. That should let you know that the juice and grapes are starting to ferment., Roughly 5-7 days after the crushing the grapes, the wine should start to ferment. Roughly 2-3 times a week you should taste the juice to confirm the wine is making its transition to wine. You will only need about 1-2 ounces to taste.

If your wine starts to taste sour, that is not good. This means the wine is too acidic or the wine is turning into vinegar. This is because your wine has too much tannin inside. Remove the stems carefully, washing all of the instruments being used.

, The total fermentation process should take about 7-8 weeks, depending on the temperature of where the wine is being stored. To check, the wine will turn a nice purple colour, depending on which grapes you choose. You can see the colour if you pour a little inside a clear glass.

Another indication that the wine is finished is you will stop hearing the formation sound. Another indication is taste it! Does it taste like wine? It should by now!

, Once the wine is finished, you can start to empty all the wine from the barrel. You now must strain all the sediment from the wine. Usually straining the wine twice is good enough; however you may strain your wine as many times as you want.


Using a very clean stainless bowl or a very clean bucket, collect the wine from the barrel. Once the stainless steel bowl or bucket is about ¾ full. Place the strainer on top of the large glass jug and pour the wine inside. This is to capture the sediment and crushed grapes that came through. Do this until all the wine is finished.
Before completely emptying the barrel, you could bottle some of that wine inside a bottle so that you could start drinking it.

, You should filter again. Why not? It doesn’t hurt. You can use old wine bottles or any old glass container. Make sure that these are cleaned very well. Funnel the wine inside the glass bottle. Close the cap. You have bottled wine!

You don't need to bottle all my wine at once. You can, for example, bottle about 4-5 bottles a week. This allows you to have some of the wine aged a little longer.
It is not necessarily true that the longer the aged wine, the better. Avoid aging this wine longer than a year; the wine could turn out sour.

, Now that you have finished your wine, you may store it away in a cool temperature cellar or begin drinking right away! Cheers!"

Glue the narrow flap to the other side of the assembly.,
Create the bottom of the bag.,
Add the handles to the homemade wine bag.",How to Make A Wine Bag," To make a wine bag using this method, you'll need scissors, a ruler, a pen, a single hole punch, clear tape, a glue stick, cardstock, some twine or ribbon, and some old magazines or other paper material that can be used for the bag's exterior.;
, Begin by ripping 2 attractive pages from a magazine and laying them side by side, with their long edges touching. Apply a long strip of clear tape along the touching edges to attach the pages together.

, Because the magazine pages will be too thin to support the wine bottle on their own, you'll need to reinforce them by gluing a second set of pages on top of them. Use your glue stick to coat each page, and place 2 additional magazine pages on top of the existing pages.

, Rip 2 more magazine pages out and glue them together to double their thickness. Cut the glued-together pages down the middle to form 2 long strips, and then tape these strips along the long edge of your existing pages. You should now have an area of about 14.5 inches by 17.5 inches (37 x 44 cm).

, You now need to fold the magazine page assembly along both of its long edges (the 17.5 inch / 44 cm edges). Along the top, crease and fold a flap towards you about 1.5 inch (4 cm) from the edge. Along the bottom, make the fold about 2 inches (5 cm) from the edge.

, The top flap (the 1.5 inch / 4 cm fold) is meant to support the handles of the bag, so it is best to reinforce it using cardstock. Cut a strip of cardstock about 1.5 inches (4 cm) wide by 17.5 inches (44 cm) long, and glue this strip underneath the flap.

, The overall length of your assembly should be about 17.5 inches (44 cm), which gives you enough room for a wine bag that is 5 inches by 3.5 inches (13 x 9 cm), with a half-inch (1 cm) overlap to allow you to glue the bag together.


Use a ruler and a pen to measure from the left side of the assembly and mark off each width successively: 5 inches, 3.5 inches, 5 inches, 3.5 inches, and 0.5 inches (13, 9, 13, 9, 1 cm).
Next, make vertical folds at each pen mark to create each side of the bag. The small half-inch (1 cm) section will be used to glue the 2 sides of the assembly together.

, After folding the pages at the marks you made, you should be able to form a rectangular bag shape with only the narrow flap left over. Apply glue to this flap and secure it to the other side of the assembly to create the finished rectangular shape.

, For the wine bag's bottom, fold the bottom flaps over each other and secure them with tape. For extra reinforcement, cut a piece of cardstock to fit the bottom panel and glue it into the bag's bottom.

, Use the single hole punch to create 2 holes on either side of the bag's top. String some ribbon or twine through these holes and knot it to secure it in place. You should now have 2 loops that can be used to carry and present the wine bag.

Your middle finger should rest on the stem just above the base.
Only these three fingers will come into direct contact with the stem of the glass. Your remaining two fingers should naturally rest on top of the base.
This is the standard way to hold a wine glass. Holding it in this manner should provide plenty of stability while keeping your hands away from the bowl of the glass.;
, Wrap your index finger around the one side of the stem, then support the other side of the stem with the tip of your thumb.









Keep your hand positioned toward the lower half of the stem.
Your remaining three fingers should curl into your palm in the form of a loose fist. Generally, these fingers won't touch the base of the glass, but it's find if they brush against it.

, Pinch the stem of the glass just above the base using only your thumb and index finger.









Even though these two fingers pinch the stem of the glass, they also brush against the top of the base.
Use your middle finger to support the glass from beneath by extending it outward along the underside of the base.
Allow your remaining two fingers to rest naturally. They may press into the palm of your hand or follow along with your middle finger.

, Keep your thumb over the base of the glass while supporting the underside of the base with your index and middle fingers.









None of your fingers actually touch the stem of the glass when using this technique.
Your index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers should all curve gently into your palm. Use the top portions of your index and middle fingers to support the base.
Note that this holding style is socially acceptable, but it's also the least stable. It's best to practice it when you're by yourself before using it in polite company.

, Holding a wine glass by the bowl is social taboo, but the reasons for that are as practical as they are polite. Both the taste and appearance of the wine can be negatively impacted when you hold the bowl.When you hold the bowl of the glass, the heat of your hands will quickly cause the wine inside to warm up. This problem is most pronounced when sipping white wine or champagne since these types of drinks taste best when chilled. The problem isn't quite as severe when drinking red wine, but even red wine tastes best when kept a little cooler than room temperature.
Additionally, holding the glass by the bowl can leave fingerprints, which makes the appearance of the wine glass less elegant. Both your fingers and the prints they leave behind can also make it harder to examine the color or clarity of the wine.

, Since this type of wine glass has no stem, you'll have to hold it like a normal drinking glass. Grab the glass toward its base, however, instead of holding it at the middle or top.









You can wrap your thumb and all four fingers around the glass if you need to do so for the sake of stability, but if possible, try to keep only your thumb and two fingers on the glass itself. The other two fingers should gently curl away from the glass or support the glass from underneath.

, Since the heat of your hand can warm up the temperature of your wine, it's best to hold your stemless wine glass as briefly and infrequently as possible.









Try to hold the glass only when taking sips. If you can set it down somewhere, do so when you aren't actively drinking the wine.
Fingerprints are pretty much inevitable when you use this type of wine glass. That social faux pas usually won't matter when you're among family and friends, but if you're hanging around wine connoisseurs or trying to make a good impression on someone new, it's best to put the stemless glasses away and opt for the traditional glass type instead.

, If you are unable to set your glass down and feel the need to support it in between sips, you can rest the base of the glass on the palm of your non-dominant hand while continuing to hold the glass at its stem with your dominant hand.









When you need to set the glass down at your dinner table, note that it should be placed to the right of your water glass. If you don't have a water glass, simply place your wine glass down in the upper left corner of your place setting, where the water glass usually sits.

, Try to drink from only one spot along the rim of the wine glass. Doing so can improve the scent and appearance of your wine.









If you sip from too many different places along the rim of the glass, the excess contact can actually taint the scent of the wine. Since scent and taste are closely linked, this could also degrade the taste of the wine.
Additionally, your lips leave a print on the glass like your fingers do, even if you aren't wearing lipstick, balm, or gloss. Sipping from only one spot makes the top of your glass look cleaner.

, As a general rule, you should only keep the glass one-third full when drinking red wine or half full when drinking white wine.On a similar note, when drinking champagne or sparkling wine from a champagne flute, you should keep the glass three-quarters full.
By only filling part of the glass, you can minimize the risk of accidental spills. Completely full glasses can get heavy, and since you can only support the glass by its stem instead of the bowl, your hand may weaken and slip beneath the weight of the wine.

, As you go to take a sip of your wine, direct your gaze into your glass instead of focusing on another person or object.









Looking at someone else as you sip your wine is considered especially impolite. This is true regardless of whether or not you're in active conversation with anyone.
On the other hand, you should maintain eye contact with someone when making a toast. Lock eyes with whomever clinks glasses with you. Doing so is polite, and superstition holds that failing to do so can mean seven years of bad luck.

, If you want to study the appearance of the wine, tilt the glass slightly while holding it up to the light.








Use natural light when possible. If you aren't able to get a good view of the color and clarity, position your glass against a white or pale background to make the viewing process easier.

, Swirling your wine is socially acceptable as long as you don't get carried away. The key is to gently swirl the glass in small circular movements while keeping the base on a flat surface.









Keep a firm grip on the stem of the glass as you swirl it and only continue swirling for 10 to 20 seconds. If you have a loose grip, move the glass too forcefully, or swirl the glass for too long, you run the risk of accidentally spilling your wine.

, When checking the scent of a particular wine, tilt the glass slightly and place your nose directly inside.









Alternatively, you could hold your nose roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the top of the glass instead of sticking it directly inside. Some people are able to detect more of the scent by doing it this way while others prefer the traditional technique. Either way is socially acceptable, though.

Cork the bottle.,
Stick a bottle in a chiller or fridge.,
Avoid heat and light.",How to Keep Wine After Being Opened1," Close a bottle of wine after pouring individual glasses from it. Use the cork that the bottle came with, or a reusable wine stopper.

Re-cork properly by inserting the cork into the bottle in the same direction as when you pulled it out. Avoid putting the “clean” side of the cork into the bottle facing the wine, even if it seems easier to do so, as it may not be clean and could in fact contaminate the wine.If you don’t have a cork or stopper available to seal your wine bottle, use a small piece of plastic wrap to cover the mouth of the bottle, then secure with a rubber band.;
, Put any leftover wine in a bottle into a wine chiller or the refrigerator. Keep most wine for a few days this way.

Don’t store the wine bottle horizontally on its side once opened, whether on a rack or in the refrigerator. This will expose a greater surface area of the wine to oxygen.Note that keeping wine in the refrigerator will not keep it from going bad, but it can slow down the chemical process responsible for making the wine lose its flavor.

, Keep an opened wine bottle away from direct sunlight and high heat. Favor cool, dark areas or a fridge.

Avoid storage in temperatures above 70° F. Also keep the wine away from a window to prevent heating and discoloration from the sun.When taking leftover red wine out of storage in the fridge or other cool place, let it warm up gradually. Place the bottle in lukewarm water, or simply bring it out of the fridge about an hour before serving."
"
Transfer to a half bottle.,
Purchase a vacuum pump.,
Invest in an inert gas system.",How to Keep Wine After Being Opened2," Pour your leftover wine into a half-size wine bottle and seal. This will reduce the surface area of the wine that’s exposed to oxygen, slowing the aging process.

Make sure your half bottle of leftover wine is sealed tightly with an appropriate cork, stopper, or screw-top.
Save empty half bottles, which you can often find when buying dessert wines, and reuse over and over again for this purpose.If you don’t have any half bottles on hand, you can use another small glass container that seals tightly.

, Buy a vacuum cap system for wine, which removes the oxygen from inside the bottle. Potentially lengthen the freshness of leftover wine in this way.

You may want to invest in this device if you frequently have opened bottles of wine to keep, or drink varieties particularly prone to oxygenating, like full-bodied white wines such as oaked Chardonnay or Viognier.Note that there is some disagreement about the effectiveness of wine vacuums. Some say that the oxygen removal is only partial, or it can actually damage the flavor of the wine due to extracting its aromas as well as the oxygen., Replace the oxygen in an opened bottle of wine with an inert gas, most commonly Argon. You can buy a device for this purpose from wine retailers.

Try an aerosol spray for an inexpensive option, or a more sophisticated system like the Coravin.Invest in this system if you’re a wine connoisseur who frequently needs to keep open bottles, as in a restaurant or other serving setting.

Take extra care with sparkling wine.,
Put reds in the fridge, too.,
Keep long-lasting fortified and box wine.",How to Keep Wine After Being Opened3," Avoid attempting to keep sparkling wine for more than one to three days. Put it in the refrigerator and seal it to avoid losing its carbonation.

Get a stopper specifically made for storing sparkling wine, which will more securely seal the bottle. A regular cork will pop out due to carbonation.Don’t use a vacuum pump on sparkling wine bottles, as it will suck out the carbonation of the wine.
Some people enjoy day-old sparkling wine like champagne more than when it’s freshly opened, due to the slight decrease in carbonation and rounding out of flavors. However, don’t depend on the flavor remaining after more than 24 hours.

, Keep opened bottles of red wine, not just white wine, in a wine chiller or the fridge. Just allow leftover red wine to warm back to room temperature before serving.

Note that dark, rich reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah will generally keep for longer than lighter red varieties like Pinot Noir.
Aged wine older than eight to ten years, and organic or sulfite-free wines, are also more susceptible to going bad more quickly., Try keeping fortified wine, such as Marsala, Port, or Sherry, for much longer than any other type of wine. You can also buy bag-in-a-box style wine for longer storage.

Fortified wines can keep for longer due to the addition of brandy, or sugars in the case of dessert wines. Keep them for up to 28 days with a cork in the fridge.
Keep boxed wine in the fridge and continue drinking from it for two to three weeks. Pay attention to and don’t drink beyond the given expiration date, as it is provided based on regulations for food stored in plastic.Another method of keeping any wine for a very long time is to freeze it for use in cooking. Freeze wine into cubes or a block and keep it in the freezer in an airtight container for up to four to six months."

Which champagne to try? Cava or Prosecco are both great options. Opt for a sparkling wine that is not too sweet, as the sweetness of the orange juice combined with the sweetness of the wine could overpower the drink.

Meet the requirements.,

Know the qualities required of a bartender.,
Deal with drunk patrons appropriately.,
Update your craft.",How to Become a Bartender," You must be at least 18 years old to work as a bartender, though some states require that you be 19 or 21. Some states also require that bartenders take alcohol awareness classes prior to beginning work.Check with your city/state to clarify the specific requirements.


Alcohol awareness classes cover DUIs, fake IDs, Blood Alcohol Levels (BAL), serving alcohol to minors, preventing intoxication, and other related issues.;
, Some bars hire new bartenders who have completed bartending school, while others prefer to promote their own barbacks/cocktail waitresses to bartending positions.


Complete bartending school. Each bartending school is different, but most classes will teach you how to prepare hundreds of different kinds of cocktails, deal with intoxicated patrons, prepare garnishes, pour liquor, and differentiate between different types of beer and wine.Find a job as a barback or cocktail waitress. Barbacks are bartenders' assistants. Duties include collecting empty glasses, preparing garnish trays, getting ice, wiping down the bar, and restocking supplies. Cocktail waitresses are responsible for delivering alcoholic beverages to patrons in bars, music venues, and other drinking establishments.Both of these positions will give you hands-on experience working in a bar setting and prepare you for a future bartending job. Let your employer know that you are interested in working as a bartender so that he or she can notify you when new positions become available.







, Regardless of what route you choose to take, it will take a great deal of practice before you will feel comfortable running a bar on your own. Most bars offer training to new employees and will start new bartenders off working alongside a seasoned bartender in order to gain supervised experience.

, Bartenders can work in a variety of establishments including restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, casinos, and music venues.Send out your resume to several different establishments in your area and check your local listings for job openings.


If you already have a job as a barback or cocktail waitress, then set up a meeting with your supervisor to discuss the prospect of being promoted to a bartending position.

, Bartending might sound like a fun, carefree job, but it can also be very tiring and stressful at times. Consider whether you have the qualities of a good bartender:


Strong people skills. Bartending is an extremely social job. You must enjoy being around people of all different backgrounds and be prepared to interact with intoxicated patrons.







Good memory. Bartenders must memorize the recipes for hundreds of different kinds of cocktails and be able to keep track of which patron ordered what drink. A good memory allows you to remember your regular patrons and their regular orders. Knowing their drinks make them feel important and welcomed. This leads to repeat business and better tips.







Sales skills. Most bartenders are paid minimum wage and rely on tips to make their money. Friendly, accommodating, and charismatic bartenders are most likely to receive good tips.







Ability to multi-task. Bartenders often serve several different customers as the same time, and must juggle mixing drinks with counting money and making change.

Ability to work under pressure. Bartending can be stressful, especially if you work at a busy bar and are the only bartender on duty.

, Bartenders are legally required to refuse service to patrons who are visibly intoxicated. Many bartenders do not realize that they can also be held legally responsible for accidents that may occur to a customer from over serving them. If your drunk customer leaves and hurts themselves or someone else, you and the bar can be held responsible. You will need to learn to recognize when a patron has had enough, and in some instances, ask him or her to leave the bar.


Intoxicated patrons can become defensive, rude, and even violent when confronted, so it's important that you have an assertive personality and not be too shy to stand up to these kinds of people.

, In addition to learning the ""classics,"" bartenders must also stay up-to-date with new cocktails and be knowledgeable about which kinds of drinks are trending at any given point in time.

Become familiar with jiggers.,
Note the different sizes of shot glasses.,
Understand the clear difference between dash and splash.,
Use jiggers when layering drinks.,
Note that a ""part"" doesn't have a specific measurement.,
Get your favorite drink recipe.,
Change the ounces (or other measurements) into parts.,
Revert the math to change parts back into measurements.,
Use measuring cups with the same method.",How to Understand Cocktail Measurements," Jiggers are the most basic bar tool for any beginner. The smaller end would vary from a ""pony"" or 1 oz (30 mL) to a typical ""shot"" or 1 1/2 oz (45 mL), while the larger end would hold up to 2 oz (60 mL). Be aware that a jigger measurement is the same as a shot.


British jiggers uses the metric system instead of imperial, so the standard measurement on a jigger is 25 mL and 50 mL on both ends.

, A typical glass holds 1 1/2 oz; however, there are many bars that have 1 oz glasses. Double shot glasses holds 3 oz and are more beneficial to hold additional ingredients, such as whipped cream.

, Like food recipes, dashes pertain to ingredients that are used in very small amounts, just to give it taste, but not overpower the dish. Adding a splash of an ingredient is a little more of quantity than dashes, so it's a judgement call on how much to use.


Splashes are used with ingredients such as grenadine or blue curacao.
Dashes are used with ingredients with more ""power"" to them, for example Worcestershire or Tabasco sauce.

, Very small quantities of ingredients might be a challenge with measuring, however, if you need a splash of it, free-pouring can be done.
, Rather, it describes a ratio of ingredients that can be scaled up or down to any number of servings.
, Remember that you're only changing the size of the measurement to make bigger quantities of it––the proportion of the ingredients doesn't change. The following example uses a typical kamikaze:

2 oz (60 mL) vodka
1 oz (30 mL) triple sec
1 oz (30 mL) lime juice/sweet and sour mix.

, The 2 oz/60 mL would change into 2 parts, while the 1 oz/30 mL would be 1 part., If you have 1 part of an ingredient, make it easier on yourself and base it on a jigger measurement. Thereafter, 1/2 a part would be 1/2 jigger (3/4 oz or 22.5 mL) and 2 parts would be 3 oz/90 mL., If you're wanting to use a pitcher, measure 2 cups instead of 2 parts.

"
Choose some different liquors and, if desired, syrups (such as grenadine) that you think will make an intriguing or traditional layered shot.,
Determine the specific gravities of the different liquors and other ingredients.,
Organize the different liquors and other ingredients according to their specific gravities so that they can be poured sequentially.,
Determine how much volume each ingredient should take up in the shot glass or cordial glass.,
Begin pouring the first layer.,
Pour the second ingredient carefully and gently on top of the first ingredient, without overly disturbing the first ingredient.,
Let the different layers stabilize for a moment, then serve.








",How to Make Layered Shots," Sweet cream or plain heavy cream are also great ingredients for layered shots. Take into account the flavors of the ingredients. Many layered shots use the same ingredients as popular mixed drinks, so will taste similar. Adjacent layers should contrast with one another. Try layering clear, colorful liquors with opaque liquors. Layered shots are primarily made for their visual and aesthetic appeal.






;
, Heavier liquor will have a higher specific gravity. A gravity chart of different liquors will have to be consulted in order to determine the specific gravities of most liquors. However, as a rule of thumb, the flavored syrups such as grenadine that do not contain alcohol will have the highest specific gravity, and the spirits with less sugar but more alcohol will have a lower specific gravity. Liquors with cream should be relatively light, as should pure or sweet cream. It may be necessary to experiment with different liquors in order to determine their specific gravities.








, The heaviest ingredient with the highest specific gravity will be poured first. The ingredients can be free poured using pour spouts or poured from jiggers or other small measuring cups. It may be easier to pour from a jigger. The ingredients can also be divided into specific small portions with jiggers as seen in the picture.








, This can be done by eye or by pouring the ingredients into measuring cups first. Typical jigger cups may be too large to measure the very small quantities that may be poured.








, Carefully pour the first ingredient directly into the shot glass. Try not to pour on the sides of the glass or splash the ingredient.








, There are multiple ways to accomplish this, some easier than others:










The bar spoon handle method (harder): Touch the end of the handle of the bar spoon to the inside of the glass above the bottom or previous layer without letting the bar spoon touch the rim of the glass. Then touch a pour spout or jigger to the twisted portion of the handle and pour very, very gradually down the handle. The ingredient should course slowly down the handle into the glass, but some may spill. When pouring onto the twisted portion of the spoon it is sometimes possible to direct the flow so that the liquid runs down the top side or the underside of the end of the spoon. Try pouring on different sections of the twisted portion of the spoon and see if your layering technique improves. Regardless of the section of the spoon that is poured down, be sure to keep the end of the spoon against the wall of the glass. This ensures that the ingredient will flow gently down the side of the glass, and helps to keep the handle steady. Also, this method can be used to pour many very fine layers with pinpoint precision and, if done correctly, should result in very pure layers.

Back side of spoon method (easier): Trickle the ingredient over or down the round back side (convex side) of a bar spoon or teaspoon (not down the handle) into the glass while keeping the spoon end against or very near the wall of the glass. The end of the spoon should also be kept above and near the bottom or previous layer. The ingredient should flow gently down the side of the glass and onto the previous layer. Repeat if additional ingredients are to be used. This method may cause the layers to mingle or streak somewhat, especially if the ingredients are poured down the length of the glass.

Be presentable.",How to Be a Good Barmaid," A big smile always makes the customers at ease. Always be polite and friendly; a bit of cheek goes along way now and then. Even if you're busy, the customer you are serving needs to feel like they have your complete attention. Answer their questions, and if you can't, then find someone who can. If they are unsure of what to order, ask what they like and make suggestions based on that. You know more about what's behind the bar than they do, so help them out! You might just introduce them to their new favourite drink.


It will make them come back for more and they may defend you against rude customers.;
, This will keep you from making mistakes at a real event or slowing down other people working with you.

, Customers at bars hate to wait.

, This will help you get the order to the right customer. If people are regulars, remember their names and usual orders. Visitors will pop in now and again, and of course you want to make a good impression on them, or they'll never come back. But your regulars are the ones who are in night after night, the ones paying your wages. Chat to them, take the time to get to know them and what they like to drink. If a regular can walk in to find their drink waiting for them on the bar because you saw them walking across the street to come in, they will feel valued and appreciate that you took the time to observe what they like.

, That way you may get more drinks in the future and appear disciplined.

, Don't appear bored or distracted.

, Don't let people trip you up with rude comments. You are doing a stressful job.If they have a problem, refer them to the manager instead of having them pick on you. That will just slow things down and break your concentration.

, If you're new to bar work, ask what needs doing. People hate new staff members that stand around waiting to be told what to do. Ask. And if you see someone doing something you don't know how to do, ask them to show you. The quicker you learn what's expected of you, and how to change a barrel, the more likely you will be offered more shifts, and the more useful you will be behind the bar.

, Clear away plates from tables and clean the tables, collect glasses and get them washed and put away. Keep the bar clean and wipe up spillages. Keep the floor mopped and dry so you don't slip over. Keep the fridges stocked up. The last thing the customers want to see is a dirty bar, tables filled with used plates as they have nowhere to sit, and they don't want to get wet sleeves when they come to the bar. The staff don't want to have to run to the stockroom/ cellar every 5 minutes because the fridges are empty. Stay on top of these things.

, Customers will often ask if you have drinks/ food, or where they can go to see live bands etc. If you are being asked for the same thing on a regular basis that you don't have, then suggest it to your boss. Customers are the best way to find out what the market wants as they ARE your market, and if customers know you will get something in for them if they ask for it, they are more likely to come back again and again.

, Underage drinking and drug use is illegal. Let it slide once and that's what your bar will become known for. It will get you a bad reputation and potentially get your bar closed down. Don't do it!

, You will generally get a feel for the type of activities your customers like, and what better way to get new customers in the door than to hold events? Whether it's live music, comedy, special offers like happy hour or a cider festival, it keeps your bar alive and vibrant.

, Everyone has their own sense of fashion and style, but just make sure you're presentable. Wear clean clothes, make sure you don't smell and your hair is tidy. Brush your teeth, don't wear chipped nail polish. If people have a bad impression of you, or can smell you from afar, they probably won't want to drink in your bar!

Make a Gin & Tonic.,
Make a Rum & Coke.,
Make a Vodka & Cranberry.,
Make a Whiskey & Ginger Ale.",How to Make Drinks1," Gin & Tonic is one of the most popular drinks of all time, thanks to its wonderfully simple, yet refreshing quality. To make the perfect Gin & Tonic you will need: a large highball glass, plenty of well-frozen, clear ice cubes, a lime, a chilled bottle of tonic water and the best quality gin you can get your hands on. To prepare:


Roll the lime on the counter beneath your palm to release the juice, then use a sharp knife to cut it across the center. Turn one lime half onto its flat side and cut it into four equal quarters.
Take one lime wedge and squeeze its juice into the highball glass, then drop the wedge into the glass. Grab your bottle of gin and pour a double measure (1.5 oz.) into the glass. If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use the cap of the gin bottle. Three cap-fulls plus an extra dash is about right.
Fill your glass with as many ice cubes as you can fit, then use a long spoon to stir the drink for a couple of seconds. Open the bottle of chilled tonic and pour 3.5 oz. into the glass. Stir the drink again to combine the gin, tonic and lime juice.
If needed, add more ice to bring the level of the liquid about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the rim of the glass - don't add any more tonic water. Take another lime wedge and slot it onto the rim of the glass to garnish. Add a clear straw, if desired.;
, Rum & Coke is another classic drink whose flavor can vary depending on the type of rum you use - you can go for regular dark rum, spiced rum, coconut rum, whatever you feel like! The traditional Rum & Coke uses light rum, and when garnished with a lime wedge becomes a drink known as a Cuba Libre. To prepare a perfect rum and coke:


Fill a highball glass with well-frozen, clear ice. Measure out 2 oz. of your chosen rum and pour it over the ice.
Measure 4 oz. of Coke (or another cola brand) and pour it into the glass, stirring with a long spoon as you pour.
Garnish the glass with a lime wedge for a Cuba Libre, or with a maraschino cherry if using spiced or coconut rum., Vodka & Cranberry is a tasty alcoholic treat whose vibrant color makes it a popular choice in bars across the world. Though many people prepare Vodka & Cranberry juice just using those two ingredients, the traditional recipe also calls for a dash of Rose's lime juice and a dash of orange juice, to really enhance the flavor of the cranberry. To prepare:


Half-fill an old-fashioned glass with clear, well-frozen ice. Measure out 1 oz. (or 2 oz. if you want a stronger drink) of vodka and pour it over the ice.
Add 4½ oz. of cranberry juice and, if using, a dash of Rose's lime juice and a dash of good-quality orange juice. Serve with one or two straws and garnish with a wedge of lime.

, Although whisky buffs may decry the notion of mixing whiskey with anything other than ice, this drink is growing increasingly popular thanks to its crisp, flavorsome nature. It's most commonly made with Jameson Irish whiskey, but also works well with bourbon and rye whiskeys. To prepare:


Fill a highball glass with clear, well-frozen ice. Measure out 1.5 oz. of your chosen whiskey and pour over the ice.
Open a fresh, chilled can of ginger ale and pour into the glass, until the level of the liquid is about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the rim.
Squeeze the juice from a lime wedge into the drink, then drop the lime wedge in. Use a long spoon to stir the drink, and serve."

This way you can concentrate on making sure your guests are having a great time instead of being stuck behind the bar frazzled by complicated drink requests.Make a mixed drink, such as rum punch, that you can prepare ahead of time and in great quantity so your guests can grab a drink as soon as they arrive.Prepare in advance a batch of signature mocktails, such as sparkling peach punch, for those who prefer not to drink alcohol. This would be especially relevant if you know there will be children at your party.You can assume each guest will down 1-2 drinks per hour. Count up your guests and the length of your party to get a good idea of how many drinks you should provide.;
, While a signature drink will cut down on individual drink requests, make sure that you still have a fully stocked bar for that guest who just isn’t into the cocktail you’re serving. Happy guests equals a fun party!


Make sure you provide a few types of beer and red and white wine for those who don’t find themselves wanting a mixed drink.
Have the basic spirits on hand, such as whiskey, gin, tequila, brandy, rum, and vodka. You’ll be able to whip up a martini in no time!
Don't forget mixers and garnishes. Basic mixers include tonic, club soda, and a variety of sodas. Cut up lemons and limes ahead of time as a garnish for drinks. Then you’ll be all set for any guests wanting a gin and tonic., You should have a variety of glasses on hand depending on the types of drinks you plan to offer. A good plan is to have twice as many glasses as guests. It’s a party and glasses will surely be broken.You can always rent glassware if you’d prefer not to invest in large amounts of cocktail glasses.
Basic glassware to have around includes wine glasses, straight-sided highballs, pint glasses for beers, tumblers for liquor, martini glasses, and champagne flutes.
Provide glass charms for your guests to identify their glass since they’ll be moving around socializing and might lose track of their glass., Ice will run out more quickly than you’d think at a cocktail party so stock up! Remember that you're not just using it for drinks, but also for chilling.


Larger ice cubes will melt less quickly in cocktail drinks so purchase a silicone mold and make several batches ahead of time.
Don’t place all your ice out for your guests at once - it will melt so keep some reserves in the freezer., Since a cocktail party doesn’t need a sit-down meal, be sure to provide your guests with plenty of snacks. Alcohol and an empty stomach simply don’t go well together! Plan on each guest eating 2-3 appetizers.Common snacks include cheese and meat boards and assorted olive, nut, or fruit platters.
You should also include a few sweets, such as cookies, in addition to more popular savory appetizers., Since appetizers can be fussy, streamline your party prep by making large amounts of simple dishes. A table filled with overflowing platters and bowls looks better than sparsely populated trays of a variety of dishes.This also allows you to easily replenish any serving platters that begin looking sadly empty.

, Skip fussy appetizers that require a seat, plate, and silverware to consume. Guests will find it easier to socialize with finger foods that require only a napkin or toothpick to consume.Meatballs on a toothpick or bite-size cheesecakes make for easy eating., It’s always a good idea to provide some veggie options for those friends who don’t care to eat meat. A good crudite platter will do the trick and will accommodate vegans as well.


You can have fun with the veggie options by putting out a bruschetta or go with a simple dip, such as spinach-artichoke., Providing locally sourced food and goodies will not only be supporting your community, but it also makes for a good conversation starter! This is a great way for you to engage with your guests and get your guests to talk to each other., Make sure you to include the time of your cocktail party on the invitation. Cocktail parties generally last only for about 2-3 hours. They can be held at any time between 4 P.M. and 10 P.M.

, Nothing is worse than showing up to a party underdressed. Be explicit whether guests should show up in cocktail attire or in casual clothing.If it’s a weeknight party you could keep things casual, leaving fancier dress for weekend or special occasion cocktail parties., Since cocktail parties mean lots of standing and mingling make sure your guests aren’t tripping over bulky furniture. Place some seating groups in small clusters for those who prefer sitting. Make sure to have a few tables around for guests to put down a drink while they’re chatting., Make up a playlist ahead of time and have it playing when guests arrive. This will make the environment more welcoming and fill up any awkward silences until the party gets going., You don’t need fancy decorations to make your cocktail party look classy. Simply put out a few accents, like vases of flowers, to jazz up your party.If your cocktail party is outdoors, string up some lights to set the mood and make sure your guests can see where they’re going., Provide a table for empty glasses or enlist a friend to help you go around and collect empty glasses as the party goes on. This will make cleaning up the next day less of a headache.Have an empty dishwasher ready to receive all those dirty glasses."

Serve straight gin.,
Serve straight whiskey.,
Serve straight vodka.,
Serve straight rum.,
Serve straight tequila.",How to Make Drinks2," Gin can be a difficult drink to drink straight, unless it is of a very good quality. Nevertheless, a good gin can make an excellent drink served chilled over ice on a hot summer day. Simply fill a highball glass with ice cubes, pour over a measure of your finest gin (Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray are two good options), and add a twist of fresh lime juice, if you like., How you drink whiskey will really depend on the alcohol volume and personal preference. Any whiskeys with an ABV (alcohol by volume) over 50% can usually benefit from a splash of water or a couple of ice cubes to dilute the alcohol slightly, thus allowing you to pick up on the flavors more easily. Whiskeys with ABVs between 45% and 50% can either be diluted with a little water or ice, or left on their own - it's really a matter of which taste your prefer. Whiskeys with ABVs less than 40% should technically be drunk neat (no water or ice, unchilled) as they have already been cut down to this volume in the distillery and don't require any further dilution.

, Vodka should be stored in the freezer overnight or for at least a few hours before serving. Freezing vodka brings out its ideal flavor and consistency. You should also place your serving glasses (2 or 3 oz. glasses are best) in the freezer for about an hour to get them nice and cold. Once they're ready, pour a shot measure (1.5 oz.) of the frozen vodka into the chilled glasses. Do not add ice. Warm the glass in your hand for a minute or two before drinking, to bring the vodka to ideal drinking temperature., Really good rum is considered a great after-dinner liquor. Like whiskey, rum can be served by itself, with a splash of water (5 to 6 drops), or over ice--it really depends on your personal preference. The best glass to use for rum is a snifter--the opening of the glass is rather small, allowing the rum's vapors and aromas to become concentrated., While most lower-range tequilas are served in a shot glass, good quality tequilas should be served in a snifter or a similar glass that has a small mouth. When serving tequila straight, it is important to 'warm up' your mouth. If you were to take a large gulp of tequila, it would taste fiery and some of the liquor's flavor would be wasted. Instead, warm up your mouth by taking a tiny sip of the tequila and letting the liquid run over all of the surfaces of your mouth--gums, tongue, and cheeks included. After this warm up you'll be able to taste and fully appreciate the subtle flavors of the tequila."

, While the dirty martini we know today (gin or vodka, dry vermouth and olive juice) has been around since the early 1900s, this drink has become world famous thanks to one man--and his name is Bond--James Bond. The spy has ordered this drink (shaken, not stirred of course) throughout numerous books and movies. Get your 007 groove on shake up one of your own tonight.

, Tequila Sunrise gets its name from the beautiful layered effect created by the yellow juice and bright red grenadine. Tequila Sunrise is a very easy cocktail to make, but definitely makes a favorable impression at parties.

, The Long Island Iced Teas is a strong, liquor-heavy cocktail that dates back to the 1970s, when it was supposedly created by a bartender in Long Island, New York. Whatever its origins, the Long Island Tea is now one of the top five most ordered cocktails in the world.

, Sex on the Beach is a sweet, fruity drink with an intriguingly risqué name., The Old Fashioned is reputed to be the original American cocktail, served since the 1800s in one form or another. It's experienced something of a renaissance recently, thanks largely to its status as Don Draper's standard drink of choice. There are lots of variations on the Old Fashioned, many of them involving muddled fruits and other unnecessary extras, but the classic version stands out for its simplicity and style., The Mojito originated in Cuba, and is said to be one of Ernest Hemingway's favorite cocktails. They are pretty much the perfect summer drink, thanks to the zesty, refreshing combination of mint leaves and lime, ideal for daytime barbecues and late-night dance bars alike., The Margarita is a refreshing, tequila-based drink from Mexico, which has become popular worldwide. In fact, it is the number one tequila-based cocktail in the United States and no Mexican-themed dinner party is complete without a couple of pitchers of Margaritas doing the rounds., The White Russian is a creamy, coffee-flavored, vodka-based cocktail which is perfect as an after-dinner drink. If you leave out the cream, you have what's called a Black Russian which is a lighter alternative., Since its creation in 1915, the Singapore Sling has been shrouded in debate and mystery. The Raffles hotel in Singapore is credited with inventing this drink, but even they are uncertain about the original recipe other than the fact that it was like a gin sling with one addition--a mystery ingredient that has been lost to the sands of time. Today, this drink is made with plenty more ingredients and remains intriguingly delicious., Like the lemony liquid of this drink, its history is a bit murky. Some say that it gained popularity in San Francisco where it was marketed as that blooming creation--the “girly drink”. Whether considered “girly” or not, men and women alike can agree its pretty darn tasty., There are several stories surrounding the naming of this cocktail. One fact is actually true--the Tom Collins has its own poem about the man who inspired the drink. That little ditty goes something like this: “My name is John Collins, headwaiter at Limmer’s / Corner of Conduit Street, Hanover Square,/ My chief occupation is filling brimmers / For all the young gentlemen frequenters there."" But wait, you might be saying, the drink is called a Tom Collins--not John! Well some time at the turn of the century, bartenders started using Old Tom gin to make the drink, and voila! the Tom Collins was born., The history of the Daiquiri is steeped in that place of cigars, dancing, and rum--Cuba. Apparently one night, a man named Jenning Cox ran out of gin while entertaining guests so he turned to that glowing island liquor known as rum. Let this drink transport you to the white sand beaches of Cuban paradise."

One of the most famous lines is, ”If you like pina coladas, and gettin’ caught in the rain.” Well now you can reconnect with your own darling and sip on this delicious drink.

, This offshoot of the original, unblended daiquiri is a fantastic beverage to drink poolside, particularly if you are a fan of sweeter, pinker drinks. Skip the store bought watery stuff and make your own frozen daiquiri to drink at your next pool party.

, The first frozen margarita machine was invented by then 26-year-old Dallas resident Mariano Martinez in 1971. Of course, you don’t need to go out to indulge in this blended concoction--try making it at home for yourself!

, If you love ice cream, alcohol, or both, look no further than the frozen mudslide. This drink is considered a “trio” cocktail because it combines three different types of alcohol in one drink--Malibu rum, Kahlua, and Bailey’s Irish Cream liqueur. Recently, however, bartenders have been favoring vodka over the traditional rum."

Consider some tips before trying out a mocktail.,
Create a base for a homemade cocktail.,
Try out some non-alcoholic versions of classic cocktails.,
Make a non alcoholic pina colada.",How to Make Drinks5," What mocktails lack in alcohol, they make up for in strong flavors and fun looks. Just because you’re making a non-alcoholic beverage doesn’t mean you can skimp on the ingredients or the garnish. In fact, when making mocktails its actually more important to use fresh fruit and not-from-concentrate juices because they are the foundation of your drink.Use fresh fruit and good juice. To give your mocktail the best flavor possible, use the tastiest ingredients available. Buy fresh fruit from your local farmer’s market. Buy juice that
Know the importance of the garnish. Garnishes are fun--no one can deny that. Match your garnish with the flavor or personality of your drink. Go wild--everyone will be jealous of your mini-umbrella, pineapple chunk, and maraschino cherry.

, If you are making up your own recipe, you should start with a solid base. Mocktails that are too sweet can be a little overwhelming so a good base for pretty much any mocktail is one ounce of lemon or lime juice mixed with ¾ ounce of fresh simple syrup. From there you can muddle away to your heart’s content, or add some club soda to get your sparkle on., If you’re not in a very creative mood and would rather stick to a cocktail you know, minus the alcohol, there are plenty of recipes out there for that. In particular, cocktails made with vodka can very easily be turned into mocktails--vodka is a neutral flavor so its absence won’t really change the cocktail too much. Try out some of these classic mocktail recipes:



Make a Safe Sex on the Beach mocktail. All the risque of the original drink, without the risk.

Try a Mojito Mocktail. Mint, limes, club soda...what’s not to love?

Make a strawberry margarita, minus the tequila. Get your groove on but not your booze on.

",How to Make a Shandy (Lemon Beer)," As long as you have a lighter beer, you really can't go wrong. Here are some types of beer that you can use as the base for your shandy:


Wheat beer. Silky and smooth, but a little heavier, pairs wonderfully with the lemon.
Lager. Crisp and refreshing, this makes a somewhat lighter shandy.
Pilsner. A little more distinctive-tasting than your average lager, this beer creates a more complex shandy.;
, Whether you choose sparkling lemonade, regular lemonade, or lemon soda (such as Sprite or Squirt), your shandy is pretty much guaranteed to be good. A couple words of advice:


If you can, choose all-natural lemonade. With a great beer, natural lemonade tastes amazing. Sure, you can make a perfectly acceptable shandy with lemonade made from concentrate, but it won't have the same pizzaz as all-natural lemonade.
If using a soda such as Sprite, add a little bit less than the specified amount (~150 ml). Lemon sodas are pretty sweet; a shandy made with lemon soda ends up being a little sweet for many people, overpowering the taste of the beer. You can always add more soda in at the end after tasting.

, If you don't mind your beer a little watery, adding ice keeps the shandy cool while you drink it.

, Shaking will cause the foam in the beer to activate. Stir gently until your beer and lemonade are beautifully intertwined.

Consider why you want to use a nanobrewery.,
Find a building for your nanobrewery.,
Adapt the building's floor if necessary.,
Conform to health standards.,
Use materials that the FDA has approved for beer production.,
Use approved commercial and/or NEMA-enclosed watertight electrical components and systems.,
Get proper gas burners and use adequate ventilation.,
Prevent grain explosions.,
Implement fermentation strategies.,
Package beer using low-cost, simple methods.,
Practice proper waste disposal.",How to Make a Home Brewery a Commercial Nanobrewery," Of course you want to make commercial beer that the public can enjoy! Also, starting small makes sense because it can take over a year to get a brewery approved, and there is always the chance that your brewery won’t be approved due to location or the condition of the building that houses the brewery. And you do need to have a working brewing system in your brewery before the entire brewery can be approved. So why risk many thousands of dollars on a commercial brewing system and related infrastructure such as a steam boiler, piped glycol system, and industrial electronic controls when you can set up a homebrew system for the initial approval process? After your brewery is approved, you can upgrade at your leisure if desired. It can, after all, take many grueling months to put together a decent-sized microbrewery. If you agree that this is a good idea, you’ll need to know that you can’t simply roll, drag, or heft your RIMS (Recirculating Infusion Mash System), MoreBeer sculpture, or homemade setup into a commercial space and tell the inspectors to come on over. There’s some technical hurdles that you’ll need to overcome, and you don’t want to have to reschedule additional inspections, as that’ll lengthen your approval process considerably.;
, Breweries must be zoned properly and conform to local regulations, and it is very unlikely that it will be legal for you to operate a commercial brewery in your home. Generally, light industrial-zoned buildings and certain types of restaurants are good candidates, as long as they are not near schools or churches. The building will also need to have commercial wiring and floor drainage systems that are acceptable for food production operations.

, The floor of the building is a major consideration. Concrete floors are essentially mandatory. Any brewery that will allow liquids to drain onto the floor will need an approved system of floor drains in addition to the sink floor drain, and the floor must have a certain slope so that liquid will flow properly to the drains. However, when using a homebrew-sized system, a complex drainage system shouldn’t be necessary. Just be aware that if you upgrade your system you may also need to upgrade the drainage system. Check on what types of drainage systems are required in your area before leasing or purchasing a building. Some breweries have drainage systems installed and have their floors sloped after the building has been purchased or leased but before the brewing system is installed. It is acceptable to only have the area that’s under the brewing system and fermenters to be sloped and equipped with drains, so your building can be retrofitted when you expand, and while you’re brewing on the nano system in an area without nearby or elaborate floor drains. Areas where customers congregate should of course not have sloped floors.

, Breweries will be treated to a large extent as food processing facilities, but there is an understanding that beer does not pose the same risks as actual food products. It does not harbor pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Still, you will need to have one or more restaurant-style stainless sinks that have an air gap between the sink drain and the floor (there must be a floor drain where the waste water will exit), and a separate handwashing sink. If you want to avoid dealing excessively with the local health inspector and want to minimize the regulations that you need to conform to, don’t initially plan on serving beer at the brewery.

, Equipment used should be made of safe, approved materials such as stainless steel. Copper is an acceptable material for use in breweries and wort can come into contact with it, although there may be some restrictions in terms of fermented beer coming into contact with copper. You should avoid brass because it generally contains lead, but small fittings probably won’t be questioned. Food-grade plastics and rubber such as polyethylene plastic, high-temp polysulfone plastic, neoprene rubber, and high-temp silicone rubber are perfectly acceptable. Always be sure not to exceed the temperature ratings of materials that are not metal. When using PVC or vinyl tubing, use types that have the statement ""FDA approved"" printed on them. Regular garden hoses are not acceptable! And glass carboys probably won’t go over too well with any inspector or the customer base.


Mash tun insulation may need to be removed, and most types of insulation should not be used on mash tuns that are heated with gas burners because they will melt or burn. It is wisest to simply use no insulation. This being said, Reflectix is approved for temperatures up to 180F, and Armaflex (and other similar types of insulation) are generally approved for temperatures up to or exceeding 220F. Unheated infusion mash tuns will not exceed these temperatures. Reflectix insulation is FDA-approved for incidental food contact. This is primarily because its exposed surface is aluminum foil. Therefore, it’s logical that other types of insulation that are sheathed in foil, such as foil-foam-foil insulation, can be used for brewing applications. Armaflex and similar types of insulation are essentially “closed-cell” elastomeric foam, and have excellent R-values. It’s typically used to insulate pipes, and can be used in food processing facilities as long as it’s contained in an FDA-approved covering. Wood is insulating and is usually all-natural, and may be an acceptable, approvable insulation material. Plywood and pressure-treated lumber are exceptions, as is wood that’s been sealed or coated in anything except natural oils (mineral oil is a commonly used, FDA-approved wood-conditioning oil). And if the wood burns it won’t really be any more toxic than a wood-fired barbecue. And, if necessary, the wood can be clad in metal to shield it from flames (although too much heat may result in the production of charcoal). For unfired vessels, wood can also be used to clad other forms of insulation such as Armaflex. Wood is generally a better insulator than Reflectix, while Armaflex is better than wood. Pine has a higher R-value than many other types of wood, especially when compared to hardwood. Wood slats can be secured to the outside of stainless brewing vessels using metal banding.

, Breweries are wet environments and thus highly hazardous when electricity is a factor. There are different grades of NEMA enclosures. Type 4 and 4X are watertight and are typically used in breweries (digital temperature controllers are often in gray, approvable NEMA enclosures). Electronic devices can often be enclosed in NEMA enclosures and related NEMA conduit. Even if you use NEMA enclosures, if the local inspector sees electrical components or systems that don’t completely follow all applicable commercial codes, you most likely won’t be approved. Be sure that all of the electrical devices and systems, including the outlet boxes, fuse boxes, and wires, conform to relevant commercial electrical codes.


Many homebrew systems, especially gravity 3-tier systems, do not utilize or rely upon electrical components. This is perfectly acceptable. However, larger or more complex homebrew systems, such as 10 gallon (37.9 L) RIMS systems and many 20 gallon (75.7 L) systems, may use electric heating elements, electronic controls, and/or electric pumps. This being said, if your homebrew system has electronic components that are not NEMA-enclosed and/or commercial-grade devices, it is best to remove them entirely. Yes, your system might be compromised, but you can make it work.
Certain pumps such as the March Pump model 409 high-temp food-grade pump that have unenclosed non-NEMA motors may be an exception, depending on the local inspector's opinion. However, they must be grounded properly and used in an approved manner. Regardless, it is best to invest in some pumps with watertight NEMA motor enclosures.

, Improperly used burners can produce lethal concentrations of carbon monoxide and present fire hazards. You’ll probably need to use indoor burners, so replace your burners if necessary and make sure they can be hooked up to the available indoor gas supply. If the brewing system is located next to a large cargo door that is capable of providing adequate ventilation, outdoor burners hooked up to outdoor-type propane tanks (barbecue tanks) should be fine. Use indoor restaurant stockpot stoves if you can’t replace the burners and don’t have the right ventilation. If a cargo door is lacking, it’s imperative that you have a vent hood installed that essentially covers all of the burners. That probably will mean that you’ll need a large vent that covers your entire brewing system. Also, it may be important to vent the vapor that is produced from the boiling wort using a ventilation hood.

, Some simple nanobreweries just use malt extract instead of grain, but like the vast majority of commercial breweries, you’ll probably be milling grain. It is common knowledge that grain dust causes explosions. The open flames that will occur when you’re brewing will present a potentially major explosion hazard, as will unenclosed electric motors. So it is best to have a separate, ventilated milling area away from the brewing area. This area is also where the grain should be stored, as any grain that’s near burners or sparks is a potential fire hazard as well as an explosion hazard. If your mill it motorized you’ll need to use an enclosed, explosion-proof motor or you’ll have to mill by hand. Watch out for those little rocks in the grain though, they might make some sparks and set off an explosion. If your brewing space isn’t big enough for a milling/grain room, the inspector may decide to limit the amount of grain that you can have on the premises at any one time.

, As for fermentation, you can simply use refrigerators with small stainless steel homebrew conicals if you want to minimize expenses as much as possible. Blichmann and MoreBeer fermenters as well as other cold-side home brewing products such as counterflow and brazed plate chillers should be perfectly fine. The step up from 7.5 gallon (28.4 L) conicals and refrigerators this is a walk-in cooler with conicals, but make sure that you have the cooler professionally installed and wired to relevant commercial standards. It is perfectly acceptable to use plastic poly fermenters as a lower-cost alternative to stainless conicals. A third option is a small glycol-cooled commercial conical with a standalone, portable glycol system that is designed for use in breweries or wineries. Portable glycol chillers can be hooked up directly to a tank without the need for a complex system of permanent glycol lines. But if you do use a 3 or 5 bbl fermenter, make sure you can fill it adequately. This will likely mean stacking consecutive brews during one long brew day.


If you want to set up a larger, non-portable glycol system from different components, it’s best to wait until after your brewery has been approved. Then you can have fun with refrigerant, compressors, glycol reservoirs, pumps, and solenoid valves. A small bright tank or serving vessel will also be a great idea, and you can use it to rapidly carbonate your beer.

, You won't be kegging or bottling large quantities of beer, so package beer much as you would at home. It is a good idea to use a simple gravity wine filler to fill 22 oz bomber bottles with flat beer that is to be bottle conditioned. Use a homebrew bench capper and/or 5 gallon (18.9 L) cornelius-type kegs. Commercial breweries have successfully packaged five-barrel batches using Colonna bench cappers and gravity wine fillers. Of course, five barrels is considerably more than what a typical nanobrewery will produce in one or even two days. A self-stopping sanitary demand pump, such as demand diaphragm pump, can be used to keep the wine filler full when it is connected to a fermenter or brite tank. Be aware that if commercial Sanke kegs are used, they will need to be cleaned using an expensive keg cleaning machine or using a potentially expensive centrifugal pump and cleaning solution reservoir setup.


Also consider how much space you’ll require to store bottled beer and kegs as well as empty bottles and kegs. Bottle and keg-conditioned beer (that is allowed to carbonate naturally in the kegs or bottles) will need to be stored for about three weeks.

, Waste disposal can be a costly hassle. Microbreweries are often not permitted to send much of their liquid waste into the the city’s sewer lines. This isn’t just because the breweries use large amounts of cleaning chemicals. Yeast, which is dumped in large quantities, actually puts a lot of stress on sewage systems. Often, the only option is to keep an outdoor waste tank. Such a tank is filled with liquid waste and periodically drained by a waste disposal truck. An additional, isolated floor drain may also need to be installed that leads to the outdoor waste tank. Luckily, it may be perfectly acceptable for a nanobrewery to send their waste down the city drain, as long as approved chemicals are used. However, be prepared to execute this strategy if the inspector requests it.

Obtain some measured jiggers of different common sizes and a liquor bottle with a pour spout.,
Grasp the liquor bottle firmly by the the neck with your index finger over the base of the pour spout.,
Deftly lift the bottle up and, in one fluid motion, tilt the bottle over and pour into a cup, then tilt the bottle back to vertical and place it back on the table.,
Count while pouring into an empty jigger until it is full.,
Free pour into a glass using the counts established in the previous step, then measure how much you poured using the jiggers.",How to Free Pour," The pour spout must fit very snugly in the liquor bottle and form an airtight seal. The jiggers won't be needed soon, but are needed to learn how to pour the right quantities. The liquor bottle should be filled with water unless you are practicing during a party!;
, It is very important to hold the liquor bottle properly, otherwise you will not be able to control the pour!

, While the exact technique will vary, this lets you understand how to pour in a controlled manner. You want to begin pouring all at once directly into the cup, then stop pouring all at once, in one fluid motion. The pour should start readily and flow evenly. If the liquid being poured sputters excessively or does not pour readily or evenly, the pour spout may not fit properly in the bottle. Be sure to angle the spout properly while pouring so that the liquor is poured as evenly as possible and downward.

, This is the secret that enables you to know exactly how much you are pouring into the glass. Therefore, as soon as you begin pouring, keep an even count, then as soon as the jigger is full, and you stop pouring, stop counting. People may count to three or four for a one ounce jigger, but be sure to establish a specific count for a specific amount. Practice this repeatedly with the one ounce jigger, then with the 3/4 ounce jigger, 1 1/2 ounce jigger, and so forth. You will end up counting less for the smaller jiggers and more for the larger jiggers.

, This will enable you to see how close you can get to the desired amount while free pouring. Many people can be essentially exact.

",How to Garnish a Cocktail," Most garnishes can be made with a paring knife, but it is helpful to have a channel knife tool and a grater. A larger knife may be needed if larger fruits are to be prepared, such as oranges and pineapples. Channel knife tools are used to make twists and spirals from citrus fruits, while a grater enables one to grate ingredients such as chocolate and nutmeg fresh right over the cocktail. A grater can also be used to grate ingredients that are used for rimming glasses. A combination of different garnishes can be used, so have the tools ready for the types of garnishes that are to be made.;
, The cocktail recipe will usually call for a certain garnish, but this is not always the case. Different garnishes can be used according to personal preference, and combinations of multiple garnishes can be used.


Citrus garnishes are generally great for cocktails that do not contain milk or cream, although there are creamy cocktails that call for citrus garnishes such as orange spirals.
Maraschino cherries complement many different types of cocktails, but should never be used in certain cocktails, such as a standard martini. Many garnishes complement one of the primary cocktail ingredients.
A pear slice is used to garnish an Asian Pear Martini, and a Razzmopolitan is garnished with raspberries. Tomato-based cocktails are generally garnished with limes, lemons and celery stalks. Always consider how the garnish will complement the flavor of the primary ingredients.
Vodka-based cocktails tend to pair well with lemon and lime flavors, tequila and rum pair well with limes, rum can pair well with mint, chocolate pairs with crème de cacao liqueur, and coffee beans complement coffee liqueur. Also consider the overall theme of the drink. Tropical cocktails may use tropical fruits, and dessert cocktails may use cookies or chocolate. A cocktail that uses spiced rum may be garnished with a cinnamon stick.

, The rim of the empty glass can be coated with garnishes such as fine sugar, salt, cocoa powder, finely grated chocolate and finely crushed graham crackers or cookies. To coat the rim of a glass, first spread or mound the garnish ingredient on a small plate or tray, then briefly rub around the rim of the glass with something such as a lemon wedge to moisten it. The garnish will adhere to the area that is moistened. Then lay the glass on its side so that the rim is touching the garnish, and rotate or roll the glass on the garnish so that the entire rim is coated. The glass can also just be placed upside down on the rimming ingredient and rotated somewhat to coat the rim. Additional garnishes may be added to cocktails that are served in rimmed glasses.

, Garnishes generally need to be prepared before the cocktail is mixed. Common, relatively simple garnishes for cocktails include maraschino cherries as well as citrus wedges, wheels, twists and spirals. Olives, cocktail onions and celery stalks are also commonly used for certain drinks.


Wheels are made by simply slicing a fruit widthwise. The ends of the fruit are disposed of, and the slices should be about 1/4"" thick. To make wedges, first cut off and dispose of the ends of the fruit, then slice the fruit into eight wedges. Start by cutting the fruit in half from one cut end to the other (lengthwise). Then slice each half lengthwise (in half) to produce four wedges, then slice each of the four wedges in half lengthwise to produce the eight wedges. Make a single slice in the middle area of the meat of the wedges and halfway through wheels (from the edge to the center) with a paring knife and stick them onto the rim of the glass. Also coat wedges and spirals in fine sugar.
Spirals can be dangled from the rim of the glass. Twists are twisted, bent or rolled to release the citrus skin oils and to give them their characteristic shape, then dropped into the drink. Twists can be about an inch or more long, while spirals can be a few or more inches long. Twists and spirals can both be made relatively easily with a channel knife tool. Try making twists by running the channel knife tool lengthwise along a lemon (or other citrus fruit), and make spirals by running the channel knife around a lemon. Twists and spirals can also be made by cutting the rind of a citrus fruit into strips with a paring knife.
Garnishes such as cherries, cocktail olives and cocktail onions can be speared with toothpicks and rested on the rim of the glass or merely dropped into the drink and allowed to rest on the bottom of the glass, especially if the drink is not opaque. If multiple such fruits are going to be used to garnish one cocktail, it is best to spear them together with a toothpick.
For an easy but attractive garnish, rest a sprig of mint on the glass rim or on the drink. Cinnamon sticks can simply be rested on the rim of the glass or placed vertically in the drink.

, Use a toothpick to stick together different fruits to make fruit ""flags"" and ""boats"". Flags are stuck onto the rim of the glass, with one fruit stuck on top of another. Boats essentially rest against the rim and on or partially in the drink, but are not stuck onto the rim of the glass. However, a boat garnish can rest on the rim of the glass with the help of a toothpick. An orange and cherry boat is made by placing a cherry on the center of an orange wheel and bending the slice somewhat around the cherry like a taco. A toothpick is inserted through the orange slice and the cherry to keep the slice curved like a boat around the cherry. Use boats with frothy cocktails. Try using fruits such as pineapples, bananas, kiwis and berries when making fruit flags. Leave fruits unpeeled when slicing them into garnishes such as wheels. Strawberries and other fruits can be dipped in melted chocolate and placed on the rim of the glass.


To make a chocolate-dipped strawberry that can be placed on the rim of a glass, first melt some chocolate, then carefully dip the strawberry in the chocolate and allow the extra chocolate to drip off. The chocolate should be allowed to cool and solidify somewhat so that is doesn't drip down the glass. Set the strawberry down on parchment paper or wax paper for a short period of time, or keep it suspended vertically so that the chocolate drips downward evenly and forms an even coating. When the chocolate has become stable but is still somewhat gooey, make a vertical slice in the bottom of the strawberry through the chocolate-dipped part, and place it on the rim of the glass. If the chocolate has been allowed to solidify completely, it may crack and break off somewhat when the strawberry is sliced and placed on the rim. The strawberry can be placed on an empty glass before straining or pouring the drink, and try chilling the glass and/or the strawberry first so that the chocolate solidifies rapidly.

, Right after mixing the cocktail, garnish the cocktail as called for by the recipe or as desired.


Sprinkle ingredients such as cocoa powder and ground cinnamon on top of the cocktail. Grate or zest ingredients such as dark chocolate, nutmeg and citrus fruits fresh right over the cocktail. Cocktails made with hot coffee or hot chocolate (usually referred to as ""warmers""), such as Irish Cream Coffee and Black Forest Hot Chocolate may be topped with whipped cream, and then garnished with grated chocolate, cocoa powder or a maraschino cherry.
You can also float the garnish on the surface of the cocktail. Float coffee beans on frothy cocktails. Also float citrus spirals and thin fruit wheels (such as apple wheels) on various cocktails, not just frothy ones.

Common garnishes for shaken cocktails include maraschino cherries as well as citrus wedges, wheels, twists and spirals. For more detail on how to make garnishes, read How to Garnish a Cocktail.;
, Shakers are generally filled about half full with ice, although different amounts can be used depending on the shaker design. Leave space so that the ice can be vigorously shaken with the ingredients in the shaker. When using a small cup as a cap that fits inside a larger cup, fill the large cup about half full with ice. Boston shakers can be completely filled with ice, as the glass cup that is filled with ice is capped with a larger cup that fits over the glass cup. Cobbler shakers don't use a separate cup as a cap, and have built-in strainers. Boston shakers and other similar shakers are used with separate strainers. It is common to use two metal cups as a shaker. When a Cobbler shaker or a large metal cup and a small cup for a cap are used, it is possible to hold and shake the shaker with one hand. Metal shaker cups are oftentimes weighted when a heavy glass cup is not used to make shaking more effective.

, The ingredients can be free poured into the shaker or measured with jiggers. Add ingredients for one or more cocktails, depending on the capacity of the shaker and the number of cocktails to be made. For Boston shakers, add the ice and ingredients to the glass cup.

, Once the ingredients have been added, cover the shaker tightly with the cap. Make sure a watertight seal is formed, but don't press the shaker in or on too tightly because it may be very difficult to remove.

, Keep the cap held tightly over or in the shaker. Hold the shaker vertically or somewhat tilted and shake it up and down. Hold the shaker securely in a manner that feels relatively comfortable. Some additional movements, such as side to side motions, can be used while shaking the shaker up and down to create some added flair. Use both hands for most shakers, with one hand on the bottom of the shaker and the other on the top. The ingredients need to be chilled thoroughly and totally mixed. When the cocktail is adequately mixed and chilled, condensation should form on the outside of the cocktail shaker, and the shaker will be cold to the touch.


When using a Boston shaker, the shaker should be inverted when shaking so that the glass cup is on the top. This will prevent the glass cup from hitting and breaking on an object, and will prevent the ingredients from leaking out of the shaker. The cooling process that occurs during shaking will also cause Boston shakers to form a solid seal between the glass and metal cups (metal contracts on the glass as it cools).


, Carefully remove the top shaker cup or cap and fit the strainer in the bottom cup. This will be relatively easy for shakers that are made entirely of metal, but can be difficult when using Boston shakers. Boston shakers are ""cracked"" open. For all shakers, place the metal cup down on the table before removing the top cup or cap. For Boston shakers, firmly hold the bottom metal cup with one hand and the top glass cup with your other hand. Try to move the glass cup back and forth just a little bit to get it to break free from the metal cup while pulling upwards on the glass cup. Don't try to force the glass cup to the side too much, as this may cause it to jam further into the metal cup. For Cobbler shakers with built-in strainers, merely remove the top cap. Never bang the shaker on an object to open it, but it is fine to tap it open with your hand.

, Simply fit the strainer in the metal cup for Boston shakers and shakers that consist of two metal cups. Cobbler shakers have built-in strainers.

, Hold your fingers over the strainer while pouring to keep the strainer in the shaker cup. Depending on the cocktail recipe, the drink will be strained into an empty glass or a glass that has been filled with ice. Glasses can be chilled in a freezer or with ice before straining.

, Many shaken cocktails will have a luscious froth.

Real ale is never referred to as a lager.,
Keep in mind that real ale contains living yeast.,
Bottled real ale is always bottle conditioned.,
Look for a layer of sediment in the bottle.,
Real ale that is on-tap is dispensed from casks.,
Observe how the ale is dispensed.,
Real ale is served at cellar temperature.,
Real ale may be clear or hazy.",How to Identify Real Ale," Ales and lagers are different kinds of beer. Ale is made with what is referred to as top-fermenting yeast and is fermented at higher temperatures than lagers. Lagers are fermented with what is referred to as a bottom-fermenting yeast and are fermented at colder temperatures for relatively long periods of time. Real ales are, of course, referred to as various types of ales, but they may also be referred to as Bitters, Porters, Milds, Stouts, and Barley Wines.


Some traditional British ales are fermented in specialized fermentation systems that accommodate the layer of actively fermenting yeast that rises to the top of the fermenting beer. These fermentation systems are traditionally open to the air to some extent, unlike the standard sealed fermenters that are used to make most lagers. Open fermentation systems may be simple vessels that merely lack a ceiling.

Yorkshire Squares are somewhat more complicated open fermenters that enable the yeast to be more easily harvested. Various real ales are made with Yorkshire Squares, such as traditional English Samuel Smith ales. The Samuel Smith Tadcaster brewery uses traditional slate Yorkshire Squares, but more modern Yorkshire Squares are constructed from stainless steel. The Black Sheep brewery in England makes real ales using modern, stainless steel versions of Yorkshire Squares.
The Burton Union system, which is a network of large casks, also allows the top-fermenting yeast to be easily harvested, and it is used in conjunction with simple open fermenters. The casks that are used with Burton Union systems are different from the casks that are used to serve real ale. Marston’s Pedigree ale is fermented in an entirely traditional Burton Union system that is primarily composed of handcrafted wooden casks.


Ales and lagers also have different origins. Ales originated in part in Britain, as opposed to lagers that originated in places like Germany. Real ales are most prominent in Britain, but fine examples are also brewed in the United States, Australia, Belgium, France, Canada, and other regions. A classic form of real ale that is called cask ale is native to and most common in Britain.;
, This piece of background information is critical in understanding the following steps. Real ale must contain some living yeast when it is added to casks or bottled so that it can undergo a secondary fermentation. Some fermentable sugar must also be present in the beer. The sugar is broken down by living yeast in the beer to produce carbon dioxide. Therefore, the beer is naturally carbonated in the cask or bottle.



Sugar is traditionally added to real ale when it is added to casks or bottled. This sugar is referred to as “priming sugar”. This is typically a solution of dextrose. However, residual sugars from the grains that the beer is brewed from may exist in the beer. These sugars can be used by the yeast in the same manner as priming sugar to induce a secondary fermentation.
Real ale cannot be pasteurized, as this would kill the yeast.
Real ale, especially when in the form of cask ale, should not be filtered. Filtration, especially fine filtration, generally removes the yeast and negatively impacts qualities that are desirable for real ale. However, it may be practical and acceptable to use some form of filtration when producing bottle-conditioned real ales.
Real ale that is brewed in the United Kingdom is traditionally “fined”. Fined beer is clarified with fining agents such as isinglass, thus eliminating the need for filtration. Isinglass is natural collagen that is derived from the swim bladders of sturgeon.

, Bottle-conditioned beer has undergone a secondary fermentation in the bottle. The carbon dioxide that carbonates the beer should be naturally produced by living yeast in the beer, and the real ale should ideally not be exposed to extraneous gases such as industrially produced carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
• Bottle-conditioned beer may be labeled as “bottle conditioned” or labeled as having been “refermented” in the bottle. Similar terms such as “naturally conditioned” or ""naturally carbonated"" may be used. It may even be the case that the beer is labeled as a CAMRA-approved real ale. However, there may be no indication on the label of bottle conditioned real ale that it has been bottle conditioned. It is often necessary to contact breweries to determine if their ales are bottle conditioned.
• Very traditional breweries that use open fermentation systems may have no choice but to allow their ales to carbonate almost entirely in the bottle. This is because the beer can only carbonate fully when it is in a completely sealed vessel such as a bottle. However, bottle-conditioned ales that are fermented or stored in sealed vessels may be carbonated to a large extent with naturally-produced carbon dioxide before bottling. Some breweries recover naturally-produced carbon dioxide that is vented from fermentation tanks and use this carbon dioxide to partially carbonate their beer. The beer is then allowed to carbonate partially in the bottle, taking into account the existing level of carbonation in the beer. Recovered carbon dioxide can be categorized as an extraneous gas. Beer may also be allowed to carbonate naturally in pressurized fermentation tanks, just like it would carbonate in the bottle. If this carbonation process is halted before the beer is fully carbonated, the beer can still be bottle-conditioned and thus allowed to carbonate fully in the bottle. In this instance, the beer qualifies as a real ale. It is certainly the case, however, that many breweries that use sealed fermentation tanks allow their beer to carbonate primarily in the bottle just like breweries that use open fermentation systems.
• Industrially produced carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen may be used by breweries to purge fermentation tanks or assist with brewing processes during the production of bottle-conditioned ale. This means that the beer may be exposed somewhat to extraneous gases, even though it is naturally carbonated. It is likely that many people would agree that bottle-conditioned ale that is made in such a manner generally qualifies as real ale, and there may be no practical way for a brewery to completely avoid the use of some extraneous gases. For example, most modern bottling machines purge bottles with extraneous carbon dioxide before the beer is added to the bottle. This improves the quality of the beer and is an industry standard. However, real ale purists may choose to only drink ale that has been bottled by hand and exposed to air rather than extraneous gases.
• Breweries may finely filter their beer before bottling to create clear (or clarified) beer and remove all the yeast, then add a small amount of yeast and sugar to the beer so that it can undergo a secondary fermentation in the bottle. Ale made in such as way is bottle conditioned, does contain living yeast, and may qualify as real ale. However, it may be lacking some desirable sensory qualities that exist with unfiltered real ale.
• Centrifugation is sometimes used to clarify the beer and reduce the yeast count to the desired low value that is acceptable for bottle conditioning. This is an alternative to filtration as well as fining and is acceptable for the production of real ales. Sierra Nevada brewing uses this technology.
• Canned beer is usually not conditioned in the can. There may be canned versions of ales that are also packaged and conditioned in bottles. Hence, the canned version may not be real ale even when then bottled version is. Additionally, canned ales that use nitrogen ""widgets"" cannot be real ales, as they are artificially carbonated with nitrogen. Maui Brewing Company does produce can-conditioned, unfiltered, unpasteurized canned real ale.

, Because real ale is conditioned in the bottle with living yeast, there may be a visible layer of sediment on the bottom of the bottle.


This layer can be thick and quite obvious but it can also be thin and hardly visible. To see the layer of sediment, look through the side of the bottom of the bottle or hold the bottle up above your head and look through the bottom of the bottle. You can also look for traces of cloudy sediment when pouring the ale. Also, the sediment may stick to the inside of the bottle after the ale has been poured, so peer into the bottle after pouring the ale. Ale that has not been filtered or fined will likely have a relatively thick, visible layer of sediment.
Real ale that has been clarified with finings such as isinglass or centrifuged may have very little visible sediment. It is often desirable for real ale to be rather clear and be relatively free of sediment, so don't discount an ale if it isn't loaded with sediment.
Unfiltered bottled beer that has not been bottle conditioned may have a layer of sediment merely because visible particles were not filtered out. Such beer may have been pasteurized or entirely carbonated before bottling.

, Real ale is not dispensed from kegs, but rather from casks. Casks are also referred to as firkins, and are usually constructed of metal, but plastic and wooden casks are also used. Casks are noticeably rounder and somewhat smaller than standard full-size US kegs. A typical cask has a capacity of 10.8 US gallons, while a typical 1/2 barrel US keg has a capacity of 15.5 US gallons.


Real ale undergoes a secondary fermentation in the cask, like bottle-conditioned real ale.
Real ale that is in a cask must not be exposed to any extraneous carbon dioxide or other gases whatsoever except for naturally occurring, environmental air.
The unique design of casks means that cask ale develops particular characteristics while undergoing the conditioning process that cannot be replicated in kegs, bottles or cans. Real ale is usually noticeably less carbonated than many other types of beer, such as lagers.
It is important to be aware that kegs are used to dispense most types of beer, including ale. Ale that is dispensed from a keg is not considered real ale. This includes Guinness Stout. Standard kegged beer is carbonated to the desired level before it is added to the keg, and extraneous carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen is used with kegs to dispense the beer.
Cask ale that qualifies as real ale should be clarified with a fining agent, but not filtered. The fining agent is added directly to the cask before the cask is sent off from the brewery. Isinglass is typically used as the fining agent.
Casks are allowed to condition in the cellar of the establishment that serves the cask. This is partly due to the fact that the ale in the cask must be allowed to settle and clarify while it is resting in the cask at its final destination. Once the conditioning process has begun and after it is completed, the cask must not be overly disturbed and must be handled properly, as the beer can be easily ruined.

, Cask ale should be dispensed from casks in an approved, proper manner. Just because ale is dispensed from a cask does not mean that it is real ale. It is also important that good cellarmanship be practiced by pubs and other establishments.


Casks have two openings, unlike kegs which have only one. One opening that is located on the side of the cask is for the shive, while the second opening that is on one end of the cask is for dispensing the ale when the cask is actually tapped. When casks are about ready to be tapped, the shive is punched through, exposing a small hole in the cask. This relieves excess pressure that has built up in the cask. After allowing excess beer to blow off from the cask, a soft spile (a small, porous wooden peg) is placed in the shive hole to allow excess gases to be vented. When enough gas has vented, a hard, airtight spile is placed in the shive. The cask is then tapped and beer is dispensed. The hard spile is removed and replaced with the soft spile when needed to allow air to enter the cask and displace the beer that has been removed from the cask.
Real ale is typically dispensed from a cask with a beer engine or by means of a tap that is inserted directly into the hole that is on one end of the cask. In Scotland, tall founts are sometimes used. These more resemble taps that are designed for kegs, but the beer is dispensed through the tap by pressurizing the cask with air, rather than carbon dioxide or nitrogen.
When a beer engine is used, the cask may be stored in an area away from the bar (such as in the cellar) while it is being dispensed. Beer engines, which are also referred to as handpumps, are manually-operated hydraulic beer taps that have large handles. The ale is dispensed from the beer engine from a narrow metal pipe that, when long and curved, is called a “swan neck”. Sparklers may also be used. These devices fit on the end of the outlet of the beer engine tap and agitate the ale by forcing it through small holes. This gives the ale a creamy head.
When a bartender dispenses real ale from a genuine beer engine, he or she will pull down forcefully on the large handle multiple times to fill a standard pint glass. Beer taps that dispense from regular kegs may be made to look like beer engines, but they are not forcefully pumped. However, electric beer engines can also be used that may seem to be standard keg taps with large handles, as they need not be pumped by hand. Electric beer engines are perfectly acceptable, but many people prefer pints that are actually ""pulled"" using manual beer engines.
Because cask ale is inordinately exposed to the air once the cask has been tapped, it quickly oxidizes and will go bad very quickly, usually within a few days. Therefore, establishments that have a high turnover are able to provide fresher real ale. Also, the beer that has been sitting in a beer engine and its associated beer lines overnight must be discarded before serving the first pint of the day.
Cask “breathers” cannot be used, as they expose the ale in the cask to extraneous carbon dioxide or nitrogen. It is easy to identify cask breathers as they are plastic devices that are attached to the shive hole in the cask and to gas tubes. It is not easy however to distinguish between cask ales that have and have not used a Cask ""breather"" based on the taste or look of the beer after it has been served. This is because at atmospheric pressure the CO2 does not change the beer.
Real ale that is dispensed from a cask may have noticeably less foam than other types of beer. This is largely due to the lower carbonation level, but also due to the fact that cask ale is not dispensed with the assistance of pressurized gas.

, Living real ale is only acceptable when served at the right temperature. This is especially the case for cask ale. Too cold, and the yeast will deactivate and the beer will be more like a cold-conditioned beer without living yeast. Ale is ale because the yeast thrive at a higher temperature than lager yeast. A consumer standards group in Britain, known as Cask Marque, takes it upon itself to monitor the conditions of the cellar and the quality of the cask beer on sale in every pub it is invited to in order to determine whether the pub is fit to serve cask ale in its optimum state. Of the many criteria that Cask Marque assess, beer temperature is one of them. Real ale should be served at cellar temperature, within the range of 54 to 57 °F (12 to 14 °C). The living yeast and naturally-produced carbon dioxide that are a part of real ale can be adversely affected by improper temperatures. The flavour and other sensory qualities of real ale will suffer if the beer is served at incorrect temperatures.

, When dispensed from a cask, traditional British real ale should be entirely clear, provided that it is not dark beer. This is because isinglass finings are traditionally used to clarify the beer. However, cask ale can be hazy, especially if it was not handled according to exacting standards. And while hazy or cloudy beer may not be entirely approved of in the UK, bottled examples of real ale may be quite hazy or cloudy, especially if they were not clarified in any way. Also, the sediment that forms in bottled real ale may cause the beer to become cloudy as the beer is poured into a glass. Some types of real ale use certain stains of yeast that cause the sediment in the bottle to stick forcefully to the bottom of the bottle, thus minimizing the risk of hazy (or cloudy) beer.

Budweiser has Anheuser Busch of St. Louis, Missouri listed on the label, and Pabst Blue Ribbon lists Pabst Brewing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

, Many large and small breweries are owned by companies that are not specifically listed on beer labels. Some domestic breweries that have been in operation since the 1800’s that were entirely owned and operated by Americans are now owned and operated by foreign companies. To research the ownership of a brewery or related company, one can visit the official brewery website, perform an online search, and contact the brewery or related company. It may be useful to contact the corporate office of the brewery if one exists. In some instances, such as with Miller brewing, it may be difficult to accurately determine who the owner or controlling entity actually is. In this case, it is useful to examine the history of the ownership of the brewery and all related breweries before coming to a sure conclusion about the ownership of a brewery.


Miller was purchased by South African Breweries PLC in 2002, forming SAB Miller.
Coors and Molson brewing of Canada merged in 2005, forming MolsonCoors.
In 2007, SAB Miller and MolsonCoors formed a “joint venture”, forming Miller Coors. Pete Coors is the chairman of the joint venture, and executives from SAB Miller and Molson Coors are also in important management positions.
Anheuser Busch was purchased by InBev in 2008, forming Anheuser Busch InBev. InBev is based in Belgium. Anheuser Busch InBev has established North American headquarters in the original St. Louis, Missouri Anheuser Busch headquarters.
The Gambrinus company (not the brewery) of San Antonio, Texas owns Shiner Brewing, Pete’s Wicked Ale, Bridgeport, and Trumer Pils in the US.
Redhook brewing and Widmer brewing have merged to create a public company that is called the Craft Brewers Alliance. Redhook and Widmer, and therefore the Craft Brewers Alliance, are owned to a large extent by Anheuser Busch InBev.
D. G. Yuengling and Son, the oldest operating brewery in the US, is still owned by a Yuengling family member. It is located in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.
August Schell Brewing Company, is the second oldest operating brewery in the US and has been in business in New Ulm, Minn. since 1860. It is operated by a descendant of the founder August Schell and produces a large line of beers. They recently began purchased Grain Belt.
Sierra Nevada Brewing is owned by the American Ken Grossman. He is a co-founder of the brewery.
Anchor Brewing, which has been in operation since 1896, is owned by the American Fritz Maytag, of the Maytag family that once owned the Maytag appliance company.
New Belgium Brewing Company is an American employee-owned company.

, The beer label may or may not state the actual brewery that produces the beer. The company that owns a beer brand may not actually brew the beer. One may need to perform an online search or contact the company that owns the brand in order to determine the name of the brewery that actually brews the beer. In many instances, beer that is owned by foreign companies is brewed in America by American breweries.


Pabst Brewing Company is wholly American, but it is a “virtual brewery” that does not physically brew beer. Pabst Blue Ribbon and many other beer brands that are owned by Pabst are brewed by Miller Brewing in Milwaukee. Pabst Brewing is technically the largest remaining American-owned brewing company.
Mackeson’s XXX stout is owned by Whitbread of England, but in the US is brewed by the Boston Beer Company in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Boston Beer Company brews Samuel Adams beer. In this instance, a foreign-owned beer is brewed domestically by a well known American beer company. However, about a third of the beers under the Samuel Adams brand are produced under contract by other domestic breweries.
Trumer Pils is brewed in Austria as well as in the US, but all Trumer that is available in the US is brewed in the US. The US brewery is US-owned.
D. G. Yuengling and Son has been brewing Yuengling beer in the US since 1829 and still brew all of their own beer.
Most American microbreweries and larger craft breweries are brewed by American breweries that are solely American-owned. These breweries include Sierra Nevada Brewing, Anchor Brewing, and New Belgium Brewing Company.
Some beers are made to look like craft beers that are brewed by individual craft breweries, but are in fact brewed and owned by larger foreign-owned breweries.

, There may be no foolproof way determine with certainty the origin of all of the ingredients that are used to make a particular beer, especially since the regions of the US that are ideal for growing hops and barley are near to or border Canada. However, the US is by far the primary grower of North American hops. US-grown barley may also be malted in Canada and then shipped to the US for use in brewing. It may be considered that the US and Canada have a mutual relationship. Taking this into account, the use of American ingredients in general can be evaluated.


American beers are usually made from domestically-grown as well as Canadian-grown barley and US-grown hops. Rice and corn are often used by the largest domestic breweries to produce light-colored pilsners such as Coors, Miller and Budweiser. The use of such adjunct ingredients is often criticized, but corn and rice have been used for many years to make American beer. They are typically grown in America, and corn has been used to make beer since colonial times.
Domestic breweries that produce more flavorful ales and lagers tend to use only barley malt, with the exception of wheat beers that are made with barley malt as well as wheat malt. Many such breweries, like the largest domestic breweries, primarily use domestic and Canadian (North American) barley and wheat because it is easier to procure and the farms may even be owned by the breweries (or by the controlling companies). Specialty European and British barley malts, wheat malts, and similar ingredients may be used in small quantities to give American beers desirable characteristics. Domestic beers also tend to be made with domestically-grown hops such as the Cascade variety that impart unique flavor and aroma characteristics to beer.
Some domestic breweries brew beers that are made entirely (or primarily) from imported grains in order to produce certain styles of beer that cannot be adequately made from domestic grains. Domestic beers may use imported hops to imbue beer with flavor and aroma characteristics that are not provided by domestic hops. As an example, Trumer Pils is made in the US with imported barley and hops, as it is brewed in the same manner as the Austrian Trumer Pils.

, American beer can be produced in America by an American company and made with ingredients that are grown in North America. Some of the ingredients may be from Canada, but this is apparently the normal way of things for the American brewing industry. American beer may also be primarily made from imported ingredients. There may be some reason to give preference to beer that is primarily made from domestic ingredients, especially due to the fact that American beer styles were created in part due to the available domestic ingredients. Beer that is brewed in the US by breweries that are owned by foreign companies may be quite American in certain important ways. They may have been established in the US, and breweries such as Miller, Coors, and Anheuser Busch have existed as all-American breweries for over one hundred years. And as long as the beer is brewed in the US, the breweries support American workers and continue to brew important domestic beers. Even beer brands that are brewed in the US but are owned by foreign companies may deserve some merit, as the beer is produced in America and brewed by Americans for Americans.

Re-use the same jars over and over, using the yeast at the bottom of the jars, but see the Warnings below.,
Finished.

",How to Ferment Cider Using Wild Yeasts," If frozen, let it thaw.;
, If it's concentrated, use about 4 ounces of concentrate per quart (one 12-ounce can for 3 quarts), and fill the rest of the jar with water. Leave about an inch at the top for the bubbles, otherwise you could have a mess on your cupboard.

,, There's no need to stir after that.

, At first it's just bubbly apple soda, slowly getting more alcoholic and less sweet. If not consumed within two to five days, depending on how warm it is, it will turn to vinegar.

,, For example, if you find you like the taste of the cider on the second day, and can drink 3 quarts a day, you'll always have 6 quart jars in use, two alternating batches, and will be buying 1 can of apple juice per day.

Be sure to give other types a beer a chance, from high-end artisanal microbrews to more common brands like Coors and Budweiser. As with anything else, it may be that there’s another sort of beer out there that you’d like better.Don’t be afraid to try out beers that you’ve never had before.
Start ordering one or two new beers anytime you visit a bar or go out to eat.;
, If you find one beer to be overpowering, transition to a lighter style. These tend to be less fermented, which means they won’t be quite as bitter. On the flipside, people who are dissatisfied with weak, watery beers can try brews with more intense flavors, like porters and stouts.Stout beers contain more pungent hops and are allowed to ferment longer, giving them more of a kick.
Light beers are considerably more delicate. They make a great introduction for people who are just beginning to develop a taste for beer.

, Beers are classified by their brewing styles, the amount of time they're allowed to ferment and the ingredients used to give them their distinctive flavors.The more styles of beer you try, the more likely you are to find one that's pleasing to you.


Try lagers, which are cool and refreshing ales, which go down smoothly and have a mild nutty or spicy aftertaste.
Go for a sweet malt beer that boasts notes of rich caramel and toffee.
When it's hot out, try Saisons, highly carbonated pale ales brewed with fruit, which makes them light and crisp.
Lambics ferment with wild yeast, and are often sour and cidery.
Dark beers like porters and stouts are full-bodied and have a strong, bitter flavor not unlike coffee.

, It isn’t just the big, well-known companies making beer. There are a myriad of microbreweries churning out small batches of beer using their own proprietary recipes. One of these beers may be better suited for your taste buds.Look for specialty craft beers on tap at trendy bars, or take a tour of the alcoholic beverage section at your local supermarket.
If you live in a city that’s home to a craft beer company, visit the brewery and try samples of some of their most celebrated concoctions., In addition to what’s known as “domestic” beers, there are countless foreign varieties readily available from places all over the globe. You can find beers from Europe, Asia, South America and even Australia with little difficulty. These beers often use different ingredients or brewing techniques which can result in wildly unique flavors.Some examples of popular beers worldwide include Guinness (Ireland), Corona (Mexico), Heineken (Netherlands), Sapporo (Japan), Ayinger (Germany) and Stella Artois (Belgium).
Most of the better-known foreign beers are imported around the world and kept stocked in bars, restaurants and supermarkets.

, There’s a lot to take in with a single sip of beer. Rather than immediately coming to a decision about whether or not you like a particular style, try to pick up on the small nuances the beer possesses. Is the bitterness properly offset by sweetness or acidity? Are there subtle nutty or floral notes? Relating the overall taste of the beer to individual flavors that you do like can help you get more out of it.Take a couple whiffs of the beer and swish it around in your mouth for a few seconds before swallowing.As you taste the beer, try to get past the initial bitterness and see what sorts of flavor profiles come to mind.

, Not all beers are meant to be savored at the same temperature. If the beer you’re drinking is too warm or too cold, it can cause the flavor to become overly sharp, bland or generally unpleasant. Heed the suggestions of the brewmaster provided on the label or ask your bartender for advice on how best to enjoy a certain type of beer.Lighter beers like lagers, blondes and pilsners should served at around 33-45 degrees F, while stouts, porters and strong, dark beers are best when sipped at room temperature.Avoid drinking beer from a frosted mug. It can cause the beer to freeze where it comes into contact with the glass, spoiling the flavor.Chill beer, don’t ice it. A watered down brew will not have the same potency or body.

, The material a beer is stored in can influence its flavor just as much as its brewing methods. Sometimes the distinctions are minute—you might, for instance, prefer the same beer in a bottle as opposed to a can. Similarly, draft beers served in a glass may have a fresher taste than bottled beers. Test each serving style to see which you like best.A mug, stein or can is fine for the majority of beers. Tall pilsner glasses should be used for especially frothy beers, as they help contain the foam and let the diverse flavors bubble to the surface from underneath.Brown glass filters out light that can cause beer to sour more quickly, so choose it over clear and green bottles whenever you can.Whenever you start on a beer, finish the whole thing or dispose of what you don’t drink. Beer spoils quickly after it’s opened and is usually no good leftover.

, People’s tastes change as they get older. It may be that your palette just isn’t equipped to enjoy beer at this point in your life, but that doesn’t mean it never will. Continue trying different beers here and there, and, above all, keep an open mind. Chances are, you’ll eventually encounter one that does it for you.The next time someone offers you a beer, don’t turn up your nose. If you renounce beer entirely, you’ll never get the chance to discover for yourself what so many people love about it.

, Even if you’re not a fan of drinking beer by itself, what you’re eating with it can make all the difference. You may find that a saison is surprisingly crisp and refreshing when sipped alongside a platter of broiled seafood, or that a dark, bitter stout makes the perfect companion for a juicy cheeseburger. When mingled with the flavors of a meal, a beer’s body can transform and take on new complexity.Like wine, different beers are typically recommended for pairing with different foods.With time, you’ll develop a sense of which flavor combinations you find appetizing together.

, Atmosphere can also play a big part in how much enjoyment you get from beer. You probably won’t get the same satisfaction from splitting a pitcher in a crowded, deafening dive bar as you would sharing with a tall one with your best friends from the comfort of your own home. If you’re not big on your surroundings, that distaste may rub off on you when it comes time to drain a pint.Stay away from places with strong smells or other unwanted distractions that might detract from your experience.
Set up a tasting at your home with a friend who’s a connoisseur. They’ll be able to make recommendations and give you cues on how to savor your beer., You’re never going to appreciate beer if you convince yourself that you don’t like it. Make an effort to stop thinking of all beers in black and white terms. Once you soften your stance, you’ll be able to start judging each unique form of the beverage on its own merits.


If you don’t like one style, move on to the next until something stands out to you.
Try not to overthink it. It’s just a drink.

If kegging the beer in a 5 gallon cornelius soda keg, prepare 1/3 to 1/2 cups of bottling sugar by mixing it with about 3 cups of water.",How to Homebrew Gluten Free Sorghum Beer," For each 5 gallon (18.9 L) batch, you will need about 6.5 to 7 pounds of sorghum syrup, about 1 to 2 ounces of hops, and 1 packet of gluten-free dried beer (ale) yeast. Additional gluten-free sources of fermentable sugars are often used, such as honey, rice syrup solids, fruit juice, and Belgian candy sugar. It is generally best to only add up to about 1 pound of additional fermentable sugars. This is because a very high sugar content requires special strains of yeast that can produce higher concentrations of alcohol, and more sugar means that the fermentation process will take longer.


Hops are available as small compressed pellets or as whole, dried ""flowers"". Pellet hops are generally easier to use because whole hops will need to be strained out using a large sanitized strainer. Different hops will have different naturally-occurring quantities of bittering compounds called alpha acids. One ounce of hops with an alpha acid content of 4 percent will imbue beer with about the amount of bitterness that is found with regular Budweiser® when boiled for 60 minutes. Use more hops or hops with a higher alpha acid content to brew sorghum beer that is more bitter. Boiling for longer periods of time also results in greater levels of bitterness. Add additional hops at the very end of the boil, or just after the boil has ended, to imbue beer with more hop flavor and aroma without adding much or any bitterness.;
, It is especially important to sanitize equipment such as the carboy (the fermenting vessel) or a fermenting bucket that will come into contact with the beer after it has been boiled and cooled (as described in subsequent steps). Also sanitize an airlock and the proper rubber stopper that the airlock will be attached to when it is placed in the mouth of the carboy to create an air-tight seal. A hose or a funnel will be used to transfer the boiled, cooled sorghum mixture to the sanitized carboy. Such items must also be sanitized. Equipment such as the boil kettle that is heated for 20 minutes or longer does not need to be sanitized. Use iodophor sanitizer or another type of sanitizer, such as an acid-based sanitizer. Sanitizers are available at home brew stores.

Soak equipment for 2 minutes in diluted iodophor sanitizer solution, then allow to air-dry soon before use. Add about one or two cap-fulls of concentrated iodophor to five gallons of water.






Completely fill a 6 or 6.5 gallon (22.7 or 24.6 L) carboy with diluted sanitizer solution. It may be necessary to attach a sanitizedgarden hose to the kitchen faucet to safely fill the carboy in a sanitary manner.






Pour out the sanitizer, keeping it for re-use if desired. Invert the carboy using a carboy stand so that residual sanitizer can drain out of it.







, If you are using a small boil kettle that has a capacity of less than 8.5 gallons (32.2 L), you will most likely need to add additional sterilized or sanitary bottled water to bring the final volume in the carboy fermenter to about 5.5 gallons (20.8 L). Pre-boil and cool the necessary amount of water, or use spring water. Do not use distilled water, as the yeast that will ferment the sorghum mixture need the minerals that are in non-distilled water.

, If using 7 or more gallons of water, there should not be a need to add much or any topping-off water. The amount of water that you heat in the boil kettle will depend on how big your boil kettle is, how you plan to heat the kettle, how you plan to cool the mixture, as well as how big your carboy is. The smallest kettles can be heated on a kitchen stove, while larger kettles should be heated outdoors using propane burners. Also, smaller boil kettles can be cooled in an ice bath in the sink, while larger volumes that cannot be safely picked up while hot must be cooled with a wort chiller (see below). It is best to use a boil kettle that as a capacity of at least 5 gallons (18.9 L), and the boil kettle should have at least 20 percent overcapacity to prevent boil-overs. Account for the volume that the sorghum syrup will take up in the kettle.


Allow for 20 percent evaporation during the boil. The actual amount of evaporation will vary. Use more water if the evaporation rate is high, and less water if it is low.
A more dilute solution will more readily take on hop bitterness as the hops are boiled, so will be more cost-effective in terms of hops. However, more energy will be required to boil a dilute mixture. Larger containers are also more difficult to lift.

Alternative method. Add 2 gallons (7.6 L) of filtered spring water to a 3 gallon (11.4 L) stainless steel stock pot. Bring to 155 °F (68 °C) and add the sorghum, the flavoring hops, and 1/3 of the aromatic hops. Bring to a boil and hold there for 10 minutes. Add the rest of the aromatic hops and drop the heat to a simmer for 5 minutes. You now have a fully ready mash. Pour 2 gallons (7.6 L) and one pint of filtered spring water, plus one bag of commercial ice, into a 5 gallon (18.9 L) fermenter (That's the white bucket you see in the later picture. It's just an alternative method of the carboy.) Pour the mash into the water/ice mix in the fermenter. The temperature should now be near 80°. That's perfect to pitch the yeast. You now have a wort. Cover, put the airlock in place, and put the fermenter in a cool, dark place for 10 - 14 days.



,


Also add additional fermentable sugars if desired.

,


The mixture may boil over at this point. Keep a close eye on it and turn off the heat (or remove from the heat source) if necessary to prevent a boil-over. Also stir to reduce the foam that will form.

, The hops can trigger a boil-over, so be ready to stir and/or turn off the heat.

, Maintain a full boil during the entire 60 minutes. During this time, the hops imbue the boiling mixture with the desired bitterness that is characteristic of beer. Use fewer hops or hops with a lower alpha acid content for less-bitter beer.

, Remove from the heat source or turn off the heat. Use a sanitized thermometer to keep track of the temperature. The goal is to bring the boiled mixture down to between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit so that the ale yeast can ferment it. If the temperature is too high, the yeast will be killed. If the temperature is too low, the yeast will not be able to ferment the mixture properly.
When using a small boil kettle that can be picked up easily, cool the kettle in an ice bath in a sink or large container. Simply mix ice with cold water, and place the pot in the ice bath, being careful to not splash hot liquid on yourself.






When boiling larger amounts that cannot be picked up, use a wort chiller. If the wort chiller is the type that is submersed in the boil kettle, it should be placed in the boil kettle for 20 minutes while the mixture is still boiling in order to sterilize it.







, This can be accomplished by simply pouring the cooled, boiled mixture through a large funnel into the carboy, or by using a siphon or, if the kettle has a spigot, a sanitized tight-fitting hose. Try to splash the cooled mixture as you transfer it, as this will cause it to pick up some air. The yeast that will be added requires oxygen to properly ferment the mixture. It is best to leave about 10 to 20 percent head space for the yeast foam (krausen) that will form when the mixture is actively fermenting. However, the krausen may not take up nearly as much volume or be as noticeable as the krausen that occurs with beer that is made from barley malt.


Top off with cooled, boiled water or bottled water (if necessary) to bring the final volume to between 5 and 6 gallons.
Add pasteurized fruit juice or whole, pasteurized canned fruit if desired. Fruit can also be added after the mixture has finished fermenting (see about fermentation below). When added after the beer has finished fermenting, more fruit flavor is retained. However, the fruit will cause a new fermentation, and must be left to ferment in the carboy for 1 to 3 weeks. Also keep in mind that since fruit juice is a concentrated source of fermentable sugars, adding too much fruit juice may cause the sugar content to be too high. The yeast may not be able to completely ferment the sugars into alcohol.

, Simply sprinkle the dried ale yeast into the cooled mixture.

, This ensures that air and bacteria will not enter the carboy and spoil the fermenting sorghum mixture. Be sure to fill the airlock with a liquid such as sanitary water, diluted sanitizer, or vodka. The liquid causes the airlock to become sealed from the bacteria-ridden outside air, but will allow the carbon dioxide that the fermenting yeast produces to escape. Never ferment beer in a vessel that cannot allow CO2 to escape, as it will explode.

, Allow the beer to ferment in a warm or room-temperature (not hot or cold), dark place until the airlock has completely stopped bubbling. The fermentation time will be about 1 week, depending on the sugar concentration and temperature. The freshly fermented beer can be given extra time, up to 3 weeks, to more completely ferment and age.

,


To prepare for bottling or kegging, clean and sanitize all of the equipment that will come into contact with the beer, and prepare a boiled solution of dextrose bottling sugar (also referred to as priming sugar). The sugar will give the yeast that is living in the beer a small amount of fermentable sugar that will be converted by the yeast into carbon dioxide, plus a very small amount of alcohol. The carbon dioxide will cause the beer that is sealed in bottles or kegs to become carbonated.
If bottling, prepare 1/2 to 3/4 cups of bottling sugar by mixing it with about 3 cups of water. Boil this solution for 20 minutes to sterilize it. Allow it to cool, then carefully pour or siphon the beer into a bottling bucket, trying not to splash it. Mix in the sugar solution with a large spoon. Attach a 4 or 5 foot (1.2 or 1.5 m) length of 3/8"" I.D. vinyl tubing to the bucket's spigot, and attach a bottling wand to the other end of the tubing.

These buckets are made with lids to accommodate an airlock and a spigot that fits tubing for bottling. They are suitable for the whole fermenting process.


Using the bottling wand, fill sanitized, air-dried beer bottles so that about 3/4 of an inch of air space is left in the neck of each bottle. The bottling wand will only release beer into the bottles when it is touched to the bottom or side of the bottles.
Cap each bottle using a handheld or benchtop capper, and store the freshly filled and capped bottles in a dark, warm area for 2 to 3 weeks. During this time, they will carbonate naturally.

, Boil this solution for 20 minutes to sterilize it. Allow it to cool, then carefully pour or siphon the beer into the keg. Mix in the sugar solution. Seal the keg and pressurize to 10 PSI using compressed CO2 and a gas regulator. Allow the beer to carbonate in a warm area for 2 to 3 weeks. Kegs may also be carbonated more rapidly using a compressed carbon dioxide gas bottle. Serve using a kegerator or a hand pump.

Select beer that has been brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot (the German beer purity law).,
Look for ingredients listed on labels.,
Be wary of light beer and verify that it has been brewed with natural ingredients.,
Look for unfiltered, hazy beer.,
Avoid beer packaged in clear bottles.,
Choose beer that contains living yeast.,
Find beer that has been naturally carbonated.,
Determine the risk for chemical contamination.,
Choose beer that is brewed in archaic breweries or with old equipment.,
Select organic beer.",How to Choose Natural Beer," Most German beer is brewed according to this purity law. The Reinheitsgebot ensures that beer is only made from barley, hops, water, and yeast. No additives or other ingredients are used when a beer is brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot, although certain artificial brewing aids such as PVPP (poly vinyl poly pyrrolidone) can be used as long as they are filtered from the finished beer. PVPP is relatively safe, but there is a risk that detrimental chemicals may originate from such unnatural compounds, such as bisphenol-A (BPA) that has been found to leach from polycarbonate food and beverage containers. Many ingredients that are not allowed by the Reinheitsgebot can be completely natural. Such ingredients include rice, corn, herbs, spices, and mineral salts.;
, Ingredients may be listed on bottled and canned beer, although Rogue brewing may be the only brewery that provides detailed ingredient information. Listed ingredients provide strong indication that the brewer strives to or indeed does only use natural ingredients. But there is no absolute guarantee that only the listed ingredients are used because beer is not regulated like food by the US government. Therefore, there is a chance that ingredients may be excluded. Also check to see if the label states that only natural ingredients were used to make the beer.

, Light beer may be produced using industrial enzymes, although many breweries such as Anheuser Busch use natural enzymes. The industrial enzymes more completely break down (hydrolyze) the carbohydrates that are derived from the grain that is used to make beer. The fully hydrolyzed carbohydrates can be completely fermented by the yeast, leaving very little residual carbohydrates in the finished beer. The completely natural enzymes that are usually used in the brewing process are provided by barley malt and wheat malt. Industrial enzymes may be derived from bacteria or other sources and are processed into a usable form. Such enzymes are not synthetic, but it is unlikely that most people can consider beer to be made with these enzymes to be completely natural.

, Various additives, brewing aids, and modern technologies can be used to make beer look clear and brilliant. Perfect filtering can, however, be conducted purely with natural, inert diatomaceous earth (the primary filter medium) if sophisticated equipment is properly utilized. Diatomaceous earth is the fossilized skeletons of ancient algae. Compounds that are used to clarify beer and aid filtration can be used early as well as late in the brewing process. PVPP and carrageenan may be added to to boiling wort, while PVPP and other compounds can be added later in the beer making process. PVPP is a non-toxic synthetic plastic, while carrageenan is extracted from seaweed. Some people who may want to avoid carrageenan because of erroneous claims that it was associated with certain health conditions, need not avoid it as it has been recently reaffirmed very safe for human consumption, even infant milk. Also, carrageenan as a beer fining agent does not go into the final product, since its function is to flocculate any impurities and clarify the beer, and thereby gets completely removed or remain with the sludge before proceeding to fermentation. The PVPP should be completely removed by later filtration, but some types of plastic, especially when heated, can contribute carcinogenic compounds. Certain types of filters may be made of plastic material and filter aids can be impregnated or dosed with PVPP, but this should be much less of a concern as beer is filtered cold. Silica gels are often dosed into cold, fermented beer to clarify it and aid filtration. Silica gels are synthetic but non-toxic and relatively safe. A common form of silica gel is used to absorb moisture in packaged food, and is found in little packets that clearly state that they are not edible.


Beer can also be clarified using natural ingredients. Traditional British ales, as well as many other beers, are often clarified (fined) with isinglass. This is merely collagen (protein). This collagen used for brewing is actually the ground-up swim bladders of sturgeon, and if anything is nutritious, but not vegetarian. Gelatin can also be used to clarify beer.

, A relatively large amount of beer is made with light-stable hop extracts. Such extracts may be used with beer that is packaged in clear bottles because clear bottles provide no protection from harmful light that causes beer to become skunky (see How to Prevent Skunky Beer). These hop extracts are used in the place of actual hops (whole flower or pellet hops), and are made by reacting hop alpha acids (and sometimes beta acids) with certain chemicals. Such hop-derived manufactured compounds include tetrahydro-iso-alpha-acids and hexahydro-iso-alpha-acids. Beer that can become skunky when exposed to light is typically packaged in protective brown bottles, but is also found in less protective green bottles.

, Beer that contains living yeast in the bottle may be relatively natural because harmful additives or preservatives that may be present would kill the yeast. Live yeast produces carbon dioxide, and therefore bottle-conditioned beer that is carbonated naturally in the bottle must contain living yeast. Unfiltered beer will contain yeast, but may not contain living yeast. Kegged beer may be unfiltered and contain living yeast, but is usually carbonated before it is added to the keg.

, There may be unwanted contaminants in industrially-produced carbon dioxide. Yeast produces carbon dioxide that naturally carbonates beer. Naturally-carbonated beer may be bottle-conditioned with living yeast, carbonated by yeast before bottling in pressurized fermentation tanks, or carbonated using recovered carbon dioxide that is stored in pressurized tanks. Large breweries are able to recover and purify naturally-produced carbon dioxide from fermenting beer using sophisticated equipment. This carbon dioxide can then be used to carbonate beer. Beer that has been naturally carbonated before bottling need not contain living yeast, and can be clear and brilliant.

, Many cleansers, sanitizers, and other chemicals are used during the beer production process. Traces of such chemicals can be found in finished beer, and different breweries use different types of chemicals. Large breweries analyze their beer for contaminants using sensors and sophisticated laboratory techniques to ensure that the product has not been adulterated. Cleansers are typically rinsed from the inside of brewing vessels and fermentation tanks, but sanitizers are typically not rinsed, as the rinse water can introduce unwanted microorganisms. Remnants of sanitizing chemicals do make it into finished beer, but the active chemical compounds that kill microbes are oxidized or otherwise neutralized and converted into harmless compounds. Nevertheless, the sanitizer does introduce unnatural compounds to the beer. Some breweries such as Anheuser Busch use pure steam to sanitize vessels and tanks, thus minimizing or eliminating chemical contamination.

, Historic breweries (such as those found in Europe) that use vintage equipment may brew beer using natural ingredients, processing aids, and components. The brewery equipment may lack plastic components and chemicals may be used sparingly. Old brewing equipment that is made of copper, iron, and wood may be incompatible with many modern chemicals, thus eliminating the use of certain potential contaminants. The beer made in such archaic breweries may not be filtered or overly processed. However, such equipment may be a source of organic, natural contaminants such as potentially toxic copper salts.

, Organic beer will be made almost entirely from ingredients that are free of pesticides and other chemicals. However, not all organic beer is made solely from organic ingredients. In the US, organic beer may be made using 95 percent organic ingredients. Certain non-organic ingredients may be used for the remaining 5 percent of the total ingredients. Conventionally-grown hops and certain other non-organic ingredients are allowed. Check with breweries to determine if their beer is made using only organic ingredients, and determine if they use processing aids, additives, or chemicals that may not be desirable.

Most festivals have pre-arranged agreements with (on-site) food vendors that allow for at least one or two low cost food items to be available for purchase from each vendor. Typical beer festival fare of turkey legs, pizza, nachos and different sandwiches will give your stomach a much needed buffer between beer and alcohol absorption. Take time to enjoy your food; this will also help to cleanse your palate between flights of beer.;
, If you have four two ounce servings of beer, try to drink that same amount of water before moving on to another flight of beer. Most festivals provide either bottled water or some other way of obtaining water specifically for this purpose. You will undoubtedly use the restrooms more frequently, but in the end this will keep you from becoming dehydrated and could help reduce the chance of suffering a hangover later on.

, Almost all beer festivals provide lists of both breweries and the beers that they plan to bring along to vend at the festival. Get hold of that list and start planning what flights you might want to try. Some festivals also provide a site layout–this makes finding your favorites that much easier. Try some of the following (as long as the requisite brewers are in attendance):


A Belgian flight
A pale ale flight
A hop flight
A German flight
A wheat flight

, Don't start a tasting session with a beer with an IBU (international bitterness units) of 90 and expect to be able to taste anything but hops from then on. Start lower and work your way up. Your taste buds will thank you.

, Too often attendees at festivals look at those festivals as a four hour kegger. To enjoy the festival and create a lasting impression in your mind, and to retain a happy memory of the beers you drank (that you should be able to find after the festival), take your time to actually taste the beer. Tasting hints to consider:


Aroma - Since half of taste is actually our olfactory perception, take time to smell the beer. Make a mental note of what you can smell.
Appearance - Although most festivals pour in two ounce portions, you should be able get a good idea of the look of the beer. The head retention, color, cloudiness, etc.
Taste - When tasting, it is recommended that you drink only half of the sample initially. Make a note of the different properties of the beer (bitter/sweet/tart, etc.).
Mouth feel - What did the beer feel like? Thick, chewy, silky, fizzy? The texture will have an effect upon your perception and enjoyment of the beer.
Second look (overall) - Finish the beer sample. Did you note any changes from the first taste to now? Did the beer breathe differently or did you experience a flavor that was not present during the first swallow? Many beers (especially ales) are very complex and can't be fully appreciated with a single taste.

, Most festivals have too many beers to possibly learn in the short period of the festival. If you find a beer that you really like, write it down and stick the information in your pocket. Plan to buy it later to enjoy it in the comfort of your home.

, Pay a neighbor's kid, go as a group with one person designated to drive, take a taxi or a bus.

, Some wineries will close their doors to late appointees. If you are going to be late, call ahead and warn them.

, Smaller wineries seldom charge a tasting fee. Medium-size wineries tend to have a tasting fee that can be waived. Larger wineries are less likely to waive their tasting fee. Tasting fees are typically around five to seven dollars but can be as much as twenty or more.

, Many wineries will allow you to take the wine outside, so that you can walk around the vineyards, enjoy the weather and have the best tasting experience for yourself.

, If you don't like the wine or if you just wanted a sip rather than the typical 3 oz. taste, dump the rest of the wine into the spit bucket. The employees will not be offended. Alternatively, if you are the designated driver, you may spit the wine into the spit bucket rather than swallowing.

Determine how the section is organized.",How to Find a Good Bottle of Wine at a Grocery Store1," If you know you’ll be picking up some wine on your next run to a specific store, do some research ahead of time. Go online and see if they have a page devoted to their wine section. Get a sense of the range and quality of what they have to offer. Reduce the risk of making an impulse buy just so you can move on to the rest of your shopping. The information available may vary from store to store, but look for:Product descriptions

Where to locate particular wines;
, Don’t let the physical space that’s been set aside for wine fool you. Regardless of how big or small the wine section seems at first glance, take a step back and scan the whole thing when you first enter the aisle. Favor stores that stock a wide variety of brands, rather than a whole lot of the same handful.A lack of variety doesn’t necessarily mean that you won’t find a wine that you like. But it does mean that you have fewer options on your next trip if the wine you bring home this time isn’t to your taste.

, Be aware that each store may arrange their shelves according to its own method. Before you zero in on a specific a bottle that you spot right away, check the categories that this particular store uses to group certain wines together so you don’t overlook other options. They may have done this according to:The type of wine, like Chardonnay or Pinot Noir.
The region in which it was made, like California or Australia.
Both the type and region, like California Chardonnay or Australian Pinot Noir
The wine’s character, like Fresh, Rich, Smooth, or Sweet."

Go with your gut.,
Favor 750 ml bottles.,
Check the wine’s ABV.,
Read the tasting notes.,
Favor younger wines.",How to Find a Good Bottle of Wine at a Grocery Store2," You may be an adventurous type who’s willing to try something totally new with whatever’s available. You could also be looking to expand your horizons but feel more cautious in your approach. Or you may want to make your $10 or $20 count with a purchase that you won’t regret. Whatever your temperament is, start narrowing down your search by either:Sticking with a varietal (the type of grape a wine is made with) that you know and love, like Riesling or Merlot.
Exploring other varietals from a region that you’re familiar with, like Barossa Valley in Australia or Abruzzo in Italy.

, Narrow your search that much more by ignoring jugs, large bottles, and boxed wines. When looking for something new, always stick with the 750 ml bottles. If you find something you like in this size and see that it’s also available in a larger bottle, go with that next time around. But for now, stick to a size that won’t feel quite as wasteful if you decide after one sip that the rest is undrinkable.This isn’t to say that you can’t find a good wine in other packaging, so if you’re carefree and curious about a jug or boxed wine, go for it. However, be aware that many of these are mass-produced for mass consumption and typically don’t measure very high in expert ratings.

, If you have a preference between light, dry wines and bolder ones, look for the wine’s ABV (Alcohol by Volume) as an indicator of which is which. Expect richer flavor from wines containing more alcohol. Use 13% ABV as a dividing line to pick a wine that will suit your personal taste. For instance:Choose a wine with 13% ABV or higher if you enjoy rich, bold flavors.
Go with a wine whose ABV is 12% or lower if you prefer light, dry wines.

, Check both the front and back labels for descriptions that detail the wine’s character beyond merely “Shiraz” or “Chablis.” Whether or not you have the palate of a 5-star chef, look for any keywords that might put you off, like “vanilla,” “sweet,” or “buttery.” Obviously, if the tasting notes are trumpeting flavors you don’t like, put it back on the shelf.Tasting notes are generally a more helpful tool in determining what not to get. Remember that these are created by the wine’s producer, who wants to sell the wine and make some money. Therefore they’re always going to write it up in a way that sounds positive. So just because the notes tout a flavor that you really like doesn’t mean that you’re going to like it., You’re probably aware that certain vintages of specific wines are prized commodities, like the 1945 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. Although it’s highly unlikely you’ll find that specific wine at your local Walmart, beware older wines in general at the grocery store. Remember that wines need particular care when it comes to long-term storage, which grocery stores lack. Always check the vintage and stick to:White wines that are two years or younger.
Red wines that are three years or younger.

, If you're totally lost on what to select for yourself, see if the store has staff dedicated exclusively to the wine section. Not all grocery stores employ wine experts, but some do just so that someone is always on hand to answer questions you're likely to have. Of course, the person you see stocking the shelves may just be a stock-person, so always ask them if they're able to provide assistance before launching straight into your more pointed questions., Rely on outside experts who have already done the work for you. Look for bottles with foil stickers listing medals or other awards that it has won. Favor those that also mention which specific vintage won that award so you can compare that with the vintage printed on the label to the bottle in your hand.A lot of factors can impact the quality of vintages in a relatively short amount of time. The longer the gap between the award-winner’s vintage and this particular bottle’s, the bigger the risk that the quality has dropped since then.
If the sticker doesn’t mention which vintage won the award, use your smartphone to search online.

, Instead of falling back on the trial-and-error method of buying a bottle and only finding out afterward if it’s any good, use the internet to narrow down your choices before purchasing them.

Switch wines.",How to Drink Wine," There are a few different types of wine bottles – most have corks or screw caps. Wines with screw caps are easy to open, you simply open them like a regular bottle. Corked bottles are a bit trickier.


You'll need a simple corkscrew to open a corked bottle of wine. Start by removing the foil on top of the cork. Next, twist the spiral of your corkscrew into the cork. Once half of the corkscrew is in the cork, lift the handle of the corkscrew to remove the cork from the bottle.;
, To get the best taste out of your wine, make sure you serve it at the ideal temperature. Red wines should be served closer to room temperature, whereas white wines are much better when chilled.


Most red wines taste best between 55 and 65 degrees fahrenheit; which is just a bit cooler than room temperature. To get your wine this temperature, cool room-temp reds in an ice bucket or the freezer for 10 minutes right before serving.White wines typically taste best between 41 degrees and 48 degrees fahrenheit. For this reason, you should normally store white wines in the fridge. To get your white wine to reach these temperatures, remove chilled whites from the fridge 20 minutes before serving., White wine glasses tend to be smaller than red wine glasses. This is because white wines do not need to oxidize like reds do. When drinking white wine, choose glasses that have narrower bowls with a tapered top. This will allow for greater aromatic concentration, making the intensity of the smells and flavors of your wine last longer.Red wine needs to oxidize in order for its flavor to fully develop, which is why red wine glasses are typically larger than white wine glasses. Because of their bowl shape, red wine glasses allow more of the wine to come into contact with the air. As the red wine breathes, the character of the wine becomes richer and more pronounced.When drinking wine, always hold the wine glass by its stem and never by the bowl. Holding a wine glass by the bowl will warm it too quickly., Red and white wines are served slightly differently. Be sure to pour the proper amount of wine into your glass to get the best possible wine experience.


When drinking red wine, bring the bottle to the glass and gently pour your red wine until your glass is half way full. This should be roughly 4 ounces of wine. To stop your pour, slowly twist the bottle upward over the glass to avoid drops and spills.When serving white wine, wrap a napkin around the neck of the bottle for insulation before pouring. This will keep your hands from warming the bottle. Then, slowly pour your wine until the glass is one-third full – roughly 3 ounces. To stop pouring, slightly twist the bottle upwards to avoid any spills., If you're a new wine drinker, go to a store that specializes in wine to ask for help in selecting the wine that is right for you. If there isn't a specialty wine store near you, don't panic. Most liquor and grocery stores have a large variety of wine, so you should have no problem finding the right wine for you.


Explain to the wine expert or store employee what flavors you enjoy so that they can help you choose the best wine.
If you're planning to have wine with food, tell them what food that will be on the menu so that they can help you pick the right wine.

, Knowing what qualities you're looking for in a wine is very important, as there are numerous types of wine. Do you want a full-bodied or light-bodied wine? Body equates to how heavy the wine actually feels in your mouth. Or do you prefer a dry or sweet wine? In wine-speak, dry is the opposite of sweet. Do you want a crisp or soft wine? A wine with refreshing acidity is crisp, whereas a wine that feels smoother is considered soft.The most popular red wines include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir.Try a white wine. Popular white wines include Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, and Sauvignon Blanc., It's common to try a few sips of wine before committing to a glass. Proper wine tasting is a great way to determine whether or not you like the overall flavor of the wine.

, Swirl the wine in your glass to expose it to a larger surface area. This increases wine’s contact with air and intensifies its aroma. Swirl your wine by holding the glass by the base or by the stem. Smell your wine as you swirl it to take in the aromas. Common aromas include different fruits, spices, herbs and flowers.


Be sure to smell the wine several times, swirling before each smell. A complex wine will offer multiples scents, and taking in each scent will intensify the wines flavor.
The overall taste of a wine is a combination of smells and flavors, so it's important that you don't skip the smelling stage. , Taste your wine in small sips. Roll the wine across your taste buds by lightly swishing it around your mouth. Hold the wine in your mouth for 5-10 seconds before swallowing to really absorb the flavor. After swallowing, notice the aftertaste, or finish. High quality wines tend to have a more defined the finish. A good finish will linger on your palate for quite some time., Wine is best when sipped and savored, as opposed to being gulped down. Take a small-to-medium sized sips of wine, and hold the wine in the center of your tongue before swallowing. This will allow you to taste the complex flavors of the wine.


Red wine is typically rich in flavor and is much better when sipped and savored. It can be served with dinner or dessert, or be sipped on its own. Drink your wine slowly so that you can truly appreciate its flavor. Swirl your wine before taking every sip, this will allow your wine to oxidize even more.
White wine can be sipped on its own, but also goes well with a variety of meals and desserts. White wines tend to be more refreshing than reds, so they balance out rich flavors nicely. Take one small sip of wine at a time, and let the flavor of the wine settle on your tastebuds before swallowing.

, There are a few factors to consider when pairing your wine with food – it's easiest to think of pairing as a balancing act. For example, sparkling wines go perfectly with salty, fried foods. The carbonation and acids emulate beer and clean the salt from your palate with each sip.


Choose silky white wines with foods like fatty fish or cream sauces. Chardonnays, for example, are delicious with fish like salmon or any kind of seafood in a lush sauce.
Pair a dry Rosé with rich, cheesy dishes. Some cheeses usually go better with white wine, and some are best with red. However, almost all cheeses pair well with dry rosé, which has the acidity of white wine and the fruitiness of a red.
Red wines such as Cabernet and Bordeaux are terrific with red meats like steaks and chops. They refresh the palate after each bit of meat.With desserts, make sure that the wine tastes as sweet, or sweeter, than the dessert. For example, pair a bitter, dark chocolate and a red wine with some sweetness, such as a late harvest Zinfandel.Check out Pair Food and Wine for details on the best foods for different kinds of wine.

, When drinking and tasting wine, it is common to try a variety of reds or whites. You should move from lighter, sweeter wines to fuller, drier wines. If you want to try both reds and whites, start with white wines and work your way to the reds. If you're drinking wine with a meal, drink a chardonnay with your dinner, and move to a red wine for your after dinner drink. You could also choose a sweet red wine to have with dessert.

The Sanyo SR-4912M 4.9 cu ft (138.75 liters) compact refrigerator is an excellent, popular choice for a dedicated kegerator that can accommodate a single cornelius keg and a 5 lb (2.26kg) CO2 tank. It has a stainless steel door with black body and does not have a freezer compartment. There is an identical version of refrigerator that has been sold under the Kenmore brand, but it may no longer be available (although check online auctions as one possible source).





;
,


If the refrigerator that’s used has a separate freezer compartment, make sure that the freezer compartment door won’t hit or interfere with the the tap or tap handle.






The end of the shank will protrude through the door and will be fastened from the inside with a fitting that screws onto the shank, so the inner surface of the door where the shank is located must be flat. It’s common to place the tap and shank somewhere along the vertical centerline of the door. Place it more than four or five inches (10cm to 12.5cm) from the edges of the door. It may be advisable to not place it toward the side of the door that opens (opposite the hinges) because the shank will be attached to the beer line inside the kegerator. Every time you open the door, the beer line will move, and you don’t want it to be forced outwards too far when you open the door. It can also obstruct access to the gas cylinder in the kegerator or get tangled up on the gas cylinder or regulator, and you want to prevent the gas cylinder from falling over, as well as the keg.







, Drill a hole for the shank through the refrigerator door with a hole saw. If using a standard shank that is 7/8” (22.2mm) in diameter, drill the hole using a 1” (2.5cm) hole saw.


Before drilling, align the hole saw and drill so that you will drill a level hole straight through the door.






Start drilling into the outer skin of the refrigerator so that the drill bit in the hole saw penetrates the metal. This hole will stabilize the hole saw when you make the larger hole.






Continue drilling. It may be somewhat difficult to drill through the metal skin of the refrigerator with the hole saw. As soon as the hole saw cuts completely through the metal skin of the refrigerator, cease drilling and remove the cut-out metal circle from the hole saw.






Now drill all the way through the foam and inner plastic skin of the door. Don’t push much on the drill because the hole saw will cut through the foam and plastic very easily. After drilling, clean up the foam and plastic particles.







Optional: After drilling and cleaning the hole, smear some DAP household aquarium-safe sealant/adhesive over the exposed foam inside the hole. This will prevent foam particles from getting on the shank when you insert or remove the shank from the hole. However, you will need to let the sealant dry before inserting the shank, and it will generally not be necessary to remove the shank once it’s installed unless you prefer to disassemble it for cleaning rather than run beer line cleaner through it.







, Before beginning, make sure the CO2 tank is completely shut off and the regulator is off/dialed or adjusted to zero pressure with its barbed shutoff valve closed. Note that some regulators can only be dialed to output CO2 when connected to a CO2 tank. The gas hose (usually 5/16"" (7.93mm) ID gas line) that connects to the keg via the ball lock gas disconnect will be attached to the regulator’s barbed shutoff valve. The regulator is attached to the CO2 tank with the large 1 1/8” (26.81mm) tank nut. It is best to use a double-gauge regulator, but a single-gauge regulator will work fine as well. As pictured, the lower gauge (left side) indicates the pressure in the CO2 tank, while the upper gauge indicates the pressure in the keg. Single-gauge regulators only show the pressure in the keg. The knob in the center of the regulator (which is sometimes a bolt or screw) is used to adjust the pressure in the keg. As pictured, the barb with the red lever is the shutoff valve that will be connected to the keg gas line. If desired, install a gauge cage on the regulator. This will help to prevent your gauges from being damaged or coming loose if your CO2 tank falls over or your regulator is otherwise impacted.


Assemble the gas line and attach it to the regulator. First cut a 3 or 4-foot (91.44cm to 1.21 meters) segment of gas hose. Use 5/16” (7.93mm) thick-walled gas hose with a standard 3/8” (9.52mm) regulator hose barb. Slide a hose clamp onto the hose and push the hose onto the regulator’s shutoff valve hose barb. It should be difficult to push on the hose, so gradually work it onto the barb. Secure it with the hose clamp. If you are using a ball lock gas disconnect with a threaded fitting, use a wrench to securely attach the barb to the quick disconnect before attaching it to the hose. Slide a hose clamp onto the far end of the gas line and push the gas quick disconnect barb into the hose. Secure it with the hose clamp.






With the tank and regulator shut completely off, securely attach the regulator with complete gas line to the CO2 tank with a large wrench (1.5"" wrench recommended). Because the gas disconnect seals itself when not connected to a keg, the CO2 tank’s primary shutoff can be opened briefly while the tank's main valve is opened to test for leaks at the regulator/tank connection and in the gas line (use soapy water and look for bubbles). However, always use very low pressure (such as 5 PSI or less) via the regulator when testing for leaks. The lower gauge should indicate that the tank contains pressurized CO2. Set the regulator to zero pressure and turn off the regulator’s shutoff valve to prevent CO2 from entering the gas line.






If desired, integrate a check valve into the gas line. Check valves prevent beer from entering the gas line and potentially ruining your regulator or contaminating your gas line. The topmost pictured device is a 1/4” (6.35mm) regulator shutoff valve that has a check valve built into it. It can be used to replace regulator shutoff valves that do not have check valves built into them. Be sure to wrap the threads of the shutoff valve with Teflon tape before screwing it tightly into the regulator so that gas leakage does not occur. To determine if a regulator’s shutoff valve has a check valve, unscrew it from a disconnected, unpressurized regulator and turn the shutoff valve on and off. If you do not see the valve opening and closing inside it, it has a check valve. The second pictured device is a check valve that is connected to the far end of the gas line, so it is connected between the keg’s gas line quick disconnect and the far end of gas line itself. It was purchased pre-assembled as pictured from a homebrew shop (the homebrew shop buys them from a distributor as is). It has a brass barb that will connect to a 5/16” (7.93mm) gas line and a short segment of pre-attached hose that will connect to the smaller 1/4” (6.35mm) barb of a standard gas disconnect (so you would not want to use a gas disconnect with a 5/16” (7.93mm) barb).






Check valve assembly installed between the gas line that is attached to the regulator’s shutoff valve and the disconnect.







, Note that shanks that have attached tailpieces do not require a wing nut or the neoprene washer that is sandwiched between the tailpiece and end of the shank.


Begin by cutting a 4 to 5 foot (1.21m to 1.52m) segment of 3/16” (4.76mm) ID (inner diameter) beverage line hose.






To assemble beer line that is used with a separate tailpiece, first slide two hose clamps and the wing nut onto the hose. Then soften both ends of the hose by holding them in hot water (hot enough to make tea with) for about 30 seconds. Then push the tailpiece’s barb into the end of the hose with the wing nut’s larger opening that will screw onto the end of the shank facing the tailpiece.






Then push the disconnects barb into the other end of the hose. Slide the wing nut right up to the tailpiece so that the tailpiece contacts it, and keeps it from slipping off the end of the hose.






Finally, slide one of the hose clamps to the back of the wing nut. Make sure there’s a small gap between the wing nut and the hose clamp so that the wing nut can rotate around the tailpiece when you’re screwing the wing nut onto the shank. Then tighten the hose clamp so that it secures the tailpiece. Finally, secure the disconnects barb with the remaining hose clamp.







,

Screw the tap onto the shank. Make sure it’s tight but not overly tight. Don’t use a regular wrench to tighten it. Use your hands or a faucet wrench.






Insert the shank through the hole in the door and secure it with the shank’s large nut.






If using a separate tailpiece, put the black neoprene washer between the end of the shank and the tailpiece and firmly secure by screwing on the wing nut by hand.






If using a shank with a unified tailpiece, push the hose onto the tailpiece and secure with a hose clamp. It may be necessary to heat the end of the hose in hot water to soften it before it can be pushed onto the tailpiece.







, Note that it is best to first place the full, disconnected keg in the kegerator before attaching the gas and beer lines to prevent shaking or otherwise agitating it.


The bottom portion of the ball lock gas and liquid disconnects are pulled up when connecting them to the keg (gas IN disconnect is shown, but the liquid OUT disconnect will be attached first).






Before connecting the disconnects, pull the pressure relief valve that’s in the lid to relieve all the pressure in the keg. Then re-seal the pressure relief valve so the keg can hold pressure.






Turn off the CO2 tank’s primary valve, close the regulator’s shutoff valve, and make sure the regulator is adjusted to zero pressure.






Make sure the tap (faucet) is in the off (closed) position. Connect the liquid disconnect to the OUT post. Make sure it is securely connected.






Connect the gas disconnect to the IN post.






Make sure (again) that the tap is in the closed position. Fully open the main CO2 tank valve. Open the regulator’s shutoff valve. Adjust the gas pressure in the keg to about 12 PSI using the regulator’s adjustment knob.







,


Try pouring some beer. If it foams too much you can lower the pressure to 10 PSI, but be aware that pressures lower than about 12 PSI will usually allow gas bubbles to form in the beer line that will cause foaming. If the beer doesn’t foam at 12 PSI, see if it’s OK at 14 PSI, which is often a fine dispensing pressure (unless the beer foams at this higher pressure). 12 PSI should be perfectly fine as well in most cases.






Before adjusting the pressure in the keg you must first dial down the regulator to zero pressure, so it is shut off. Then pull the relief valve on the keg and vent all the pressure from the keg (this will happen very quickly). Then close or seal the relief valve and re-pressurize the keg to the desired pressure using the regulator.






Be aware that if your beer or kegerator is warmer, a higher pressure will be needed, while lower temperatures require lower pressures for beer dispense. It may be necessary to adjust the pressure a few times to get the best pour.
A “balanced” system will not produce overly foamy beer. This means that adequate CO2 pressure can be applied to prevent foam-causing gas bubbles from forming in the beer line, and the required pressure will not produce overly foamy beer. If your beer foams at 12 PSI, you may need to increase the length of your beer line.

, Drip trays will keep beer from dripping onto the floor, and are a handy place to set down foamy glasses. Drip trays are secured with two or more self-tapping screws that will be included with the tray, so no pre-drilling is required. The drip tray's screw holes will allow the trip tray to be removed from the door. The drip tray should be centered directly under the tap, and leveled with a level. Allow for adequate space between the tap and the drip tray so that you can readily put glasses under the tap with plenty of room to spare. When you know exactly where to set the drip tray, mark the drip tray's screw holes with a pencil while holding it against the kegerator's door, then line it up with the holes and secure it using an electric drill (it should be possible to use a regular screwdriver, but it may be somewhat difficult). Do not overly tighten the screws against the drip tray, as the drip tray will be pulled free from the screws for regular cleaning.

Observe the buildup of particles on the filter pad.,
Clean the filtration system.",How to Filter Wine1," This method of filtering is the cheapest of all the filtration methods. It works by connecting the filter body, containing a filter pad, with a siphon tube. The siphon tube pushes the wine through the filter.This is the cheapest method, but it is also the slowest. The slowness of this process also causes the filter pads to collect yeast and other particles from the wine.;
, The wine is forced through the filter pads. There are three different grades of filter pads.Coarse filter pad. This type of pad adds polish to the wine without losing body or color.
Polish/medium filter pads. This is the type of pad that winemakers most commonly use. It adds polish to wine without removing too much body or color.
Sterile/fine pads. This type of pad should be used last after the other two pads. The greatest amount of yeast is removed with this pad. It also helps remove the effects of oxidation in your wine.

, Make sure to affix any other attachments to the intake siphon tube. Position this below the barrel or storage unit.

, Fasten the outtake siphon tube to the release on the barrel or storage unit. Prepare a bottle for the wine to flow into at the other end of the filter pad. Make sure that the system is hooked up properly, and the filtration plates are set up right to prevent leakage.Complete any steps in the winemaking process, except cold stabilization, before filtering. Your wine should be in the barrel or storage unit and ready to be bottled prior to beginning gravity flow filtration.Sterilize your filtration system before using.

, Wine should begin to flow towards the filter pad where it will slow down and trickle through to the bottle.

, This method is best if you are dealing with one or two gallons of wine at a time. Allow 45 minutes to an hour to filter one gallon of wine.

, This type of system produces a coarser filtration. For a finer filtration, you will need a mechanical filtration system.


As wine begins to get stopped up behind the pad, tilt the siphon tube back toward the barrel or storage unit, remove the filter pad, and replace it with a new one.

, Use water and sulfite solution. Rinse thoroughly with water."

Know your beer.,
Select a beer that complements and enhances the food.,
Evaluate the malt and hop levels.,
Determine the role that the beer will play in your cooking.,
Choose a reputable brand.,
Follow the directions in the recipe.,
Bring the beer to room temperature before cooking.,
Remember to use a measuring device created for liquids.,
Start cooking.",How to Cook With Beer1," There are three main types: these are ales, stouts and lagers. Ales and lagers tend to be best for using in cooking, although stout has its place too, such as in some versions of Christmas pudding.;
, The right type of beer should be considered before you cook. One rule of thumb to follow is like wine––use dark beer for robust dishes and light beer for lighter fare.


Generally, pale ale beer complements nearly all recipes. Beer intensifies during cooking, so a lighter tasting beer may lend more of a blended flavor than a darker beer.
Nut brown beer is ideal for rich dishes such as stews or cheese dishes.
Strong Belgian ales can complement meat dishes. Most meat, especially red meat, dishes will require the use of dark brown ale rather than the lighter version.

Fruity beers work well with desserts.

Wheat ales can enhance seafood and poultry dishes.

Lager beer is works well for baking breads because it adds levity to the dough. Beer can be used instead of yeast in pancakes and some breads.
Adding beer to batters produces a light and crispy texture.

, Malt and hops are the flavoring agents in beer. If the levels are higher, more beer flavor will come out in your dish.

, Enhancing the flavor of the food is not the only role beer can have in cooking. It is also a natural meat tenderizer, yeast enhancer that complements bread and pancakes. It is also a deglazing agent that can re-infuse a dish with cooked ingredients.

, Never cook or use beer that you wouldn’t enjoy drinking. Remember that price doesn’t always dictate flavor, so if you're not already sure, sample the beer before adding it to your dish.


Don't be afraid of using stale beer though. Last night's unfinished beer, provided it was refrigerated, can be used to cook with. After all, it's probably flat and no good for drinking now!

, Beer is meant to enhance and enliven the flavors of your food, so add this ingredient specifically according to directions. Overdoing the addition of beer could overwhelm the flavor of the food and cause it to be unpalatable.

, Beer that is too cold or hot may compromise other ingredients in your dish. If your brew has been in the refrigerator, make sure you take it out and give it time to get to room temperature before adding it to your dish. Only do otherwise if a recipe overrides this specifically.

, Some measuring cups are actually made for dry ingredients such as flour or sugar. Purchase a measuring cup system from the local home store that is designed specifically for liquids to obtain an accurate reading.

, Below are some typical dishes made using beer. Experiment with a few to see what your favorites will be.

Choose a port you would like to drink.,
Purchase the port of your choice from a local liquor supplier.,
Purchase or have on hand glasses designed for serving port.,
Stand the bottle of port upright for a minimum of 24 hours for younger ports and up to 1 week for vintage ports.,
Uncork the bottle carefully with a wine key once the sediment timing is complete.,
Decant the port.,
Rest the port in a location that will help the liquid to achieve a temperature of between 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 degrees Celsius).

,
Pour the port from the decanter into your serving glass.",How to Drink Port," There are 8 varieties: white, ruby, tawny, crusted, late-bottled vintage or LBV, single quinta, colheita, and vintage. Each port variety has unique characteristics to explore, and you can seek tasting events in your area to attend. You can also research the different types of port on the Internet or in books to help you decide which type to drink.


White is made from white grapes and can be sweet or dry. Ruby is made from grapes that span several harvests and is aged in wooden barrels for at least 3 years. Tawny is similar to ruby port, but it is aged for up to 40 years or more. Crusted is also similar to ruby, but does not go through the filtering process, which gives it a crust of sediments that develop in the bottle over time. Late-bottled vintage, or LBV, is made from grapes harvested in only 1 year and aged for 4 to 6 years. Single quinta is made the same way as LBV, but features grapes only taken from 1 estate, or quinta. Colheita is a tawny port, but it is made from only 1 year's grapes and from 1 estate. Vintage, considered the cream of the port crop, is a single-harvest port aged only 2 to 3 years and set to age unfiltered. The winemaker must determine that the harvest was exceptional, and that the port will be exquisite. Then, the winemaker declares that year a vintage, and vintage port is made. As a result, vintage port tends to be an expensive rarity.;
, If none are available, try looking on the Internet for a port wholesaler.

, The glasses will help you get the most from the experience. They should be standard Institut National d'Appellation d'Origine (INAO) tasting glasses, or you can splurge and purchase glasses specifically designed for port, which you can easily find through many Internet wholesalers.

, This allows time for the sediment in the bottle to sink to the bottom. Your port is ready when you are able to see a fine layer of sand-like particles on the bottom of the bottle.

, The older the port, the more difficult the cork will be to remove and the more likely the cork will break, since corks tend to dry out with age.

, Carefully and slowly pour the liquid into a decanter. When you reach the bottom of the bottle, stop pouring port once you spot the sediment enter the neck of the bottle. For best results, use a decanter that has a funnel so you can easily and quickly see the sediment before it escapes the bottle.

,, Etiquette suggests filling each glass no more than half full.

Cook with white wine to add flavoring, marinate, grill and sautee your favorite dishes and recipes.,
Stay away from wines that are specifically termed cooking wines when cooking food with white wine.,
Visit wine shops and grocery stores to learn about the different wines available.,
Experiment with your recipes and dishes that call for white wine, but start small.",How to Choose White Wine for Cooking,"


A good rule of thumb is that if you are going to use a white wine to cook with, choose a white wine that you would also want to drink.
White wines are divided into the of the following popular categories: Pinots, Chardonnays and Sauvignons.;
,


Wines termed ""cooking wines"" will tend to cost less and will ruin the flavor of your food.
When it comes to selecting the right white wine to cook with, you will want to purchase a wine considered at least medium grade, but it doesn't have to be the most expensive wine on the shelf.
What you want to aim for with white wine is a nice aromatic smell to your dish, along with a nice flavor that the wine will provide.

,


By doing this, you will be able to see the wine selections and there are people available to answer any questions you might have about their wine selections.

,


Some dishes will require you use just enough to add a splash of flavor.
In other dishes, if a recipe has water, you might consider using wine instead.
When marinating chicken or fish, you can mix white wine into oil for extra flavoring.

Choose a decanter.,
Open the bottle and pour the wine slowly down the sides of the decanter.,
Leave the wine out for a period of time.",How to Decant an Older Wine," There are many different decanters, at various prices. The important thing to remember is that the purpose of decanting a wine is to expose as much of the wine as possible to oxygen. The wider the decanter, the better. Some decanters are also created at a 45 degree angle or so. This exposes even more of the wine's surface area to air.;
, There are two philosophies on the intensity of the pour. Some people believe a vigorous, quick pour better aerates the wine, some believe this can shock the wine and prefer a slower, more gentle pour. Especially with older wines, an easy, gentle pour is the way to go.

, How long depends on what kind of wine you have. A tannic, robust red like Cabernet Sauvignon, French Cahors or Australian Shiraz can be left for a few hours, settling the wine and opening up the fruit flavours. More delicate reds like Pinot Noir and Amarone need less time.

Try Canadian or German ice wine.,
Try an ice wine from the US.,
Try an Australian ice wine.",How to Choose Ice Wine1," Ice wine is manufactured across the globe, but Germany and Canada are known for producing the best ice wines. If you’re looking for a traditional ice wine, select a wine from one of these two countries.Canadian and German wines primarily use Riesling grapes in their ice wines.Canadian wines do not age well and are best consumed when they are younger. German wines should be allowed to age a little longer.;
, The United States is not a major producer of ice wines, but it does have several very successful vineyards. If you’re buying ice wine from the US, look for wines manufactured in very cold regions, like Michigan or the Finger Lake region of New York.If you’re an ice wine super-fan or if you’re local to New York, visit the NY State Ice Wine Festival, which is held every February in Fairport, New York. Wineries across the region bring samples for vendors and new fans to sample and enjoy.
There are also other festivals scattered across New York, as well as across the country. Try Googling Ice Wine festivals to find an option near you.

, Australia is much warmer than other countries where ice wine is manufactured, and therefore, their methods are a bit more controversial. Australian ice wine is created using artificial freezing techniques, instead of natural freezing techniques.Tasters are unable to tell the difference between wines frozen artificially and wines frozen naturally, but if you're looking for a more traditional ice wine experience, avoid Australian ice wine.

Choose a region.,
Decide whether you prefer dry or sweet Champagne.,
Consider the color.,
Think about food pairings.",How to Choose Champagne1," Sparkling wines are made throughout the world and are known by many names. By understanding the country of origin, you can appreciate the flavor profiles each type of sparkling wine embodies.


Vintners in Champagne, France, a region in the northeastern corner of the country, produce the most commonly known sparkling wine. Only certain approved grape varieties, such as Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier, are allowed in Champagne according to French law. French Champagne is commonly drier than other sparkling wines.Prosecco is an increasingly common sparkling Italian wine. Known for its fruity aroma and large bubbles, Prosecco is often blended into mixed drinks. The main grape used to produce Prosecco is Glera, and it has been cultivated since Roman times.Spanish sparkling wine is known as Cava. Typically dry, many agree that Cava often has a flavor profile similar to Champagne, but for a fraction of the price.Sparkling wine is a common term used to describe any non-Champagne carbonated wine. Despite the non-specific nature of its name, many sparkling wines, particularly those from California, are known for their high quality and good value.;
, Champagnes and sparkling wines vary regarding how much residual sugar remains in the finished product. This determines how sweet or dry the resulting wine tastes.


Brut champagne, a common option, is defined as having less than 15 grams of sugar per liter. In other words, it will not taste sweet at all. Extra brut is drier than brut, and brut zéro is the driest choice. Surprisingly, the flavor of extra dry Champagne is between a sweet and a dry choice. It has a slightly sweet flavor profile, and it is also a good option for pairing with a variety of foods. For a dessert option or sweet choice, consider a champagne labeled “sec” (sweet) or “demi-sec” (semi-sweet). Moscato is a popular dessert choice for sweet, sparkling wine. , Depending on the type of grape used in production, as well as other factors, champagnes and sparkling wines vary in color from white, to pink, to red. Color can affect flavor and how “heavy” the wine feels in the mouth as well.


Champagne made from all white grapes is known as “Blanc de Blancs” or “white of whites.” These wines are usually delicate and taste lighter on the palate than those made by adding red grapes. They are often served as an aperitif.”Blanc de Noirs,” or “white of blacks,” refers to wines made with black grapes (e.g., Pinot Noir or Pinot Meunier). These wines are still light in color, but not as white as Blanc de Blancs. They can range in color from straw or golden yellow to light pink, and their flavor is a little heavier than a Blanc de Blanc.
Rosé wine, which has increased in popularity lately, is typically dry with a berry aroma and a pink or coral color.
An unconventional choice for a sparkling wine is a red one, such as a sparkling Shiraz from Australia or a sparkling Malbec from Argentina. , The crisp acidity and effervescent nature of Champagnes and sparkling wines make them a perfect partner for a variety of dishes. Depending on the type of grape used in production, each kind of Champagne or sparkling wine has optimal food pairings.The lighter quality of Blanc de Blancs compliments foods such as seafood, creamy cheeses, and vegetarian dishes. Blanc de Blancs are sometimes served at the beginning of a meal as an aperitif or while appetizers are being served.
Heavier foods, such as roasted duck or turkey, pair well with Blanc de Noirs. Other options with Blanc de Noirs include pork tenderloin and aged cheeses.
Sparkling rosés are a versatile choice, as they pair nicely with a range of dishes, including Mexican food, holiday hams, and garlic foods.
Grilled and/or spicy foods are enhanced by pairing them with a sparkling red, such as Shiraz or Malbec.

Select a wine based on cost.,
Select a wine based on alcohol content.,
Select a wine based on vintage.",How to Choose Ice Wine2," Creating an ice wine is a very time consuming and sometimes dangerous process and this is reflected in the cost per bottle. Ice wines start at $40 a half bottle, but bottles have sold for up to $30,000.Good affordable ice wines include the 2009 Equifera Riesling Ice Wine, which retails for $70 and the 2012 Inniskillin Riesling Ice Wine, which retails for $80.
For even more affordable options, try the 2012 Reif Estate Vidal Ice Wine, at $50 a pop or the 2010 Megalomaniac Coldhearted Riesling Ice Wine for $30.

, Ice wine varies in the amount of alcohol it contains, with German wine typically weighing in as low as 6% and Canadian wine weighing in as high as 13%. If you are looking to get slightly buzzed, choose an ice wine with a higher volume of alcohol.Most ice wines fall in the 8-9% alcohol content range., Ice wine is created under frozen conditions, but sometimes those conditions yield lesser harvests. Grapes can fall victim to birds, disease, mold, rain, hail and other factors. To avoid inferior ice wines, select vintages from years that have been especially cold.2013 was an especially good vintage for Canadian ice wines, so be on the lookout for ice wines from this year."
"
Select a red ice wine.,
Choose a white ice wine.,
Choose a sparkling ice wine.",How to Choose Ice Wine3," Ice wines made from red grapes generally result in shades of light burgundy or pink. Red ice wines tend to run sweeter and contain notes of berries, candy and dried figs.The best red ice wines are generally made from Merlot or Cabernet Franc grapes., Ice wines made from white grapes generally result in shades of pale yellow and light gold, but over time, can deepen to a dark gold hue. Their flavors are generally more full bodied and the wines have more of a lingering finish than red wines do. White ice wines contain notes of fruit, with hints of peach and citrus.The best white ice wines are generally made from Riesling grapes.

, Sparkling ice wines are made by capturing the natural bubbles from the wine within stainless steel tanks. Sparkling ice wines are generally gold yellow in color and contain notes of fruit (especially apricot) honey and/or spice. The wines are more luxurious than their non-carbonated counterparts and they have a long finish.For an excellent sparkling ice wine, try the 2012 Inniskillin Sparkling Cabernet Franc ice wine or the 2014 Inniskillin Sparkling Vidal ice wine.If you’re a fan of Rose, try the 2011 Sparkling Rose Ice Wine from Johnson Estate Winery.The best ice wines are generally found in Ontario’s Niagara region, where sparkling ice wine was first produced."

Consider the occasion.,
Determine whether the wine will be mixed into another drink.,
Decide on a bottle size.",How to Choose Champagne2," The type of event and the number of guests present should definitely factor in to how much you decide to spend per bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine.


An intimate dinner or small gathering will enable you think about selecting an exclusive bottle or two of Champagne (ranging upwards of $100 per bottle). Well known producers of these high-end Champagnes include Dom Perignon, Louis Roederer Cristal, and Krug.
For a larger party or wedding, sparkling wine may be a better option because of a wider variety of price points. Although a quality Champagne can be purchased for approximately $40, many well regarded Proseccos or Cavas are available for less than that. If a large quantity is being purchased, ask the merchant whether a bulk discount is available.

, If the Champagne or sparkling wine is going to be added to a cocktail or punch, consider purchasing a less expensive American sparkling wine.

, Price varies depending on the amount of Champagne being purchased.


A typical bottle of Champagne or sparkling wine is 750 milliliters.
Smaller, half-bottle sizes of expensive brands enable you to sample them without making the financial commitment to the regular size bottle.
A 1.5 liter Magnum may be a fun option for a party. But remember, although a Magnum has double the amount of sparkling wine found in a typical bottle, it is usually more than twice as expensive due to material and shipping costs."

Visit an assortment of wine shops and grocery stores.,
Develop relationships with local merchants.,
Explore online retailers.,
Seek out local wineries.",How to Choose Champagne3," Due to increasing popularity and demand, Champagnes and sparkling wines are widely available.


Grocery stores and mass marketers may have limited selection, but their wines will typically be more reasonably priced because they’ll sell more popular wines at a higher volume.
Local liquor stores usually have a section devoted to Champagne and sparkling wine. The staff may be able to offer suggestions, and the wines may be classified by country of origin.
Wine stores are your best option for truly learning about the different types of sparkling wines available. Many wine stores offer tastings and classes.

, Once you have found a reputable local wine seller, invest the time in getting to know them and their products. Staff at these stores are usually quite enthusiastic about sharing their information with others.

, Occasionally, online retailers may be your best option for sourcing rare, hard-to-find varieties or very high-end brands. Check the laws in your state, however, as some forbid buying alcohol by mail.

, Each of the 50 states currently has at least one winery, and local vintners offer a variety of tours, tastings, and events which can be helpful as you explore the world of sparkling wines.

Determine if your dish calls for a dry or sweet wine.,
Determine the appropriate body and color of the wine.,
Consider the wine you'd like the dish to be paired with upon serving.,
Know when you can make a substitution.",How to Choose a Wine to Cook With," Broadly, wine can be categorized as either dry or sweet. Dry wines have very few residual sugars in them, while sweeter wines have a higher sugar content. As wine cooks, its sweetness intensifies as the alcohol and water portions evaporate, leaving a higher concentration of sugar behind. Because of this, dry wines (whether red or white) generally work the best when preparing savory dishes. Sweeter wines can lend a cloying sweetness to a dish, and are best suited for dessert applications.;
, Both white and red wines, either light- or full-bodied, can be used in cooking. Assess the qualities of your dish to determine which wine would work best.


In general, white wines work well with mild-flavored dishes featuring fish or chicken. The bright, lively acidity of light-bodied whites accentuates the mild flavor of the meats without overpowering them. Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio are both excellent choices for this type of cooking.
Heavier dishes featuring beef or any highly-seasoned meat work well with a full-bodied red wine. The tannins in these wines can provide a pleasant palate-cleansing effect when paired with hearty dishes; in lighter dishes, these tannins can yield an unpleasant bitterness. Zinfandel, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon pair well with heavier dishes.

, If you are planning on serving the dish alongside a glass of wine, consider how the wine in the dish will interact with the wine in the glass. Using the same wine for both cooking and serving is an excellent technique that allows the food and wine to reinforce each other's flavor notes. If you want to use a different wine, taste the 2 alongside each other first to determine whether or not they clash.


There is a common adage that you should only cook with wine that you'd want to drink. This assertion doesn't generally bear out; in truth, when wine is cooked nearly all of its subtle complexity is lost, leaving only a rough template of its original flavor profile. The levels of tannins, sugars, acids, and overall body are the characteristics that will remain in the cooked dish.

, Some French or Italian dishes call for a specific type of wine, often referred to by its origin or specific appellation. For example, most coq au vin recipes call for Burgundy wine, but an American Pinot Noir could be easily substituted.

Consider using wine ratings to help pick out more expensive bottles.,
Ask the waiter or wine store staff for recommendations to help navigate the waters.,
Consider the vintage, or year, when you choose wine, but understand that all wines age differently.",How to Choose Wine1," Most people buy wines based on labels they like, but take things a step further and actually read the winemaker's description. They frequently point to the prominent flavors and character of the wine, and sometimes suggest food pairings as well. If you're at a restaurant, check the basic descriptions before choosing a wine -- most places offer at least a sentence or two about each wine.


Expressions like ""blend"" and ""table wine"" are usually cheaper, but frequently bland and unbalanced. These wines use a variety of grapes from a wide area that weren't suited for more specific types of wine. They can be great for casual drinks or meals, however.If the wine list at a restaurant has no description, talk to your waiter. Chances are high that they, not the menu, are the experts on each bottle and varietal.;
, The idea of ""red with meat, white with fish,"" is far too simple. The more important goal is for the wine and meal to complement each other. A ""heavy"" meal is usually dense and strongly flavored -- a meat sauce, a spicy dish, or a hearty soup or stew -- and requires a strongly flavored wine to cut into these flavors. You don't want either the dish to overpower the taste of the wine or vice versa -- they should both have a similar depth.


Wines that are described as ""full-bodied,"" ""deep,"" ""complex,"" ""rich,"" or ""densely layered"" are best with heavier meals. Even powerful whites can be deep and complex, making them great with spicy dishes or heartier fare.
Wines that are described as ""light,"" ""balanced,"" ""crisp,"" or ""refreshing"" are great for lighter meals with less powerful flavors -- vegetables, pastas, fish, chicken, and lighter cheeses.

, Pair, for example, a light, citrus-y white wine with a lemon chicken dish. Use a deep, smokey red to match up with the barbecued pork shoulder. Matching these flavors up will help create a seamless meal experience, highlighting key notes in both the dish and the wine.


When picking complementary flavors, think about how the food would taste if that flavor was added from the wine. For example, if you have a deep red with ""hints of chocolate, spice, and blackberry,"" ask yourself if chocolate, spice, and blackberry would look out of place on your plate. There isn't ever a perfect comparison, but it is a good place to start., There are two schools of thought when pairing wines -- complementing flavors and boldly contrasting them. Neither is completely right, and you should try out both approaches as you get more comfortable choosing wine. When contrasting, think about balance. A salty, acidic food like oysters, for example, is well balanced by a fruity, softer Sauvignon Blanc. A hot, oily curry is well contrasted by an acidic, fresh, and citrus-like red, like a Rose.


When considering contrasted flavors, think about the acidity of the food and the texture. Oily or creamy foods are well cut by acidic (sharp tasting) wines, acidic foods are balanced out by fuller, less bitter wines.Big, complex dishes with lots of flavors, like Paella, are well contrasted by simpler, well-balanced wines. This allows the dish to command the ""attention"" with a light, palate-cleansing wine behind it., Cut through the spice with a sweeter wine, which will naturally complement each other. Remember that lighter wines can be either red or white, depending on your preferences, but almost all restaurants will offer some wines that are more ""refreshing,"" or ""fruity.""


Sweeter wines, such as Riesling, pair well with spicy foods, while woody wines, such as Chardonnay, go well with creamy foods or with foods that have several herbs and seasoning.
Look for citrus, berries, floral notes like honeysuckle, and hints of gentle spices like vanilla to find good wines to match with spicy foods.
This doesn't mean asking for a ""sweet"" wine, like a dessert wine. Instead, focus on the fresher, sweeter fruit notes in the description instead of a ""sweet"" wine.

, If you're trying to impress, it may be best to do some research before spending the cash. Websites and magazines like Wine Spectator, Food & Wine, and Wine Enthusiast offer apps and online reviews of just about every wine on the market, allowing you to quickly and easily see if an expensive wine is worth the sticker price.


Most wine shops place labels indicating high-ranked wines. That said, they never get all of them, and you shouldn't skip a wine just because it wasn't

, The waiter at a restaurant should be able to offer suggestions to help you choose a wine that will complement your meal, and should be knowledgeable of the wines they offer and the meals they pair well with. Depending on where you live, the staff at your local wine shop may be well versed in wine. They may be able to make recommendations based on your price range and based on what you plan on pairing with the wine, as they see and sample hundreds of wines a month.


Some fancier restaurants may have sommeliers, or in-house wine experts, to help patrons pick a red wine or other pairings.

, All wines change, develop, and evolve with age. Further complicating things, every wine ages differently, making choosing based on the year a fool's errand unless you're a seasoned pro. That said, there are some common traits that all wines take on as they age, including:


When shopping for light, refreshing, and easy-drinking styles, aim for the younger bottles -- they tend to loose fruity qualities with age.
Denser, complex wines typically need to age for a few years to develop the best taste.
Aging will soften ""tannins,"" which is the bitter taste prominent in many wines.
Flavor intensity generally grows with age, though some wines have a ""cocoon period"" where they mellow out before growing again in flavor."

Try out a Côtes-du-Rhône for an inexpensive but wide-ranging red.,
Look to Sangiovese for a bright, acidic Italian wine.,
Go with big, fruity merlots for another easy to pair, agreeable wine.,
Pick up the classic Cabernet Sauvignon for a rich, layered, and full-bodied red.,
Grab a dense, peppery Syrah for a strongly flavored, spicy red.,
Drink a bold, spicy Malbec to mix with casual foods like pizza and barbecue.,
Grab a Cabernet Franc for an earthy, spicy, and rich red.,
Look to the fruity Zinfandel for a rich, berry-heavy wine.,
Get a high-priced, but extravagant, Pinot Noir when you want to splurge.",How to Choose Wine2," This beautiful blend from Southern French is one of the easiest and most drinkable French wines to pair. It is light, generally fruity, and mild enough to work with almost anything. If you want something foreign but not wallet breaking, go to the CdR.


Pronounced ""Coat Do Rone.""
There is actually a white version of the CdR as well, which match well with fishes. They are less common, but still a good choice for a white., Of course, this pairs very well with almost all Italian dishes, as it is light, acidic, and peppered with light hints of spice, cherry, and even tobacco. It may be blended with a Cabernet to make it a little heartier, as well.

, Note, however, that merlots are popular and can vary substantially. For example, a bottle of Merlot is usually bold and fruity. However, Merlot aged with oak may have a smoky taste as well. They are best from France and the Northern US, and pair with anything, much like the Côtes-du-Rhône, but with a slightly bolder and more noticeable taste.

, This is the famous Napa Valley grape, and it leads to a very dense wine with layers of currant, dark berries, and even olives. Pair this with a rich, substantial, and hearty dish for a beautiful combination and strong, flavorful meal.


If you're aiming for a bargain, grab a Cab Sauv, as it is often the cheapest win with the best results, since Cabernet grapes are easy to grow, These wines can be made either on the lighter side or rich and dense. They come from a spicy, peppery grape, and this note shines through to pair well with similarly peppery foods., This French and Argentinian wine is strong, spicy, and tart. It matches well with casual, rich, and oily/greasy foods, making it a good pair for tailgating, BBQs, or pizza night

, The Cabernet Franc is known for its notes of blueberry and violets, as well as an earthy, almost coffee-like scent. It is high in tannins, giving it a full-body feeling and a touch of bitterness.


Matches well with stews, red meats, and smoky dishes.

, Usually found with hints of raspberry, cherry, raisin, and more, Zinfandels have a uniquely hearty but fruity taste, making them great wines to drink on their own or to pair with rich meals. They are highly alcoholic, meaning they may overpower lighter dishes if you're not careful.

, The Pinot grape is notoriously difficult to grow, making good Pinots expensive. But when a winemaker gets it right, the grape yields a complex, rich, and nuanced wine. Know that you should spend at least $20 a bottle to get you money's worth, if not more. Cheaper pinots aren't worth it.


The Pinot is a complex wine for rich, complex dishes. But it goes equally well with desert, such as a decadent chocolate."
"
Look to the Chardonnays for a drinkable, pair-able wine from anywhere in the world.,
Check out the light, bright Pinot Grigio for an easily paired dinner wine.,
Know you can't go wrong with a Sauvignon Blanc.,
Snag a Riesling for a sweet, dry, and powerful white.,
When in complete doubt about wine choices, grab a Rose.",How to Choose Wine3," One of the most popular grapes around, the citrus-flavored, crisp, and green apple laced Chardonnay is a well-balanced and versatile grape. It can be crafted into many different wines, from sharp and bright to buttery and woody, and anywhere in between.


If you're on a budget, a Chardonnay is often your best bet.Chardonnay is either ""oaked"" or not. Oaked chardonnay has the toasty, vanilla-like flavors, whereas unoaked is usually crisper and brighter., It goes well with fish, chicken, and even some heavier meals (especially the California Pinot Grigio). It is light and fruity, often carrying heavy notes of pear flavors along with citrus. Light on alcohol and oak, it is easily drinkable even without food.

, One of the most common white grapes out there, the Sauvignon Blanc hosts notes of citrus and berry, even peaches, that make it a good pairing for lighter, softer dishes or casual drinking with appetizers. It can be made in a variety of styles depending on aging and fermenting, so be sure to check out the bottle of each one -- they won't be all the same!


Sauv Blancs are also your best cooking white wine, as they have a punch of acidity without too much overpowering flavor.

, The Riesling, a wine of German origin, ranges from sharp and dry to strongly sweet, making it a versatile, though very particular, wine to choose. The drier versions will cut hard into shellfish and spicy dishes -- think Asian cuisine. Meanwhile, the longer aged varieties are perfect on their own as dessert wines, or matched with sharp cheeses.

, The simple, high-acid Rose will add a nice finish to just about any meal, and getting one with bubbles will further help cleanse the palate, no matter what you're chomping on. While Rose often gets a bad rap, it is completely unfounded. Eminently drinkable with or without food, this is a great wine to grab for a large group or if you're unsure about the meal pairing."

Try a simple mixed drink.,
Make a mojito.,
Get fruity with a daiquiri.,
Try a more complex Mai Tai.",How to Serve Rum1," Mix rum with just one other beverage, such as a soda. This is an easy way to enjoy any quality of rum. It’s also a drink that can be made at virtually any bar.


Go for the classic Rum and Coke by starting with approximately two ounces of light or dark rum and adding a dark cola to taste. Pour over ice and serve.
Try a spicier mixed drink, called a Dark n’ Stormy, by pouring dark rum (traditionally Gosling’s Black Seal Rum) over ice and ginger beer (a strong ginger soda). Drizzle the rum slowly over a spoon into the glass to create the cloudy look that illustrates the name. Top with a lime wedge and serve.;
, Try a classic rum cocktail, the mojito. Use light rum, mint leaves, lime, sugar, and club soda for this refreshing drink.


Put several wedges of lime and fresh mint leaves into a glass and muddle them to release their flavors if you wish. Add ice and two ounces of light rum. Fill the rest of the glass with club soda, then stir in sugar to taste.Try adding other fruit flavors to a mojito, like strawberry or pineapple, by adding either the fresh fruit or juice.

, Make a daiquiri by mixing light rum with fresh lime juice and simple syrup (sugar boiled into a syrup consistency). This drink typically uses nearly any combination of fruit juices with the basic ingredients.


Build on the basic recipe of 2 ounces light rum, ¾ ounce of fresh lime juice, and ¼ ounce simple syrup with fruits like banana, strawberry, pineapple, etc.
Make any daiquiri on the rocks (with ice), or typically find them frozen (blended).
Line the rim of a glass with brown sugar and a fresh wedge of whatever fruit you use for a common daiquiri presentation.

, Make a Mai Tai by using a few more specialty ingredients than other rum cocktails. Use orgeat—a high-quality almond sugar syrup—and orange curacao—a liqueur from a dried citrus peel—to make this refreshing drink.Combine 2 ounces of dark rum with ¾ ounce lime juice, ¼ ounce simple syrup, ½ ounce orange curacao, and ¼ ounce orgeat and pour over ice. Top with a lime wedge and a mint leaf.
If you don’t have the specialty ingredients for this cocktail on hand, you can substitute cheaper almond syrup for orgeat and triple sec for orange curacao."

Distinguish between the most popular white wines.,
Select a full-bodied wine to drink with chicken.,
Choose a Chardonnay wine to pair with cheese.,
Select a medium-bodied wine for grilled fish.,
Pair a Riesling with spicy dishes.,
Note the region from which the wine comes.,
Learn the grape variety in each white wine.,
Check the alcohol percentage.,
Take note of each wine's acidity.,
Check the year the wine was made.",How to Choose a Sweet White Wine," These are typically the sweet white wines that you will have to choose from, with various brands represented from each category. Refer to the list below to start eliminating tastes that are not of interest to you:Chardonnay – Fruity and smooth-tasting. Chardonnay often features flavors of green apple, citrus, pineapple, and papaya.
Pinot Grigio – Lighter and more dry than Chardonnay. Pinot Grigio is flavored with the taste of citrus, fresh pear, and melon.
Riesling – Usually sweet, with fruity flavors. It is typically more bitter than Moscato.
Moscato – Arguably the sweetest white wine, being a lighter-bodied white. It can act as a great accompaniment to brunch or to fruit-themed desserts. Fresh floral, ripe stone fruit, and exotic spice stand out as flavors in this wine.Sauvignon blanc – More dry than Chardonnay and very acidic. It includes tropical flavors.;
, Wines such as Chardonnay or Chenin Blanc work best for chicken pairings, since they are full-bodied selections. 'Body' refers to the perceived “weight” and viscosity of the sweet white wine. A full-bodied wine feels thick, coating the sides of a glass as you swirl it, while a light-bodied wine will behave almost like water., Consider the type of cheese for any cheese and wine pairings. For creamy soft brie or camembert, try Champagne, Chardonnay, or dry Riesling. If you're having strong goat cheese, pair with Sancerre, Sauvignon Blanc, or Pouilly-Fume. Smoked cheese is best paired with Gewurztraminer, Sauternes, or Shiraz. For blue cheese, try Sauternes, Banyuls, Port, Late harvest wines, Madeira, or Amarone., For fish pairings, your best bet is to use a light to medium-bodied white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc, Vinho Verde, or Chablis. White wine is ideal to be paired with fish, so you cannot really go wrong in your selection., For spicy foods, try a wine with a low alcohol content. This will allow the beverage to be more refreshing, and less harmful as you may be drinking more of it to counteract the spiciness. Try out Riesling or Gewurztraminer.

, The label will list the region where the wine was made, and this can help inform your decision. Learn which grapes are grown in various regions to get a better idea of which wine you'd prefer.The only way to know for sure whether or not you will like a sweet white wine is to try it. Go to a wine tasting event to try a lot of wines at once, or simply ask for recommendations at your local liquor store., Many wine labels include the grape type that was used to create the wine. This can help you to choose wine that is sweeter and more suited to your taste.Varietal wines are named after the primary grape variety that the wine was made from. Merlot, for instance, contains mostly Merlot grapes.Chardonnay uses chardonnay grapes from Burgundy. The grape flavor is similar to that of a green apple and makes for a crisp tasting wine.The Riesling grape can produce such a wide range of aromas, and is grown in northern Europe, and in parts of Australia and New Zealand. They have a sweet, sugary taste to them., Some wines contain a higher percentage of alcohol than others. This will always be listed on the wine’s label, so carefully compare these before purchasing.White wines tend to have one of two extremes: they are either very low in alcohol content, such as a German Riesling (Kabinett, Spatlese and Auslese), or very high, such as an Australian Chardonnay or white Sherry., Acidity in white wines allows them to be refreshing. However, a high acidity can taste sour and a lower acidity can make a wine taste saturated with fat. Wines that are associated with high levels of acidity include New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Champagne, Loire Valley wines, such as Sancerre and Vouvray.


White wines tend to be more acidic than reds. Cooler growing climates produce wines higher in tartaric and malic acid.A wine high in acidity that also emphasizes its flavor of sweetness will seem less acidic. A sweet white wine could thus be high in acidity without tasting sour.

, The year of the wine is typically boasted on the front of the label, especially if it is a vintage selection. Wine is known to grow more potent as it ages, so select the wine that has an older date for better quality."

Pour about one ounce (30ml) of absinthe into a glass.,
Lay a flat, perforated absinthe spoon across the rim of the glass, and place a single cube of sugar on the perforated area of the spoon.,
Drip very pure ice cold water into the absinthe from a small pitcher.,
Stir the drink with the absinthe spoon after the water has been added.",How to Prepare Absinthe1," There are various types of glasses that can be used, some of antique or historical design and others of more modern design. French absinthe glasses, such as reservoir pontarlier glasses, are quite suitable for the French absinthe ritual. Different styles of reservoir glasses are available, but every style will have a distinct or bulbous bottom area that indicates the amount of absinthe that is to be initially poured.;
, This is customary but is not necessary. The sugar is traditionally used to balance the bitter taste of the wormwood.

, This very slow and gradual addition of the water forms the heart of the absinthe ritual, and is done with or without the sugar. When using sugar, the cold water is dripped over the sugar and into the drink, causing the sugar to slowly dissolve into the absinthe. Very high quality absinthe can be expertly experienced simply with the ice cold water.
• Three or four ounces of water are added per ounce of absinthe.
• Ice cubes can be added to the pitcher of water if desired, but be sure that they don't fall into the glass of absinthe.
• As the water is added to the absinthe, the absinthe should gradually louche.
• Absinthe fountains were traditionally used to drip the ice cold water into absinthe drinks.
• Brouilleur devices can also be used to automatically drip the water into individual glasses. The brouilleur is placed over the glass, and water, ice cubes, or ice water (as well as sugar if desired) is added to it. The water will gradually drip through the brouilleur into the absinthe. The brouilleur is removed before drinking the prepared absinthe.

, Two or three ice cubes can be added to the finished drink, but this practice may be frowned upon by absinthe purists.

Buy a high-quality rum.,
Sip rum slowly.,
Try special rhum agricole or cachaça.",How to Serve Rum2," Stick to a quality “sipping rum” to enjoy it neat, meaning at room temperature with no other additions. Look for bottles sourced from the Bahamas and Latin American countries for more traditional varieties.


Look for higher quality in light rum by avoiding flavored or “over proofed” varieties, like Bacardi 151. This type of liquor has 75% ABV or higher, rather than the typical 40% ABV.
Look for higher quality in gold rum by avoiding brands that color the rum artificially to achieve the traditional amber color. While alcohol companies aren’t required to list ingredients, you can generally count on more expensive brands for rum that isn’t dyed.
Look for higher quality in dark rum by buying a more expensive variety. For spiced rum, avoid cheaper brands that simply dye light rum darker. You want gold or even dark rum that is infused with spices like anise, cinnamon, pepper, and rosemary., Pour rum for sipping into a small glass. Warm the glass in your hands and sip slowly to enjoy the full flavor.


Smell the aromas of the rum from a distance so you don’t hurt your nose, and take small sips to let the flavor access all parts of your tongue.Drink sipping rum at room temperature, or on the rocks if you wish.

, Look for specialty alternatives to traditional rum for a new experience. Rhum agricole and cachaça use only fresh-pressed juice from sugar cane.These specialized, “pure” forms of rum are considered such because they use the fresh sugar cane juice rather than molasses and use little to no other ingredients in processing.
Try rhum agricole or cachaça neat to experience the full flavor. Cachaça is also typically used in a Caipirinha, a cocktail popular in Brazil, where cachaça is the national liquor."

Determine how you'd like to store the vodka.,
Try to store the bottle upright.,
Find somewhere with a consistent temperature.,
Use the freezer if you want chilled vodka.,
Consider the lighting.",How to Store Vodka1," You'll need to find a convenient dry place to store your vodka if you'll be using it frequently. If you're considering long-term storage, the place you choose doesn't necessarily need to be convenient. Decide if you want to store the vodka along with other liquors or if you only need space to store a bottle or two. Popular ways to store vodka include:A shelf or cupboard in your kitchen
A liquor cabinet
A small or full bar;
, When you've decided where to put the vodka, check to see if you can store the bottle so that it stands upright. If you have to store the vodka bottle on its side, it's more likely to leak so think about storing it somewhere else.If your bottle of vodka is stopped with a cork, it's even more important to store it upright. If the vodka is on its side and comes into contact with the cork for a long time, the alcohol can slowly eat away at the cork and cause your bottle to leak.

, Regardless of if you're storing the vodka for short-term or long-term use, you should store it at a consistent temperature. The temperature shouldn't fluctuate throughout the day from hot to cold. Instead, aim for a constant temperature of 60 to 65°F unless you want to store it in the freezer.If you want to store the vodka for the long term, the basement is a good choice (unless it's right next to a boiler). Avoid storing in extremely hot areas like attics.

, Although alcohol will actually freeze at very low temperatures, your home freezer won't be able to get that cold. You can store vodka in your freezer if you'd like chilled vodka for drinks. Just realize that it will cause the vodka to seem thicker and may mute some of the flavor.Vodka that's been chilled and slightly thickens may actually be better for drinking since it fully coats your mouth., Avoid storing your vodka in direct sunlight, especially if it's in a clear bottle. Not only will sunlight speed up evaporation once the bottle is opened, but it can change the taste of the vodka if it's stored in sunlight for a very long time. For the best storage, keep your vodka in a dark place.If you're storing your vodka (and any other liquors or wine) in a dark place, make sure you have good lighting when you need it. This way, you'll be able to turn on the light and see your collection.
If you have to store the bottle in some sunlight, wrap the bottle in black cloth. This will minimize the amount of light reaching the vodka.

"
"
Keep the bottle sealed for as long as you can.,
Check the seal on your bottle.,
Consider transferring opened vodka.,
Keep vodka in a flask for a very short term.",How to Store Vodka2," An unopened bottle of vodka can be stored indefinitely. Because of this, you should wait to open a bottle until you're actually ready to start drinking it. The alcohol in the vodka starts to slowly evaporate once the seal is broken and the bottle is opened.It will take several decades before the opened vodka becomes undrinkable because of alcohol.

, If your vodka is sealed with a cork, make sure the cork is firmly in place since a loose seal could speed up evaporation. If your bottle has a screw top like a cap, make sure it is tightly closed.If the cork or screw top doesn't seem like it will be secure, you may want to store your vodka in a different bottle or container.

, If you've opened a bottle of vodka and decided that you want to store it for a prolonged period of time, transfer the remainder of the bottle to a new clean bottle. The new bottle should be small enough that the rest of the vodka fills the bottle and leaves very little room for air in the bottle.If you continue to store small amounts of vodka in a large and mostly empty bottle of vodka, the vodka is exposed to more and more air. Transferring vodka to a smaller container will slow down oxidation and evaporation.

, If you'd like to take vodka with you when you're out and about, store vodka in a flask. Most flasks come with small funnels so you can easily transfer the vodka to the flask. Just be sure to use the vodka or remove it within 3 days since prolonged exposure to the metal in the flask can make your vodka taste metallic.When you've emptied the vodka, rinse out your flask and let it air dry.

"
"
Check the vodka before drinking it again.,
Go through your alcohol cabinet.,
Keep beyond the reach of children.,
Monitor how much alcohol you have.",How to Store Vodka3," Chances are your bottle of unopened vodka is fine to drink after storing it for an extended period of time. If you've already opened the bottle and it's been a long time since you drank it, check the vodka before mixing up a drink. Throw out the vodka if:If you notice a strange smell
If it has an unusual or noticeably bad taste
If it looks different (cloudy or simply looks different than when you bought it)

, Pure vodka will last for years if stored properly. But if you have vodka that's flavored with natural ingredients, you should be checking it periodically to make sure it's not going bad. It's a good idea to clean through your entire liquor cabinet every 6 months or so. This will encourage you to use up alcohol that has a limited shelf life or throw out alcohol that's no longer good.Liquors with dairy or natural flavorings often have an expiration date listed on the bottle. Some of these may even benefit from being stored in the refrigerator instead of in the cabinet.

, If you have young children in your house, you should take extra care to make sure your vodka is out of their reach. Although your children might not go looking for your alcohol, young children are curious and may find it. To prevent accidents, keep alcohol in a high up place and lock the storage container or liquor cabinet.Even if you trust your older children, locking the liquor cabinet is a good idea. If your teen is being pressured by a friend to take your alcohol, a locked cabinet gives your child a good excuse for not giving in to the pressure.

, If you have teenagers in your house, you should be monitoring how much alcohol you have on hand. While you should be able to trust your children, studies suggest that monitoring alcohol in the household sends a message to your children that underage drinking is not acceptable. To monitor alcohol in your house, try:Marking the sides of liquor bottles to track the levels
Writing down how many bottles of each alcohol you have
Making note of when you open a bottle of spirits or liquor

The narrower shape at the top concentrates the aromas for sniffing, while the wide bottom allows you to swirl the whisky before you sip it.A snifter glass is the best option for whisky tastings.;
, Tasting the whisky in a stemmed glass prevents the heat of your hand from warming it. The stem also creates distance between your hand and the whisky so odors from your skin don’t interfere with its aroma.Many snifters have stems, but you can substitute a wine glass if you don’t have a snifter.

, If the bowl of the glass is extremely deep, you won’t be able to get a true sense of the whisky’s aromas. That’s because the heaviest of the volatile compounds that make up the whisky won’t be able to rise to the top of the glass., Whisky can taste different when it’s chilled, so it’s best to taste it a more moderate temperature first. Taste the whisky when it’s between 64° and 72°F (18° and 22°C) to get the truest sense of its flavor., You may be tempted to fill your glass to the brim, but you don’t want to be overwhelmed. Pour ¾ to 1 ½ ounces (2 to 4 centilitres) so you have just enough to smell and taste the whisky., Once you’ve poured the whisky, roll the glass sideways in a complete circle. That will evenly distribute the whisky throughout the glass and coat the inner surface of the glass’ bowl, which helps draw out the aromas that are at the bottom., Before sipping or even smelling the whisky, hold the glass up to eye level. The whisky’s color can help indicate its age or what type of cask was used to age it, so try to determine what shade you see.Most whiskies are a yellow, gold, or amber shade, though you may observe some orange or peach tones as well.
In most cases, the darker that the whisky is, the longer that it’s been aged.

, Tilt the glass around again to move the whisky throughout the glass. Check out the way it moves down the sides of the glass; the streaks that it makes are known as its legs, which help indicate how thick the whisky is. A whisky with thick legs typically has a more pleasant feel in the mouth.A whisky with a more pleasant feel in the mouth typically has smooth, creamy texture.

, Place the palm of your hand over the top of the glass, and agitate it slightly to create bubbles. Pay attention to how long it takes for the bubbles to disappear; the longer it takes for the bubbles to go away, the higher the whisky’s alcohol by volume (abv) is., Since your senses of smell and taste are so closely linked, you should smell the whisky before you sip it. Bring the glass up directly beneath your nose and allow the aromas to drift up. Don’t breathe in deeply; let the scents come to you.The initial scent of the whisky will have a strong alcohol scent.
By letting the whisky’s aroma drift up to you, you give your nose time to adjust to the amount of alcohol in it. Otherwise, your nose may feel like it’s burning.

, After you’ve gotten an initial sense of the aroma, tilt the glass on its side so it’s parallel with the floor. Be careful not to spill any of the whisky, and raise the glass up in a straight line while you smell it. You should be able to take in the aromas of the heavier compounds that are usually at the bottom of the glass.The heavier compounds in the whisky typically have woody, smoky, and earthy aromas.

, With the glass still parallel to your face, move it down so your nose is about ½-inch (1-cm) above its rim. Smell the whisky again, paying attention to the lighter notes in its scent.The lighter compounds in the whisky often have floral or sour aromas.

, When you have a good sense of the whisky’s scent, it’s time to taste it. Start with a small sip. Keep your lips puckered in an “O” shape, and slide your tongue against your lips to move the whisky around.The first few times that you try this technique, it may make you feel like gagging. That's usually due to how strong the whisky is -- the burning sensation that it provides can make you cough, which can trigger your gag reflex.
Don’t try to look for any particular flavors; just see what notes you detect.

, After your initial taste, move the whisky back and forth in your mouth like you are gargling with it. Don’t do it too quickly or you may not be able to pick up all of the whisky’s flavors.Overall, you should hold the whisky in your mouth for about 30 seconds before you swallow it to really take in all of its flavors.
You'll likely taste woodsy and spicy flavors when you first take in the flavor. Depending on the type of whisky, you may also taste hints of citrus, nuttiness, caramel, and other flavors.

, Once you’ve moved the whisky around a little and have gotten a good taste of it, you can swallow it down. The burning feeling that you experience as it goes down is known as the finish. Try to notice exactly how it feels -- it could be short, long, mellow, or unpleasant, depending on your alcohol tolerance.A short finish doesn't linger long in the mouth so the flavor disappears quickly.
A long finish lingers in the mouth so the flavor stays with you after you swallow the whisky.
A mellow finish has a smooth, pleasant flavor.
An unpleasant finish may have a bitter flavor or burn as it goes down.

, After you’ve tasted the whisky neat, it’s a good idea to add a little water. That helps open up the whisky so you can pick up more of its flavors. Be sure to use room temperature water, though, so differences in temperature don’t affect the whisky’s taste.Mix still or flat water into your whisky, not carbonated or sparkling.

, It’s important not to add too much water to the whisky at once or you may alter its aroma and taste. Use a pipette or a straw to add just one drop at a time so you don’t wind up diluting the whisky rather than opening it up.If you don’t have a pipette or straw, you can use the cap from your bottle of water to add a small amount at a time.
If you don’t feel like you’re picking up any new aroma or flavors from the whisky after adding a drop of water, you can add another.

, Once the water is added to the whisky, smell it once more. See if you can pick up any different aromas that you didn’t earlier. Next, sip the whisky in the same fashion you did earlier and look for any changes in the flavor.Adding the water to the whisky can help bring out subtle flavors that you didn't pick up when it was neat. For example, you may be able to taste citrus notes or a nutty flavor that you didn't detect at first tasting.
The water can also help tone down the alcohol taste of the whisky, so if it had an unpleasant finish, you may find that you like it better with the water.

Add a garnish.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make a Gin and Juice Drink1," As a general rule, you should use about 5 oz (150 ml) of juice per 1.5 to 2 oz (45 to 60 ml) of gin. The type of juice you use is really up to you, but tart juices are more commonly used than sweet juices.


For a milder taste, consider using pineapple juice, orange juice, pomegranate juice, cherry juice, or grape juice.
For a slightly stronger taste, consider grapefruit juice or cranberry juice.
You can also combine juices as long as the ratio of gin to juice remains the same. Try mixing grapefruit juice and orange juice, cranberry and grape, or another of your favorite juice combinations.Strong citrus fruits, like lemon and lime, can also be mixed with gin but are generally combined with other ingredients, like syrup or soda water, to dilute the sourness.;
, Secure the lid on the container and shake it using a vigorous up and down motion away from your face and away from anyone else. Shake it for at least 15 seconds to mix the ingredients completely.

, To chill the glass, store it inside the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes before using it. Fill the glass at least halfway full with ice.

, Release the lid and pour the contents of the mixture over the ice.

, A slice of citrus fruit, like lemon or lime, works well depending on the juices in your drink. You could also float a small sprig of mint on top of the drink.

",How to Make a Daiquiri," Some people like to fill it with ice and soda water. The soda water removes any oils and dirt that may be lingering on your glass. It also helps the ice chill the glass faster. Move your Martini glass to the side for the time being. It will be sufficiently chilled by the time you are ready to use it.;
, Depending on the style of shaker you have, you can cover it with either the cover that came with it or just use a 16 oz glass to cover it.

, Shake either 10 times or until water condensates on the outside of the shaker. Rum doesn't bruise the way gin does, so don't worry about shaking it too much. However, you don't want to melt all the ice into the drink, so 10 times should be enough.

,, Many people prefer a Julep strainer because it's less complicated than a Hawthorn strainer. Both have their merits!

Experiment with different garnishes.",How to Make a Gin Martini," To mix this drink you will need a chilled cocktail shaker, a chilled cocktail glass, a cocktail spoon, a cocktail strainer, a jigger, chilled gin, chilled vermouth, plenty of ice, and an olive.


Measure out 4 small jiggers of gin.
Measure out 1 small jigger of vermouth.;
, Place the ice in first and then add the vermouth. Swirl the vermouth around to coat the ice cubes and the shaker. Pour in the gin.Leave the olive out, and add it once you have poured the drink into the serving glass.
If you want your martini to be extra dry, pour out the excess vermouth using a strainer before adding the gin.

, Stir the drink for about 60 seconds so that the drink will be chilled sufficiently, diluted properly, and mixed thoroughly., Using a strainer to keep the ice in the shaker, pour the drink carefully into the serving glass., You can place the olive on a cocktail toothpick, or you can just drop it directly in the martini. Serve the drink immediately., There are many combinations of vermouth and gin you can use to make your martini. Different combinations will lead to different results. Vermouth comes in a sweet version (known as Italian Vermouth) and a dry version (known as French Vermouth). Most classic gin martini recipes will call for dry (French) vermouth, but it is OK to experiment with sweeter vermouth.Keep in mind that using a dry vermouth does not make the martini a “dry martini,” this refers to the amount of vermouth used in the cocktail not the type of vermouth being used.
A good rule of thumb is to simply stick to high quality ingredients. When purchasing gin, don’t just purchase the cheapest gin you can find. If you’re going to make good cocktails you will need good ingredients.

, Martinis are meant to be nice and cold so you should do everything you can to help get it as cold as you can. To help with this you can place your cocktail shaker and your serving glass in the freezer for 10-20 minutes.


Keep your serving glass in the freezer while you mix your martini.
Make sure that the vermouth is chilled in the refrigerator, and that you get your gin as cold as possible by storing it in the freezer.

, A garnish is something that is added to a food dish or a drink just before serving.The purpose of garnish in a gin martini is to add a little extra flavor to the drink. Common garnishes for a gin martini are a lemon twist, an olive, or a few cocktail onions on a toothpick. Which one you choose is a matter of personal preference, but some would say that an olive is the classic addition.If you use cocktail onions, it is recommended to use frozen ones as they help keep the drink colder and lends a better flavor to the drink.
If you choose to use an olive, don’t use olives that are packed in oil. This will create a gross oily layer on the top of the drink. It is probably also best to use an olive that is de-seeded, and not stuffed with anything (e.g. pimientos, cheese, garlic).

, When making your martini, you’ll want to use lots of ice. Don’t leave the ice sitting out while you gather all of your ingredients together, as this will result in ice that is already melting (and will dilute the drink too much). Instead, keep the ice in the freezer until after you have measured out all your ingredients, then add it to the shaker, and quickly add all of the ingredients.Lots of ice will cool the drink quickly without diluting it too much.
Don’t be stingy with the ice. If you don’t use enough ice your martini won’t be nice and cold, as it is supposed to be.

, Although you can serve up your martini in any kind of glass you want, doing it properly requires that your martini be served in a martini glass, which is a v-shaped glass with a long stem (like that of a wine glass)., Whether your martini is wet or dry simply refers to the amount of vermouth you are using in the drink. A dry martini will have about 4 parts gin to 1 part vermouth. If you want to make a wet martini you can add 4 parts gin and 2 parts vermouth or more.In the past, a martini used to be made with equal parts gin and vermouth. Today, this is typically called a fifty-fifty.
Experiment with different ratios. Although some gin martini connoisseurs may have strong opinions about ratios, you should make a cocktail that tastes good to you. If you are making a drink for someone else, and you don’t know what they like, then stick to the classic 4 to 1 ratio.

, Using a jigger will help you get the ratio of gin to vermouth right, which will improve the taste of the drink. If you are making a classic dry martini you will want to use 4 parts gin. This means that you could fill up the big or small half of the jigger 4 times (you will have added 1 jigger of vermouth). Pour it over the ice and vermouth.If 4 jiggers is too much for your drink, you can cut this amount in half. For example, you could do 2 jiggers and then half of a jigger full of vermouth.
If you want to measure your ingredients in ounces, for a dry martini, you could also use 2 ounces of gin and only use the vermouth to “rinse” the ice cubes and shaker.

, This is completely optional, but some people like to make their gin martinis “dirty” by adding the brine that comes from soaking olives.To make a dirty martini, you will use as much olive brine as you would vermouth. If you are using the 4 to 1 ratio you would add 4 parts gin, 1/2 part vermouth and 1/2 a part olive brine.
The more olive brine you add the dirtier your martini becomes.

, Stirring does three things for a cocktail: it blends the ingredients together, it chills the drink, and it helps to dilute the drink properly (by helping the ice melt a bit). Therefore, it is important to stir the drink with the right tools using the right technique.Hold the spoon between your thumb index and middle finger of your dominant hand.
Insert the spoon into the drink all the way (until it touches the bottom of the shaker) and use your wrist to rotate the spoon around the glass.
Stir for about 60 seconds. If you are holding the spoon correctly, it will be moving around in the glass, but will also be rotating on it’s axis between your fingers.
You could also shake the martini, which will cool the drink faster and produce a cloudy-colored drink, but most connoisseurs believe this is not how a martini should be made.

, If you are using an olive, you can stick the olive on a cocktail toothpick and place it in the drink or you can just drop the olive right in. If you use a lemon twist, run the twist around the rim before balancing it on the rim of the glass. If using pickled cocktail onions, you can place one or two frozen ones on a cocktail toothpick and place it in the drink.To make a lemon twist, cut a lemon in half using a sharp knife, and then cut off a thin slice from the middle (where the lemon is largest), remove the pulp from the peel of this slice, and cut through the peel so that the lemon peel is no longer a complete circle. Twist the lemon into a curly-q shape."

Strain and serve your cocktail.",How to Make a Pomegranate Martini1," Combine 1/2 cup (113 g) of granulated sugar with 1/2 cup (115 ml) of water in a small saucepan. Turn the heat to low and cook the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Turn off the heat and refrigerate the syrup until it cools.You won't need all of the simple syrup to make one pomegranate martini. Store the remaining simple syrup in the refrigerator for other drink or recipes. The syrup will keep 1 to 2 weeks in an airtight container in the refrigerator.;
, This recipe will make a single pomegranate martini. Place your martini glass in the freezer to chill while you shake up the cocktail.If you think you'll make more than one pomegranate martini, consider chilling extra glasses in the freezer to have on hand.

, Carefully, cut 1 lemon in half. Use a citrus reamer or juicer machine to juice the lemon. You'll only need to end up with 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) of lemon juice for one drink. You can use bottled lemon juice, but the flavor won't be as intense.Keep the squeezed lemon half for preparing the rim of your martini glass.

, If you want to add a little salty or sweet flavor to your cocktail, salt or sugar the rim. Place a few tablespoons of sugar or kosher salt in a wide shallow bowl or plate. Run the piece of squeezed lemon around the rim of your chilled martini glass. Dip the rim into the sugar or salt.The lemon juice helps the sugar or salt stick to the rim of the glass.

, Measure out 1 tablespoon of your squeezed lemon juice and add it to a cocktail shaker. You should also add 2 ounces (60 ml) of citrus-flavored vodka and 1/4 of an ounce (1/2 tablespoon) of pomegranate juice to the shaker. Fill the shaker with ice.Avoid letting the Ingredients sit in the ice for very long since this could dilute your cocktail.

, Cover the cocktail shaker and shake it vigorously. The outside of the cocktail shaker should become cold and frosty once the cocktail is shaken well enough.


If you have a small cocktail shaker, make sure you don't overfill it. You may need to split the cocktail in two to shake it if you have a very small cocktail shaker.

, Pour or strain your pomegranate martini into your prepared and chilled martini glass. The cocktail should come to the very top of your martini glass and it will be bright pink in color.Try garnishing your pomegranate martini with a slice of lemon or orange.

, Carefully, cut 3 limes in half. Use a citrus reamer or juicer machine to juice about 3 limes. You need to end up with 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of lime juice.You can use bottled lime juice, but the flavor won't be as intense.

, Put your lime juice along with the other cocktail ingredients into a large pitcher. Stir them and refrigerate the cocktail mixture until you're ready to mix up the drinks to serve. Place these ingredients in your pitcher with the lime juice:2 cups (16 ounces) of vodka
1 cup (8 ounces) of orange liqueur
1 cup (8 ounces) of pomegranate juice

, Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and fill the cocktail shaker halfway with your Cosmo-pomegranate mixture. Cover the cocktail shaker and shake it vigorously.

Next, pour the liquid ingredients over the ice. There are countless variations on the ingredient list of a basic Rum Runner - we've provided just a few in this article (see recipes above).


The Original Rum Runner is just what it sounds like - classic Rum Runner goodness. A delicious tropical staple drink.
The Fancy Rum Runner is all the rage among the smarter set. With highbrow ingredients like blackberry brandy and spiced rum, this drink is a cut above the rest.
The Basic Rum Runner is for the partygoer who wants a no-frills drink. With common, affordable ingredients, this variation delivers refreshment on a budget.
The Islamorada Rum Runner, named for the drink's town of origin, is a drink for those with a sweet tooth. Mostly sweet-and-sour mix by volume, this drink goes down smooth.
The Holiday Isle Rum Runner is extra-tasty and extra-strong. Incorporating 151-proof rum into the drink, this variation offers tropical flavor with a kick.;
, Run the blender until the liquid ingredients and ice are blended to a smooth, ""slushy"" consistency. Try to avoid having large ice chunks.

, Traditionally, Rum Runners are served in Hurricane glasses, but if you don't have one, any sort of glass will work. Garnish with an orange slice or lemon slice.

, One popular Rum Runner tradition is to add a thin layer of Bacardi 151 on top of the drink. This highly alcoholic liquor floats above the blended ingredients and gives the drink a fiery initial ""kick"". To add a Bacardi ""floater"", carefully pour 1 oz (30 mL) of Bacardi 151 over the top of the finished drink.


Try not to pour the liquor all at once - it'll ""break through"" the top of the blended ingredients and give the entire drink a strong taste.

"

Fill a glass with ice.,
Add the liquid ingredients.,
Serve.,
Optionally, add a Bacardi 151 floater.",How to Make a Rum Runner2," Toss a handful of ice cubes in a Hurricane glass - the more ice, the colder the drink. If you don't have a Hurricane glass, any sort of cocktail glass will work. Old Fashioned glasses look particularly great.

, Add the liquid ingredients in sequence, pouring them over the ice. Gently mix the ingredients to combine. Alternatively, add the ice and and liquid ingredients to a cocktail shaker, shake to combine, and pour into the glass. Again, there are countless variations on the ingredients in a Rum Runner - the recipes at the top of this article represent just a few possibilities. As a reminder, the recipes in this article are:


Original
Fancy
Basic
Islamorada
Holiday Isle

, Garnish with orange or lemon slice and serve with a straw.

, Like with the frozen version of the Rum Runner, it's not uncommon to add a Bacardi floater to the Rum Runner on the rocks. Do so in the same way - pour 1 oz (30 mL) of Bacardi 151 over the top of the completed drink.


Note that because the ""on the rocks"" version of the Rum Runner is liquid, rather than slushy, the Bacardi 151 will mix with the cocktail itself somewhat. If you don't want this, try pouring the Bacardi into the straw - this ensures that the first thing you taste is the Bacardi by itself and ensures that the Bacardi doesn't mix with the rest of the drink.

The vanilla bean is optional but it really does add an extra delicious taste to the drink. You can also use ordinary rum instead of white rum. If you want a creamier taste, you can use cream of coconut instead of coconut milk.


If you want to make the drink virgin, then replace the rum with a cup of cold coconut or ice.;
, Start by putting the evaporated milk, condensed milk, and coconut milk in a blender. Blend them together for about a minute, and then add the rum, cinnamon, and vanilla. If your blender isn't large enough, you can also blend the ingredients together in batches.

, Pour the ingredients into an ordinary pitcher or even some glass bottles. Whatever you use, make sure that it has a lid and is fully covered. You can even stick with the blender you were using. Just like revenge, Coquito is best served cold! Some people even refrigerate it overnight, but giving it at least two hours should do the trick too.


Add the cinnamon sticks and halved vanilla bean to the mixture before you refrigerate it.

, This will help blend the ingredients a bit more.

, Pour this drink into small glasses and serve the tasty drink garnished with a bit of cinnamon and a cinnamon stick or just on the rocks. You can keep the leftovers in the fridge for about a week, but if you make Coquito right, there won't be any leftovers! This recipe will serve about five 8 oz. bottles.


If you like the drink but want to make it less potent, you can replace some of the rum with ice, coconut milk, or even whole milk.

You can also fill a cocktail shaker and pour into a glass later, but by pouring your ingredients directly in the glass you can be sure you have the right amount to fill the cup.;
, To keep track, bartenders use a ""count system."" 1/2 ounce equals a ""two count"" (start pouring, count ""1,2,"" and then stop). The slower your count, the stronger the drink. You can also use a shot glass for measurements -- 1 shot equals 1.5 ounces.


Feel free to mix and match different rums (light, dark, coconut, 151 proof, etc.)-- you want a total of 1-1.5 ounces of rum total.

, Most bartenders use banana liquor, but some use cherry or coffee as well. To measure an ounce, use a 4 count (""1,2,3,4,"" then stop pouring).

, Pineapple is used in almost every Bahama recipe, and orange juice is common as well. Fruit juices are generally a 4 count, but some bartenders just add them to the top of the glass after the alcohol is poured.


Bahama Mamas are usually contain 1 part rum, 2-3 parts juice and liquor. That means you usually have two or three times as much juice as rum.

, Make sure to place it firmly so that it makes a seal. Ignore this step if you have been mixing the ingredients directly in your shaker.

, You do not need to mix for very long -- a quick 2-3 second shake should be enough.

, Garnish the top with a cherry, strawberry, and/or a slice of orange and enjoy!

If you don’t have a way to measure exact amounts, you can use a shot glass and keep the right proportions for each liquid.If you have a shaker with no lid, that’s okay, too. You’ll just need to use a large glass inverted into the shaker to mix the drink.
If you don’t have a shaker at all, consider using an empty water bottle to shake up the drink. You can also simply pour the ingredients into a glass and stir them together, but shaken is the preferred method.;
, Measure out 4 oz (120 ml) of pineapple juice. If you aren’t measuring exact amounts, then make it 4x the amount of orange juice. Pineapple juice is one of sweeter parts of the cocktail, so for a less sweet taste, reduce the amount.

, Measure the same amount that you used for the orange juice. Cream of coconut is not the same thing as coconut milk or coconut cream, so make sure you use the right thing.


If you need a substitute, you can use coconut syrup or sweetened condensed milk with coconut extract.

, The Painkiller is trademarked by Pusser’s, so if you have to use another brand of rum, it won’t technically be a Painkiller, but if you use dark rum the taste should be similar. This recipe calls for 2 oz (60 ml), but for a stronger drink you can add more rum., This is not a mandatory step, as some recommend it and others don’t. Adding ice to the shaker will cool the ingredients while you shake rather than waiting until you pour them into the glass of ice.


If you are stirring in a glass rather than using a shaker, don’t add the ice until you have mixed the drink up thoroughly. If you are mixing in a water bottle, ice probably won’t fit anyway.

, If you are using a shaker with an inverted glass, make sure you hold them together tightly so no liquid leaks out. Shake for 5-10 seconds.


If you don’t have a shaker, stir the drink in fast circles for the same amount of time.

, It’s recommended to use a Collins, a hurricane, or a highball glass, but really any glass will work. You can fill the glass full or only put half a glass of ice.

, As you pour, strain out the ice that was in the shaker. It usually works best to pour quickly so you avoid spilling the drink down the side of the shaker.

, You can use a grater to sprinkle some fresh nutmeg or you can use powdered nutmeg from a bottle. This is just to add a taste, so don’t go overboard.To finish the drink off, you can garnish with a wedge of pineapple or lime. Add a cocktail umbrella to add a festive look to the drink.

, The original Painkiller drink was created at this bar on Jost Van Dyke Island, British Virgin Islands. It’s been served at this island bar for over 40 years. The island is said to not have a dock, so you’ll have to swim out to have your drink., Mix all of the liquid ingredients as you would for the normal drink, but pour them into a blender with a few cups of ice. Blend for just long enough to crush all of the ice small enough to drink. Be sure to drink it slowly so you don’t get a brain freeze!

, If you are hosting a party with young ones present, this drink will be just as satisfying for them without the rum as it is for you! Mix up the orange juice, pineapple juice, and cream of coconut and pour them over ice."

",How to Make Martinis," Don't skimp; ice is a necessary component to chill and blend the other ingredients.






;
,, The amount and type of vermouth varies according to taste (from a splash to a shot). Some people like their martinis ""perfect""—that is, made with 50% red (also known as ""Italian"" or ""sweet"") and 50% white (also known as ""French"" or ""dry"") vermouth. Note: ""perfect"" in this context is a bit of cocktail terminology referring to the vermouth mixture, and is not a value judgement regarding the flavor of a martini made this way. In a similar vein, one could order e.g. a ""perfect"" Manhattan.









Optional: Shake and pour into glass. Roll vermouth in glass to form a film or coating then dump out. This will make for a drier martini.
If you are using vodka, you can use a cocktail shaker, or mix the martini by stirring. You can use the shaker bottom for mixing and stirring, if you'd like. Some people insist that gin should never be shaken, but rather always stirred to avoid ""bruising"" the gin. This is a personal preference. Try them both and see which you prefer!
Optional: Add 1 – 2 dashes of orange bitters. Be careful when adding bitters because a little goes a long way. You will be able to taste the difference by adding even 1 drop because it is highly concentrated. Start with less and add more if desired.

, Melted water from the ice is a necessary ingredient to a proper martini to mellow the ""burn"" off the alcohol.

Since the martini is three parts vodka and one part each apple schnapps and Cointreau, you could count out six seconds of vodka, then two of the other liquors for a simple ratio.


You can use any amount of liquid, as long as this 3-1-1 ratio stays consistent.
If you want a little extra flavor, squeeze in a touch of fresh lemon juice.;
, Shake for at least 5 seconds. The longer you shake, the colder the drink will get, but this may also start to water it down a bit. Most bartenders shake for 5-15 seconds.

, You can either freeze the glass ahead of time or fill it with ice water for 2-4 minutes before serving. Dump out the water, quickly dry, and pour into the chilled glass.The long stem of the martini glass is so your fingers don't have to touch much of the glass, keeping it cool.

, Note, however, that most martinis do not have ice in them. A cube of ice takes off some of the alcoholic bite of the drink but keeping it cool and slightly watering it down as it melts., Hook the slice on the rim of the glass, or simply drop it right in the drink to soak in the alcohol. Serve immediately, while still cold."

Drop your garnish of choice into the bottom of the glass, if desired.",How to Make an Apple Martini2," If you want a stronger drink, use ice cubes. The crushed ice will give the drink a slightly water, almost slushy-like texture that many people enjoy. However, a stronger drink needs less ice and less coolness, so cubes are a better bet., If you don't feel like measuring out the ratios, use a simple count. Pour one second of vodka, one of sour apple schnapps, and two seconds of apple juice. If you want more, simply keep the ratio the same and count for longer -- four seconds for juice, and two for the liquor, for example.


As long as the vodka-schnapps-apple juice ratio stays 1-1-2, you can add as much liquid as you want.

, This takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds. The longer you shake, the colder the drink will be. Note, however, that colder drinks tend to have less of the alcoholic bite that many people like in their drink., Keep your glasses in the freezer before using to ensure they are cold when the drinks are poured. If you forget to put the glass in the freezer, fill them with ice water for 3-4 minutes to get them cold quickly. Then pour out the water and pour in your drink.

, Not ""manly"" martini but not ""girly"" martini either, this half-breed resists characterization. Earthy, deep, well-rounded — an enigma in a glass.

, Pomegranate juice, the major component of grenadine, contributes to this martini's essential charm. Pink and lively, slightly acidic but positively fresh.

, Like a whirlwind of coffee, chocolate, and whipped cream, this drink satisfies more than an outsized craving. For anyone who's ever wished that the classic Italian dessert was pure — not partly — booze.

Place the martini glasses, the shaker or stir glass, and the bottle of gin in the freezer for at least a half hour.Classic martinis typically use gin, though some recipes replace it with vodka. You can use whichever option you prefer, but be sure to choose a high quality alcohol to ensure the best taste.;
, Hold a 1-inch (2.5 cm) or larger ice cube against the palm of your hand, and hit it with a metal spoon to crack it into large pieces. Crack enough ice to fill the chilled shaker glass.If you’re cracking the ice while the glasses, shaker, and alcohol are still chilling, make sure to place it in the freezer after cracking until you’re ready to use it.

, Lemon is a traditional garnish for classic martinis. Use a sharp knife to remove a 1-inch (2.5 cm) strip of the peel. Try to cut off as little of the white pith under the peel as possible.Olives are another traditional garnish for martinis, so you can substitute one or two olives for the lemon peel in your martini if you prefer.

, Once the glass shaker is chilled, fill it with the cracked ice. Pour 4 ounces (120 ml) of gin over the ice, and then add 1 ounce (30 ml) of dry vermouth.Dry vermouth is perishable so make sure that you store it in the refrigerator.

, When all of the ingredients are in the shaker, you can stir or shake them to ensure that they’re fully combined and chilled. Stir or shake the martini until the outside of the shaker becomes frosty, which should take at least 30 seconds.While famous fictional spy James Bond prefers his martinis “shaken, not stirred,” many mixologists prefer stirring because they feel shaking dilutes the drink and leaves it cloudy. You may want to try it both ways and see which you prefer.
Whether you stir or shake the martini, try to touch the outside of the shaker as little as possible so the mixture stays cold. When shaking, place your hands just on the top and bottom of the shaker.
If you’re stirring the martini, you’ll need to stir it approximately 50 times.

, When the martini is properly combined and chilled, use a Hawthorne strainer or a large slotted spoon to strain it into a chilled martini glass. Make sure that none of the ice makes its way into the glass., After you’ve strained the martini into the glass, twist the lemon strip that you cut over the glass to express the oils. Next, rub the peel along the rim of the glass.If you plan to use olives as a garnish in place of the lemon peel, place one or two on a toothpick to ready them.

, Once you’ve rubbed the lemon peel around the rim of the glass, make sure that it’s still twisted. Drop it into the martini so it floats in the drink.If you’re using olives instead, place the toothpick with them on it into the glass. They won’t float, so you may want to hook them on the rim.

, If there is any excess martini left in the shaker after you strain it for serving, strain the remainder into a regular glass. Place the glass in a bowl full of ice so it will remain chilled until you’re ready to drink or serve the rest.

While vodka martini's are much more common these days, there is no reason to stay tied to trends without trying out both drinks for yourself.


There are bartenders who swear by gin up and down the coast in place or vodka, and those who ardently defend vodka. The thing is-- they're both right, so try both!

, A shaken martini actually ""bruises"" the vodka or gin, chilling it for longer, mixing in the olive juice, and taking some of the flavor of alcohol out. But for a drink with a bit more ""umph"" in it, got for the stirred martin, James Bond be damned.

, Sour, herbal vermouth is, in some circles, essential for any martini. But a growing legion of bartenders is swearing off vermouth, believing it is a bit too strong of a flavor that detracts from the simple, classic flavors in the drink.


You can also cut the vermouth in half -- adding just a splash to get a little kick without overpowering the drink.
You might add a touch more olive juice in place of the vermouth., The higher quality the the olives, the better the martini. But even cheaper olives will be good if you pay attention to how much brine you're adding. Everyone's perfect ratio is different, so feel free to play around until you find yours."

, Fruit should be added next, so add the watermelon, blueberries, and cherries. As liquids go best nearest the bottom, try adding the cherries first as the jar will have some juice in it. This may help the drink mix faster., The amount of ice you add is optional. It is to cool off the drink and give it a chunkier texture. A cooler, chunkier drink will require more ice.

Fruit should stop getting stuck on the bottom and all the ingredients should be swirling together.

, Once things are blending, increase the speed to low. Blend the juice on low for 20 to 30 seconds.

",How to Make Ron Ron Juice3," A powerful blender can mix ingredients more easily. If you're working with a small blender, without a lot of different speed settings, cut your fruit into very small pieces. This can help your juice mix smoothly even if your blender is on the weak side., Even strong blenders sometimes slow down, especially when dealing with ingredients like fruit. If your blender is stalling, turn it off. Then, use a spoon to push the ingredients around. This should loosen things up and get your blender working again., The longer you let a blender sit with dirty ingredients, the harder it will be to clean.

The Kahlua can be poured before the vodka, but even when the Kahlua is poured second it will sink to the bottom of the glass because it is heavier than the vodka.

, The drink is usually not stirred after adding the half and half or milk, as the alcoholic ingredients, especially the Kahlua, should rest on the bottom of the glass. The dark Kahlua should be evident on the bottom of the glass, and contrast with the milk. The vodka will not be apparent, as it is clear, and it will mix some with the milk.

Gently close the participant’s mouth.",How to Make a Tequila Popper2," There are some resorts in Mexico that serve tequila poppers (sometimes called Tijuana poppers), which are different in that they are poured and served directly in the participant’s mouth, and they often use beer instead of soda.


For Mexican tequila poppers, you will need a bottle of tequila (preferably with a measuring spout on it), as well as a bottle of beer, such as Corona, that’s been opened.
In Mexico, the server will continually blow a whistle while serving this drink.

, This drink can get pretty messy, so it’s a good idea to take a few precautions.Have the participant tilt his or her head back, mouth open.

, To prevent excessive consumption, measure out either a quarter, half, or full ounce directly into the mouth of the participant. Tell the participant not to swallow.

, To get the same fizzy effect as the lemon-lime soda, cover the top of the beer bottle with your thumb or finger and shake the beer.Carefully direct the opening of the bottle into the participant’s mouth and slightly move your thumb to the side to allow a spray of beer into the mouth.


Don’t spray in too much or the participant could choke, and don’t spray it directly down the throat.
Instead of pre-fizzing the beer, some resorts will pour the beer into the participant’s mouth, hold the mouth closed, and then shake the participant’s head to fizz up the beer., Cover it with the towel so the foam doesn’t get everywhere and tell the participant to swallow.

Choose a tequila that is made from 100% agave.,
Choose an Añejo tequila.,
Enjoy your tequila with a little bit of sangrita.,
Follow the sipping protocol.",How to Drink Tequila1," Not all tequilas are created equal. If you are planning on sipping your tequila and enjoying it like most Mexicans do, be sure to choose tequila that is 100% authentic.


There are tequilas that are ""mixtos,"" meaning that they are made with at least 51% agave and fortified with sugars. Stay away from these. They don't taste much like tequila.
Many bartenders and tequila experts recommend choosing a family-owned tequila over a large conglomerate.(We're looking at you, Cuervo.) If you can find a tequila that's part of a small, family-owned business, chances are overwhelming that it will be 100% agave, and simply that it will taste better.;
, Because añejo tequilas are aged for at least a year, they make for better sipping than a tequila that is rushed to maturity or those that are front-loaded with tequila flavor but lack any body or complexity to round it out. These añejos are often compared to aged cognac.



Añejos tend to be more expensive than reposados or blancos, but not outrageously so. You should be able to find a good añejo for under $50.
Drink añejos at room temperature.Adding ice to it dilutes the flavor and can mask the tequila's different components.
If you become serious about sipping tequila, consider getting a tequila glass to enjoy your añejo in. Many also enjoy the tequila in a snifter.

, ""Sangrita"" means ""little blood"" in Spanish, called this way because of the color of the liquid. The sangrita is non-alcoholic. Pair the sangrita with your sipping tequila in a separate shot glass and take turns sipping the tequila and sangrita. To make sangrita, mix together, then refrigerate:


1 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
1 cup tomato juice (not V-8)
1 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice
1 tsp grenadine
12 dashes hot sauce — e.g., Cholula

, (Optional.) If you're the kind of person who enjoys the thought of sipping tequila the right way, here are some tips on how the experts enjoy their vintage tequila.


Pour about one ounce of tequila in a tequila glass or snifter. Hold the glass at the stem (not the bowl), raise the glass to eye level and look at the tequila's color.
Swirl the tequila gently in its glass. Note how the tequila clings to the walls of the glass, looking for the ""string of pearls"" effect.Take a small sip, swishing the tequila around in your mouth for about 10 seconds, letting the alcohol travel over different parts of your tongue.
Swallow and repeat! Fancy, huh?

Choose a blanco, oro, or reposado tequila to shoot.,
Shoot neat and unchilled.,
Shoot with salt and lime.",How to Drink Tequila2," Oro, meaning ""gold,"" tastes similar to blanco and costs about the same. Remember to choose 100% agave tequila. Mixtos may be cheap, but a nasty headache in the morning is expensive.

, You don't have to go through the salt-and-lime routine if you don't want to. (Most Mexicans don't drink tequila this way, anyway.) Take room-temperature tequila, pour it into a shot glass, toast, and pour it down your gullet.

, The salt-and-lime method of shooting tequila has been around for a while, though it's not clear that it's a popular way of shooting tequila in Mexico. One report suggests that the oldest known mention of the salt-and-lime technique, from 1924, reverses the order: First lime, then tequila, then salt.Either way, it's a popular way of shooting tequila, even if it's detested by snobs the world 'round. Here's how:


Lick the skin between your thumb and index finger. Shake a little bit of salt on your skin, which should stick to the moisture.
With a tequila shot and lime wedge in hand, lick the salt on your hand and shoot the tequila. Try to get the tequila down in one gulp if you can. You are shooting it, after all.
As a ""chaser,"" suck on the lime wedge after shooting the tequila. The acidity of the lime won't taste as sharp after the alcohol.

Enjoy your tequila in a classic margarita.,
Enjoy your tequila in a ""tequini,"" or tequila martini.,
Enjoy your tequila in a tequila sunrise.,
Try a twist on a Bloody Mary, called a vampira.",How to Drink Tequila3," A margarita can be frozen or classic. If you really want to savor the flavor of the tequila, go for a classic margarita, as the frozen margaritas are laden with sugar and water. To make a great margarita, follow this recipe:


Pour the following ingredients into a cocktail shaker half-full with ice:

2 oz. blanco, oro, or reposado tequila
1/2 oz. orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier or Triple-Sec
1 oz. freshly-squeezed lime juice
1/2 oz. agave nectar sweetener


Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds and strain into cocktail glass with a salted rim.

, A tequini takes all the sophistication and class of a martini and squeezes a little bit of fun into the mix. Imbiber beware, however, because this brother is boozy! Turn the tequini into a sweeter tequini by using a reposado tequila and sweet vermouth.


Into a cocktail shaker filled with ice, mix:

2 1/2 oz blanco tequila
1/2 oz dry vermouth
Dash of Angostura bitters


Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds and strain into a martini glass.
Garnish with an olive, lemon twist, or jalapeno pepper.

, Called ""tequila sunrise"" because of the layering of red and orange, this recipe is another reminder that tequila and citrus make a really nice pairing.


In a highball glass with ice, pour in:

2 oz. blanco, oro, or reposado tequila
Enough orange juice to fill the glass almost to the top.


Stir ingredients, and then dip two dashes of grenadine syrup into the drink by tilting the glass slightly and funneling the syrup quickly down the side. The grenadine should sink to the bottom and slowly rise through the drink.
Garnish with stirrer, straw, and cherry-orange.

, This is also sometimes called a ""Bloody Maria."" The vampira cocktail is a Mexican twist on the classic bloody Mary recipe. It's light and spicy, and manages to be original without betraying the essence of the prototype.


Fill a 10-ounce glass with ice. Into the glass, pour:

pinch of salt
1 1/2 oz. blanco tequila
1 teaspoon Mexican hot sauce, e.g. Cholula
1 oz. Clamato
1 oz. freshly squeezed lemon juice


Top up the drink with Mexican Squirt or another grapefruit soda, and garnish with a lemon wheel.

Gather your supplies.,
Add ice to a cocktail shaker.,
Measure and add the liquids.,
Add lime juice.,
Mix the ingredients.,
Serve the drink.",How to Make a Kamikaze1," You’ll need ice, vodka, triple sec, and limes to make the drink. Ice is an ideal addition to the cocktail version of the kamikaze. You could use a shaker or use a cup and spoon. Some people enjoy using lime concentrate for convenience sake, while many argue that you need to use fresh limes.


A good tool for an aspiring bartender or home entertainer is a double jigger. These come in two sizes: 1 ounce and ½ ounce or 1 ½ ounce and ¾ ounce.For a medium to large party, buy a liter of vodka and triple sec. For this size, you'll need about a dozen fresh limes or a liter of lime juice.;
, You can also mix your ingredients in a large cup. Larger cubes of ice add a nicer presentation to the drink. You can purchase ice trays that specifically make large ice cubes made for cocktails.Shake your drink in a cup by placing a small plate over the opening. Apply pressure to the plate and shake the drink for five seconds. Strain the mixture by allowing a small opening for the liquids with the plate.

, Use the double jigger to measure out the liquors. The cocktail version of the kamikaze is usually stronger than the shot version. Add one ounce of vodka and one ounce of triple sec to the container. If you want a milder cocktail, you could use ½ ounce or even ¾ ounce of each liquor. Add equal parts of each ingredient, or a proportion of 1:1:1.


The quality of the liquors depends purely on your tastes and price range. A simple rule is the more you spend on the liquor, the better your drink will be.
You can also use a shot glass as a measuring device.
Three tablespoons will give you a 1 1/2 ounce shot.It isn't advised to eyeball the drink unless you're experienced mixing liquors properly.

, Traditional kamikazes are served with same portions of lime juice as with the liquors. If you added 1 ½ ounce of vodka and triple sec, add 1 ½ ounce of lime juice. The key is for all the ingredients to be around the same parts.Use a lemon or orange strainer to create fresh juice out of limes. You could also use store bought lime juice.

, Traditionally, kamikazes are shaken in a cocktail shaker vigorously for about five seconds. You could instead stir the ingredients for about 10 seconds. Yes, James Bond would say, “shaken, not stirred,” but you can use whatever you have.

, Strain the drink into a glass with ice. Some prefer kamikazes served straight, or without ice. Ask your guests before serving the drink, but the default is over ice, or on the rocks.

Some people enjoy using lime concentrate for convenience sake, while many argue that you should use fresh limes.


A good tool for an aspiring bartender or home entertainer is a double jigger. These come in two sizes: 1 ounce and ½ ounce or 1 ½ ounce and ¾ ounce.For a medium to large party, buy a liter of vodka and triple sec. For this size, you'll also need about a dozen fresh limes or a liter of lime juice.

, For the shot version of the drink, you’ll use less liquid to fit into a shot glass. You can measure either ½ ounce or ¾ ounce of vodka and triple sec. Again, a double jigger will help you measure out these portions equally.


Pour the two alcohols into the shaker.

, Use the portion used for the vodka and triple sec for the lime juice. It is best to squeeze fresh limes, instead of using store bought lime juice. Everyone has their own tastes and you should follow yours. Add the lime juice to the shaker.

, Add a scoop of ice to the shaker. Right after adding the ice, cap the shaker, and shake. Shake the concoction vigorously for about five seconds or more. It’s important to shake the mixture quickly so the ice doesn’t melt.

, Strain the mixture directly into a shot glass. Add a slice of lime to the edge of the shot glass for added presentation. It is best to take the shot right after being made because the drink is chilled just right.

Create simple syrup.,
Infuse with herbs.,
Infuse your alcohol.",How to Make a Kamikaze3," Traditional kamikazes weren’t served with simple syrup, but the “traditional days” are over. Heat half a cup of water with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Stir often as the mixture heats up to prevent the sugar from caramelizing. Take the saucepan off the heat once the sugar is fully dissolved.


Add ½ ounce of simple sugar to your shaker or cup for a sweeter taste., Bartenders are getting more and more creative with infusing cocktails with herbs. Common herbs that mix well with limes are rosemary, basil and lavender. Only use fresh herbs when infusing into a cocktail. Mince the herbs with a sharp blade and add to the shaker before being mixed.


Another popular herb that could be used is mint.

, Instead of buying flavored alcohol, flavor it yourself. Infuse your vodka by mixing it with a chopped produce, like ginger. Let the combination sit for about a week before straining and using in the recipe.Make sure the container is capped and stored in a dry location. Here are some other ingredients you can use to infuse your booze:


Poblano peppers will add some heat and savoriness to your cocktail.
Tart apples will add a sweet and sour taste to your drink.
For the sweet tooth, infuse the vodka with raspberries, cantaloupe, or blueberries depending on your taste buds.

Bake angel food cake.,
Cut the cake into bite-sized chunks.,
Soak the pieces in tequila.,
Heat oil in a deep frying pan or saucepan.,
Fry the pieces of cake.,
Remove the cake from the oil.,
Sprinkle with powdered sugar.,
Serve while still warm.",How to Make Deep Fried Tequila Shots1," The ""shots"" in this recipe are formed from bite-sized cubes of angel food cake. Baking angel food cake is easy. The simplest way to do it is generally to use a box of storebought cake mix (e.g., Betty Crocker, etc.), but it's also possible to make it from scratch. See our angel food cake recipe to get started.



Here is another good commercial angel food cake recipe.Note that the final product will be a little richer than angel food cake, so you may not meed as much as you think. A single box of cake mix should make deep fried shots for at least about 10 people.;
, Once the cake has finished baking and is cool, set it on a cutting board. Chop it into small, bite-sized cubes (about one inch to a side). Break the pieces apart and form a loose pile.


You want your guests to be able to pop the shots into their mouths, so don’t make the pieces too large. Having each piece be about the length of two small dice per side should be plenty.

, Pour tequila into a bowl and carefully dip each piece of cake in. Transfer the soaked pieces to a clean, dry bowl. Since tequila is much more expensive than the other ingredients in this recipe, it's wise to pour a little less than you think you'll need into the mixing bowl and only add more as you need it.


Because angel food cake is highly spongy, this cake will absorb the tequila quickly. Don’t leave cake in the tequila for too long or it may start to break down and disintegrate.

, Bring an inch or two of oil to about 350 F (177 C) in a pan on the stove. For most stoves, a few minutes of medium-high heat should be plenty. The oil needs to be hot enough that the cake will fry quickly, but not burn.


Use vegetable, canola, or peanut oil for best results. Don't use olive oil, which smokes at low temperatures and can give your shots a bitter taste., When the oil is plenty hot (flicking a drop of water into the pan should immediately make it crackle and sputter), transfer a few of the cake pieces in with a set of tongs or a fork. They will cook quickly, so keep a close eye on them. Turn the pieces as they cook to ensure an even browning on all sides.


Don’t drop the cake into the oil until it is hot or the cake bites will get soggy with oil.
Be prepared to cook in batches — not all pans will be big enough to handle all the bites at once.

, Once the bites are browned on all sides, transfer them to a plate covered with a paper towel. The towel will help absorb any residual grease. After a minute of sitting on the towel, transfer the bites to a wire rack over a baking tray. Here, they'll have a chance to cool and any remaining grease that drips off will be caught by the tray.


Don't treat the bites like bacon, letting them cool in a big pile over a paper towel for a long time. The steam from the piled-up bites will cause them to lose their crisp exterior and become soft.

, You can use your fingers to dust the bites with powdered sugar while they cool on the wire rack. For a more even coating, however, you may want to put the powdered sugar into a fine wire strainer and shake it over the bites.

, Enjoy your treats responsibly.

Serve with lime.,
Serve in a margarita-style glass.,
Make a lime dipping sauce.,
Make fruit-flavored shots.",How to Make Deep Fried Tequila Shots2," Since tequila is often associated with tart slices of lime, the fruit makes a logical garnish for this dessert dish as well. Try placing lime slices around the rim of your serving bowl for a festive presentation. Alternatively, squeeze half of a fresh lime over your shots when they're done to give them a sour kick.

, Another great idea for presentation is to recreate the traditional garnishes used for margarita glasses. Try wetting the rims of glasses, dipping them in margarita salt, and putting a few of your deep fried shots inside each glass. Optionally, include a lime slice or a paper umbrella to complete the look.

, These deep fried treats go well with many sweet dipping sauces. To make your own lime-flavored sauce, try combining about a cup of your preferred vanilla frosting (homemade or storebought) with the juice from half a lime (a little less than 1/4 cup). Green food coloring can be great for presentation purposes but isn't required.


Optionally, add the zest of the lime you juice for additional flavor and aroma. See our article on zesting limes for more information.

This key lime frosting recipe makes a great dipping sauce as well.

, To add tropical flavors to your deep fried shots, just mix the tequila with your preferred fruit juices and soak the cake bites as normal. When they're done, your tequila treats will have the flavor of whatever juice you used. Orange, pineapple, lemon, lime, and mango juices all make great choices.

Try it virgin.",How to Make a Caesar Drink," Use a large glass, such as a goblet, highball, or pint glass. Basically, the glass should be able to easily hold 10 oz of liquid, or slightly more.


If you are planning on adding a lot of garnishes, you should account for that as well when you choose your glass. You may need a large glass with a heavy bottom just for stability if you want to add a ton of garnishes to the top of your drink.;
, Rub a lemon wedge around the edge of the glass. Then dip the rim of the glass into a pile of celery salt.Turn the glass lightly around, so that the entire rim is covered in the celery salt.


Rimming the glass adds a kick of flavor every time you take a sip of your finished cocktail.
If you don't want to taste the celery salt every time you take a drink, simply add a straw to your cocktail and drink out of that. This means that you have the choice between a sip with celery salt and a sip without.

, You should fill the glass until it is about 3/4 full. The ice is important because you want your Caesar to be nice and cold throughout. There is nothing worse than warm clam juice after all!

, The type of vodka you use and the amount of vodka you add is up to you. The amount of vodka usually varies between 1.5 ounces and 3 ounces, depending on how strong you want the drink and how much Clamato you are going to add at the end.


If you are making a cocktail that will fill a pint glass, you probably want to use the full 3 ounces.
If you are making a cocktail in a small highball glass, then you probably should add about 1.5 ounces.

, While the Clamato has some seasoning, you will want to kick that seasoning a bit with some additions of your own. You can add a shake of salt and pepper, 2-4 drops of Tabasco, and 3-6 drops Worcestershire sauce. This will help to create the classic Caesar flavor.

, Fill the glass almost to the top with Clamato. This is a juice that combines tomato juice and clam juice. You will want to leave a little bit of room in case you want to add more vodka to taste, or if you need room for lots of garnishes.


The clam juice adds an additional layer of flavor that is pleasantly savory. This flavor is sometimes called umami.The addition of Clamato is the main difference between a Caesar and a Bloody Mary. While a Bloody Mary uses tomato juice, a Caesar has the additional clam juice to give it a kick.

, You can do this by simply adding a lemon or lime wedge to the edge of the glass. Or you could add a celery stalk to the glass and a variety of other bites on cocktail skewers.Part of the fun of a Caesar can be its garnishes.

, Enjoy your drink morning, noon, or night. While a Bloody Mary is traditionally drunk with brunch, Caesars are enjoyed at any time of day., While some people are happy with just a few drops of Tabasco, others may want more of a kick. Try adding additional Tabasco or some other hot sauce. Do you have a favorite hot sauce? Try splashing a little bit into your next Caesar!


For a fun twist, try adding a little Sriracha Chili Sauce. This will add a little heat and a little difference in taste.You can also add horseradish to your drink for a different kind of kick.
Why not try wasabi instead of Tabasco? It will be just as hot but the kick will fade quickly after each sip., You don't have to stick to only celery salt on the rim. Perhaps you could simply mix celery salt with a little pepper for a little more flavor.


If you want to get even more creative you can make a mixture of celery salt, pepper, garlic powder, and just a touch of chili powder to use when rimming you glass. This will certainly give a huge pop of flavor when you take a drink.

, If you want to get fancy and punch up the flavor of your drink, you can make your own Clamato. Simply combine tomato juice with canned clam juice to punch up the clam flavor in your drink.


If you are planning on making multiple drinks combine 4 1/2 cups tomato juice with one bottle of clam juice (usually 250mL). This should make enough tomato clam juice for about eight drinks., Who says you can only have a lime wedge and a stick of celery in your drink? Try adding olives, pickles, pepper, or any pickled vegetable.


If you are getting really wild you can even stick a strip of fried bacon right into the glass.
Get a long skewer and put roasted garlic cloves, cherry tomatoes, and cooked shrimp on it. Add the skewer to the glass and you practically have a meal included with your drink!
Your imagination is really the only limit to the type of garnishes you can add.

, If you are in the mood for a Caesar but you can't get drunk, or don't want to, them make a virgin one without vodka. All you need to do is omit the vodka from the recipe and you will still have a delicious, salty drink to enjoy.

, It is preferable to use a rocks glass (aka a lowball glass). Use 2 teaspoons of sugar for a sweeter drink, one for a drink with more of the cachaça flavor.


American bartenders prefer raw sugar,.
Refined white sugar is usually used in Brazil.You can substitute 1 or 2 oz. of simple syrup (50/50 sugar and water by volume) for the sugar.

, Muddle them by pressing down and twisting repeatedly with a muddler – a long pestle shaped like a miniature baseball bat.Crush the limes just enough to release their juice. If you mash them too much, your drink will be bitter.If you don’t have a muddler, just use the back of a spoon.

, Crushed ice is best, though cubed will work fine.

, Recommendations from American bartenders range from 2 oz. (a little over a shot) for a sweeter, tarter drink,to 2.5 oz. (about two shots) for a stronger drink.Brazilian recipes, which are typically heavier on lime and lower on alcohol, usually call for 1.7oz (50ml)., Enjoy!

, A true caipirinha is always made with cachaça, but in Brazil, you’ll find a variety of other takes on the national drink employing different alcohols. If you don’t have any cachaça on hand, try one of these:


Substitute vodka to make a caipiroska.Caipiroskas mix very well with different fruit pulps.
Substitute white rum for a caipirissima.Rum is a sugar based alcohol like cachaça (from molasses, rather than sugarcane juice) and produces a similar, though less earthy flavor.Because of its simpler flavor profile, rum mixes slightly better with fruit than cachaça.
Substitute sake for a caipisake.These are best made following the traditional recipe, as sake loses its particular flavors and aromas when mixed with fruit.

, Pretty much any fruit will work in a caipirinha.Pick ones that you like or that are in season. Here are some popular fruits, with tips on how to add them:


Tangerine – Substitute ½ a tangerine for the lime to make a caipirinha de tangerina.Strawberry – Substitute 4-5 quartered strawberries for the lime.Passion fruit – Substitute for lime. Take 1 small passion fruit or ½ a large one, cut it in half crosswise and scrape the pulp in a glass.Pomegranate – Add 4 teaspoons of pomegranate seeds to a caipirinha made with 2 slices of lime. Muddle the seeds with the lime and sugar.Watermelon – Puree a cup of watermelon (seeds removed) in a food processor, and add it to a traditional caipirinha along with the cachaça.Grapes – Muddle 7 seedless grapes along with 2 lime slices and the sugar.Kiwi – Add one peeled and chopped kiwi to a caipirinha made with ½ a lime. Muddle the kiwi with the lime and sugar.Pineapple – Add 2 tablespoons of crushed pineapple along with the cachaça in a traditional caipirinha.Raspberries – Muddle 6 raspberries along with the lime and sugar.Kumquats – Muddle 5 kumquats along with the lime and sugar.Guava – To make the popular caipirinha de goiaba, mix 100ml of guava juice and 2 teaspoons of condensed milk, then add the cachaça and ice. No extra sugar; the condensed milk and guava provide the sweetness., In the US raw sugar is standard, while Brazilians prefer refined sugar. But there are a number of other sweeteners that can subtly change the flavor of a caipirinha.


Honey – Substitute 1oz. of honey for the sugar.Maple syrup – Substitute 1.5 teaspoons of maple syrup for the sugar.Agave – Substitute 1 teaspoon of agave syrup for the sugar.

, Especially when trying a fruity caipirinha, you can really bring out the flavor of the fruit with a fruit-infused cachaça. To infuse cachaça, dump the fruit and a bottle of cachaça into a glass container (not the original bottle). Seal and let sit in a dark place for 24-72 hours, then strain and return to the original bottle.Here are few ideas to get you started:


Pineapple infused cachaça – Peel and slice a whole pineapple and cover with a bottle of cachaça.Raspberry infused cachaça – Add 3.5 cups of raspberries per bottle of cachaça.Strawberry infused cachaça – Add 3 cups of strawberries per bottle of cachaça.Chili infused cachaça – Add 1 large Anaheim chili and 3 serrano chilis per liter of cachaça. This infusion works well with a caipirinha made with cucumber slices muddled along with the sugar and lime."

Understand that winemaking is not simply a question of mixing fermented fruit until it tastes good.,
Realize that a winemaker often has to wear many “hats” and the job is varied.,
Understand that a winemaker should be able to ensure that the farm has achieved the right quality of fruit in the orchard.,
Realize that the average day will be spent doing a combination of fieldwork as well as controlling the fermentation process or other winemaking procedure, as well as seeing to the administration and management of the cellar.

,
Look for good people skills.,
Seek somebody passionate.,
Realize that winemaking is a way of living, not a job.,
Look for team oriented people.,
Seek an analytical mind.,
Check for qualifications.,
Be prepared to pay for travel costs.,
Offer good rates and conditions.",How to Choose a Good Winemaker," A good wine starts with the planting and tending of the fruit orchard.;
, So any winemaker needs to be able to be flexible and have ability to multi-task.

, Making the wine in the cellar and marketing the wines locally and internationally is also part of the job.

,, A good part of the time will also be in contact with people in regards to selling wine in the store, promoting and introducing the range of wines to clients, buyers and friends.

, Winemakers need to be passionate about all aspects of the wine industry, enjoy drinking the wine they have produced and be open to wine styles that they may not necessarily be accustomed to drinking. Being open to criticism and the ability to produce a wine that the public will like (not only what you like) is very important.

, To be successful the winemaker must have a real love of everything to do with winemaking.

, A winemaker will be working as part of a team and must enjoy working with people and be able to communicate at all levels., A winemaker needs to be scientifically, analytically and mechanically minded as well as a people person with lots of creative abilities. Being slightly eccentric or outgoing may also help as winemakers are often linked to the brand or product by the public and the winemaker often must conduct public relations duties.

, All winemakers should at least have some formal wine education either at the college level or University. There are several colleges in Canada that offer wine education. There is even long distance education available that the owner/operator could conduct at their own pace. Hired winemakers should have a diploma in Cellar Technology or a B.Sc. in Microbiology or Oenology. Some winemakers rely on gaining a lot of hands-on experience in grape growing and winemaking areas so many winemakers have traveled extensively in wine producing regions of the world.

, There are plenty of opportunities for travel in this job. Most winemakers are also responsible for marketing the wines and can spend a considerable amount of time traveling to establish a market. Many owner/operators and winemakers visit the established wine markets all over the world and also investigate new and emerging markets. This obviously depends on the wineries budget, marketing and distribution philosophy and size., Good winemakers are much in demand, as the industry is experiencing a shortage of these skilled men and women."

Understand the basic functions and components of a kegerator.,
Obtain the necessary components.,
Carefully read all instructions and warnings for all of the components.,
Determine how the components should be placed in the refrigerator.,
Choose a specific area of the refrigerator that can be safely drilled through in order to place the faucet shank.,
Draw a circle or make a centered dot where you want to drill a hole in the refrigerator for the shank and faucet assembly.,
Obtain a hole saw drill bit (generally 1 1/8"", 1"", 7/8"" or 3/4"") that will produce a hole that will neatly accommodate the faucet shank, and drill a hole.,
Clean and sanitize the beer faucet, shank, beer line, and other associated components.,
Insert the beer faucet and shank assembly through the refrigerator, and secure using included hardware.,
Securely attach the gas line to the regulator outlet and to the keg gas line ""in"" connector or coupler gas inlet.,
Verify that the CO2 cylinder is filled, completely shut off, and properly attached to the gas regulator.,
Obtain a chilled keg of beer (warm beer will result in overly foamy beer).,
Connect the beer line to the keg.,
Connect the gas line to the keg.,
Make sure that all connections are secure, and that the beer tap handle is in the closed position.,
Pressurize the keg for dispensing.,
Try dispensing some beer from the faucet, and check for beer leaks.,
Periodically check for gas and beer leaks, and be sure to check the gas pressure that is indicated by the regulator.

",How to Build a Kegerator," A kegerator is essentially a keg of beer that is kept cold in a refrigerator. The refrigerator has a beer tap or faucet protruding from it, from which the beer is dispensed. The beer is forced through the faucet from the keg by forcing carbon dioxide into the keg. A small tank (cylinder) of carbon dioxide is used to supply the gas pressure, and maintain a specific pressure in the keg so that beer can be dispensed evenly at any time. A regulator that is attached to the gas cylinder enables one to regulate the pressure. There is vinyl ""gas"" tubing that goes from the gas cylinder and regulator to the ""in"" port of the keg. From the ""out"" port of the keg there is the ""beer"" or ""beverage"" line, more vinyl tubing that goes to the beer faucet.;
, The components will be somewhat variable, depending on the type of beer that is to be dispensed, and number and types of kegs that will be on tap at one time. The components generally include: One refrigerator large enough to contain the type of keg(s) that will be utilized, beer faucet(s) and handle, faucet shank (long enough to protrude through refrigerator), wing nut with washer and tailpiece to attach the shank to the beverage tubing (if not already part of the shank), beverage and gas line connectors or coupler for type of keg that is to be used, fasteners such as worm clamps for the tubing, CO2 cylinder, CO2 gas regulator, and appropriately sized vinyl tubing. The vinyl beer line should be five feet or more in length (to reduce beer foam), while the vinyl gas line should be about three feet or more in length, and be able to withstand high gas pressure. Also consult the list of ""Things You'll Need"" below.

, Make absolutely sure that you understand how to use and operate the CO2 gas cylinder and regulator. Always keep gas cylinders secured and in an upright position. CO2 cylinders are shipped empty, and must be filled locally. See ""Warnings"" below.

, This can be done by measuring the components as well as the inside of the refrigerator, and by fitting the components in the refrigerator. Make sure that the kegerator door can be closed properly, that the components won't tip over, and that the beverage and gas lines won't be impeded or compressed. Make sure that the shank will protrude adequately through the refrigerator (shanks are available in different lengths), and that the protruding end has enough room inside the refrigerator. It is customary to place the gas hardware in the refrigerator with the keg, although this is not necessary. However, an additional hole will have to be drilled for the gas line if the gas hardware is placed outside the refrigerator.

, Refrigerators have internal components that must be completely avoided. It is generally easiest and safest to drill a hole though the refrigerator door.

, It is generally best to use a level and a ruler when determining where to drill the hole. Remove the keg and gas hardware from the refrigerator. Make sure the refrigerator is unplugged.

, A larger drill bit such as 1 1/8"" can be used to leave a little extra space if desired. A neater and possibly stronger fit can be produced with a narrower drill bit. A bit larger than 1 1/8"" will probably produce a hole that is too large. Be sure to check the dimensions of the shank before choosing a drill bit, and account for the thickness of the refrigerator. The metal exterior of the refrigerator can provide some resistance when drilling, but the insulation and plastic that exists under the metal skin should be very easy to drill through. The centered inner drill bit that protrudes from and is part of the hole saw should enable the drilling to start relatively easily, and will hold the drill bit in place while beginning to drill. If the drill bit cannot readily penetrate the metal exterior, it may be necessary to start a smaller hole with a small regular drill bit. Be sure to clean up all the debris that was produced from the hole drilling, and make sure that the internal components of the refrigerator were not damaged. The refrigerator insulation can break apart easily and get on the shank (and possibly in the beer), so it may be a good idea to line the inside of the shank hole with something to prevent this, especially if the shank will be removed frequently. Oftentimes it is not necessary to remove the shank, but certain cleaning methods may require the shank to be removed. For example, cleanser and sanitizer can be simply run through the beer lines to clean a kegerator, or the beer lines (including faucet and shank) can be removed, broken down, and soaked in cleanser and sanitizer. If the hole that has been drilled is found to be too small, it may be necessary to grind the metal layer of the refrigerator with a tool such as a Dremel to widen the opening. If the hole that has been drilled is found to be too big, it should be possible to install an extra reinforcing plate on the inside of the refrigerator. To do this, merely cut a piece of thin yet strong material that will cover and overlap the area inside of the refrigerator where the hole was drilled. Then drill a smaller hole in the piece of material that will properly accommodate the shank and associated hardware. Insert the shank through the refrigerator and through the rear reinforcing plate, and screw on the hardware that attaches the shank. This can also be done to reinforce a properly fitted shank.

, Anything that comes in contact with the beer should be clean and sanitized. The gas lines and hardware should be clean and free of dust and debris that may end up in the beer.

, Attach the beer line to the connector or coupler that attaches it to the keg, and attach the beer line to the faucet shank tailpiece. If the shank does not have a unified tailpiece, then a wing nut, separate tailpiece, and neoprene washer will be needed. The separate tailpiece is held within the wing nut and attached to the tubing with a worm clamp. The wing nut rotates freely around the tailpiece. The neoprene washer is ultimately sandwiched between the tailpiece and the end of the shank. The wing nut holds the tailpiece against the shank. Secure both ends of the tubing with worm clamps or similar hardware. All beverage and gas lines must be completely secured so that beer and gas leaks do not result. To keep the pressure balanced up to the tap (and not produce a mug full of foam), special ""Beverage"" tubing is used. The beer line should be at least five feet in length when using 3/16"" beverage tubing in order to pour a good pint.

, The gas line should be about three feet or more in length.

, The regulator must also be completely shut off and set to zero pressure.

, Vent off all gas pressure in the keg by pulling a pressure relief valve on the keg. Do not attach the keg connectors or coupler to a full, pressurized keg, as this may cause beer and gas to be released explosively from the keg.

, Re-vent gas pressure from the keg if necessary.

, Keep the gas turned off.

, Make sure that the gas regulator is set to zero pressure and the regulator safety shutoff valve is closed, so that gas cannot escape. Also make sure that the keg is sealed and ready to be pressurized.

, Turn the main CO2 cylinder gas valve on, keeping the gas regulator off so that gas still cannot escape through the gas line. Open the regulator shutoff and very very slowly adjust the regulator to about 12PSI, letting the gas enter the keg. Listen for any hissing sounds that may indicate that gas is leaking from somewhere in the system (there should not be any leaks).

, Do not drink this initial beer as it may contain sanitizer or cleanser. The beer may be overly foamy. This may mean that the keg is too warm, that the beer line is too short, that there is too much gas pressure, or that there is a gap of air in the beer line. Inadequate gas pressure will result in air spaces in the beer line.


To adjust the pressure in the keg, shut off the gas and the relieve the pressure in the keg. Then adjust the pressure in the keg using the gas regulator to achieve desired beer foam.

",How to Brew Your Own Beer," As any experienced brewer will tell you, 80% of the secret of success is cleanliness. Thoroughly clean and sanitize everything that is going to come in contact with your beer. The easiest way to do that is to use an electric dishwasher set at the high heat setting or use a powdered cleanser such as PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash).









Do not use a scrubber that will scratch the surface of whatever you're scrubbing—pathogens love to grow in the grooves left behind, and they're almost impossible to sanitize. Rinse well, then soak briefly in a bleach or iodine solution.;
, Rinse off bleach before using items using very clean potable or distilled water. Do not assume tap water is sanitized for rinsing brewing equipment.



If you're using bleach to sanitize, add one ounce (30ml) of bleach to five gallons (19 liters) of cold water, followed by one ounce (30ml) of white vinegar. Do not mix the bleach and vinegar together before adding to the water! The vinegar will make the water more acidic, which helps the bleach sanitize.
Do not rinse iodine solutions, let equipment drip dry instead.
Note that bleach can cause unwanted flavours in your beer, and requires rinsing, which can introduce microorganisms to your sterilized equipment. If you want to sterilize your equipment properly, use either a food-grade cleanser or sanitizer such as One Step No-Rinse Sanitizer, which requires no rinsing; or an iodine solution such as BTF Iodophor.
Remember, in beer brewing, you can do just about anything you want, and add anything you want, to make whatever kind of beer you want—but proper sanitizing is the MOST important thing you can do. Take the time and the energy to do it right.

, That includes cleaning and sanitizing as outlined, and also includes having all your ingredients prepared and measured in advance.


, Before you begin your foray into home brewing, get a notebook, and note down everything you do—the cleaning process, what strain of yeast, the amount and specific type of malt, what variety of hops, and any specialty grains or other ingredients used to produce your beer.



This will allow you to reproduce any given brew, or provide a basis for experimentation and improvement.

, Put any specialty grains into a grain bag (a mesh bag to contain the grains—like a tea bag, only a lot bigger) and steep them in the large stock pot in three gallons (10 liters) of hot water (around 150°F (66°C) for about 30 minutes.











Remove the grains and allow the water to drip out of the grain bag, into the pot. Do not squeeze the bag, because you may extract tannins that will give your beer an astringent flavor.

, The hops are usually added at various intervals to add flavor, bitterness, or aroma and the times will be spelled out for you in the kit's instructions for your style of beer.











In general, hops added early in the boil will contribute more bitterness, but at the expense of flavor and aroma. Hops added at the end of the boil will have a more pronounced flavor and aroma, but will not contribute significantly to the bitterness of the beer.

, After you have boiled the liquid (called wort—pronounced wərt), you need to cool it as quickly as possible. The easiest way is to put the whole pot in a sink or bathtub that is filled with ice water.











You can gently stir the wort to help expedite the cooling, but try not to splash or aerate the wort while it's still hot (it can make for some funky flavors).
Once it's around 80°F (27°C) you are ready to transfer it to the fermenter.

, After the wort has cooled and before fermentation starts is the one and only time that splashing is encouraged. Yeast need oxygen, and splashing the wort as you pour it into the fermenter will deliver that.











Once fermentation has started, you want to minimize exposure to air, as it will lead to off flavors and aromas.
Using a large strainer (usually cheapest at restaurant supply stores), scoop the hops out—you've already got all the good stuff out of them. (If using a carboy, strain the wort as you pour it into the carboy).
Add water to make five gallons (20 liters). You are now ready to ""pitch"" (add) the yeast. Some yeast requires that you ""bloom"" (stir with warm water to activate) them prior to pitching, others do not. You may find that even those that don't require blooming will start working faster if you do bloom them first, but it's usually no big deal.
Put the lid on your fermenter (or stopper in your glass carboy) and affix the air-lock to the top. Put the fermenter in a dark area that stays a fairly consistent room temperature (for ales...lagers need refrigeration to ferment properly). In about 24 hours, you should notice the air-lock happily bubbling away, if it hasn't started doing anything after 48 hours, you might have a problem such as dead yeast.

, After a week or so, the activity from the airlock will slow to a crawl. Leave it alone for two weeks measured from the time you first started the brewing/fermenting. The beer is now ready for bottling. Your kit probably came with some priming sugar or DME(dried malt extract). This is used to provide carbonation to your beer once it is in the bottle.











Boil the sugar in a little water and cool it. Then, add it to the empty, cleaned and sanitized bucket with the spigot or to your fermented beer.

, Use your cleaned and sanitized plastic tubing as a siphon to transfer the beer as gently as possible—so that there's little or no aeration—from the fermenter to the bottling bucket with the priming sugar solution in it. Try not to get any of the sediment (trub) from the fermenter into the bottling bucket.











Attach your cleaned and sanitized bottle filler to your clean and sanitized plastic tubing, the other end of the tubing attaches to the bottom end of the spigot. (If you are only using one bucket, it is important to let the fermented beer settle after stirring in the priming sugar solution. There is sediment on the bottom (trub) that will lend an off flavor to your beer).

, If you are using a bottling bucket, just open the spigot and put the bottle filler in a bottle. Push the bottle filler to the bottom and that will let the beer flow.











If using the one bucket method, fill the tube (attached to the bottle filler) with water and put the open end in the fermented beer and place the bottle filler in a glass, or a bottle or the sink, press down to let the water flow out and start the beer flowing in the tube like a siphon. Fill each bottle just to overflowing, then remove the bottle filler: this leaves an almost perfect airspace at the top of the bottle. Cap the bottle with your handy bottle capper, and repeat until all the bottles are full.

, Store the bottles for at least a week preferably two at about room temperature, then refrigerate.


, When you're ready, open a bottle, and pour carefully into a glass. Leave about a quarter inch in the bottle—the sediment tastes a little yeasty, and will give you serious beer farts.

Build or buy a brewery that has access to high quality brewing water.",How to Brew Commercial Beer1," Learn from brewers or go to brewing school. Excellent brewing programs in the United States are offered by the University of California, Davis and the Siebel Institute of Technology. The Master Brewers Association of the Americas (MBAA) offers a 2 week Brewing & Malting course held in November each year at the University of Wisconsin in Madison (www.mbaa.com). Industry-standard textbooks written by the UC Davis instructors Michael J. Lewis and Charles W. Bamforth are readily available and easy to understand. Foreign textbooks such as Technology Brewing and Malting by Wolfgang Kunze are also highly informative and can be incredibly detailed, but may be difficult to obtain as well as expensive.;
, Choose a name, create a logo, and decide what type of beer your brewery should produce. Register your company with the appropriate local government agencies.

, Apply for and obtain a state-issued brewers license such as a small brewers license.

, Beer that is bottled and sold commercially must display approved labels. Make sure that you can wait for a few months or so before selling bottled beer while the labels are approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms or similar agency.

, Find a spot where lots of high-quality brewing water can be easily obtained. Well water is generally preferred to city water, especially if city water is from different, inconsistent sources. A high hardness to alkalinity ratio may be preferred for ales, while soft water is great for pilsners. Alkaline water must be avoided. Assure that your brewery is engineered properly and can pass health department inspections, and also that it is safe for workers and customers. Also ensure that the waste water from the brewery can be sent to a local waste water treatment facility.


Design your brewery so that it uses electronic control systems. Valves, pumps, brewing vessels, and so forth can be controlled from centralized locations and automated with the use of computers and sensors. This saves manpower and reduces worker error.

Choose a light or medium red wine for roast beef.,
Choose a bold red wine when roasting lamb.,
Choose a white and rose wine with veal.",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine1," When roasting beef, red wine is the best option. The added acidity tastes great with the beef texture. Beef roasts pair best with light or medium-bodied red wines. For a beef stew, you might select Sangiovese. For fattier cuts of beef, you might choose a bolder red wine like Barolo or Napa Cabernet.Sangiovese comes in two basic varieties. One is a fruitier variety like the type produced by Ciacci Piccolomini d’Aragona. The other is the rustic and traditional variety typified by Casisano Colombaio Brunello di Montalcino. This type has a bit of an oregano aftertaste and is very savory. Both taste great with roast beef.Barolo might be hard to find at a bargain price. A cheap bottle is about $30.Napa Cabernet tends to be expensive, but you can find a Sauvignon Blanc from the Napa region for under $20 per bottle. Popular producers include Cake-bread, Joseph Phelps, and Hall.;
, Lamb is more delicate than beef, and tastes great with a bold red wine like Malbec, Touriga Nacional, and Petit Verdot. Each of these wines has its own unique flavor that you should look for at a discount price.Malbec is known for flavors of blackberry, plum, and cherry. It doesn’t have a long finish, and also pairs well with blue cheese, mushrooms, and cumin.Touriga Nacional has a rich taste that can encompass blueberry, plum, and blackberry. It matches well against other flavors like potatoes, cheese, cauliflower, cilantro, dill, and apple. Portuguese red wines blended with Touriga Nacional are available for $10-$12.Petit Verdot evokes flavors like blackberry and blueberry. It also pairs well with cheeses, mushrooms, raisins, chestnuts, anise, cloves, and cinnamon. Petit Verdot is available for $12-$20 per bottle., Unlike most roasts, veal generally pairs best with white and rose wine.For instance, you might enjoy White Burgundy (Chardonnay), German Rieslings, or Austrian Grüner Veltliners.Austrian Grüner Veltliner is a dry white wine. It is native to Austria and, in addition to veal, pairs well with cheese, potatoes, green beans, spinach, celery, broccoli, ginger, and allspice.White Burgundy (Chardonnay) is an extremely popular wine with hints of apple and citrus. You should be able to obtain a bottle of Chardonnay for less than $20.German Rieslings are white wines with nutty or honey-like flavors. Except for Kabinett varieties (which is dry or off-dry), Rieslings tend to be sweet.A heavier veal dish might pair well with Chianti or Pinot Noir."

",How to Assemble a Cornelius Keg," The components consist of the keg tank, a long liquid dip tube and o-ring, a short gas dip tube and o-ring, one lid and o-ring, a pressure relief valve for the lid, one gas plug (post) with o-ring, one liquid plug (post) with o-ring, and two small poppet valves that fit inside the plugs (posts). There is a total of five o-rings. There are different types of Cornelius kegs, and different brands of similar five gallon soda kegs are generally referred to as Cornelius kegs. Be sure that the components that you have for a specific keg all correspond with a specific keg design. The pin-lock type of keg is generally not used, and it is far more common to find and use the ball-lock variety. If rebuilding a keg, all of the o-rings are usually replaced with new ones, as they can absorb soda odors, and possibly harbor bacteria and the like.;
, There is little reason to assemble a dirty keg! Used kegs usually still have soda residue in and on them, and must be completely and thoroughly cleaned as well as sanitized. Completely disassembled kegs can be soaked overnight in a solution of Powdered Brewery Wash or similar cleanser, scrubbed, rinsed, and then sanitized. Be sure to remove the o-rings during this process, and replace them if necessary. Note that the plug (post) o-rings are not easily removed, so should be kept on during cleaning and sanitizing unless the keg is being completely rebuilt.

, The end of the tube will usually angle in to the center of the bottom of the keg.


Some home brewers will cut one half to three quarters of an inch off of the end of the liquid dip tube to prevent the uptake of yeast sediment when dispensing beer. To do this, cut off the desired length with a tubing cutter, a Dremel cutting wheel or hacksaw, then smooth the resulting jagged edge with sandpaper. The dip tube cannot be used right away, as the part that was cut will be prone to rust. Freshly cut stainless steel must go through a process called passivation before it is rust resistant. The rusting can be prevented by cleaning the tube with a cleanser such as Bar Keepers Friend. The easiest method involves cleaning the metal well, then allowing the metal to passivate over the course of a week or so by itself (this happens as it is exposed to the air).

,,, Use a combination or box wrench or a socket wrench that can properly fit both plugs (posts). Keg plugs (posts) come in different sizes, but many will fit a 7/8"" or 11/16"" wrench. For common Cornelius kegs, the base of the liquid ""out"" plug (post) will be hexagonal. The liquid ""out"" and gas ""in"" plugs are not interchangeable. The keg plug (post) for the gas inlet will only connect properly to the keg connector (disconnect) that attaches the keg to the gas cylinder, and the liquid ""out"" post will only connect properly to the keg connector (disconnect) that attaches the keg to the beer faucet.

Cool the wort rapidly.,
Use a low flocculating yeast strain.,
Harvest and reuse yeast during the fermentation process.,
Bottle or bulk condition in kegs with living yeast.",How to Brew Antioxidant Rich Beer," Malted barley is the primary ingredient from which beer is made, and is higher in polyphenol antioxidants than most other grains, such as rice and corn (although corn is apparently a good source of polyphenols). A standard pale barley malt should be used as the base grain. A variety of darker specialty barley malts (including roast barley) should probably be used as well to add additional antioxidants. These antioxidants, such as melanoidins (Maillard reaction products), are formed when the barley is kilned or roasted at higher temperatures. Use a pound or more of a variety of these specialty malts so that the beer will have a variety of these antioxidants. Combine lightly kilned specialty malt such as melanoidin and crystal malts with darker malts, such as chocolate and carafa malts. Also, dark malts apparently provide compounds that help to keep hop polyphenols in solution in beer.;
, Noble, low alpha acid hops such as the Saaz variety tend to have a higher polyphenol content than high alpha acid bittering hops. Fresh hops will also be a better source of polyphenol antioxidants, as the polyphenols will degrade over time. However, fresh hops must be used very soon after they are harvested, preferably within twenty four hours. As fresh hops have not been dried (kilned), about five to eight times by weight will need to be used compared to dried hops.

, Use any type of mash tun and a mashing schedule that is appropriate for the type of barley that is used. In this process, the milled grain is mixed with heated water. The water and grain mixture (the mash) is held at specific temperatures for specific periods of time. This enables the enzymes that exist naturally in the malted barley to become activated and convert (break down) the starch that is part of the grains into fermentable sugars.The mash tun manifold enables the sugars and other constituents to be efficiently extracted from the grains during the sparging process (see below).

, Fly or batch sparge in the mash tun or lauter tun. The goal here is to rinse or extract fermentable sugars from the grain and collect the resulting wort. Barley antioxidants such as polyphenols and important nutrients are also collected along with the sugars. The yeast that will eventually ferment the wort (after boiling and cooling, see below) will consume the sugars and produce alcohol. The yeast also requires the vitamins, minerals and amino acids that are provided by the malted barley. During fly sparging, a layer of hot water is maintained above the grain bed in the mash or lauter tun. As water is gradually added from the top, the wort is allowed to gradually flow out of the mash tun through a spigot that is connected to the mash tun manifold or similar device. During this process, a very rough filter bed is formed by the grain itself over the mash tun manifold, which enables the wort to be extracted and essentially separated from the grain. The wort is collected in the boil kettle.

, The wort is typically boiled with hops for 60 to 90 minutes in order to extract the bitter constituents (essentially alpha acids) from the hops. The alpha acids are antioxidants, but powerful hop polyphenol antioxidants are also extracted during this time. It is apparently best to boil for a shorter amount of time, such as 60 minutes. A hazy, polyphenol-rich beer is what is desired, and longer boil times may result in clearer beer. Longer boil times may facilitate the removal of proteins that exist in the wort. The proteins that contribute to haze adsorb (bind to) antioxidants, so should not be completely removed. A 90 minute boil should generally be fine, however, especially if dark malts are used. It may be best to add hops throughout the boil to extract different types of hop polyphenols. Hop polyphenols and other constituents such as the bitter alpha acids are isomerized, degraded, and lost during the boil (depending on the exact nature of the constituent). Isomerized and degraded hop constituents are still important antioxidants. In fact, the primary purpose of the boil is to isomerize the bitter alpha acids. Un-isomerized and undegraded hop constituents are also important antioxidants, and can be extracted and preserved when hops are added near or after the end of the boil.

, This helps to preserve the fragile hop polyphenols and other antioxidants, as hot wort is susceptible to oxidation. The oxidation process destroys antioxidants, and also degrades the overall quality of the beer. A wort chiller should be used.

, This type of yeast remains somewhat suspended in the beer and does not form a very compact sediment. Yeast in beer is rich in antioxidants and nutrients, and therefore some should be consumed with the beer, as opposed to stuck to the bottom of the beer bottle or keg (see below).

, The yeast adsorbs (binds to) and consumes the antioxidants and nutrients from the wort. As such, the fermentation process results in the propagation of nutrient-rich brewing yeast. Breweries typically harvest yeast from the fermentation tanks and reuse it to ferment subsequent batches of wort.

, This living yeast will not only provide antioxidants and nutrients for the beer consumer, but will also actively help to preserve the freshness and antioxidant content of the beer by consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide. Therefore, do not filter out all of the yeast from the beer before bottling or kegging. Yeast can also be harvested from the fermentation tanks and added to the beer at bottling to further increase the antioxidant-rich yeast content. It is undesirable to add additional yeast to kegs, as when kegged beer is dispensed, the beer is pulled from the bottom of the keg. This can result is too much yeast being dispensed with the beer when the keg is initially tapped. The use of a low flocculating yeast strain that remains suspended in the beer, as noted above, helps to remediate this situation.

Ensure that you have enough pallets to use in conjunction with the forklift. Use the pallets to store and move beer and other items.

, Obtain sacks of grain and/or fill grain silos so that enough grain is on hand for the scheduled brews. Also make sure that the malt meets the required specifications. The specifications should be provided by the maltster and can be tested for by the brewery. Specifications include indexes of modification, kernel plumpness, friability (friable grain is easier to mill), protein content as well as free amino nitrogen (FAN) content, enzyme activity or content, and moisture content. There is no one perfect set of specifications, as different types of brewing equipment and methods works best with different types of barley malt. For example, a traditional British 2-row malt works well with a 2-roll mill and an un-stirred infusion mash tun, while American six-row malt can mashed in a stirred mash tun with rice or corn adjuncts. Different types of malt with different degrees of modification, enzyme contents, and so forth are used with different types of equipment to make different types of beer.


Move grain from grain silos with an auger system. This enables grain to be moved through pipes.

, Arrange a contract with a hop supplier in order to secure a steady supply of hops at a certain reasonable price, if possible. Hops can be expensive and in short supply. Make sure that the hops are stored in sealed, airtight containers under refrigeration and that they have the right alpha acid content so that the proper amount of bittering will be contributed to the beer from the hops during boiling. Alpha acids become iso-alpha acids when they are boiled in the sweet wort that is produced during mashing and lautering. Hops may take the form of whole cone hops or pelletized hops. Pelletized hops are more resistant to spoilage or deterioration, and are merely whole cone hops that have been pulverized into a powder and shaped into pellets. Liquid hop extracts that are concentrated sources of alpha acids and, in some instances, already isomerized iso-alpha acids, are also available. Pre-isomerized extracts may be added directly to finished beer, although it is always still necessary to boil the sweet wort when making beer.

, Find a yeast strain from a yeast lab or use your proprietary yeast that will produce the type of beer that you want to brew, and have the proper quantity to pitch into the fermenter. Use absolutely hygienic, aseptic conditions and equipment when handling yeast so that the yeast does not become contaminated with wild yeast, unwanted strains of brewers yeast, or with bacteria. Wyeast Laboratories and White Labs will grow pure yeast strains for breweries as well as store and grow proprietary yeast strains in aseptic facilities. An industry standard for the amount of yeast to be pitched into beer is one million cells per milliliter wort per degree Plato of wort, although exact pitching rates are variable for different types of beer. Degrees Plato can be converted to or derived from specific gravity. Also use a quantity that will enable the yeast to multiply about five times before the fermentable wort sugars are consumed by the yeast. Buy liquid or dry yeast, depending on the sophistication of your brewing facilities. Store or propagate the yeast in a yeast propagator if necessary or desired. Also store yeast in the cooled cones of cylindroconical fermenters or in other vessels that are sanitary, cool, and sealed from incoming air. Be sure to let the CO2 that yeast generates vent out of the vessel so that too much pressure does not accumulate and create an explosive event.

, Start the steam boiler and keep it running so that steam is always available. Breweries require steam for various heating duties. Also have a hot conventional water heater for hot water, which is always required. Also use heated water that is returned from the heat exchanger.


Pipe the steam to the vessel heating jackets and other destinations.
Run the steam condensate back to a condensate reservoir that feeds the boiler. Condensate is a liquid that forms as steam condenses and forms liquid. When steam condenses, it gives up much energy, and therefore transfers heat to the material to be heated.

, Maintain cold glycol or other refrigerant to cool hot wort, maintain fermentation temperatures, and chill beer so that a consistent, quality product is produced. Pipe chilled glycol to cooling jackets and other destinations. Use a glycol tank as a glycol reservoir.

, A supply of carbon dioxide is required for pressurizing tanks, carbonation, and other brewery tasks. Use gas tubing to connect CO2 nozzles.


Pipe the CO2 to output nozzles inside the brewery.
Connect the CO2 to nozzles (often inputs) that are connected to tanks and other equipment.

, Clean hot-side brewery equipment prior to brewing. Clean and sanitize all hoses, pipes, fittings, pumps, heat exchangers, tanks, filters, and other equipment that will contact the cold-side wort and beer. Use caustic soda as a cleaner and chemicals such as peroxyacetic acid for sanitization. Ensure that all caustic and other cleaning chemicals are rinsed from the equipment before adding the sanitizer. Ensure that correct temperatures are used for all chemicals. Sanitize equipment soon before use to limit the chance that contaminating organisms will grow.


Use CIP (cleaning-in-place) for most brewery vessels. Use spray balls, gamma jets, or other CIP technology for cleaning duties whenever possible. CIP devices disperse water, cleaning agents, and sanitizer in closed vessels causing the entire inside surface of the vessel to be cleaned and sanitized. Also use CIP devices to heat and cool vessels with hot and cold water, respectively.
Use a centralized reservoir of cleaning and sanitizer solutions. Pump the solutions to the desired locations.
Use a keg washer to effectively clean and sanitize kegs. Keg washers also purge and fill kegs with carbon dioxide so that the beer that they are filled with does not become oxidized.

, Connect vessels such as the heat exchanger and fermenters with hoses and pipes, and ensure a sanitary connection that is not exposed to the atmosphere. Run cleaning solution and sanitizer through the pipes and hoses while they are connected to the vessels before using them.


Use gaskets between hoses and valves or other fittings to form a sanitary, leak-proof seal.
Keep a supply of hoses and hang them up to keep them clean and dry.
Use sanitary butterfly valves and ball valves for many brewery applications. Direct product and service fluids and gases to desired locations with such valves.

Use about one million cells per milliliter wort per degree Plato of wort. Discount dead yeast cells by staining them with methylene blue while counting them with the hemocytometer.

, Add the yeast to the fermenter to which the freshly brewed, chilled and oxygenated wort will be added. Pitch a specific, desired quantity using a device such a peristaltic pump. Pitch from a yeast propagator, yeast brink, or from the cone of a cylindroconical fermenter. Re-pitch yeast from previous fermentations a limited amount of times, perhaps twelve to twenty times. Repitch less for high-gravity beer, perhaps five to eight times. Discard old yeast. Test yeast for bacterial infection or unwanted mutations, and discard it if necessary. Infected yeast can be acid washed to kill the bacteria but not the yeast. Therefore, yeast must be discarded when contaminated with wild or unwanted yeast strains.


If desired, let batches of beer in open fermentation vessels ferment spontaneously. This involves letting wild airborne yeast inoculate the wort instead of adding pure-culture brewing yeast. This method will also allow airborne bacteria to inoculate the wort, although certain bacteria may be desirable for spontaneously fermented beer.

, Mill the correct weight of barley malt. Use the grain mill to break the barley malt into smaller particles. Set the mill gap to the correct setting, depending on the specific type or variety of barley malt, so that a correct crush is achieved. Ensure that the husk is essentially just broken in half and that the correct percentages of coarse grits, fine grits, and flour are achieved for the brew system and malt that are used. The grits and flour come from the inner starchy endosperm of the grain. This is converted into fermentable sugars during the mash by the natural barley enzymes.


Two roll, four roll, and six-roll mills can be used, depending on the type of malt and brew house used. Use two-roll mills with highly modified malt, such as traditional British two-row malt, and use six-roll mills with less modified malt such as American six-row malt.
Modification of barley malt occurs when living barley kernels are malted in a malt house. Malting involves germinating the grain and then kilning it. Modification is a natural process and occurs during germination. Natural barley enzymes work on the barley grain to break down cellular structures. Modification also involves the activation and synthesis of barley enzymes that are needed for the conversion of barley malt starch to fermentable sugars during mashing. When the cellular structures of the barley kernels are broken down, the grain also becomes more ""friable"" (easier to mill). Six-roll mills break up the malt more thoroughly, thus physically breaking up cellular structures that were not broken up enzymatically during malting.
Hammer mills that pulverize grain are used with mash filters instead of conventional lauter tuns. Wet mills keep the grain husk more intact than with conventional mills, and such mills may improve yield.
Grain can be automatically added to to mill from the grain silo and transferred to the grist hopper.

, Milled grain is referred to as grist. Account for the angle of repose that the grain will form in the hopper. Hoppers may be used to weigh the incoming grain, and milling can be shut off automatically when the correct weight of grist is obtained.


Use an auger system to move grist from the mill to the grist hopper if the hopper is located above the mash tun. If the grist case is located below the mill but the grist case is not above the mash tun, use an auger system to move the grist to the mash tun from the grist case when ready to mash in (add grist and water to the mash tun).
Make sure that the premasher plates that keep the grain from falling into the mash tun are in the closed position, especially if the grist hopper is situated directly above the mash tun. The premasher is attached to the top of the mash tun and is directly below the grist case or connected to the auger system that moves grist into the mash tun.

, Ensure that the hot liquor tank is filled, and heat the water to about 180 °F (82 °C) or higher without boiling it using the hot liquor tank steam jackets or other method. When brewing multiple batches of beer, be sure to use water that was heated when it passed through the heat exchanger to replenish the hot liquor tank. The hot wort is cooled with cold water to fermentation temperature, thus producing heated water and cooled wort.


Make sure that the cold liquor tank is full and in working order. As with most other tanks, use the attached level indicators to determine the volume of fluid in them. Level indicators may be narrow clear tubes that hang from the top to the bottom of the tank, and the level of fluid in them correlates with the level of fluid in the tank.

, Add some hot water to heat the mash tun and form a cushioning layer on the bottom of the mash tun.


Mash tuns can be stirred or unstirred, and can double as lauter tuns. Stirred mash tuns that are used with separate lauter tuns are typically smooth vessels that have a water inlet in their ceilings, and an outlet at their lowest point that allows the mash to be pumped to the lauter tun.

, Pull the mash tun premasher plates that will allow milled grist to fall into the mash tun and add hot water as well, allowing the grist to mix with the water in the premasher chamber that is attached to the top of the mash tun.


Let the mash tun fill with the water and grist mixture. If the mash tun is stirred, mix the grain and water mixture as it falls into the mash tun.

, Make sure that the desired mash temperature is achieved. Mix hot liquor and cold liquor (water) to achieve the proper temperature. The grain, mash tun vessel, and environment will absorb heat from the water, and therefore use water that is hotter than the desired mash temperature. Calculate the water temperature needed based on these factors. Allow all the desired grain and water into the mash tun in order to achieve the desired water to grist ratio. Use a flow meter to measure the water volume. Different volumes of water relative to grist weight are used depending on the brewing system and style of beer. A large factor involves the type grain to be used. For example, traditional British ales mashed in infusion mash tuns will use less water per unit grain. This is because infusion mash tuns are unstirred, but also because the barley enzymes that create sweet wort are preserved better in a thick mash. While traditional British malt is well modified, it is also low in enzymes. Six-row malt used to make beers such as Budweiser are very high in enzymes, and therefore a thinner, hotter mash can be used.

,


Use initial lower temperatures. These stages are referred to ""doughing in"" as well as the protein rest. The protein rest occurs at about 122 degrees, and may actually be best referred to as the beta-glucan rest, as it may help to break down beta glucans which can cause lautering difficulties. The protein rest may also induce malt enzymes to break down proteins or peptides, thus creating amino acids and/or small peptides.
Provide the natural barley enzymes with the proper amount of time and the proper temperature(s) needed to convert the barley starch to fermentable sugars. This phase is the conversion rest. The conversion rest may last about 90 minutes, depending on the type of beer being made and the type of equipment being used. The conversion temperature can be reached immediately after mashing in, or achieved by further heating the mash tun after mashing in.
Heat the mash tun. A ""programmed mash"" will use heating jackets or direct fire to incrementally heat the mash. However, the mash can also be heated by adding boiled adjuncts such as rice or corn. This is referred to as double mashing, and requires a separate cereal cooker. Adjuncts of course also add starch that must be converted to fermentable sugars by the malt enzymes during the conversion rest. Add ten percent barley malt to the adjunct in the cereal cooker and rest briefly at 158 degrees so that the alpha amylase enzymes from the malt can liquify the adjunct starch and make it pumpable. Otherwise, it will form a solid, unpumpable mass. As the boiled adjunct is pumped over to the main mash, it creates an increase in temperature that is referred to as a ""temperature ramp"". Another method involves removing a portion of the mash and placing it in a smaller, heated vessel. This is brought to a boil, then add back to the primary mash to increase the overall mash temperature. This is referred to as decoction mashing, and can involve one to three steps where portions of the mash are removed, heated, then returned to the main mash.
Attain the correct conversion temperature(s). Conversion temperatures are variable depending on the desired beer style, but temperatures between 130 degrees and 155 degrees results in adequate activation of the desired barley enzymes. A single rest at 149 degrees may be desired for certain styles of beer, especially traditional British ales. Provide a rest at 131 degrees to activate beta amylase and a rest at 149 degrees to activate alpha amylase in addition to beta amylase. Heat to 160 degrees or higher to inactivate and denature these enzymes. Beta amylase will begin to be deactivated when the mash is heated to temperatures that favor alpha amylase. To achieve a high degree of wort fermentability, ensure that beta amylase is adequately activated. To ensure that overall extract is achieved, and that the malt and adjunct starch is adequately converted to sugars and dextrins, ensure that beta and alpha amylase are adequately activated. They work together to break down starch.

, Prepare for pumping by first adding an initial shallow layer of hot foundation water to the bottom of the lauter tun that just covers the false bottom. Then pump over the mash. Use a properly sized centrifugal pump for most pumping duties. Most transfers in the brewery are conducted with pumps.

, After pumping over the mash, recirculate (vorlauf) the wort. This allows the wort to run through the grain bed, out the bottom of the lauter tun, then up to the top of the lauter tun and back through the grain bed again. Do this until the wort is relatively clear and free of particles. Then stop recirculating the wort and run it into the boil kettle from the lauter tun. Use the lauter tun to separate the converted sugars from the grain husks and other unusable grain material. Continually run the sweet wort into the boil kettle.


The grain bed rests on the false bottom (narrow grates) in the lauter tun. It forms a level, relatively compact filter bed that is established during the vorlauf phase. The wort flows from the grain bed and down through the grates, leaving the grain husks and other unwanted grain material behind. Ensure that the grain bed is very level and relatively undisturbed so that runoff is even and uniform.

, As wort enters the boil kettle, begin heating it with integrated steam jackets and/or internal or external calandria. Account for the amount of time that will be required to bring the wort to a full boil. Calandria operate by running wort through tubes that are surrounded by steam. The wort is heated to a boil as it passes through the tubes, and is circulated continuously.

, Spray the wort with hot water from above to rinse residual sugars from the grain. Continue running off the sweet wort that is now more dilute due to the addition of hot sparge water.

, Ensure that the clarity is good, and that there is not too much particulate matter.

, Cut through the grain bed to increase runoff. Use the rakes to reduce the change in pressure that occurs through the grain bed from top to bottom. Not all lauter tuns have rakes, and some mash tuns double as lauter tuns. Such mash tuns may be unstirred and may not be equipped with rakes.

, Remove the spent grain from the lauter tun after it has been drained of sweet wort and undesired liquid. Use a hoe or an auger to remove the grain.

, Arrange for a cattle farmer to pick up spent grain soon after brewing so that it can be a valuable food source for cattle and some other animals.

, Obtain the correct volume of sweet wort in the boil kettle, and bring it to a full, rolling boil. Use an internal or external calandria, steam jackets, or direct fire to heat the kettle.


The boil must be vigorous and active to mix the hops around and induce proper hop isomerization. Hop alpha acids must be isomerized during the boil in order to imbue bitterness to beer. Boil for 45 minutes to two hours, depending on the style of beer and equipment that is being used. Boil off the required volume and volatilize (boil off) unwanted compounds such as dimethyl sulfide, which is derived from the barley malt.
Keep the boil kettle closed or just cracked open so that heat is not lost and the boil is efficient.

, Check the specific gravity with a hydrometer or other device before and after boiling to obtain the correct gravity or sugar content for fermentation.

, After the wort has been brought to a boil, add the first hop addition to add bitterness and other hop characters to the wort. Then add additional hops later in the boil if desired. Flavor and aroma hops are added during or after the end of the boil, as the hop oils that contribute to flavor and aroma are lost if hops are added earlier. For lots of hop aroma, add hops during fermentation. This is referred to as dry hopping.

, Use the whirlpool to cause the wort to flow in a circular path, thus creating a force that causes unwanted trub particles to the center of the bottom of the whirlpool, separating them from the wort. Trub is coagulated protein, hop pellet particles, and other material that should not be in finished beer. Add hops to the wort in the whirlpool if desired. Whirlpools are commonly used, but some brewing systems may not use them. Brewing systems that use whole hops in conjunction with a hop back to remove trub should not require a whirlpool.

, Add the trub to the spent grain if desired. The trub is removed through the bottom of the whirlpool, and can be added to the spent grain trailer.

, Ensure that the wort is cooled to fermentation temperature. Ales may be fermented at about 68 degrees, while lagers may be fermented at about 55 degrees. Drain the whirlpool and simultaneously send the hot, whirl-pooled wort through the heat exchanger and to the fermentation tank. Maintain a higher pressure on the wort than on the coolant to prevent coolant leaks into the beer. Water used for primary cooling can cause microbial contamination. Food-grade glycol, generally used for secondary heat exchanger cooling (if needed) is not meant to be a food additive. Typical heat exchangers, such as the one pictured, are plate heat exchangers that cause product and coolant to flow near each other on opposite sides of the plates, and heat is passed from hot liquid to cooler or cold liquid.

, Send the cooled wort past an aeration/oxygenation stone using compressed oxygen from a gas cylinder. Oxygenation and carbonation stones are generally finely perforated stainless steel rods that allow fine bubbles of gas to enter the liquid wort or beer. Make sure that the wort is oxygenated to about twelve parts per million so that the yeast can multiply. Yeast consumes oxygen, but ensure that this is the only time in the brewing process that oxygen is added in order to avoid unwanted oxidation of the beer.

, Ensure that the fermenter is not overfilled, and when using cylindroconical fermenters about twenty percent of the overall capacity should remain unused. Add multiple, consecutive brews if the fermenter has enough capacity. Cylindroconical fermenters are closed to the open air and enable rapid, consistent fermentations. This is because the CO2 that is produced by the yeast during fermentation is evolved in part towards the bottom of the fermenter, and as a higher hydrostatic pressure exists at lower levels, the CO2 moves upwards through the center of the fermenter. As the CO2 moves upwards, a flow is produced that mixes the fermenting wort up through the middle then down past the sides and so forth. This causes mixing but also forces flocculated clumps of dormant yeast that is done fermenting and unwanted trub particles down to the cone of the fermenter, where they can be removed. One or more cooling jackets are built into the walls of the fermenters, and the fermenter cones are equipped with valves that allow beer and yeast to be added to the fermenter as well as removed. Ports that exist in the top of the fermenter are for the CIP device and addition of CO2 for top pressure as well as for the removal of CO2 that is produced by the yeast during fermentation. CO2 may be recovered from the tanks, purified, and used for brewery applications such as carbonation.


Open fermenters can be used to brew certain traditional ales, but open fermentation generally needs to be conducted in special sanitary rooms that are equipped or connected to special cooling devices. Entire lower floors may be occupied by cooling apparatus. CO2 must also be vented and monitored, as the CO2 produced by the yeast is free to move directly into open air. With traditional open ale fermentation, yeast is harvested (skimmed) from the top of the fermenting wort. This method allows results in the harvesting of relatively pure yeast, as much unwanted material including contaminating bacteria sink to the bottom of the fermenting wort and are not harvested with the yeast.

, Allow the fermentation gasses and yeast blow off from the top of the fermenter to pass into a bucket of water, thus sealing the tank from the atmosphere. Maintain the desired fermentation temperature with the cooling jackets that are built into the walls of the fermenter. Ensure that the heat that is generated by the yeast during fermentation is adequately counteracted by the cooling jackets. Measure the specific gravity to check the progress of the fermentation, and ensure that the sugars are being fermented by the yeast.


After the active, initial blowoff is complete, replace the bucket of water with a fresh one. The carbon dioxide that is generated from active fermentation will be visible as bubbles that pass from the hose and into the water, and this will subside as the sugars in the wort are consumed by the yeast.
End primary fermentation when a certain target specific gravity is reached. The specific gravity that determines the end of primary fermentation will vary depending on the method of secondary fermentation that is used, as well as the type of beer style that is desired.

, Cool the cone of the fermenter to about 41 degrees and the fermented wort to about 50 degrees (depending on beer style and brewing technique). Drop or transfer yeast and trub from the bottom of the cylindroconical fermenter. This is facilitated when the beer and yeast in the cone are cooled. Conduct secondary fermentation in the same fermenter. Some suspended yeast should exist in the beer, and therefore begin secondary fermentation when one to four million yeast cells per milliliter of beer exist. Also initiate secondary fermentation before all the fermentables have been consumed or add fermentables in the form of sugar or krausen (freshly fermenting young beer). The active yeast that is fermenting the residual fermentable sugar will metabolize compounds such as diacetyl during this period, causing the flavor to become more acceptable. Allow additional yeast and trub to fall into the cone over a period of time, depending on the type of beer that is to be produced. Allow about one week (perhaps only a few days) for ales and about two or more weeks for lagers. Dropping yeast removes a large amount of particulate matter, thus making filtration much easier and more efficient.


It may also be desirable to allow the beer to carbonate naturally during secondary fermentation, so it may be important to closely regulate the CO2 pressure that is exerted upon the tank and test the beer carbonation levels.
Age the beer if desired. Further condition the beer by aging it for extended periods of time. Use stainless tanks or oak casks. If making a beer such as a spontaneously fermented lambic, fruit may be added to the aging vessel. This will trigger an additional fermentation.

, After fermentation has been completed, cool the beer to prepare the beer for filtration. Ensure that the beer reaches 28 to 30 °F (−2 to −1 °C) so that filterable haze complexes are formed, and that filtration is therefore as effective as possible. Cool the beer in the fermenter using the cooling jackets or with a heat exchanger. Use the heat exchanger in-line between the fermenter and filter.

, Maintain 28 to 30 degrees and filter the beer. This temperature causes chill haze protein-polyphenol complexes to form, which can then be filtered out. Use a diatomaceous earth (DE) filter (also called a powder filter) for primary filtration, and a sheet and/or membrane filter for additional clarity if desired. The filter that is pictured is a DE filter. As beer is filtered, the small tank holds a mixture of DE and beer that is dosed into a stream of incoming unfiltered beer and then into the larger tank. The larger tank holds metal screens that catch the DE and filter the beer. Piping and a centrifugal pump that occupy the lower area of the filter move unfiltered beer that is dosed with DE and filtered beer. The unfiltered beer moves in from a secondary fermenter, is dosed with DE in a chamber that doubles as a sight glass, moves through the filter elements in the large tank, comes out of the large tank filtered, moves past a sight glass, and is then directed into a bright tank. See substeps below for more information.


Use specific grades of diatomaceous earth powder for specific filtration duties to achieve the desired beer clarity. It is common practice to use coarser DE for the pre-coat, and finer DE for dosing. DE is mined from natural deposits and is the fossilized skeletons of microscopic algae, also known as diatoms. DE is sold as a fine powder. This forms a filter bed that is referred to as a depth filter. Depth filters create ""tortuous paths"" that small particles become stuck in, but the paths are actually wider than many of the particles that are filtered. Finer grades of DE are used to filter out finer particles and also to better remove the polyphenol-protein complexes that form chill haze. However, finer grades of DE lead to less efficient filtration runs.
Put on an N95 dust mask before handling dry DE powder, as DE can cause lung damage.
To begin filtering, first run some beer out of the fermentation tank and ensure that it does not contain too many particles, such as lots of yeast. This material will make filtering too difficult or impossible. Run incoming beer through a sight glass to make sure that it is filterable, and deter initial un-filterable material so that it does not enter the filter.
Begin filling the smaller compartment (the dosing tank) with incoming beer, and mix it with DE powder. Also fill the larger compartment with unfiltered beer.
The larger compartment contains flat metal screens that will catch the DE.
Under pressure that is induced by the filter pump and the subsequent flow of beer, the DE will form a filter layer or filter bed on the screens. The screens without a DE layer don't actually filter the beer. Circulate DE and beer through the filter so that a filter bed of DE builds up on the screens, forming the pre-coat. Beer will enter the two opposing outer sides of the screens, then flow into a thin middle section or chamber inside the screens and down to a small outlet in the bottom. From here, the filtered beer will flow through piping, past a sight glass, and either be recirculated or sent to the bright tank. The beer is initially recirculated.
As the pre-coat forms and creates a filter bed, the beer will become relatively clear. When this happens, the beer is ready to be transferred to the bright tank. Check the beer through the sight glass to make sure that it is of acceptable clarity. Look for DE breakthrough, and check the flow rate if possible.
Begin transferring filtered beer to the bright tank while adding continuous, regulated doses of DE from the dosing tank. Let incoming beer flow through the filter and run out to the bright tank. As filtering is conducted under pressure, and be sure to watch the pressure gauge on the filter. The pressure will climb as particles are trapped in the DE and as additional DE is added. However, dosing in new DE keeps the pressure from increasing too rapidly. The flow rate will decline as the pressure increases and filtering efficiency drops. However, if the pressure drops during filtration due to pumping failure, the filter bed can break free from the filter screens and the filtration must be started anew. As such, if the filter pump stops running or takes up pockets of air or other gas, the flow of beer on the filter bed will be interrupted and the filter bed may fall from the plates.
The DE filter bed with thicken until there is not enough space between the screens, and they run together. The screens should be pulled and cleaned of DE before this happens.
If the screens need to be cleaned, be sure to sanitize the filter again before filtering more beer.
Store the filtered beer in a clean, sanitized bright tank. Be sure to displace air in the bright tank with CO2 before filling so that the beer does not come into contact with oxygen and become oxidized. Prepare the bright tank for the filtered beer before filtering.

, If the beer has not been carbonated naturally during secondary fermentation, or needs additional carbonation, use a carbonating stone to add a desired quantity (referred to as volumes) of carbon dioxide to the beer. For example, 2.6 volumes of CO2 may be desired. Alternatively, allow the beer to carbonate naturally with living yeast in the bottle. This generally requires that the beer be dosed with sugar or fresh wort. Beer can also be allowed to carbonate naturally in pressurized bright tanks prior to bottling.


Measure the carbon dioxide content of the carbonated beer before packaging. Use a testing apparatus to measure the carbon dioxide that is in the beer in order to be sure that it is completely correct.
Measure the oxygen content of the beer before packaging. It is informative to measure the oxygen content in the bright tank, as this is the end of the beer-making process. The beer is ready to be packaged at this point, and it is good to determine if it is within spec and read to be packaged. A high oxygen content is undesirable, as oxygen causes undesirable oxidation reactions.

, Bottle, keg, or can the beer for sale off-premises.


Keg the beer. Fill kegs with carbonated beer from the bright tank. If desired, use a flash pasteurizer to kill potential spoilage microbes in the beer before filling the kegs. Oxygen uptake is likely during this stage, and should be minimized by using packaging machines such as high-speed double evacuation bottle fillers. However, naturally conditioned beer that contains yeast is less prone to oxidation because the yeast rapidly consumes oxygen.
Bottle or can the beer. Bottle or can carbonated or uncarbonated beer from the bright tank. Uncarbonated beer that contains living yeast can be dosed with sugar or fresh wort and allowed to carbonate naturally in the bottle. Beer may be bottled using simple gravity fillers and $40 hand cappers or with more sophisticated machines, such as rotary bottle fillers. Try to keep the oxygen uptake low while bottling. If using simple machines, use beer that still contains living yeast, as the yeast will consume the oxygen as it is introduced to the beer. Yeast-free beer should be bottled with bottle fillers that evacuate the air from the bottle and replace it with carbon dioxide in order to prevent oxygen uptake. Beer can be pasteurized before bottling with a flash pasteurizer or after bottling with a tunnel pasteurizer. Naturally conditioned/carbonated beer cannot be pasteurized because the pasteurization would kill the yeast that produce the natural carbonation.
Box beer and stack the cases of beer on pallets. Wrap the pallets to make them ready for transport. Also put kegs of beer on pallets. If the beer is naturally conditioned/carbonated in the bottle, let the beer carbonate over a period of about two weeks before distributing it for sale.
Store beer that has already been carbonated (or that has finished carbonating naturally) in a cold room to preserve the quality of the beer until it is ready to be delivered.

, Check the color and look for particles, unwanted haze, and other desirable and undesirable factors.

, Use a tasting panel, a flavor wheel, and other methods to evaluate the flavor of the beer. Be sure to taste for diacetyl and other compounds that may indicate improper fermentation or a microbial infection.

, Use standardized devices to measure in-package carbonation, oxygen content, foam, haze or clarity, and other variables. Keep the oxygen content low to prevent unwanted oxidation. Maintain consistent carbonation levels. Test for bacterial contamination and other contaminants that may spoil beer and cause it to be aesthetically unpleasant. Use selective growth media to test for bacteria and wild or unwanted yeast strains.

, Use a delivery truck to distribute the beer to stores and restaurants. Also use established distributors and importers who can deliver your beer to their customers in various locales, such as different states and countries.

Choose a Morgan Grenache/Syrah.,
Choose a white wine.,
Choose a pinot noir.",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine2," At just $14 per bottle, the Morgan Grenache/Syrah might be the best bargain wine to pair with turkey. Grown and produced in California, this luscious red wine contains hints of black licorice, dark chocolate, cherry jam, and espresso. This wine is probably best if your holiday turkey is heavy on the seasonings., White wine tastes great with turkey. For instance, you might enjoy Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, or Riesling. Chardonnay is a white wine, typically dry, but fruity. Sauvignon Blanc has an acidic, herby taste that is not to be missed. Riesling, with its soft, fruity flavor also pairs well with turkey., A younger pinot noir – with hints of strawberries, cherries, and raspberries – is an ideal match for a turkey dinner.This sweetness will make the turkey even more delicious. Pinot noir is usually light to medium-bodied, and therefore won’t overpower the flavor of the turkey. Overall, the complex flavor profile of a pinot noir makes it versatile enough to pair not only with turkey, but with the whole array of holiday dishes that might accompany the turkey.Pinot Noirs produced in New York, California, and Oregon are the most prized.
While pinot noir can be hard to find at a bargain price, with some effort you can find one at less than $25 per bottle. The 2009 Sebastiani Pinot Noir by Sonoma Coast, for instance, costs $18. The 2010 Garnet Pinot Noir and 2009 Educated Guess Pinot Noir, both produced by Carneros, each go for $20 per bottle.
Similar red wines that might work well with turkey dinner include Beaujolais, Zinfandel, and Syrah.

Set your budget.,
Look for less renowned brands.,
Avoid wines with high production costs.,
Shop around.,
Buy holiday-themed wine right after the holidays.,
Buy in bulk.,
Buy boxed wine.",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine3," Choosing a bargain holiday wine means identifying what you mean by “bargain.” Are you looking for a wine under $35? Under $30? Under $15? Most bargain wines can be obtained for around $20, but you should customize your budget to reflect your own financial situation. Set your upper spending limit and only consider wines that fall below it., Brands that are very popular tend to be more expensive. If you’re looking for a bargain holiday wine, steer clear of popular brands, including:Black Box
Yellow Tail
Sutter Home
Carlo Rossi
Barefoot

, Wines that have high production costs and need a lot of fermentation time might be cheap, but they might not translate to high value relative to their taste. Many people find pinot noirs, for instance, too sweet and fruity.Grapes used to make Riesling wines, likewise, can be tough to grow., Different stores will often sell the same wine at different prices. You should check all your local wineries and liquor stores, as well as looking at places online. If you know the exact wine you want, you can save time by just calling the store and asking the price of the wine in question.
If you’re looking at prices online, be sure to factor in the cost of shipping. Sometimes a dollar or two saved off the base price can be lost by a three or four-dollar shipping cost.

, After the holidays are through, many holiday items – including bargain holiday wines – go on sale. Buy some of these bargain holiday wines (and even some normally non-bargain holiday wines that have become bargain wines) and store them properly for next year., Buying wine in bulk will give you a better deal. If you’re ordering online, you’ll be able to keep your shipping costs down by ordering more (up to a point). Retail wineries might offer discounts on bulk purchases, too. Try to buy by the case (12 bottles), especially if you have a big holiday office party or plan on attending several holiday parties., Boxed wine is wine that comes in a big plastic bag inside of a box. Some people turn up their noses at boxed wine, but it’s inexpensive, and if you can find some that is appropriate for the holidays, you could get a great deal.Pour the boxed wine into personalized, decorated bottles. Then, obtain some empty wine bottles from an arts and crafts store and use a funnel to fill it with the boxed wine.
Decorate wine cask with a label of your own making. Use construction paper to draw a logo and wine brand of your own invention. For instance, cut a strip of construction paper out and write “John’s Wine” in a florid script. Tape the label to the bottle. Your friends will get a kick out of it.
If you’re really creative, you could paint your favorite winter characters, like a snowman, Santa, or Rudolph the reindeer.For an even more personal touch, instead of buying boxed wine and pouring it into your customized wine casks, you could make your own bargain holiday wine and bottle it for the holidays.

Do a taste test.,
Do your homework.,
Ask for advice.,
Look for wine produced in wine-growing regions.",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine4," One of the great things about wine is that you can often try before you buy. If you patronize a specialty wine retailer, you’ll be able to sample the wines before you make your purchase. Tasting each wine will give you firsthand knowledge of all the subtleties of the flavor that you can’t truly get just by reading reviews or product descriptions online. Use this knowledge to choose a bargain holiday wine., If you can’t make it out to a winery, look up some bargain holiday wines online. Since wine quality and prices vary depending on the time of year, you should always investigate the current holiday’s wine picks and prices before making a decision. The internet contains a treasure trove of information about bargain holiday wines. Run a word string like “bargain holiday wines” through your preferred search engine. Click several results and use the information to decide how to move forward.There are also a number of free apps that allow you to scan wine labels in the winery with your phone, then check reviews from others who have tried them.
Delectable, for instance, is a free phone app that allows you to browse wines, read reviews, and have one delivered to your door.Sites like Wine Searcher – online at http://www.wine-searcher.com – can help you see what your local shops are holding.
After investigating, make a purchase if you find a wine that sounds good. Keep looking if you still have doubts about the ideal bargain holiday wine.
Remember, there are no right or wrong choices when buying a bargain holiday wine. Buying the “right” bargain holiday wine is largely a matter of personal taste. As long as you and your guests enjoy the wine, you’ve made a great choice!

, Talk to your local winemaker or shopkeeper for advice about choosing a flavorful but economical holiday wine. Their broad knowledge of wines, flavors, and prices will help you make a good decision. Say to them, for instance, “I am interested in a bargain holiday wine. Do you have any recommendations?”Share your upper spending limit with the winemaker. If your spending limit is $20, for instance, say, “I’m looking for a holiday wine under $20.”
If a shop is pushing an obscure and affordable wine, give it a try., Your holiday wine can taste great without breaking the bank. Good wine comes from good grapes, and some places around the world are more capable of producing a healthy grape harvest than others. A bargain holiday wine should come from one of these prime locations. Locations that support a thriving grape harvest include:Chile (well-known for its cabernet sauvignon)
South Africa (renowned for its chenin blanc)
New Zealand (celebrated for its sauvignon blanc)
California (popular for its red and white wines)

Think about sauces.,
Consider the bitterness in holiday meals.,
Pair dessert with a sparkling wine.,
Don’t try matching wines to sides.,
Think about your audience.,
Choose a wine that will please many people.",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine5," Dips, sauces, and gravies compose an important aspect of a holiday meal. You should choose a bargain wine that complements these flavors. Heavy gravies that incorporate cream or roux should have a wine with an equal viscosity and weight to them. Rich Chardonnays – for instance, Mount Eden’s 2012 Estate Chardonnay – makes an affordable yet full flavor choice., Dark, leafy vegetables like collard greens are a major part of many holiday meals. But these veggies can be alkaline, and so require a wine that balances their flavor profile with a higher acidity content. For example, you might opt for:Oregon Pinot Gris
Riesling
New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc
Vouvray
Willamette Valley Vineyards’ ‘Whole Cluster’ 2013 Pinot Noir

, For a budget pairing, you can mix Chambord and a sparkling wine of your choice – Asti Spumante or Prosecco, for example – in a champagne flute. This mixture yields a sweet flavor that goes perfectly with a slice of apple pie or a spiced cookie. This bargain holiday wine combo yields a sweet ending to any holiday get-together.Try a $13 2005 Foxglove Cabernet Sauvignon, or a $10 2006 Smoking Loon Cabernet Sauvignon. Both have fruity, full-bodied flavors with a bit of spice.

, Most holiday fetes will probably have a huge variety of side dishes. You won’t be able to get a holiday wine that pairs well with every single side, but you should try to find a wine that goes well with a variety of flavors. An off-white dry white wine like Vouvray is a good option.A good holiday wine will have an acidity level to counteract salty sides.
Holiday wines should also have a low-to-mild sweetness level that complements sweeter holiday flavors like pies and other desserts.

, There are as many wines as there are personalities. Who are you buying the wine for? Different people will have different flavor preferences. For instance, people who are quite picky might prefer a J.P. Chenet or a Merlot-Cabernet red wine. A family or group of friends with a more sophisticated palate might prefer an Clairette de Die or a Crémant du Jura. For a smaller holiday get-together, think about who you’re buying for and look for a wine with a flavor profile that will please them., Assuming you’re buying a holiday wine for a larger holiday get-together, you should choose a wine that is accessible and enjoyable for the greatest number of people. White wines or red wines are most likely to get a positive response.Gewürztraminer, Oregon Pinot Gris, Champagne, and Prosecco are some of the best white wines.
Zinfandel and Gamay-based wines are the best choice for red wines.

1 6-oz. package of Jello (170 grams)
Approximately 3 cups of water
Approximately 1 cup of chilled alcohol of your choice;
, The proportions will depend on the proof of the alcohol you use. Use the following ratios to ensure that the shots will set:


13 oz. (26 tbsp., 390 ml) of 30 to 50 (~20%) proof alcohol with 3 oz. (6 tbsp., 90 ml) water
10 oz. (20 tbsp., 300 ml) 80 to 100 (~45%) proof alcohol with 6 oz. (12 tbsp., 180 ml) water
6 oz. (12 tbsp., 180 ml) 150 to 200 proof alcohol with 10 oz (20 tbsp., 300 ml) water

, Wait until the mixture is completely chilled before moving onto the next step. This is important because the temperature at which alcohol evaporates (the boiling point) is 78.6 degrees C (173°F). Later you will mix the alcohol with a water that was just boiled at 100 degrees C (212°F). If the alcohol isn't cold, it might exceed its boiling point when mixed, and some of the alcohol will evaporate. This will make your shots less potent.

, You'll need exactly 1 cup of boiling water, so put a little more than that in the pot or kettle since some will evaporate.

Baileys is a drink made from Irish dairy cream and Irish whiskey, along with a blend of chocolate. You can use the Baileys Original Irish Cream, or you can experiment with some of their other flavors, like vanilla, hazelnut, or caramel.Kahlua is created from coffee and sugarcane rum.Amaretto liqueur is an almond-flavored, Italian liqueur., This isn't absolutely necessary, but many prefer the orgasm layered shooter to be served cold. Pop your bottles into the freezer, and they'll get cold pretty quickly.

To make the shooter extra chilled, put the shot glass in the freezer as well. This will give the glass a cool, frosted appearance.
Because the Baileys contains dairy, serving it chilled can make the orgasm shot seem almost like a mini-milkshake.

, The key to creating a layered shot is to start with the alcohol with the highest specific gravity, or the heaviest, and to layer in decreasing order. Kahlua has the highest specific gravity, so it needs to be poured first.

You can learn more about creating these layered drinks here!

The orgasm layered shooter consists of 1/3 Kahlua, so make sure you are careful to only fill the glass about 1/3 full with it.

, It's easiest to do this by transferring the amaretto into a second shot glass first, rather than pouring it directly into the glass from the bottle. If you pour it directly from the bottle, it can pour more quickly and forcefully than you intended, ruining the look of the shot. The trick is to pour the amaretto slowly and gently into the glass, so you disturb the bottom layer of Kahlua as little as possible.


Place the second glass containing the amaretto against the rim of the original glass.
Holding the original shot glass at an angle, pour the amaretto slowly against the side of the glass.Again, only pour until the glass is 2/3 full, leaving room for the top layer of Baileys.

, Create this layer the same way you did with the Kahlua. Transfer the Bailey's into another shot glass, and pour it slowly and carefully into the original glass. Pour it against the side of the glass, holding it at an angle.

, if you did it perfectly, you should be able to see three distinct layers of alcohol. If it doesn't look as great as you'd like, take the shot and start all over. Just remember to drink responsibly!


Remember that the shot will taste the same, regardless of its aesthetic appeal. If you are entertaining guests, they won't notice your mistake if you don't point it out.
Since drinking alcohol has a dehydrating effect, sip on some water in between orgasm shooters. Your body will thank you the following morning., To make a screaming orgasm shooter, try adding a layer of vodka to the top of the regular orgasm shooter. You can make it extra sweet by adding a little bit of whipped cream to the top of the shot, or even add sugar around the rim of the glass. Don't be afraid to play bartender and experiment a little bit with different flavors and brands!"

",How to Make a Slippery Nipple Layered Shooter,"


Estimate the capacity (volume) the shot glass or cordial glass. This can be done by eye or with measuring cups. The Sambuca will take up a about three-fourths of the glass, and the Baileys Irish Cream will take up about one fourth of the glass. The grenadine will take up a negligible amount of the glass. You don't want to overfill the glass, so leave a little extra space.;
,,, This can be done by pouring just a little bit of grenadine into a small measuring cup (such as a jigger) and, while holding the cup a few inches or more above the top of the cordial or shot glass, drip the grenadine onto the Baileys. The grenadine needs to pick up a little speed on its may down to the Baileys so that it can impact the layer of Baileys and form the nipple shape.

Make sure the bowl has a lot of headspace on top after adding the mixture. You will be adding a lot of other ingredients, so it's vital you make sure your bowl is big enough., After pouring your mixture into your bowl, measure out your chilled milk. Pour the milk into the instant pudding mixture. Use a spoon or wire whisk to stir into the milk until you have a smooth mixture.It's best to go for a wire whisk over a spoon. The milk will mix in much quicker with a wire whisk.

, Measure out your Bailey's and Kahlua. Pour these two liquors into the milk and instant pudding mixture., Use a wire whisk or spoon to mix all your ingredients together. Liquor will not mix into the pudding and milk without some effort. Stir continuously for a minute to get a smooth, even texture. Do not stop stirring until all your ingredients are mixed evenly., Pour your container of cool whip on top of the mixture of milk, pudding, and liquor. Use a large metal spoon or rubber spatula to fold it into the mixture.Folding in ingredients is different than stirring. Run your spatula or spoon around the side of the bowl. Then, fold the mixture over, pulling some of the pudding mixture over the whipped cream. Turn your bowl 90 degrees and repeat this pattern. Keep folding the mixture and then turning the bowl until everything is mixed evenly.It's important that you fold in the whipped cream instead of stirring it. Folding will combine your ingredients without removing air from the batter, allowing the shots to come out like pudding.

, After mixing all your ingredients, you may notice the batter is not quite green. If you want something greener for the season, stir in a few drops of green food coloring.Make sure to only to use very small drops of food coloring. Too much food coloring can affect the taste of your mixture.

, Set out shot glasses along a tray. Use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out your mixture and divide it evenly between your shot glasses. Fill the shot glasses so there's a small amount of headspace at the top. You will need this space later to garnish your shots.How many shots you will make depends on the size of the shot glasses.

, Your pudding needs time to set. Place your shot glasses in the refrigerator. Let them cool for an hour. When they're done, your shots should have a solid, pudding-like texture.If your shots are not solid enough after an hour, keep them in the fridge for a bit longer.

, You can use sweetened or unsweetened whipped cream to garnish the shots. Spoon a dollop of whipped cream on the top of each shot.If you want more green, try mixing a few drops of green food coloring into your whipped cream to turn it green.

, You can buy green sprinkles at most grocery stores. Sprinkle a small amount of green sprinkles over the whipped cream on top of your shot glasses. This adds a festive touch to your Saint Patrick's Day shots.You can also use green M&Ms if you want to add some extra flavor.

, Guests will not be able to take shots by drinking them. As your shots are made of pudding, have small spoons nearby when serving the shots. Your guests will eat the shots like pudding.

, Turn the spoon upside down, so the dome part is facing up. The tip should be touching the inside wall of the glass, just above the Kahlua.

, Make sure that you are pouring towards the hand that's holding the spoon. Move the spoon upwards as the liquid level rises in the glass. Don't let the tip of the spoon get inside the liquid.


Patience is key. The slower you pour, the better. If you pour too fast, the layers will mix.
Don't worry if the layers start to mix. If this happens, stop and wait a few seconds. They will eventually settle and separate.

, If you have extra time, you can chill wine to a more desirable temperature. From room temperature, full-bodied red wines require about 40 minutes of chilling in the refrigerator. Light-bodied white wines will need a full 2½ hours to reach serving temperature.

, From room temperature, white wines will need about 15 minutes of chilling, or 20 if they are light-bodied with low alcohol content. Medium-bodied reds will be ready after 10 minutes, and full-bodied reds can take as little as 5. Set an alarm if you are likely to forget about the wine, as it could freeze if left in too long.


The ice bucket method described below is even faster.

, If you want to maximize your control over the wine's temperature, use an infrared thermometer or contact thermometer from a kitchen supply store. Wine aficionados determine the optimal temperature to serve wine at based on its body, or the feel and apparent alcohol level in the mouth:Light-bodied white wines should be chilled to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). This includes Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and all sparkling wines.
Medium- to full-bodied white wines, such as Chardonnay and Sauternes, should be chilled to between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 13 degrees Celsius).
Light-bodied red wines like Pinot Noir and Merlot should be chilled down to between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 15 degrees Celsius).
Full-bodied red wines like Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Shiraz should be served at about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).

Rotate the bottle.,
Dry before serving.",How to Chill Wine2," This method can cool a red wine to serving temperature in two minutes, and even a light-bodied, low-alcohol white wine can be properly chilled in five to ten minutes.

, If you are using a wine bucket, fill it about ⅔ full of ice. For a larger bucket, fill it to approximately ⅔ the height of the wine bottle.

, Pour the coldest water you have access to into the bucket, until it is level with the ice.

, Salt lowers the freezing temperature of water, allowing the ice to cool the water a lower temperature than it would normally be able to. This in turn chills the wine bottle more quickly.


Smaller grains of salt tend to be more effective. Rock salt will work, but may have a less noticeable effect.

, Lower the wine bottle upright into the water. This should cause the ice water to rise above the shoulder of the wine bottle.

, Spin the neck of the bottle with your hands while waiting for the wine to chill. The movement will cause the wine inside to move around in the bottle, so more of the warm wine comes into contact with the chilled bottle, speeding up the process slightly.

, Remove the bottle when it reaches your preferred temperature, or after approximately 2 minutes for red and 7 minutes for white wine. Remove the bottle and dry it with a cloth or paper towel. Serve immediately.

Store horizontally, in a cool, dark place.,
Find alternatives to a wine cellar.,
Dig an underground storage space.,
Purchase a wine refrigerator.",How to Chill Wine3," Always keep your wines in an area under 70ºF (21ºC) and away from direct sunlight. Store horizontally on a wine rack to keep the cork moist., If you plan to age wines or store expensive wines, but don't have a wine cellar, use a basement or closet. The temperature should be close to 55ºF (13ºC), and the area should be quite humid. If this environment is not available in your home, move on to the options below.

, You can build your own cheap ""cellar"" by excavating a pit in a shaded area of your backyard. Place the wine bottles inside a wooden box, insulate the box on all sides with aluminum foil, and lower it into the pit. Cover the pit with plywood or any sturdy cover. Including a thermometer is recommended, since soil temperatures and climate can vary greatly, but as long as the temperature stays stable at a temperature between roughly 45–60ºF (7–16ºC), it can be used to store wine at larger quantities and lower expense than a refrigeration system.

, These are sometimes called electric wine cellars, and are the most expensive option for storing your wine, after hiring someone to dig a full-scale cellar! You may prefer to spend the extra money on pre-aged wines instead, but the wine fridge could be a good option if you have a few dozen bottles, or if you want to taste how different bottles of the same vintage age over time.


Full-featured models allow different temperature zones for different types of wine.

Chill vintage champagne between 54 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Fill a bucket with half ice and half water.,
Leave the champagne bottle in the bucket for 20 to 30 minutes.,
Pop the cork and serve.",How to Chill Champagne1," Vintage champagne, which comes with years printed on the label, should be served between 54 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is best achieved by using an ice bucket. An ice bucket usually has a slightly warmer temperature than you would get in your fridge., Grab a bucket big enough to contain a bottle of champagne. Fill the bucket with ice. Submerge the champagne bottle into the ice, so just the tip of the bottle sticks out.You can use a small thermometer to test the temperature of your ice bucket. You can add more ice to chill the bucket more. You can also add a small amount of water if the bucket needs to cool down.

, Simply let the champagne bottle sit in the bucket. You can set a timer on your phone or just keep an eye on the clock., After 20 to 30 minutes have passed, you can pop the cork on the champagne bottle. Make sure to aim the tip of the bottle away from any expensive objects before popping the cork. To serve, tilt the bottle at a 45 degree angle and fill a glass three quarters of the way full with champagne."

The salt draws heat out of the bottle of champagne, making it cool faster. To start, add some ice to a bucket of water. Add enough ice that, after adding about half a cup of water, you can submerge a bottle of champagne., Take a salt container and open the lid. Quickly shake the container over the ice, getting a generous amount in the bucket., About half a cup of tap water will usually do. You'll need to add enough that the ice is floating in the water, sort of like cereal in milk., The champagne will cool quickly using this method. You only need to leave the bottle in the ice for a few minutes. It should cool off sufficiently in roughly 3 to 5 minutes., Remember to point the bottle away from breakable objects when un-corking the champagne. Tilt the bottle at a 45 degree angle when serving and fill a cup about three quarters of the way full.

Magazines such as Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator offer monthly publications that contain a number of articles relating to learning about wine, wine production, and learning to enjoy wine.If there is a particular portion of winemaking or tasting that interests you, such as how soil impacts flavor or how to distinguish between wines by taste, look for a book on the subject.
Brochures from vineyards and distributors contain useful information about specific vintages and wine producers. Good wines come from good producers, so take a look to see who is well-regarded in the industry.
Go for tours and tastings at local vineyards. If there is a wine producer near you, do some first-hand research by attending a tour and tasting at their vineyard. This lets you ask questions directly from the people who make the wine.;
, Understanding the concepts behind what makes a wine good is important, but knowing what a good wine tastes like means actually tasting good wine. Find a tasting event at a local vineyard, wine store, or restaurant.


Look for events that offer a number of wines. New product or cask events usually focus on a single type of wine and do not offer the chance to become familiar with different types of wine. Try asking ""I like this type of wine. What else would you recommend based on that?""
Take a friend. Tasting are often part learning and part social. If you are uncomfortable going alone, bring a friend to learn about wine with you.
Ask questions. If there is a wine you like, ask who makes it, what region it comes from, and what year it was produced. Say ""I very much enjoyed this wine. Can you tell me more about who makes it and how it gets its flavor?"" Compare wines you like to see if they have something in common, such as coming from the same region.
Check the wine’s sight and smell, along with taste. Visual factors, such as a murky wine, as well sour or acrid scents may indicate that a wine is not good., There are reds, whites, and roses, but there are also different wines within those types. Read up on the basic wine types and their tastes to figure out what you might like.Chardonnay is a popular type of white wine. It is described as being buttery and often fruity with notes of apples and citrus.
Riesling is a sweet white wine with lighter, fruitier flavors than a Chardonnay. Its high acidity pairs well with spicy foods.
Sauvignon Blanc is an aromatic white wine with sharp, herbal qualities. It may also taste slightly of sour fruits.
White Zinfandel is a popular type of rose that is moderately sweet and a little dry. It is said to have citrus as well as candy notes, and is slightly acidic. It is best served cold.
Merlot is a soft red wine with plum-like notes that tends to be mellow from the day it is opened. It is well-liked for its underlying chocolate flavors.
Cabernet Sauvignon is a darker, bolder red than a Merlot. It sometimes has a berry-like taste to it, and ages very well.
Pinot Noir is a red wine that is often described as tasting like red fruits such as cherries and strawberries.
Syrah, also known as Shiraz, is a bold, sweet red wine that is often cited as tasting spiced. Syrahs age well, and are said to go wonderfully with grilled meats.

, This allows you to keep track of what wines you enjoyed and which ones you did not. It also lets you take note of specific things that you enjoy in a wine, so that you can better understand your personal pallet.You can find journals made especially for logging wine online and in some bookstores and wine stores. These give you specific prompts and notes to keep your records consistent.
Alternatively, you can always use a simple notebook to keep track of wines you have tried. Note the type of wine, the vineyard, the vineyard location, the date, and your own tasting notes.
Note things like taste, color, and smell. Was the wine sweet? Was it sour? Did it remind you of chocolate? Was it bright red or dark red? Did it smell grassy? Did it smell like fruit?
Always include a simple note stating whether you liked the wine. This could be as simple as writing “good” on the top corner of the page, or you could create your own rating system.

, Every wine store is different, and you will find that each store offers different selections, different price ranges, and different styles of business.


Stores with organized wine tastings, or those that allow you to buy a glass of wine in order to try it, can lead you in your quest to purchase good wine.
Find a store where you feel comfortable going in and asking questions. You want a wine store with a staff that will not only help you understand your wine choices, but also make you feel comfortable coming to them with your questions.
Be willing to try more than just specialty shops. Some liquor stores as well as grocery stores carry a wide variety of wines. Look in different places to find different selections.

, Consider the price of the wine, but do not solely base your decision on this factor. These days, it is not uncommon for wines to be priced based on factors not related to taste.


The business costs of the winery, including start-up costs and investment amounts, can be factored into the price of a wine. Wines from newer vineyards may cost more but may not taste any better.
The location of the winery can affect the cost as well. A bottle from a traditional wine region may cost more than a better tasting bottle from a lesser known region..
Some established wineries sell their wines under a different label at a cheaper price.

, Ignore the idea that bottles of wine with screw caps are not considered to be good wines. An increased number of wine producers are forgoing corks.Screw caps can prevent corkiness, which is when the natural corks produce a smell similar to wet cardboard.
Screw caps also keep bacteria out of wine and allow opened wines to stay fresher longer. Seriously consider a screw cap if you are buying a bottle that will take longer than one night to consume.

, Some wines get better with age, but many wines are finished aging by the time they are bottled. Look for the freshest wine you can get to ensure you have a good bottle.Wines labeled or stocked as “fine wines” in your wine store may be better with age. Consult with your wine store’s expert if you are looking for a fine wine.
For standard wines, such as those you buy from a grocery store, find the most recent vintage available. This helps prevent getting a corky or spoiled wine. Look to the back of the shelves, as stores often move older stock to the front.

, What you eat can drastically change the flavor of your wine. Buy a wine to match your meal so that you get the best flavors from your wine as you enjoy your food.Salty and savory foods go well with sweet wines.
White meats tend to pair better with white wines, while red meats usually pair better with red wines.
Lighter white wines usually work best with seafood.
Sweet foods are complemented by sweet white wines as well as dessert wines.
Spicy foods work best with Rieslings and Gewürztraminers.
Vegetable dishes work best with rich whites and light reds, such as Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.
When there are a number of different flavors or food options, look for a wine that is well-balanced and not too extreme in taste.Sauvignon Blancs and Pinot Noirs are generally consistently good and not too offensive with any particular pairing., There are a number of clubs, such as the International Wine of the Month Club, that will mail you a bottle or a case of wine on a monthly basis. These clubs send you a curated wine, sparing you the stress of picking a bottle and allowing you to try something new.Find a club that is catered to your interests. If you like local wine, see if there is a local wine club. If you only like reds or whites, find one that allows you to receive only the type of wine you like.
If you find a wine you enjoy, check with the club or the producing vineyard to find out where you can buy it locally.

, Smartphone apps like Wine Ring let you record the wines you like, then give you recommendations based on your preferences.Use it along with or instead of a wine journal to rate wines you like.
Get specific vintage and vineyard recommendations for other wines that you might enjoy based on your preferences. Use this to make shopping for wine at the grocery store easier.

, Buying a good wine doesn’t mean much if you don’t serve it the right way. Using the right glass, keeping your wine at the right temperature, and letting certain wines breath can all impact how good your wine tastes.


Serve your red wines in large, wide-bowl glasses and whites in smaller, more enclosed glasses. Fill the glass a third of the way, leaving room for air to meet the wine and release aromas in the glass.Not all whites are chilled and not all reds need to be room temperature. Consult the bottle to see if the wine producer recommends keeping the bottle cold, or if it is best left at ambient temperature.
Aerating your wine allows it to oxidize, which helps get rid of sour and undesirable flavors. Pour your wine into a decanter or a wide-mouth glass pitcher an hour or so before you serve it to get rid of some harsh flavors., If you are going to switch between multiple wine types in one sitting or during the same meal, cleanse your palate in between each wine. This keeps the flavor of the old wine from interfering with the flavor of the new wine.Crusty bread is often used as a palate cleanser during wine tastings to help soak up the flavor as well as the alcohol.
Cheese works particularly well with red wines to remove the tannic flavors.
The salty flavor of olives can help clear away sweet wine flavors.
A glass of room-temperature water cleanses the palate without requiring you to eat.

, Get the most from a good wine by making sure you store it properly after you open it. This keeps the flavors sealed in for as long as possible.Store your wine upright to minimize the amount of wine coming in contact with the air.
Use the cork, screw cap, or your own wine bottle stopper to seal the bottle opening.
Store your wine at a temperature below room temperature. If you can, put open bottles in the fridge.
Drink the rest of your wine within 5 days to keep it from spoiling.

, It's often possible to get better deals on a particular style of wine by picking a lesser-known appellation or an up and coming wine region.


Up and coming wine regions include: Clare Valley, Australia, Hill Country, Texas, La Mancha, Spain, Mendoza, Argentina, Douro, Portugal, Central Valley, Chile and Sicily, Italy. They have great wine for a lower price than other regions in their respective countries.
Some wines can be from a well-known region without a well-known name. For example, in Southwestern France, Bordeaux and Cotes-du-Rhone are well known appellations, but their neighbors like Languedoc, and Pic St. Loup offer similar taste at a portion of the price. If you like Pacific American wines, Washington's Columbia Valley outscores Napa in many wine taste tests, but it is consistently sold for less.

, Many supermarkets or liquor stores have free tastings of new wines to encourage buyers. If you frequently shop at a local wine store, ask them if you can taste certain wines before you buy them.

, Sites like The Budget Wino and Vino 100, post ratings and reviews on bottles under $10 and $20, respectively. Even Consumer Reports lists holiday wine deals.


Keep a list of wines you like, so that you can check for sales in local ads and supermarkets.

, Some supermarkets offer you a discount if you buy 6 or more wines. Ask the supermarket or wine store if you can buy the wine by the case to receive a deeper discount, or mix and match a case of wine.

, During the holiday season, these stores discount a large number of wines.

Choose the wine with the largest discount over the cheapest wine. Many supermarkets display both wine that's always inexpensive and wine that's marked down. If you are buying budget wine that you are not familiar with, it is best to aim for something you may not have a chance to try if it were full price.

, They often list reviews on bottles of wine and offer larger quantities for a cheaper price, or single bottles at a few dollars less than the supermarket price.

, Many websites like Wine.com Beverages and More (BevMo) has a sale every year that allows you to buy and ship 1 bottle at full price and the second bottle for 5 cents.

, These bottles are marked up extremely high and are not budget-friendly.


If you do buy from a restaurant wine list, don't be afraid to buy the cheapest bottle of wine. Some of the bottles with the highest mark up are hidden as the second or third cheapest on the menu.

Learn the proper conditions for aging wine.,
Determine which wines can benefit most from aging.,
Always store wine bottles on their side.",How to Age Wine Without a Cellar1," While it is aging, wine needs to be kept at a constant, chilly temperature and a relatively high humidity. It needs to be kept as dark as possible and disturbed as little as possible.


The aging temperature is perhaps the most important criterion. Fifty-five degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) is the ideal temperature. Any colder and the wine will barely mature in flavor, while warmer temperatures will lead the wine to mature quickly and clumsily, soon deteriorating into a worse state than that in which it began.
Temperature swings must also be avoided. Because wine cellars are nearly always dug into the earth at basement level, their temperature is regulated by the insulating properties of the surrounding mass of soil. Avoid storing wine in any area where drafts, sunlight or any other factor will produce temperature swings.
High humidity is also an essential factor. A humid wine cellar prevents each bottle's cork from drying out and losing its seal. Once the seal is broken, a wine spoils very quickly.
Low light and movement are the final important considerations. Excessive light can damage and degrade the wine through the glass bottle. Disturbances, such as picking up or rotating the wine bottles, can disrupt the delicate chain of chemical reactions that leads a wine to mature well.;
, The vast majority of wines produced in the world are intended for immediate consumption, and will actually deteriorate if you attempt to age them. However, some wines age well for a handful of years, while a select few can benefit from several decades of maturation.


If you are new to aging wine, consider starting with some robust, highly tannic reds. Big, flavorful Bordeaux and Cabernets will benefit immensely from the softening of the tannins that aging provides.
Other types of wine that benefit from aging include Port and various dessert wines. Whites wines generally do not require aging, although more complex vintages of Chardonnay, Riesling, or Sauternes can mature well over a few years.

, A final consideration when aging wine is the position in which the bottles are stored. Wine should always be stored on its side, which keeps the cork moistened and prevents it from drying out.

Purchase a freestanding wine cellar.,
Position the freestanding wine cellar in an ideal location.,
Keep track of the wine in your freestanding cellar.",How to Age Wine Without a Cellar2," The most effective way to age wine without a cellar is by buying an electric aging unit. These appliances function very much like refrigerators, and offer precise control of temperature and humidity conditions.


A chief downside to these units is their hefty price tag. Before purchasing them, consider whether you wouldn't rather spend that money on better quality wines for immediate consumption.
To determine how large a unit you'll need, do a little math. If you hope to drink 1 bottle of aged wine per week, and would like to age each wine for 5 years, then you'll need (5 * 52) or 260 bottles of storage space.

, The wine cellar will do a good job of controlling temperature and humidity by itself, but you will need to locate it properly to keep the light and disturbance to a minimum. Place the wine cellar in a dark location where it will be safe from possible disturbances, for example by curious children.

, Many freestanding units have individual racks that slide out gently, allowing you to identify your wines without disturbing them much. However, you may still want to begin keeping a wine aging log so that you know how long each bottle has been aged.

"
"
Find an ideal location in your home for aging wine.,
Assemble wine racks in your storage space.,
Monitor the wine's quality closely.",How to Age Wine Without a Cellar3," A frugal option for aging wine without a cellar is by finding a room in your home that approximates the ideal aging conditions as closely as possible. Look for an area that is dark, cool, humid, and is not subjected to swings in temperature and humidity. Basements and closets along cold exterior walls are possible choices.

, After selecting a location, assemble several wine racks so that you can age bottles on their side. Remember that your intended consumption rate will determine how much aging space you need. Make sure the wine racks are positioned such that they do not need to be moved once in place.

, In an improvised cellar space like this, you won't generally be able to get away with aging wines for 10 or 20 years. Instead, aim for a maximum aging period of only a few years, and try to select wines that will benefit well from this short period.


As a way to test your improvised cellar's aging abilities, begin by placing 5 - 10 bottles of the same vintage wine in the cellar. At the end of each year, remove 1 bottle and drink it. This will help you determine whether your wine will continue to improve over this period, or at what point the wine will peak and begin to deteriorate.

Calculate how much wine you'll need.,
Pair the wine with any food to be served.,
Consider the costs.,
Factor in the time and day of the event.,
Consult your local wine merchant.",How to Buy Wine for a Crowd,"


The average guest will drink 2 glasses of wine per hour, with each pour being about 4 oz. (120 ml). Multiple the number of people attending your party by 2 (2 glasses each per hour) and then multiply that number by the approximate length, in hours, of the party. Therefore, if you have 20 guests, they'll consume 40 glasses of wine per hour. For a 3 hour party, that's about 120 glasses of wine. Divide that number by 6, which is the number of 4 oz. (120 ml) glasses per bottle, and you'd need 20 bottles of wine for your guests.;
,


White wines classically pair with fish, lighter dishes and cocktails. Red wines, especially full-bodied ones, pair better with beef and game meats, pasta and heavier dishes. If you're offering a variety of foods it is best to include a variety of wines such as a Riesling, which is a lighter, sweeter white, a Chardonnay that is full-bodied and aromatic and a drinkable red such as a Merlot.

,


Wine prices can vary greatly from inexpensive to very costly. Perfectly good wines can be purchased for around $10.00 USD per bottle, and if you buy by the case, most wine merchants will discount the price by 10 percent. If the occasion is more intimate with fewer guests, then buying some better bottles of wine might be in order.

,


People will generally drink less wine for a morning or early afternoon event compared to an evening one, and events held on the weekend will require more wine than those during the week. Most wine merchants will refund unopened bottles of wine if you buy large quantities and arrange this with them ahead of time. If your event is on during the evening and on a weekend, allow for 1 or 2 extra glasses of wine per person per hour.

,


Your local wine merchant is a valuable resource who can guide you on wine selection. He might suggest certain wines that are more suited to the season of the event, or ones that might be popular in that particular area. Always ask the wine merchant for their advice and suggestions.

Open up a bottle of red wine.,
Pour the wine into a blender.,
Close the blender and pulse it on high for 15 to 30 seconds.This will help mix air into the wine and soften tannins.,
Pour the wine into wine glasses and serve.",How to Aerate Wine1," If it is under eight years old, chances are, it will be slightly tannic. If the wine is older, it won't need any aeration.;
, If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor with a blade attachment.

, Don't worry if you see bubbles forming. This is simply the air bubbles, which will help aerate the wine.

, For a better presentation, you can also use a funnel to pour the wine back into its original bottle.

"
Use quality wine ingredients.,
Use the correct bottles.,
Control the temperature.,
Consider the position of the bottle.,
Control the humidity.,
Store the wine at home.,
Store the wine off-site.",How to Age Homemade Wine,"


The first step to ensuring that the wine aging process goes well is to make the wine using quality ingredients. Using boiled water, quality grapes and other high end ingredients is essential to making a good quality homemade wine. The better the quality wine you make, the better it will age.;
,


Red or rose wines need to be stored in dark colored bottles; otherwise the wine can become discolored. Homemade red wines can be stored for up to 18 months or longer, if it is a dessert wine. Properly sterilized and sealed bottles are also necessary for aging wine.

,


Homemade wines don't follow the same rules as those made at wineries, where the wine is stored in casks for much longer. Once bottled, your homemade wine should be stored between 50 and 60 degrees F (10 and 15 degrees C). Keeping a consistent temperature is key; fluctuating temperatures can dull the flavor of the wine, it can lose its aroma, and any special flavor notes you were looking to give it might be lost.

,


Experts are not in agreement on how the bottle should be stored for aging. Some experts say that an upright bottle will allow any residual sediment to fall to the bottom, while others claim that a bottle on its side is the best, especially if the bottle is corked. Some humidity is needed to keep the cork from drying out, but even on its side, one end of the cork will be exposed to less humidity. A large number of bottles are best stored on their side as they will be more easily accessed and will take up less storage room. Sparkling wines and champagne, however, should be stored upright because the trapped carbonic gas bubble prevents the contents from spoiling due to exposure to oxygen.

,


Wine bottles that are sealed with corks require that they be stored in a humidity controlled environment. Humidity levels of 55 to 75 percent will prevent the cork from drying out and shrinking. If the cork shrinks the wine could leak out, and oxygen can get in and cause the wine to spoil.

,


Most homes aren't equipped with underground wine cellars that remain cool and humid all year long. There are, however, wine storage cabinets that you can purchase. They can be adjusted to maintain whatever humidity and temperature level you choose. Most homemade white wines can be enjoyed soon after bottling so long term storage isn't necessary. Expensive wines, or batches you want to preserve, should be stored properly at home.

,


Some companies offer wine storage. These facilities are humidity and temperature controlled for optimal wine storage. Some wine making supply stores offer storage facilities.

Get two pitchers.,
Pour a bottle of tannic red wine into the first pitcher.,
Pour the wine into the second pitcher.,
Continue pouring the wine back and forth between the pitcher.,
Serve the wine.",How to Aerate Wine2," You will be pouring the wine back and forth between the pitchers, so it might be a good idea to use ones that are lightweight and easy to handle.

, If the wine is under eight years old, it will probably be somewhat tannic and need aeration. If the wine is older than it, you won't need to aerate it.

, Don't worry about how fast or how slow you do this. You will be doing this repeatedly, which will help aerate the wine.

, Do this for a total of 15 times., At this point, you can pour the wine into the wine glasses, or you can pour it back into its original bottle. Place a funnel into the neck of the bottle first, so that you don't spill any wine.

Read the label.,
Understand the classifications for organic wines.,
Know that wine that has had sulfites added to it can still be organic.,
Research the vineyard before you buy the wine.",How to Buy Organic Wine," For a wine to be labeled “Organic” and bear the USDA organic seal, it must be made from organically grown grapes and give information about who the certifying agency is. A wine in this category cannot have any added sulfites. It may have naturally occurring sulfites, but the total sulfite level must be less than 20 parts per million., The classifications below apply to wines produced in the United States.


”100 Percent Organic” printed on the label means that the wine was made from 100% organically grown grapes and does not contain added sulfites.
”Organic” printed on the label means the wine was made from at least 95% organically grown grapes. The other 5% of the ingredients in the wine were not produced organically, or another ingredient, such as yeast, was added.
”Made with organic ingredients,” “Made with organic grapes” or “Organically grown” printed on the label means the wine contains at least 70% organic ingredients. The other 30% of ingredients were not grown organically.

, Sulfite (sulfur dioxide) is used as a preservative in wines. Many wines are made from 100% organic grapes, but they may contain a small amount of sulfites. Wine exported to the United States, even though it is made from organic grapes, cannot be labeled “organic.”If the total sulfites in a bottle of wine are above 10 parts per million, the label must state that the wine contains sulfites. If that is the case, you may not want to purchase the wine, even if it is made from organic grapes. Look for a statement on the label that says, “No added sulfites.” That doesn’t mean it is sulfite-free, but it does mean there are probably some naturally occurring sulfites in the wine due to the fermentation process.

, There are many small family-owned vineyards that grow organic grapes and bottle organic wine, but they don’t get themselves certified. Why? The certification process is restrictive and the costs are prohibitive.

Identify the strain of grape in your wine to determine the proper length of aging.,
Store red wine for aging.

,
Lay the wine bottles on their sides (a sturdy wine rack works best) in a wine cellar or basement in cool temperatures at a steady 55 to 65 degrees F (12.79 to 18.36 degrees C).",How to Age Red Wine,"


Red Bordeaux: 5 to 20 years (fruity, oaky).
Cabernet Sauvignon: 5 to 15 years (mild to hearty).
Merlot: 2 to 8 years (mellow, compliant).
Barolo: 5 to 10 years (thick, complex, flowery).
Chianti: 0 to 7 years (strong, bold, fruity).
Pinot Noir: 0 to 5 years (more complex, less fruity).
Shiraz/Syrah: 5 to 12 years (peppery, berry/plum).
Sangiovese: 5 to 10 years (fruity, hefty).
Red Zinfandel: 5 to 10 years (fruity, spicy).
Vintage Port: 10 to 20 years or more (rich, sweet).
Red Rioja: 4 to 10 years (bold, berry taste).;
,,


If you do not have a basement or cellar there are many specialized refrigeration units for wine on the market that will maintain your investment and do all the work for you.
Keeping the temperature at a constant is crucial to slowing down the aging process.
Extreme changes in the core temperatures will expand and contract the wine which will push or pull on the cork, resulting in oxygen entering, thus spoiling the wine.
Keep a digital air thermometer on hand to monitor the temperature.

Choose a wide neck decanter for aeration.,
Buy a thin neck decanter to separate the wine out of sediment.,
Pick a wine decanter shaped for easy pouring.,
Find a decanter with a broad middle.",How to Buy a Wine Decanter1," Exposing the wine to air before serving is one of the primary purposes of a decanter. A wide neck decanter will give your wine ideal exposure and bring out more flavors within your wine. Because you'll be able to taste more, wide neck decanters are great for making young wines taste complex.Wide neck decanters are also better for cheap wines, as aeration will make the wine taste richer.
Generally, wide neck decanters are easier to clean.;
, Because a narrow neck lets less air in, thin neck decanters are not as good at aerating wine. They are, however, much better at sifting out sediment. For expensive, aged wines, thin neck decanters offer a cleaner flavor.Thin necked decanters often come with a special brush for cleaning.

, Decanters in odd shapes can make it challenging to pour without dripping. You don't want to stain any counters or waste expensive wine. Decanters with mouths wider than their neck will make for mess-free pouring., Decanters with wide middles give the wines room to aerate before serving. After a wine has been stored in a bottle for several years, it takes time to aerate. In decanters with a narrow surface area, the wine will take much longer to react with air and bring out its flavors.Decanters with the most surface area in the middle will need around an hour to achieve its ideal aroma and taste.
To speed up the decanting process, swirl the wine around so it receives more air."
"
Choose a red wine glass with a large bowl.,
Pour some tannic red wine into the glass.,
Set the wine aside and let it breathe for at least 45 minutes.The younger the wine is, the longer it will need to sit.,
Swirl the wine in its glass and take a sip to test the flavor.",How to Aerate Wine3," Red wine glasses are different from white wine glasses for a reason: to help aerate the red wine.


If you are serving a larger number of people, you can use a red wine decanter instead; choose one with a larger bowl.

, Stop pouring at the widest part of the glass. This will allow more of the wine to come in contact with the air. It will also prevent any sloshing or spilling when you swirl the wine.As you pour, try to hold the bottle about 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) above the glass. This way, the wine will be exposed to more air on its way into the glass.

, For example, a young wine might need to sit for up to six hours, whereas an older wine might turn to vinegar after one hour.If you are pouring an old, fragile, and mature wine, drink it within 30 minutes. Don't let it sit any longer than that.
Lighter bodied red wines, such as pinot noir's, typically need only 15 to 20 minutes to breathe, if that.

, Swirling the wine in the glass helps aerate it further.

"
Decide whether you need a large or small decanter.,
Buy a decanter made of crystal or standard glass.,
Choose a wine decanter with a stopper.,
Choose a decanter especially made for certain wines.",How to Buy a Wine Decanter2," Most decanters are meant to hold one glass at a time, but larger options are available. The largest decanter you'll want is one made for a bottle of wine. Any bigger, and you're reducing the surface area of wine exposed to air (and thus its effectiveness)., Unless you're buying an antique decanter, these will be your options. Crystal decanters are durable and decorative, allowing for more intricate designs. Glass is cheaper and more resistant to corrosion.Do not buy crystal decanters made before 1969, as these are usually made of lead crystal. Lead crystal can leach out into your drink and cause poisoning.Crystal decanters are known for their clarity. Even the cleanest glass decanters will be slightly foggier.

, After sitting in a decanter from 18-24 hours, your wine will lose its flavor without a stopper. If you don't plan on drinking your wine directly after serving, use a stopper to preserve its flavor and aroma (especially if you're serving an aged wine). Not all decanters come with a stopper, so keep this in mind while shopping.Remove the stopper around an hour before serving so your wine has time to aerate.
Wine will last between 3-5 days with a stopper, on average. Sparkling wine will not last as long, and light or fortified wine will last longer., If you have a preference for red or white wines, you could buy a decanter specially made for your favorite kind. White wine decanters keep the drink at a cooler temperature, and red wine decanters usually have thinner necks for separating sediment.

You can also choose decanters made for a only one type of wine, like merlot, chardonnay, or pinot noir decanters.

"
"
Choose between function and fashion for your decanter.,
Find a clear wine decanter, and avoid frosted or colored glass.,
Pick a design that will be comfortable to use.,
Buy a design that will be easy to clean.",How to Buy a Wine Decanter3," Some high-end decanters are made to be aesthetically-pleasing. You may prefer an expensive crystal decanter that doubles as a stunning work of art to woo your guests. Simpler styles, however, can compliment wines with rich colors (like deep red wine).

Artsy-looking decanters are harder to clean and not usually dishwasher-safe.
Don't buy a decanter that will break your bank. High-end decanters usually work as well as more affordable options. The raise in price is mostly artistic appeal.

, Frosted decanters or stained glass designs can look beautiful but will ruin the purpose of your decanter. If you're unable to look inside the decanter, you won't be able to tell if the sediment has separated in your wine/

Hand-blown glass decanters are a great alternative for frosted glass, if you want an artisan look and clear glass.

, While some use wine decanters only for special occasions, others use theirs on a daily or weekly basis. Choose a decanter that will be comfortable to handle and you won't feel nervous to break. Fancy designs can be fun, but you don't want to pick a decanter you could easily drop., If you can't rinse your decanter out well enough, the taste will be ruined by older wine residue or soap. When shopping for decanters, decide whether the design will be difficult to clean. Avoid decanters that will involve intensive cleaning if you do not have the patience.Check whether your decanter is dishwasher-safe before buying.

Buy an appliance timer and thermometer.,
Set up the timer.,
Turn the power setting to the lowest possible and put the thermometer in the mini fridge.,
Set the appliance timer to raise the mini-fridge's temperature to 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C).",How to Turn Your Mini Fridge Into a Wine Refrigerator1," You can find an appliance timer in most hardware stores in the lighting section. Refrigerator thermometers are pretty easy to find. You can get them at pretty much any grocery store.;
, Plug your mini-fridge's power cord into the appliance timer. Then plug the appliance timer into the outlet.

, Allow it to run, and take the temperature. Once it is below 55 degrees F (proper wine storage temp) then move on to the next step.

, Basically, the appliance timer can be set to intervals which will turn on and off power to the mini-fridge. This will effectively raise the temperature enough to make it a good place to store wine. Start with 2 hours on, 2 hours off intervals. If you start with this, and the temperature ends up above 56 degrees F, adjust the timer so that it has longer on settings, like 2 1/2 hours on, 1 and 1/2 hours off. Likewise, if the temperature reads too low, adjust your timer so that it has longer off settings, 1 1/2 hours on and 2 1/2 hours off.

Gather supplies.,
Build a still.",How to Make Moonshine1," It's important to use the right supplies when you're making moonshine, because using equipment made from the wrong material can backfire - literally. For the sake of safety and the best chance of making true moonshine, collect the following supplies:


A pressure cooker. Use one you don't intend to use for other purposes, or buy a new pressure cooker specifically for making moonshine.
Copper tubing. You'll need about two yards of tubing that is 1/4"" in width. This can be purchased at a hardware or home and garden store.
A drill with at least a 1/4"" bit, for drilling a hole in the lid of the pressure cooker.
A 15 gallon (56.8 L) metal pot.
A large plastic bucket.
Cheesecloth.
10 pounds of cornmeal, 10 pounds of sugar and 1/2 ounce of yeast.;
, Drill a hole in the lid of the pressure cooker and thread it to snugly receive a 1/4"" copper tubing. Insert the end of the 1/4"" copper tubing into the hole, being careful that it does not project through more than an inch. This is your condensing tube.


The tube should be long enough to go from the cooker to a sink and extend beyond the sink down to near the floor.
If you don't want to drill a hole in the cooker's lid, you can thread it through the vent and affix it there using duct tape.

Wait 12 to 24 hours, then take the temperature.",How to Turn Your Mini Fridge Into a Wine Refrigerator2," You'll probably see a small screw next to the main control. That's the calibration screw.

, Twisting it counterclockwise is likely to alter the temperature range so that the fridge doesn't get as cold, but the only way to make sure is to find out which direction turns the compressor on, then twist it in the opposite direction slightly past its original position.

, Make incremental adjustments to the calibration screw until you get a good temperature for wine.

Boil 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water.,
Cook the cornmeal.,
Add the sugar and yeast.,
Ferment the mash.",How to Make Moonshine2," Fill the pot 2/3 full with tap water (10 gallons or 37.8 L), then place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high. Let the water come to a rolling boil.

, Add the 10 pounds of cornmeal to the water and stir it with a wooden paddle or another instrument. Let it cook for a few minutes until the water combines with the cornmeal and thickens into a paste. Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool, then pour it into the clean bucket.

, Stir in 10 pounds of sugar and 1/2 ounce of yeast. Use a wooden paddle or another large instrument to thoroughly incorporate the sugar and yeast into the mash.


Bread, brewers' yeast, naturally occurring yeast or even sourdough starter may be used in place of dry yeast to start the fermentation process.

, Loosely cover the bucket with cheesecloth and place it in a cool, dark place, such as in your cellar or basement, to allow fermentation to take place. Fermentation occurs when the yeast metabolizes the sugar and corn carbohydrates and produces alcohol.


A brown or light tan foam will appear on top of the mash bucket, gradually rising up higher each day. When the mash quits working, the sugars are ""used up,"" and you will notice the foam, or ""head"" is no longer rising.
The mash is ready for the next stage when it stops bubbling. At this point it is referred to as ""sour mash.""

"
Strain the sour mash through a cheesecloth.,
Pour the strained mash liquid into the pressure cooker.,
Position the copper tubing to create a condenser.,
Turn on the burner under the pressure cooker.,
Transfer the alcohol to jars.",How to Make Moonshine3," Place the cloth over the bucket, then tip the bucket over a clean bucket or pot. You may also use a screen wire or a clean white t-shirt to strain the mash.

, Clamp down the lid and place it on a stovetop burner. You may discard the solids that you strained out with the cheesecloth.

, Run the copper tubing run from the lid (or vent) of the pressure cooker to a sink filled with cold water. Coil the middle of the copper tubing in the cold water, then run the other end of the tube over the edge of the sink to a clean container on the floor.

, Let the contents heat to exactly 177 °F (80 °C) and no more. This is the approximate boiling point of grain alcohol. As the pressure cooker heats, the alcohol turns into ethanol steam, travels through the condensing tube to cool. The resulting liquid drips into the container on the floor. That's the moonshine.


The liquid that comes out of the copper tube before the cooker reaches 177 °F (80 °C) contains methanol, which becomes steam at a lower temperature than ethanol. This low-boiling liquid must be discarded. Methanol attacks the optic nerves when consumed. You'll probably have to discard at least two ounces of liquid before the ethanol, which can actually be consumed, begins to emerge.
Keep monitoring the temperature and collecting alcohol until the temperature rises above or drops below 177 °F (80 °C). You should be able to collect about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of liquid.

, Finished moonshine is between 180 and 190 proof (90 to 95%) - practically pure grain alcohol. To make this product drinkable, responsible brewers cut it to half strength by mixing with pure spring water.

Select the right lemons.,
Gather your supplies.,
Clean the lemons.,
Peel the lemons.,
Pour the alcohol over the zest.,
Let the lemons infuse into the alcohol.,
Filter the limoncello.,
Make the simple syrup.,
Add the simple syrup and bottle the limoncello.,
Chill before serving.",How to Make Limoncello1," Lemons are the main source of flavor in limoncello, so it’s important to pick ripe and flavorful ones. Also, because the zest will be soaking in the alcohol, it’s best to choose lemons that have been grown without pesticides and haven't been waxed.


To determine if a lemon is ripe, gently press it with your thumb. If the lemon gives a little, that’s a sign that it’s juicy and ready to eat.
Choose lemons with smooth rind, because this will make them easier to peel.
Most lemon lovers opt for Meyer lemons whenever possible, because they're sweeter, less acidic, and have a more complex flavor than other lemons.;
, To make limoncello, you'll need a vegetable peeler, large jar with a tight-fitting lid, fine-mesh strainer, coffee filter, large bowl, small saucepan, funnel, and three to four sterile bottles for storing.


To accommodate the lemon zest and the alcohol, use at least a 1-quart (946 ml) jar.
If you don’t have a vegetable peeler, you can also use a microplane grater, zester, or a knife.
Instead of a coffee filter, you can also use cheesecloth.
For storage, you need a bottle or bottles that can hold about 60 ounces (1.8 L) of liquid. Clean wine bottles work well, but make sure you have a clean lid or cork to seal the bottle.

, Remove any fruit stickers that are on the lemons, and peel off any sticker residue. Hold the lemons under clean running water and scrub the rinds with a vegetable brush or clean toothbrush. Pat the lemons dry with a clean towel.The lemon zests will be soaking in alcohol, so you need the lemons as clean as possible. Otherwise, any dirt, residue, or pesticides left on the lemon rind will infuse into the alcohol.

, Remove all the zest from the lemons by peeling off long strips of the yellow zest with the vegetable peeler. Don’t peel too deeply, or you'll end up with pith (the white part) on the zest, and this will make the limoncello bitter.


If you do get some pith with the zest, cut it off with a knife.
To use a microplane grater or zester, remove a thin layer of zest from around the entire lemon.
You only need the zest to make limoncello, but you can reserve the remaining portion of the lemons for juicing, baking, or lemonade., Transfer the lemon zest to the clean jar. Pour the vodka over the zest and swirl the jar to stir up the alcohol and lemon. Screw the lid onto the jar and close it tightly.The best alcohol for limoncello is high-proof (at least 80) grain alcohol or vodka.

, Place the lemon and vodka mixture somewhere dark and out of direct sunlight. Let the mixture infuse undisturbed for a minimum of four days, and up to a month.


The longer you let the alcohol infuse, the bolder and stronger the lemon flavor will be. Also, the longer you leave in the lemons, the more yellow and golden the vodka will become., When the lemons have had time to infuse into the vodka, remove the jar from its dark place. Line a fine-mesh strainer with either a coffee filter or cheesecloth, and position the strainer over a large bowl. Pour the contents of the jar into the strainer and let the vodka drain through into the bowl.If the strainer gets blocked and the liquid stops flowing, stir the mixture in the strainer to move the lemons around.

, Heat the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Dissolve the sugar, then increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil. When it boils, reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for three minutes.After three minutes, remove the pan from the heat and let the syrup cool completely, about an hour.
Simple syrup traditionally combines equal parts water and sugar, but this limoncello recipe uses more water., When the simple syrup has cooled completely, add it into the limoncello mixture and stir to combine.

Once all of your corn is contained in the burlap sack, cover the sack with warm water. You can do this by placing the bag in a tub or large (super large) bucket., You will need to keep the corn moist for roughly 10 days. Check your corn for sprouts. When the sprouts have grown so that they are ¼ of an inch long, your corn is ready for the next step in the recipe., Wash your corn in a tub, making sure to scrub away any dirt along with the corn sprouts. If your corn has roots, scrub these away too. Move the washed corn to your primary fermenter.

, This is called making the mash. Make sure that each kernel gets thoroughly cracked. When you are sure all of the kernels are cracked, add five gallons of boiling water to your mash.

, When the water has cooled down to 86º F (30º C) add one cup of champagne yeast starter. Mix the ingredients together., When the water has reached the desired temperature, add seven pounds of rye grain, two pounds of barley, and one pound of malt. Stir all of the ingredients together., You will have to constantly stir the mixture. While stirring, increase the temperature of the mash by five degrees every two minutes. When the temperature reaches 160 ºF (71.1ºC), do not raise the temperature anymore., You will need to keep the temperature at 160ºF (71.1ºC) so that the starch turns into fermentable sugar and dextrin. This can only be achieved by continuing to stir for two to three hours.

, Let your mash cool down to 70ºF (21.1ºC). Add three grams of yeast and stir the mixture well.

, You can use a funnel to pour your mash into the fermenter of your choice. Many home brewers use glass carboys, which are essentially large glass bottles. You can often buy them with an air lock (which you will definitely need).You can also make your own air lock. To do this, drill a hole in your carboy cork or lid that exactly the size of surgical tubing (which you will also need for this method to work). Once you have drilled the hole, run the surgical tubing into the hole, letting the other end of the tubing hang down into a glass or jar of water.

, Once you have added all of the mash and yeast, you will need to seal your fermenter with an airlock so that absolutely no air can get in or out of your fermentation device. The process of fermentation involves the sugars in your mash, like glucose or fructose, getting converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide., The length of time you should let your mash ferment will depend on the recipe you used. It could anywhere from a couple of days to longer than a week. For the corn whiskey recipe listed above, let your mash ferment for seven to ten days. For the rye whiskey recipe, let the mash ferment for five to seven days., There are several ways to tell you can safely take your whiskey out of your fermenter. The best and most accurate way to tell if the fermentation process has ended is by using a hydrometer, though you can also do a visual inspection.Using a Hydrometer: Hydrometers measure the density of a liquid compared to the density of water. When the mash is done fermenting, the number reading on the hydrometer should stay the same. You should take a reading one time each day, for three days around the time when your recipe says your mash should be done fermenting. A good way to use the hydrometer is to take a sample of your mash by using a wine thief or turkey baster. Put this small sample into a graduated cylinder. Lower the hydrometer into the cylinder and gently swirl it around to release any bubbles. Take a reading right at the level of the liquid. This reading should be the same for three days in a row.

, It is recommended that you use a hydrometer to determine whether or not your mash is done fermenting, however if you really don’t want to buy one, you can try to do a visual inspection of your fermenter. Inspect the top outer edge of the fermenter. Are there any bubbles being formed? The day that you notice there are no bubbles forming, give your mash one more day to ferment and then move on to the distillation process.

, The process of distillation focuses on separating the ethanol (alcohol) created in the fermentation process from the wort (or used mash). The goal is to get 80% ethanol and 20% flavors and water from the mash., For safety reasons, it is generally in your best interest to buy a copper or stainless steel still from a still making company. There are plenty of websites that have quality stills for purchase. If, however, you would prefer to take on the project of building your own still, you can learn how to do so here.

, Fermented wort is referred to as ‘wash’. To transfer your wash, you will need to strain or siphon your wash through a cheesecloth and then into your still. The cheesecloth is necessary because you want to allow as few of the larger chunks of mash into the still as possible. If you choose to siphon your wash rather than strain in, try to leave as much of the solid chunks in the bottom of the fermenter.If you do end up with some of the larger chunks in your still, its not the end of the world. You can leave them in there.

, Again, if you have made your own still and want to refer back to the wikiHow instructions, click here. Once the rest of the still is assembled, slowly heat your wash. If you heat your wash too quickly, you may burn it. Over the course of 30 to 60 minutes, bring your wash to a boil.

, On your still, there should be a thermometer placed right before the cooling condenser. As the wash boils, keep on an eye on this thermometer. When it reads 120º F- 140º F (50º C-60º C), start the cooling water for the condenser tube. Doing this will begin your distillation process., Once you have added the cooling water, the condenser will begin to drip. For a wash that is five gallons in size, you will want to throw out the first 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) (¼ cup) that comes out of the condenser. This first bit is called the ‘head’ and is the methanol boiling out of the wash. The head has a nasty flavor that you will not want mixing with the rest of your whiskey.

, Once you have thrown out the head, read the thermometer again. It should read 175º F-185º F (80º C-85º C). At this time, the distillate coming out of the distiller is the ethanol boiling off, or the “body”. This is the liquid gold you’ve been waiting for. You will want to collect the body in 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) containers so that you can keep track of your product., When the temperature has reached roughly 205º F (96º C), you will want to stop collecting the distillate. The liquid now coming out of the distiller is call the ‘tails’. This will also give your whiskey a bad flavor, so keep it separate from the body.

, After you have collected all of your distillate, you will need to let each part of the still cool (be careful--it is very hot). Once it has cooled, clean it well.

, Most whiskeys are aged in oak barrels. However, if you don’t have any oak barrels on hand, you can also add oak chips to your whiskey while it ages in another jar or container. Allowing the whiskey to age will give it that beautiful whiskey flavor that we all love. You can buy both charred oak barrels and oak chips online.If you choose to age your whiskey in a jar or other closed container, you will need to regularly open the jar to let the alcohol vapors escape as they would do if being aged in a wooden barrel (this escaped vapor is called the “angels share”). Let your jars breath once a week at a minimum.
If you choose to use a barrel, fill your barrel with warm water first. Doing this will cause the wood to swell, effectively sealing off any cracks the wood might have. This is important to do or else your whiskey might leak out of your barrel.

, When making whiskey at home, the aging process takes a lot less time than commercial distillers take, as you are no doubt making a much smaller batch of whiskey. Because of this, your whiskey is more exposed to the wood of the barrel or chips, because there is less liquid vying for a spot up against the wood. Your whiskey will be aged in a matter of months.

, When aging whiskey at home, there is a chance that you might ‘over oak’ your liquor. To avoid this, sample your whiskey once every three or so weeks., To determine your whiskey’s alcohol content (ABV) you can use your distiller’s hydrometer. Keep in mind that a whiskey with 75 to 80% alcohol is going to be a relatively unpleasant thing to drink. In general, whiskey gets diluted to 80 proof, or 40% alcohol. To dilute, add water.

, Once your whiskey has reached the taste and color you prefer, its time to bottle it. Store your bottled whiskey or enjoy it immediately, the choice is yours. Enjoy!

Select and clean the lemons.,
Gather your supplies.,
Suspend the lemons above the vodka.,
Let the mixture rest.,
Make the simple syrup.,
Remove the lemons and add the syrup.,
Strain and chill before serving.",How to Make Limoncello2," Choose fresh, ripe lemons that have been grown without pesticides and aren't waxed. Meyer lemons are among the most popular, because they're flavorful and sweet.Hold the lemons under running water and scrub them clean with a vegetable brush or clean toothbrush.
Pat the lemons dry with a clean towel.

, The major difference between traditional limoncello and the Sicilian-inspired version is that the lemons don’t get soaked in the alcohol with the Sicilian-style. Instead, the lemons are suspended in the same jar as the alcohol, and the vapor from the vodka breaks down the zest and absorbs the flavors. To make this style of limoncello, you'll need:


Quart (946 ml) jar with a lid
Cheesecloth
Twine
Small saucepan
Vegetable peeler or zester
Fine-mesh strainer
Funnel
Two sterilized bottles (enough to hold about 40 ounces (1.2 L) of liquid)

, Transfer the vodka to the large quart jar. Wrap two lemons in the cheesecloth. Tie the cheesecloth up with a 20-inch (51-cm) piece of twine, leaving long tails on both ends of the twine. Place the lemons inside the jar, suspended above the alcohol.Take the extra twine that’s tied around the cheesecloth and wrap it around the outside of the jar. Tie a knot in the end of the twine to secure the lemons in place above the vodka.
Place the lid on the jar and seal it tightly.

, Place the jar somewhere cool and dark, and let it rest for one month. Do not disturb the mixture while the alcohol vapors are breaking down the lemon zest.


The nice thing about this recipe is that you don’t have to worry about zesting so many lemons, because the alcohol vapour will actually macerate the lemon peel for you.

, When the month is over, retrieve the jar. Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. This quantity of sugar and water will yield 1½ cups of simple syrup. Dissolve the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for three minutes.Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool for about an hour.

, Remove the lid from the jar and untie the twine. Remove the lemons from the cheesecloth and discard them. Pour in the cooled simple syrup and stir to combine. Use the vegetable peeler or zester to remove the yellow zest from two fresh lemons.Add the fresh lemon zest to the limoncello and stir to combine.
Let the mixture rest about 15 minutes.

, Place the funnel into one of the storage bottles, and hold a strainer over the funnel. Pour the limoncello mixture through the strainer and fill the bottles.


Close the bottles with the lids and chill the limoncello in the fridge or freezer for four hours before serving.
Limoncello will last for about a month in the fridge, and a year in the freezer."

A single bottle is sufficient for a small party of 10 or less, but if you’re expecting a larger crowd, you’ll want to use two or three bottles.Traditionally, hunch punch is mixed in a 5 gallon (19 l) cooler. If using one, make sure that it’s clean before pouring in the Everclear.;
, Once the Everclear is in the container, add 1 gallon (3.8 l) of fruit punch. Use a long-handled spoon to mix the punch together to ensure that the fruit punch is fully blended with the alcohol.You can use a bottle of ready-made fruit punch or mix up your own using powdered drink packets. Just make sure that it adds up to 1 gallon of fruit punch.
If you’re using additional bottles of Everclear in the punch, you’ll need to add more fruit punch as well. For every 750 ml bottle of alcohol, mix in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of the fruit punch.

, When the Everclear and fruit punch are completely mixed, add as much ice as desired to chill the punch. Use a ladle to pour the punch into cups and serve.If you don’t want to use ice, you can refrigerate the fruit punch overnight to chill it before adding it to the alcohol.

Consider re-distilling your brandy.",How to Make Homemade Brandy," Traditionally, making brandy at home was a way to capture and preserve the flavors and fragrances of summer and fall fruits. Pears, apples, grapes, peaches or plums were gathered, processed into wine, then distilled into fruit brandies. If you want to make your own wine, you'll need to gather your fruit and start the fermentation process at least a month before you distill it to make brandy. If you'd prefer to start distilling right away, purchase a few liters of fruit wine and skip to the next section.


Wait until the fruit you want to use is in season, and harvest at the peak of ripeness.
For this recipe, you'll need about 3 quarts of fruit, which will yield enough wine to make a small batch of brandy. Harvest and ferment more fruit if you want more brandy.
Commercial brandy is usually made from grape juice or crushed grape skins. The resulting distillate is harsh in taste, so it's aged in oak barrels to take off the edge.Brandy made from fruit other than grapes is more suited to making at home, since it doesn't require oak barrel aging.;
, Wash it thoroughly, then cut it into slices. There's no need to peel the fruit, but you should remove pits for this recipe.

, Place the fruit in the jar, then use a potato masher or another instrument to mash it down. This will help the fermentation process go more quickly.


If you're using berries, which are lower in sugar than other types of fruit, you'll need to add sugar. Line the bottom of the crock with sugar, then add a layer of fruit. Add more sugar, and continue layering until the fruit and sugar have been used up.
Use a stone crock large enough to accommodate all of the fruit with a few inches to spare, since the mixture will bubble up during the fermenting process. If you don't have a stone crock, you can use a glass bowl or another thick, heavy container. It should be made of glass or ceramic, not wood or metal.

, Dissolve 6 teaspoons of dry yeast in a cup of warm water. Use active dry yeast, not instant yeast, found at any grocery store. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and sugar mixture. Add six cups of cold water.

, The liquid inside will begin to bubble up during the fermenting process, so you'll need the tray to catch any overflow. Leave the mixture in a cool place for a week.

, Uncover the crock and use a clean, long-handled spoon to stir it thoroughly, then place the cover on top. Each week the alcohol content will increase.

, At the end of four weeks, pour the wine into glass bottles and cover tightly. You can store the wine for several months to deepen the flavor.

, To make brandy at home, you'll need a still small enough to operate on your stove top. A 1 1⁄2 to 2 liter (0.4 to 0.5 US gal) alembic copper still will probably be sufficient for your needs.To find a still, look in local kitchen supplies stores, online, and in secondhand stores. You'll be able to use it to make other spirits in addition to endless batches of brandy.


If you purchase a new or secondhand still, be sure to clean it before using.
If you want to experiment with a very small batch of brandy, you can construct a still with a copper tea kettle and plastic tubing.
If you find that you enjoy making brandy so much that you'd like to make larger batches, you can upgrade to a 5 gallon (18.9 L) still. Anything larger than this will be too big for home brandy-making.

, In addition to your base wine and still, you'll need an array of clean glasses, a ladle, and other supplies to complete the distillation process. Gather the following materials and set them out in a clean workspace within easy reach of the stove:


A Dutch oven or another pot large enough to fit the still inside. This will be filled with water and used as a double boiler of sorts to give you maximum control over the heating of the still.
Plenty of glass containers. As the still does its work, you'll need small, clean glass containers to hold what comes out of the pipe.
A graduated cup will come in handy if you want to measure exactly how much you have.
A sealable large glass jar, for storing the finished brandy.
A towel, for wiping up any spills that might occur.

, First, fill the Dutch oven with a few inches of water. Put the still inside. Add more water if necessary; it should rise about three quarters of the way up the sides of the still. Set the Dutch oven and still over a gas burner or whatever heat source you're using.


If you're using a large 5 gallon (18.9 L) still, it won't fit inside a Dutch oven, so you'll need to skip this and place the still directly over your heat source.

, No matter what size still you're using, leave the top 1/4 of the still empty. When the wine heats up, it can bubble and rise, so it's important not to fill the still all the way.

, Place the lid on the still, then connect the tube from the lid to the condenser coil. Place cold water in the condenser and set a glass under the spout to collect the alcohol that flows from it. Different still models will require slightly different assembly, so read the instructions that came with your still carefully. It's vital that you follow the directions that came with the still you have to ensure the distillation process runs smoothly.

, When making brandy, you never want to let the contents of the still get too hot; the distillation process should be slow and steady. The wine should come to a good simmer, but not a boil. Start heating the still with a strong flame, and keep it strong until alcohol beings to drip from the spout. If the alcohol begins dripping too quickly, you'll need to turn down the heat. Do not let the alcohol drip faster than 1 drop per second.You'll know the alcohol is going to start flowing soon by touching the copper tube where it enters the water. When it becomes hot, the alcohol is about to flow.The slower the liquid flows from the spout, the better quality your brandy will be.

, The first distillate that comes from the still, about 7.5 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine, is called the foreshots, and it contains a toxic combination of acetone and methyl alcohol. Measure out the emerging foreshots or take a whiff; when the strong, sharp smell of chemicals abates, it's done flowing. The foreshots should be thrown away; there's nothing drinkable there.

, The next liquid to emerge will be the heads, which is a combination of acetone, methyl alcohol, methanol, and ethyl acetate. If you're planning to make a second batch of brandy sometime soon, it might be worth saving the heads, which may be distilled a second time to preserve the ""good"" ingredients and remove the ""bad."" It's also fine to simply throw the heads away.


Collect the heads in small glasses. You'll want to be able to save every drop of the hearts - the good stuff - which is coming out next. Collecting the distillate in a big glass increases the chances that everything will get muddled together.
Keep smelling the distillate as it flows. The heads will smell better than the foreshots, but not nearly so sweet and pure as the hearts.
The heads and foreshots together will comprise the first 30 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine.

, When the hearts start to come, the smell of the distillate will have hints of the fruit you used to make your wine. You'll smell pear, peach, plum or apple essence without the harshness of acetone. The distillate should be clear, not milky. Continue collecting it in small glasses, monitoring the smell for changes.


Adjust the temperature as necessary. As the distillation process nears its end, you'll need to keep increasing the temperature to achieve the same flow rate. Keep turning it up so that 1 drop per 1-3 seconds continues to flow.
Do not overheat the still, and do not let it boil dry.

, The last distillate to exit will be the tails, which is less concentrated and less tasty. You'll notice a change in smell; the fruitiness will be gone. It may also look milky. This should be discarded. When the tails comes, turn off the heat.


After the distillation process, it's important to clean your still carefully.

, You should have 300 mL of drinkable brandy for every 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine you distilled. Store the brandy in the jar with a tight lid.

, If you smell strong hints of acetone and methyl alcohol in your finished brandy, you can store the jar with a piece of cloth rubber banded over the top to let it breathe for a few days. The unpleasant smell and taste will leave the brandy as the acetone and methyl alcohol evaporate.

, If you're not in a hurry to drink your brandy, you can mellow it out a bit by waiting a few months before drinking. Screw the lid on tightly and store it in a cool place for several months. When you open the brandy, it should have a smoother taste than it did when you first distilled it.

, It's not commonly done at home, but you can distill the brandy a second time to increase the alcohol content and refine the flavor. However, since doing this makes the distillate very flammable, its not advisable to do so until you have plenty of experience operating your still.

, Once you've soaked the fruit and made the lemonade mixture, pour the mixture into the vodka and watermelon mixture and stir it thoroughly to combine the ingredients together.

, Use a large ladle to serve the jungle juice in clear plastic cups or Solo cups. Do not just dip each cup into the punch -- make sure to use something to pour the juice into the cups to keep things sanitary. You can even garnish each glass with a slice of lemon if you're feeling fancy.


If you like this recipe, you can try cutting off just the top of one of the sides of the watermelon and serving the ingredients from the melon, next time.

Dip the glass in water or soda.,
Use fruit or juice.,
Dilute syrup.,
Dip the glass in an alcoholic beverage.,
Use salt or sugar.,
Make a candy rim.,
Apply graham cracker crumbs.,
Use cocoa.,
Add sprinkles.,
Wet the rim of the glass.,
Dip the glass in a topping.,
Clean off the excess topping.",How to Rim a Cocktail Glass," Use regular water or tonic water. Alternately, sugary soda leaves a sticky residue that can help your topping to stick. Look for light-colored soda so that it adds just the right amount of taste.Try a lemon-lime soda with a slice or lemon or lime as a garnishment.;
, Cut up fruit and rub it along the rim of the glass. Or, dip the glass in a shallow dish of juice. Use juice that is similar to an ingredient in your cocktail.For example, rub a wedge or lime or lemon around the rim.

, Use a ration of one part syrup to one part water to thin the syrup. Try a syrup that is commonly used with cocktails, such as simple syrup or grenadine. Or experiment with fruit or other syrups.


Try maple syrup, honey, or agave.

, Use beer, wine, or a liqueur. Dip a clean sponge in the alcohol and use that to rim the glass if you don’t want to waste any alcohol by pouring it in a shallow dish.Liqueur is especially sticky and will help your topping adhere to the glass.
Use beer as the liquid to make a beer-and-salt rim.

, Pour coarse sea salt, kosher salt, or table salt onto your rimming dish. If you’d rather use sugar, you can opt for granulated or powdered. Try white or brown sugar, or raw cane sugar.Mix equal parts of sugar and ginger or nutmeg for a holiday twist.
Muddle salt with lime zest for a citrusy take on the salted rim.Any dried herb you think will compliment your cocktail can be mixed sparingly with salt or sugar.

, Use a powdered candy such as Fun Dip. Alternately, crush something up yourself, with a mortar and pestle. You can also crush candy in a folded-over freezer bag, using a hammer or meat mallet.Try crushing up Pop Rocks, sour candies, or miniature candy canes., Use graham cracker crumbs from the baking supplies section at the grocery store, or crush your own graham crackers. Alternately, you can use crushed cookies. Add a graham cracker crusted rim to any drink that pairs well with a sugared rim.Try a chocolate cocktail with marshmallow vodka and a graham cracker crust.Try a graham cracker rim for a pumpkin pie or key lime pie cocktail.

, Dip the glass into cocoa powder. This works well with chocolate or vanilla cocktails. Add a bit of salt to the cocoa for a salty chocolate rim!


Almond milk is a tasty liquid you can dip the glass in before the cocoa powder. For example, try this with a sweet cocktail that uses butterscotch liqueur.Take a raspberry or two and garnish the glass or plop them into the cocktail.

, Use multi-colored sprinkles, or play off of the shade of the cocktail you’re making. Get round sprinkles for a cleaner look. Try a rim with sprinkles for any cocktail that pairs well with sugar.Sprinkles go well with creamy cocktails, especially in flavors like sugar cookie or cake batter.

, Turn the glass upside down and hold it at a 45 degree angle. Dip the outer rim only, about a quarter of an inch deep into the dish containing your liquid. Rotate the glass to moisten the whole outer rim. Alternately, use a clean sponge soaked in the liquid to moisten the rim of the glass.For example, use a shallow dish full of water or diluted syrup. Use a sponge if you’re working with beer, liqueur, or another type of alcohol, so that none goes to waste.
Use about two tablespoons of liquid per glass.

, Pour two tablespoons of topping (for each glass) into a shallow dish. Hold the glass at a 45 degree angle and dip it into the topping. Rotate the glass to coat the entire outer rim of the glass.Try twisting the glass to add a thicker layer of topping to the rim.

, Shake the glass over the topping dish so that any topping which isn’t well adhered will fall off. Wet a napkin or paper towel. Wipe off any topping that strayed outside the line and looks messy.Set the glass down, upright, on a hard surface. Pinch the stem with one hand. With your other hand, press the moistened paper against the glass where the rimmed topping ends. Twist the glass by the stem, 360 degrees, to wipe off the excess topping in one clean line.

Place the lemon slice, wedge, spiral, or twist on or in the glass.,
Serve the drink.",How to Make a Lemon Drop," All lemon drop shooters should be garnished with something such as a lemon slice, wedge, twist, or spiral. Such garnishes are usually coated with sugar or make sure that the garnish contributes sweet as well as sour flavors.


A slice is a wedge without the ends cut off. If making a shooter, the slice or wedge will be rested on the top of the glass. If using a larger glass, the slice, wedge, twist or spiral can be set on the rim of the glass.
Twists and spirals that have not been coated in sugar can be dropped into the drink. If making a shooter, coat the slice or wedge with sugar. This is done by rolling or pressing the moist citrus piece in a plate or tray of sugar. Superfine sugar may be preferable to regular granulated sugar.
When using a cocktail glass, a lemon spiral can be coated in sugar. To coat a spiral in sugar, moisten it with lemon juice and press it into a plate or tray of sugar. For detailed information on making garnishes, see How to garnish a cocktail.
A sugar cube can be served with the cocktail if the drink already has a lemon flavor (from lemon juice or similar ingredient).
If not using a sugar-coated lemon piece or a sugar cube, coat the rim of the glass with sugar. In this instance, garnish with a plain lemon slice, wedge, twist, or spiral.
A sugar-coated lemon slice can also be served separately.;
, Make a cut in the lemon slice or wedge so that it may be placed on the rim of the glass. If using a sugar-coated lemon piece or a sugar cube, the rim of the glass does not need to be coated with sugar. The rim of the glass also does not need to be coated if sweet ingredients are used when mixing the drink.

,, Use the most appealing combination of ingredients. The types of ingredients that are used will determine how the drink should be garnished. If not using lemon juice or a lemon-flavored ingredient, the drink should be garnished with a lemon slice or wedge that can be sucked on. If the drink is not sweet, a sweet garnish should be used. Sweet garnishes include sugar-coated lemon sliced and wedges, sugar-rimmed glasses, and sugar cubes. Spirals and twists that have been coated in sugar will probably not be sucked on after finishing the drink.

,,,, This will require that the lemon slice or wedge be served separately or added after the drink has been extinguished. Extinguish the flaming drink before drinking by covering the drink with a glass. Generally, only shooters or drinks served in small glasses should be ignited. Drinks served in cocktail or martini glasses should not be ignited.

, If using a shot glass, merely rest a sugar-coated lemon slice or wedge on the top of the glass with the rind portion pointing down and the meat portion pointing up. If using a very small rocks glass, try to place the lemon slice or wedge on the glass in the same manner. If using a larger glass, set the wedge, slice, spiral, or twist on the rim of the glass or serve a sugar-coated slice or wedge separately. Spirals and twists can be dangled from the rim of the glass or dropped into the drink. However, sugar-coated lemon pieces should not be dropped into the drink, as the sugar will dissolve.

, If the drink is lemon-flavored and is not sweet or garnished with a sugar in some way, serve with a sugar cube. When drinking a lemon drop, first shoot or drink the alcohol, then suck on the lemon slice or sugar cube.

Carefully pour 8 1/2 cups of boiling water over the blackberries. Wear oven mitts or hand protection and mash the fruit. Cover the bucket and let it cool to room temperature.This will make 2 to 3 750-ml bottles of blackberry brandy liqueur.;
, Add 1/2 teaspoon of pectic enzyme to your bucket with blackberries and water. Stir to combine the mixture and cover it back up to rest for a day.


The pectic enzyme will keep your blackberry brandy clear. You can find it at a home brewing supply store.

, Stir in 3 cups (600g) of granulated sugar till the sugar is mostly dissolved. Sugar is used to help preserve the blackberry brandy and sweeten the tart berries.Since the sugar acts as a preservative, you shouldn't cut back on the amount of sugar used in this recipe or your blackberry brandy may spoil faster.

, To encourage fermentation of the blackberries, stir in 1 packet (5g) of wine yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient. Stir the mixture well and cover the bucket. Let the mixture rest for 4 or 5 days. Stir the mixture really well every day.You can get wine yeast and yeast nutrient from home fermentation stores.

, Pour the blackberry brandy out of the bucket through a clean mesh strainer. To keep all of the seeds out, line the strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth or muslin. Transfer the strained blackberry brandy to sterile bottles or a small jug. Refrigerate the blackberry brandy for 6 weeks before serving it.If you want to remove all haze or cloudiness from your blackberry brandy, carefully siphon or pour the blackberry brandy to a new sterile bottle so that the sediment is left in the bottom of the original bottle.

, Depending on what size jar you're using (you could use several quart jars or a large gallon jar), you'll need enough blackberries to cover the bottom with a single layer. The blackberries should come up about an inch.Make sure to use a jar that has a tight-fitting or sealable lid since you'll be storing it for an extended period of time.

, Take 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar and sprinkle it over the blackberries in the bottom of your gallon-sized jar. The blackberries should be covered with the sugar.If you're using two smaller jars, you may need a little less sugar over the blackberries.

, Add another layer of blackberries over your sugared blackberries. Sprinkle another cup (200 g) of sugar over this layer. Continue to add a layer of blackberries and sprinkle sugar over each layer until you're about an inch from the top of the jar. Your last layer should end with sugar on top.For a gallon jar, you'll probably end up using around 3 pounds (6 cups) of granulated sugar and about 10 pounds of fresh blackberries.

, Pour 2 cups (479 ml) of non-chlorinated water over the top of your sugared berries. If your city treats the water with chlorine, you should use bottled spring water. You don't need to stir the berries, sugar, and water.If you're unsure if the water out of your tap is chlorinated or not, just use bottled spring water to be on the safe side.

, Place plastic wrap over the mouth of your jar and loosely set the lid on the jar. Put your jar on a tray in a dark spot. Stir the brandy and sugar mixture every other day for the first week. To make it easier, use a long-handled spoon.The tray can contain any mess if the brandy bubbles over the side of the jar while it ferments.

, After the first week, stir your brandy once a week for three more weeks. You can then strain the brandy through muslin or cheesecloth. Removing the blackberries at this point will prevent the brandy from becoming bitter.You can also strain the brandy through large coffee filters, but this will take more time and you'll end up with less brandy.

, Once you've strained the blackberries out of the brandy, divide the brandy into smaller bottles with screw caps or into mason jars with lids. Store your brandy in a dark place for around 3 months to improve the flavor.If you won't go through the blackberry brandy very quickly, consider using smaller bottles or jars so that the opened brandy doesn't come into contact with a lot of oxygen. Oxygen can lower the alcohol content of your brandy if it's exposed for a long period of time.

, You'll need a large glass jar that can hold at least a quart (4 cups). The jar should have a sealable lid since you'll be storing the brandy in it and shaking it frequently. Place 2 cups (44g) of blackberries into your clean jar and smash them a little with the end of a wooden spoon to release some juice.If you like your blackberry brandy to be a little tart, add 1/2"" piece of lime zest to the jar.

, Buy an unflavored vodka and brandy. Any quality brandy will work when making homemade blackberry brandy, especially if you let the blackberries infuse the alcohol for several months. Pour 3/4 cup (177 ml) of brandy and 1 1/4 (355 ml) cup of vodka into your jar with the muddled blackberries.For a stronger brandy flavor, you can replace the vodka with more brandy or even whisky, rum, or gin., Seal the jar with your berries, vodka, and brandy. Shake the mixture and let it sit for 3 days. Avoid refrigerating it and keep it out of direct sunlight. After 3 days, pour the brandy mixture through a strainer lined with cheesecloth. This will catch any blackberry solids.You can throw away the blackberry solids since they'll mainly be seeds.

, Mix 1 cup (235 ml) of water with 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Cook it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate the syrup until it's cool. Add all of the cold simple syrup to your strained blackberry brandy.If you want to make extra simple syrup to further sweeten the brandy or to use in other drinks, you can double the water and sugar. Refrigerate your extra simple syrup for up to 5 days.

, Shake the jar so that the simple syrup and blackberry brandy completely mix. Let it rest for at least 1 day after you add the syrup. You can then serve the blackberry brandy or mix it into a cocktail.Refrigerate your blackberry brandy for up to 2 months.

Add the other four gallons of apple cider to the five-gallon container.,

Sterilize the apple cider containers and hose.,

Freeze the applejack.,
Separate the applejack from the water.,
Enjoy responsibly.",How to Make Applejack1," Since the fermentation process for applejack requires activating the proper bacteria, you want to make sure that only those bacteria are in the mixture. Therefore, you want to sterilize all of your equipment, especially the five-gallon container.You can use an iodine solution known an an iodophor to sterilize everything. The solution is readily available from most home brewing outlets.;
, You want to make sure that all of the apple cider you use is free of preservatives and has no sugar added, especially since you will add your own sugar. Pour the first gallon of apple cider into the large pan and heat over medium heat., Once the gallon of apple cider reaches approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit, begin stirring in all five pounds of brown sugar. Keep stirring in the sugar until all five pounds have fully dissolved in the apple cider., Once all of the sugar has been stirred into the gallon of cider, you also want to add the packet of brewer’s yeast. If the apple cider has reach over approximately 115-120 degrees Fahrenheit, then let it cool to this temperature before added the yeast.Temperatures over 130 degrees Fahrenheit will kill the yeast instead of activating it, and temperatures under 105 degrees Fahrenheit won’t activate the yeast at all, so it’s very important to add with the cider in the correct temperature window.Follow the directions on your particular packet of brewer’s yeast for the amount of time the yeast should be kept at the activation temperature.

, Once you’ve added the yeast at the proper activation temperature and kept if there for the correct amount of time, you can remove the cider from the heat source. It needs to cool enough so that you can add it to the airtight five-gallon container without causing pressure issues as it cools.Since the cider wasn’t overheated to begin with, this will only need to cool for five-to-ten minutes.

, While waiting for the yeast and brown sugar cider to cool, you can add the rest of the apple cider to the sterilized five-gallon container.Only add a little bit of the fourth gallon because the additions to the heated cider will result in a bit more than five total gallons, and you don’t want to overflow the container.
If you have a five-gallon container meant for brewing, that’s great. If you don’t, you can even use a five-gallon water jug. However, you have to make sure that you still have the cap if you use a water jug, and you have to make sure that it seals properly., Once the heated cider has cooled for ten minutes, you can add it to the rest of the apple cider in the five-gallon container. Then add a bit more of the final gallon of cider, but not all of it. The five-gallon container should still have several inches of room left at the top of it.

As the yeast feeds on the sugar in the mixture, it will foam and create pressure. If the container is too full, then you can end up with a mess on your hands., A brewer’s airlock is a device that allows pressure to escape the container without allowing any outside air in. Attach the airlock to the cap by following the instructions for the specific unit you purchased.

You’ll easily be able to find the device at the same home brewer’s store where you found your yeast.
The airlock will also require about an ounce of water inside it. This allow the gas to escape up through the water without allowing any outside air to pass down in., You now want to allow the applejack to ferment for a minimum of six days. However, the longer you allow the yeast to feed, the higher the alcohol content of the applejack will be.Closer to ten days is going to give the applejack more bite.

Especially if you’re using a clear water jug, you want to store the container in a dark place because too much sunlight can kill the yeast.
Give the container a tap once a day. You don’t want to shake it hard—just give it a tap or a rattle to send any gas in the liquid up to the surface to vent to keep from building too much pressure., Once you’ve waited your six-to-ten days for the yeast to do its job, it’s time to bottle the applejack. Begin by sterilizing the original gallon jugs in which your apple cider came. You can sterilize them with the same iodophor as the larger container. You also want to sterilize the small hose or piece of tubing you have to move the applejack., You will see a layer of sediment from the yeast at the bottom of the larger container. Insert the sterilized tube to a level just above the sediment so you won’t get any of it, and siphon the applejack out of the five-gallon container and into the smaller, sterilized one-gallon containers.

Make sure that you still have the caps in order to seal the one-gallon containers.
Realistically, you can simply refrigerate the mixture at this point to kill the yeast, and you’ll have an apple wine that is in the neighborhood of 40 proof—20% alcohol. However, you can freeze off some of the water in the current mixture to increase the alcohol content further and possibly even double it., Once you have all of the applejack sealed in the smaller containers, freeze them. You want the contents of each container to be frozen solid before moving on to the next step., After you have frozen the containers solid, open them, tip them upside down and let them drip into mason jars. Since water freezes at a much lower temperature than alcohol, the liquid that drips into the jars will be concentrated applejack as it separates from the still frozen water above.You will fill several jars as the content continues to melt and release more alcohol.

You will visibly see the frozen portion losing its caramel color as the alcohol drains and leaves behind the ice.
The process can take an hour and a half or two hours, so be patient.
If you truly want to separate the water out as much as possible, then pour the contents of the jars back into the jugs once you’ve dumped out the melted water and freeze them again. After two or three times through the distillation process, you’ll notice that the contents don’t freeze at all. Your applejack will be closer to 80 proof—40% alcohol—when this happens., Once you have removed much of the water and impurities from your applejack, it is ready to drink.

In order to infuse the brandy with natural apple flavoring, you will need to begin by peeling and chopping from fresh apples. Two cups worth is enough for this recipe., To give your infused spirit some extra spice and cider-flavored goodness, try adding three cinnamon sticks to the apples and water., To help release all of the natural flavors and to kill any germs that you don’t want to add to your infusion, you should heat the mixture for ten minutes on medium heat.The mixture should be covered during heating.

, Once you have heated the mixture, add the 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Stir in the sugar and continue stirring over heat until the sugar has dissolved in the mixture., After the sugar has fully dissolved in the mixture, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool. It doesn’t have to cool to room temperature, but it needs to cool enough that placing it in an airtight bottle won’t create any pressure problems as the liquid cools further.

, Once the mixture has cooled to warm but not scalding, add it to a large glass container.It’s very important to make sure that the container can be sealed airtight.
Add the entire mixture, not just the apples and liquid.

, Now that you have finished the process for prepping the mixture, you can combine the brandy with the apples and sugar., The final ingredient for this recipe is the three cups of dry white wine, which you should now add to the mixture., Once you have combined all of the ingredients and given them a good mixing, it is time to seal the container.

Store opened white wine in a wine cellar or closet.,
Leave red wine out.,
Keep dessert wines like Sauternes, most everyday Ports and most Sherries for longer.",How to Store Wine," Store all wines away from light, especially direct sunlight and fluorescent fixtures. UV rays can cause wine to be 'light struck,' giving them an unpleasant smell. Darker bottles are better protected and some bottles have UV filters built into the glass, but enough UV rays can still penetrate to ruin the wine. If you can't keep a bottle entirely out of the light, keep it lightly wrapped up in a cloth, or simply put the bottle inside a box out of the way. If it does get exposed to light occasionally, try to make sure it's light from incandescent or sodium vapor lamps., If they are stored upright for a long amount of time, the corks will dry out, and air will eventually get to the wine, spoiling it. If you store it label side up, it'll be easier to spot any sediments that may have formed in the wine over time when you do eventually pick it up.

, For extended aging of wine (over 1 year), refrigeration is a must in most parts of the world; even a below-ground cellar is not cool enough.


Wine storage temperature should not go over 75˚F (24°C), for longer than brief spans of time. At 75°F, wine begins to oxidize. An ideal temperature for storing a varied wine collection is 54°F (12.2°C).Letting the temperature drop below 54°F won't hurt the wine; it'll only slow down the aging process.However, A 68 to 73 degree storage area is far preferable to one that is 45 to 65 degrees F, though the first approaches the dangerous 75 figure. Rises in temperature force wine through the cork; drops cause air to be sucked back in.
Temperature in a wine storage area should be as constant as possible. All changes should occur slowly. The greater the changes in temperature a wine suffers, the greater the premature aging of the wine from over breathing. The temperature should never fluctuate more than 3°F (1.6°C) a day and 5°F (2.7°C) a year, especially with red wines, which will suffer more temperature-related problems than white wines., If possible, store the wines in such a way that you don't need to move them in order to reach a bottle to drink. Try not to move a bottle at all once it is stored. Even vibrations from heavy traffic, motors, or generators may negatively affect the wine.

, High humidity keeps the cork from drying and minimizes evaporation. Don't allow the humidity to go too much over 70%, however, because it can encourage the growth of mold and cause labels to loosen.You can purchase a hygrometer to track the moisture conditions and use humidifying or dehumidifying techniques as needed.

, Remember that wine ""breathes"", so don't store it with anything that has a strong smell, as the smell will permeate through the cork and taint the wine. Good ventilation may help prevent musty odors from entering the wine., Not all wines improve over time. Generally, new world, inexpensive wines will not improve. Red wines can be stored and aged for anywhere between 2-10 years to mature. This, however, depends on the type of red wine and the balance of its sugar, acid and tannins. Most white wines should be consumed after 2-3 years of storage (though select White Burgundies (Chardonnays) can be aged for over 20 years.)

, Different wines taste best at slightly different temperatures, which may vary from the temperature in which they were stored. Right before drinking the wine, allow the temperature to rise or fall to the appropriate serving temperature:Blush, rose and dry white wines: 46-57ºF (8-14ºC)
Sparkling wines and champagne: 43-47ºF (6-8ºC)
Light red wine: 55ºF (13ºC)
Deep red wines: 59-66ºF (15-19ºC).

, If you do not have one, put it in the fridge. This will generally only keep the wine for three to five days if you have already opened it, though there are ways to ensure it stays good for longer:


Minimize its exposure to air. Cork the bottle tightly. If there is only a little bit of wine left, try transferring it to a smaller bottle.
Keep it away from excess amounts of light and heat. If you have multiple refrigerators, put it in the one that is used the least. If you only have one, try not to leave the fridge open for extended periods of time.
Purchase a wine stopper and pump.

, As long as you place the cork in the bottle and put the bottle in a dark place, you won't need to worry about it going bad for a few days.

, They will resist degradation for more than 3-5 days, though exactly how long depends on the individual wine."

Find an object with blunt ends.,
Place the bottle on the floor or a steady surface.,
Set your object against the cork.,
Push the cork down.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew1," It should be narrower than the cork and something that will not stab, shatter, burst, chip, or break the cork or bottle. A cheap white ballpoint pen or basic marker (including a highlighter or dry erase marker), in each case with the cap on, will work well. You could also use a long rod, a cylindrical container of chapstick, or a slim knife sharpener. Carabiners work well, too., You can put in your lap to keep it in place. You could simply rest it on a table as well.You can also place the object against a wall or other vertical service and press horizontally. Push on the bottle's wide base to force the cork in easily. Hold the neck area and the other end of your object to prevent slipping. Make sure the surface is strong enough so that it will not dimple, or protected, like a wall padded with some junk mail.

, The cork is usually already recessed slightly into the bottle's neck. If the cork is flush with the end of the bottle, push your object against the cork to force it in a little. This will allow your object to stay in place without slipping off the side of the bottle.

, Point the bottle away from people, just in case wine sprays out. While gripping the bottle with one hand and your object with the other hand, push firmly on the cork until it falls into the bottle. Be ready for the wine to splash a bit when the cork hits it.








This method works well but you will likely end up with small pieces of cork in your wine.
The surrounding area (and the opener's clothes!) should be stain resistant as a little wine may spill; don't try this with red wine and a nice outfit or over a carpet. Have some napkins handy; you may wish to wrap one around the neck as you push.

Fill a quarter of the glass with wine and hold it by the stem.,
Take a small sniff of the wine right after opening.,
Look at the edges of the wine and note the colors.,
Know that red wines have natural sediment at the bottom.,
Swirl the wine in your glass.,
Sniff the wine.",How to Taste Wine1," Holding the glass by the bulb will heat up the wine and distort the flavor. The reason for the stems is to prevent adding excess heat, so hold the glass lightly by the thin stem.Wine needs to ""breathe,"" or rest in exposed air, after being opened to get the best flavor, so take your time examining the wine before starting to drink.;
, This is a good time to catch a preliminary sniff of the wine so you can compare its fragrance after swirling. This will also allow you to check for any off odors that might indicate spoiled (corked) wine or some other biological or chemical imperfection, which will smell stale or rotten. Smells to note include:


A musty, wet, attic-like smell means the wine was improperly bottled and cannot be salvaged.
The smell of burnt matches is a product of bottling, but it should fade after exposure to air.
Nail polish or vinegar-esque smells indicate a wine that is too acidic.
Brettanomyces, or ""Brett,"" causes a yeasty smell that is natural in red wines. Too much of this yeast smell can, however, ruin the other flavors of the wine and point to a mistake in the wine-making process., Tilting the glass can make it easier to see the way the color changes from the center to the edges. Hold the glass in front of a white background, such as a napkin, tablecloth, or sheet of paper, to make out the wine's true color. For the wine professional, this is the first clue to how old the wine may be and how well it is holding up. Look for the color of the color and clarity of the wine. Intensity, depth, and saturation of color are not necessarily consistent with quality.


The wine should not be murky or cloudy in color.
White wines get naturally darker with age, but should not be brown.
Red wines to lose their color with time, turning brownish, and have a small amount of harmless, dark red sediment in the bottom of the bottle or glass., Sediment formation, which looks like dirt at the bottom of the glass, is a naturally occurring process in which polymerization causes the precipitation of colloids of pigmentation, among other things, to fall out of solution and form small grainy sediment. Long story short: this is not a fault in the wine, it this is a natural part of wine making.

, This is to increase the surface area of the wine by spreading it over the inside of the glass allowing them to escape from solution and reach your nose. It also allows some oxygen into the wine, which will help its aromas open up.


Lightly twirl the stem of the glass, keeping the bottom of the glass on the table if you are worried about spilling.
Viscosity is how quickly the wine slides back down the glass. More viscous wines are said to have ""legs,"" and are likely to be more alcoholic or contain more glycerol (for sweeter, dessert wines). Outside of looking pretty, this has no relation to a wine's quality, but more ""legs"" may indicate a full-bodied wine., Initially, you should hold the glass a few inches from your nose. Then let your nose dive 1/2 inch or so into the glass. What do you smell? Keep gently swirling your wine if you can't smell much -- swirling allows the evaporating alcohol to carry the aromatic molecules toward your olfactory sensors.f you don't think a wine smells good, it likely won't taste good. Great wine is enticing on the nose and gives you a hint of what is to come.Common scents include:


Fruits: berries, cherries, and richer fruits for reds and citrus for whites.
Floral or herb scents in whites and lighter reds, like Rhône region reds.
Earthy scents, like soils, minerals, or rocks, are possible in nicer whites.
Spices and unique smells like vanilla, toast, pepper, chocolate, and coffee come from the wooden barrels used to age the wine, usually oak.Older wines often have nuanced, subtle smells that are hard to place, so don't worry if you can't pick out a smell.

Find a pocket knife or a paring knife.,
Insert the blade into the cork.,
Twist back and forth to slowly remove the cork.,
Wedge the knife in between the bottle and the cork.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew2," The blade has to fit easily into the neck of the bottle. You can also try using a serrated knife so that it grips the cork better.Exercise caution when using a knife. Make sure not to cut yourself.

, Carefully work the knife back and forth into the cork, using very little downward pressure. It should go all the way through the cork., With the blade buried in the cork, twist the knife with a slight pull, and slowly work it out. Be careful not to break off pieces of the cork into your wine.







, Use the knife to pry the cork out from the side. Carefully insert the knife between the edge of the cork and the bottle. Apply slow, even pressure on the cork by pulling the knife towards you so that its blade moves inward, like a lever.









If applying pressure from the side, it works best to grip the bottleneck with your free hand slightly below the knife.

Remove the wine bottle’s protective cover.,
Place the bottle of wine in the opening of your shoe.,
Hit the sole of your shoe holding the wine bottle gently against a wall.,
Remove the cork.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew3," Make sure there is no plastic or foil covering the cork. It should be just the cork and the bottle. To remove the cover, simply slide it off by pulling it upwards. If it doesn’t slide off, pull on the tab if it has one, which will remove the top portion of it. Alternately, cut it off with a knife by gently tracing a knife around the edge of it., It can be any kind of flat shoe (not high heels or flip flops), as long as its opening is large enough to accommodate a bottle of wine. The bottle should go in bottom first, so that the cork is facing you. To keep the bottle in the shoe, you will hold the bottle with one hand and the shoe with your other hand., Continuing to hold both the shoe and the bottle, hit the bottom of your shoe against a wall several times. The bottle should be horizontal and you only need to make contact on the wall with the portion of your shoe directly under your bottle. Your shoe will protect the bottle from breaking, but don’t hit it too hard. A firm hit several times should begin to move the cork out due to the pressure in the bottle.








If you are on a picnic and there isn’t a wall nearby, you could hit your shoe against a pole or a tree. Just make sure not to miss it or you will likely drop your bottle!
If you don’t have a shoe that fits a wine bottle, you could wrap the bottle in a towel or hold a book behind the bottle while hitting it. The shoe’s purpose is simply to protect the bottle from breaking.

, Once the cork has moved out of the bottle by about an inch, you can simply pull out the cork with your fingers. Your bottle of wine is now ready to enjoy.

Use a bicycle hook instead of a screw.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew4," The wider the distance between threads on the screw, the better. Make sure that any objects which come into contact with the cork are clean; dirty objects increase the likelihood of tainting your wine.

, Turn the screw into the center of the cork until there is about 1








Work carefully to ensure that the cork does not break apart into smaller pieces.

, Use the pliers to pull the screw out; the cork should come with it. The claw (nail-pulling side) of a hammer also works well in place of pliers, as does a fork. You simply need some object that can grip the screw better than your fingers.







, Simply replace the pliers with the corncob holder, making a T shape. The screw should be vertical and the corncob holder should be horizontal. Place the corncob holder where the prongs are hugging the screw. Place your index and middle fingers on the prongs and handle respectively, and pull up.


Make sure the corncob holder is thinner than the flat end of a small to medium threaded screw.

, Find a bicycle hook (the kind used to hang bikes from rafters). Screw it into the cork. Using the vinyl-coated hook as a handle, pull the cork out, away from your body. This way, you don’t need pliers or another object to remove it.

Rotate the wire 90 degrees.,
Remove the cork.,
Use the hanger as a corkscrew.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew5," Get a cheap wire coat hanger and bend the hook part out straight.

, Use pliers to make a little hook by bending the last half inch (10 mm) back until it makes an angle of about 30 degrees (a bit like a fish hook).







, The wire should be straight against the edge of the bottle (the hook shouldn’t face in yet). Push the wire down beside the cork until the little hook is below the cork. You will need to push it down at least 2” to accomplish this.







, This will allow the hook to grab the bottom of the cork so that you can easily pull it out. Simply twist the hanger so that the little hook moves towards the center of the bottle., Pull on the hanger slowly, wobbling it back and forth a bit to ease out the cork. You might want to wear gloves, as the wire can hurt your fingers. The hook should enter into the cork while pulling up so that the cork moves with the hanger.

, An alternate method with a coat hanger is to use the hanger in place of a corkscrew. After straightening the hook, simply insert it into the center of the cork. Twist the hanger while pulling on it gently. This will gradually remove the cork."

Take a sip of wine and let it linger in your mouth.,
Aspirate the wine after your first taste.,
Take another sip of wine, this time with air with it.,
Look for balance in a good wine.,
Note the aftertaste of the wine.,
Write down what you think about the wine.",How to Taste Wine2," One important difference between drinking and tasting is expectorating. Roll the wine around in your mouth, exposing it to all of your taste buds. Pay attention to the texture and other tactile sensations such as the sense of weight or body (the wine feels physical). What are the initial flavors that stand out? Most importantly, do you like it?Spit the wine into a spittoon, provided on all wine-tours, if you are planning to taste lots of wine. Getting drunk will make it harder to taste complex wines later on. If you're driving, use the spittoon.

, With your lips pursed as if you were to whistle, draw some air into your mouth and exhale through your nose. This liberates the aromas for the wine and allows them to reach your nose via the passageway at the back of your throat, known as the retro-nasal cavity. The nose is the only place where you can detect a wine's aromas. However, the enzymes and other compounds in your mouth and saliva alter some of a wine's aromatic compounds. You are looking for any new aromas liberated by the wine's interaction with the environment of your mouth.

, In other words, slurp the wine (without making a loud slurping noise, of course). Note the subtle differences in flavor and texture. Flavors and scents come in successive waves in fine wines, they are revealed as your sensors adjust to the wine.


This is especially important with red wines.
Don't worry if this makes you feel out of place. It is an accepted step in wine tasting.

, Is there any one taste that overpowers the rest? Can you detect the same flavors you smelled now that you are tasting the wine? Great wines are balanced so that they don't attack your taste buds. You can taste 2-3 different fruits, a mixture of sweet and sour, and some earthy characteristics.


A little bitterness is natural, but it shouldn't ruin your palate.
All wines are different -- whites and dessert wines, for example, are usually on the sweeter side. You are looking for balanced flavors, whatever they are, not one ""perfect"" balance., How long does the finish last? A good, 60 second or longer flavor in the aftertaste is a good sign of quality. At times, you will pick up things in the finish that was not detectable in the initial taste. Do you like the taste? Has it changed?

, You can use whatever terminology you feel comfortable with. The most important thing to write down is your impression of the wine and how much you liked it. The more specific or detailed you are the better your reference will be against a similar wine from another winery. Many wineries provide booklets and pens so that you can notes. This can be a great aide in helping you to pay attention to the subtleties of the wine and remember what you like.


Keep a booklet of your favorite bottles and what meal you ate them with for future reference.

Match the glassware to the wine.,
Know how wines change with age.,
Remember some common flavors for different wines.,
Know how common wine flavors are produced.,
Try pairing wines with new ingredients and note the how it enhances or diminishes the flavors of the wine.",How to Taste Wine3," Stemware/drinkware comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The more experienced wine drinkers and connoisseurs often enjoy wines out of stemware or bulbs that are tailor-made for a specific varietal. When starting out, the basic rule of thumb is that you want larger glasses for reds and smaller glasses for whites., Wines have a myriad of components that can be generally categorized into aromatic or tactile. Aromatics relate to what you smell. Tactile elements include bitterness, saltiness, sweetness, tanginess/acidity, and savory elements.


Aging will soften tannins, which is the bitter taste in some wines.
Perceived Acidity will soften throughout the life of a wine as it undergoes chemical changes, including the breakdown of acids.
Flavor and aromatic intensity will rise and then fall throughout the life of a wine, going into a cocoon stage mid-life and reemerging.
Alcohol content will stay nearly the same. All of these factors contribute to knowing when to drink/decant a wine.

, There are some commonly found tastes for each of the most common varieties. However, remember that the growing region, harvesting decisions, and production choices have a great impact on a wine's flavor as well.



Cabernet - black currant, cherry other, black fruits, green spices.

Merlot - plum, red and black fruits, green spices, floral.

Zinfandel - black fruits (often jam-like) and black spices - often called ""briary.""

Syrah (or Shiraz, depending on vineyard location) - black fruits, black spices - especially white and black pepper.

Pinot Noir - red fruits, floral, herbs.

Chardonnay - cool climate: tropical fruit, citrus fruit in slightly warmer climes and melon in warm regions. With increasing proportion of malolactic fermentation, Chardonnay loses green apple and takes on creamy notes, Apple, pear, peach, and apricot.

Sauvignon Blanc - Grapefruit, white gooseberry, lime, melon., There are a lot of decisions a winemaker must make when designing a wine, and it would be impossible to explain them all. Some of the most common methods, and the taste they produce, include:


Malolactic fermentation (the natural or artificial introduction of a specific bacteria) will cause white wines to taste creamy or buttery
Aging in oak will cause wines to take on a vanilla, caramel, or nutty flavor.
The minerality and earthiness of a wine comes from the soil the wine was grown in.
""Tannins"" refers to the astringent, bitter compounds found in grape skins, stems and seeds as well as the oak barrels in which the wine is aged. If you want to know what tannins taste like, bite into a grape stem or eat a cabernet grape off the vine. In young red wines, tannins taste bitter and drying, but they get silky with age., With red wines try different cheeses, good quality chocolate and berries. With white wines, try apples, pears, and citrus fruits.



Pairing wine with food is more complicated than ""red with beef and white with fish."" Feel free to drink whichever wine you want with whatever food you want, but remember a perfect pairing is a highly enjoyable experience

Pour and enjoy!",How to Open a Champagne Bottle with a Sword," The key to opening a champagne bottle with a sword is the pressure in the bottle.


Because of the way champagne is packaged, the carbon dioxide creates roughly 35 pounds of force pushing against the cork at all times.
Glass is brittle. That means that it breaks instead of bending when it is damaged.
Scoring the surface of the glass bottle will cause it to crack, and the force inside will cause the collar of the bottle and the cork to fly off.;
, You will likely not get this right on the first try, so you will need backup bottles. This trick even works on cheap champagne though, so there’s no need to splurge on your practice bottles.


Sparkling wine also works well.
In general, French and Spanish champagne tends to come in thicker bottles than American champagne. It may also be more expensive. Thicker glass works better than thin, but if you’re operating on a budget, American champagne will also work.
This trick typically takes half to a full a case to master. Plan on making at least a $30 investment to learn (6 x $5 bottles). Practice with inexpensive, corked sparkling wine. Note that some inexpensive bottles are cheaply made from inferior glass, which can lead to a higher rate of breakage and are therefore riskier to work with.

, It doesn’t have to be terribly sharp. Really, any sturdy knife will work. Of course, a sword is the most dramatic and flashy!









The best knives and swords for sabrage are thick and sturdy. The sides should be as flat (parallel to each other) as possible.
You may want to practice with a sturdy kitchen knife before investing in a fancy sword.
Keep your eye out in thrift stores, yard sales, and estate sales, and you could find a sword for a reasonable price.
You can find champagne swords made specifically for this purpose online. , The colder the neck of the bottle is, the better.









You may want to chill the neck in a bucket of ice water right before sabering.
Be very careful not to shake the champagne.
Don’t chill it in the freezer. You’ll ruin the flavor, and it could explode. , Outside is best. This trick is going to create flying objects and spill champagne, so unless you are in an open indoor area like a gymnasium, outside is your best option.









Some saberers have reported that the cork flies as far as twenty feet, so give yourself plenty of room.
Be sure that the guests you are trying to impress with this trick have a safe haven away from flying corks.

, Wipe away any moisture on the bottle. Remove the foil and wire basket from the top of the bottle. Keep your thumb over the cork as you do this. There is a chance that simply removing the wire will cause the cork to fly out.








, This is where the two halves of the bottle join together. It’s the weakest part of the bottle, so it’s where you’re going to focus your attention.








, The cork should be higher than the bottom of the bottle. Be sure to point the cork in a direction where it will not hit anyone or anything. The angle doesn’t have to be very precise.








, Grip the bottle firmly at the base. Put all of your fingers except your thumb beneath the bottle (on the opposite side from the seam) out of the way of the sword. The bottle should rest on your fingers while your thumb stabilizes it. 








Your sword will not come anywhere near the base, so your fingers will be safe down here.

, This will help you stabilize the bottle without putting your thumb in danger.









Once your thumb is in place, practice holding your fingers closer together or farther apart.
Choose the method of holding the bottle that feels both secure and safe. , The dull edge of the blade should face the cork. Hold the blade flat against the bottle.









This trick also works if you use the sharp or cutting edge of the sword, but it can damage your sword.
Using the cutting edge of a sword can also increase the chances that you don’t get a clean cut.

, This is the ring around the top, which you will be aiming for with the back of the sword.









Notice the point of the annulus where it connects with the seam of the bottle. This is the weakest point on the bottle.

, Before attempting this grand gesture, it will help for you to get a feel for the motion.








You could also try putting the sword down and practicing the motion with just your hand.

, Do this using a single firm, confident stroke.The bottle should break cleanly and the cork should go flying. If done correctly, the bottle will break cleanly. Make sure you follow through with the motion — that is, don't halt your arm when you hit the annulus. Continue moving your arm forward, following the trajectory of the cork.









You will get the best, cleanest results by following the seam.If you don't use enough force or you pause, the trick won't work.
If you find that your first attempt doesn’t work, you should go back to practicing. Be sure that you can move your hand (without the sword) quickly and assuredly.

, Wipe it off carefully with a cloth if necessary. Be careful not to push shards of glass into the bottle.









The pressure inside that sent the cork and top of the bottle flying will likely have prevented any shards from falling into the bottle, but you can never be too careful. , Be sure to double check the glass of champagne for shards of glass.









It’s also a good idea to locate the annulus and cork at this point. Be careful not to step on it, and only pick it up by the edge that isn’t broken.

Be ready to show expertise when you're given your glass of wine.,

Be aware that winemakers and wine tasters are very fond of finding fruit other than grapes in the wine.",How to Pretend You Have Good Taste in Wine," A fast study in the art of wine doesn't have to be all cramming and no play. This movie is a fun study of how you can get away with pretending to like wine while in the company of a mate who actually does know wine inside out. In this film, the clueless-about-wine character simply trails about mimicking his friend's expertise, all in the pursuit of impressing women for the chance of a date. Watching the antics, you'll realize how much fun it can be to pretend you have good taste in wine.


It's recommended that you enjoy a glass of wine during the film. You can mimic the gestures used and try any of the ploys that you think will work for you.;
, A discerning wine drinker will already be familiar with good wine labels, so may only place stock in the name and year. As an amateur wine fan, you're less knowledgeable and you'll need to read the lot. Moreover, since a pretty or funny label doesn't necessarily guarantee good quality contents (and can, indeed, be a way of diverting the attention of less savvy wine drinkers from the sour muck inside the bottle), you need to wise up to the marketing tricks. It's therefore important to do a quick brush-up on wine labels for the wines likely to be at your wine-tasting event, both local and farther afield. Alternatively, if you want to just wing it, bookmark a few trusted wine review sites or download some apps to your smartphone before you leave home, then subtly search what others have to say about the particular wine when in situ. Do this discretely––under the bar, tablecloth, while pretending to text a friend or quickly nip to the bathroom to ""powder your nose."" Alternatively, make a show of ""adding the wine"" to your app, giving you the chance to quickly read up on its qualities. When assessing the label:


Start with the obvious things: First, check for awards or endorsements––an award winning bottle of wine is always worth trying. Then, read the back of the bottle. This information will provide clues about the wine such as the types of fruit, aging process or region where it’s made. Be aware it's probably dripping in wine terminology about such things as buttery, berry or peachy tones but if the description tickles your fancy, then it's probably worth trying.
Plenty of wine companies are making vintages with names like, “Desperate Housewife” or “Ménage a Trois.” While funny or cute, there’s no guarantee those bottles of wine will be delicious, so be discerning. Then again, don't be too cynical about the marketing ploys. While they're in full swing when it comes to wine, not all pretty label pictures are covering up for bad wine inside. Sometimes the quality of the image and wine actually dovetail, so try not to judge (or misjudge) the wine by its label alone.
Ask the chef or the person responsible for pouring the wine. Act magnanimous and show your friends that you're willing to let your favorite chef, sommelier, garçon or waiter endorse the choice. Allowing the serving staff to shine will win you brownie points for being friendly, thoughtful and willing to trust the judgment of the staff.
You can always say you left your glasses at home if you choose really poorly!

, (Hopefully your wine is coming out of a bottle––if not, refuse it because that shows you know that it's just ""plonk"" and not fit for pretending anything about.) Comment on the elegant shape of the bottle and its interesting color or texture. Or make an informed comment about the cork versus plastic screw cap debate––you can find great statistics or factoids about corks and screw caps online, such as the high cost of shipping corks to New Zealand and Australia from Europe versus the lower cost of screwcaps, the much reduced rate of corking (cork taint) for bottles using screwcaps, the previous facts then being complicated by the sustainability of harvesting cork versus using less-sustainable plastic, and so forth. Do a quick bit of online research and you can sound amazingly knowledgeable before the bottle even gets opened!

, Even if you don't know what you're looking at (besides the obvious fact that it's wine in a glass), you can definitely pretend you're ""in the know"" by adopting the typical gestures of a seasoned wine taster.


Pick up the glass and gaze lovingly at the color and texture of the liquid within. A few ""ooh, what a deep red velvet cake red"" or ""this white has an awesome pearlescent quality to it"" won't go astray here––the more descriptive, the better. As for knowing whether or not the wine should be that color, don't fret––you can at least appreciate the color it does present. To study the color of wine, hold it to your eye level and study the hue with a good, hard stare.
Then get serious. Gently swish the wine around the perimeter of the glass. To do this, place the glass of wine on the table and firmly grasp it by its base. Smoothly swirl the wine around (with the glass still on the table) to get an idea of its texture and volume. Take care not to swish so hard it sloshes out (although this can be used as a last resort should your friends start getting suspicious about your wine credibility). Indeed, if you're in charge of pouring, don’t pour a full glass, as you'll need that extra room to swirl and swish the wine around without it spilling on the table.
Take a good sniff of the wine’s aroma. Try to get your nose down in the glass––avoid actually inhaling wine––although amusing, it's incredibly uncool. Breathe deeply as if you were inhaling scents from a fresh spring meadow. Wine appreciation is a combination of appreciating the aroma and enjoying the taste, as outlined in the following two steps.

, When it's finally time to drink, only take a dainty sip, then swish it around in your mouth like mouthwash. At this stage, you're only attempting to ""coat your palate"". Give a smile or a knowing look and utter a few ""ah, so smooth"" comments. Follow the cue offered by your friends––by this stage you should already have demonstrated enough wine knowledge that a short delay in offering your opinion should be just fine. Or maybe if you just look ecstatic as you sip serenely, you won't even have to offer a further opinion!


Don't spit it out unless you're actually wine-tasting––it'd be bad taste to do so at the dinner table. After this initial taste, you can drink normally if dining, or finish that glass before repeating the procedure with the next wine at a tasting.
If you've been designated first taster at the table during a dinner party, again only take a small sip and be ready to confirm that the wine is drinkable. This role is often misinterpreted as one of awaiting for your approval of the wine itself but this initial sip is about ensuring that the wine isn't corked, and that it is going to be okay for all at the table to drink. If it's good, simply say so, while if it's corked, send it back. (""Corked"" refers to the phenomenon whereby the phenols in the cork have reacted with the wine, making it taste like old socks. Bear in mind that if you've already thought that it smelled like a wet dog, then bonus points to you, as the rank smell is usually the first, most obvious indicator.) Generally it's presumed that the wines offered at a wine tasting won't be corked because those running the event will already have an initial indication before serving each person.
If you think a wine is off but you're not sure, ask the waiter or sommelier to confirm it; this is standard practice.

, They might also manage to find vegetables, candy and a variety of other non-grape derived flavors too. Just roll with it, it's the fun part of tasting wine. And there is no saying that your palate has to be the same as anybody else's––if you taste bubblegum and smell pretzels while they're all tasting cherries, just smile it out. You'll get the hang of it soon enough and taste is subjective anyway.


Fruity wine can include aromas and flavors like citrus (grapefruit and lemon), berry (strawberry, blackcurrant, raspberry) and tropical fruit (lychee, melon, banana).
Some wines actually have a hint of vegetables including bell peppers, green or black olives, mushrooms.
Herb and plant flavors are also commonplace in wines, such as mint and even freshly cut grass.

Eat just before the festival, and snack throughout your time at the festival.,
Drink equal parts water and wine or, better yet, more water than wine.,
Have a plan of attack.,
Spit two or three of every five wines you sample if you can't spit them all.,

Keep a record of your favorite wines rather than trying to quaff down more of them.,
Have a designated driver or some plan to avoid driving.",How to Navigate a Wine Festival," Many wine festivals include food booths or stalls and often feature local produce. It is likely that you will be able to enjoy such foods as cheese, olive oil tastings with crackers, bread, olives, dried fruits, etc. Take time to enjoy this food as well as the wine and your body will absorb less alcohol as a result.
, The easiest way to accomplish this is to carry your own water with you. While many booths will provide water, sometimes they run out, and you also don't want to hold up the line drinking water in addition to wine.

Drinking a lot of water will probably mean that you end up taking several trips to the toilet, but doing this will keep you from getting dehydrated, especially if the weather is warm.

, Stick with the following order and select only a few wines from within each range. Do not double back! The recommended order is:





 Light white wine first please!

Try the white wines first, then the reds, and finally the sparkling wines and ports. Also try dry before sweet and light before full-bodied wine.Take your time to smell the wine before trying it. This is an important part of the sampling experience. Try to guess the aromas coming from the wine in each glass.Remember your wine tasting skills. Smell, swirl, see, sip. Follow this, and you will get the best of your wine. For more tips on how to taste the wine, see How to Taste Wine.

, At least some of the tastings should be just that; mere tastings.

Carry your own spit cup (spittoon). This gets around the problem of no such cups being available, although a good wine festival should account for this adequately. You can rinse the spit cup regularly with the water that is usually supplied. If not, nip into the bathroom and rinse it out periodically.

, If you find a wine you really like, write it down and stick the information in your pocket. Plan to buy it later to enjoy in the comfort and safety of your home., It is always safer to have a non-drinker in charge of the driving. Organize this in advance, or have a taxi or booze bus booked in advance."

Rotate the wire 90 degrees so that the U will be beneath the cork when you pull up.Repeat on the opposite side of the cork with the second paperclip.

, Twist the ends together a few times. They should be securely joined so that they stay together when pulling out the cork.

, Insert a suitable utensil, such as a spoon handle, pen barrel, or pencil, under the twisted wires. Slide your fingers under the utensil, with the wires between your middle and ring fingers, and slowly pull out the cork."

Find 3 short finishing nails and a hammer.,
Gently hammer the nails into the cork.,
Place the claw of the hammer around the nails.,
Pry the nail-embedded cork out of the bottle.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew7," Ideally, you will want the nails to reach just to the bottom of the cork.

, Hammer them straight down and form a line with the nails. Keep the nails in close proximity to each other. Don’t hammer too hard or you could break the cork into pieces.







, It should grip them tightly to allow for removal.

, Simply pull on the hammer and gradually move the cork towards you. You can gently rock it back and forth to help with removal. You can also use the hammer and nails to hold the cork in place and twist the bottle away from you to separate the cork from the bottle.








If at first the cork does not come out, hammer nails in again in a line perpendicular to the original line and try again.

Twist the scissor handles while pulling up.",How to Open a Wine Bottle Without a Corkscrew8," It is best to use smaller craft scissors or scissors for children (not safety scissors).

, Be sure not to touch the sharp side of the blades. Hold the handles of the scissors and open them fully.

, Carefully apply a slight amount of pressure and push the scissor blade halfway into the cork. Be careful not to push the cork into the bottle or break the cork., Hold the bottle tightly with one hand while twisting the handles of the scissors. Alternately, hold the handles of the scissors still and twist the bottle instead. The cork will come out on the scissor blade if you have the blade wedged deep enough or the cork will come out far enough to be pulled out by hand.

Try to tilt the glass to its side (if you can).,
Wait till the bubbles subside and then continue pouring to fill the glass.",How to Pour a Glass of Champagne," Place it in the fridge, or better yet, submerge it for an hour or two in a wine bucket with plenty of ice and a little bit of water.;
, Polish with a tea towel (dish towel) or linen napkin to remove any water marks and dust. Milk is your worst enemy for fizzy drinks so make sure you never use milk in your champagne flutes or glasses, or wash it in water where milky substances have already been washed.

, White linen napkins look best but may not capture your drips as easy as a soft tea towel. This prevents the ice water or condensation from dripping and also makes the bottle easier to hold with one hand if you choose to do so.

, Make sure to keep a hand on top of the cork as they can 'pop' prematurely.


Gently twist the bottle to ease the cork from the bottle. The bottle should not make a ""pop"" sound but ""sigh contentedly"". Making the bottle ""POP"" is a sure fire way of reducing the carbon dioxide content of the champagne making it feel ""flat"" when you taste it.







, Do not put the glass in one hand and the bottle in another, unless you have the strength to hold the champagne bottle with one hand.

, This will stabilize the bottle for accurate pouring. If you have a very steady pouring hand, you can skip this step.

, This way, when you pour the champagne, the champagne will hit the side of the glass, reducing the speed at which it hits the base of the glass, thus maintaining the bubbly texture.


Pour the wine onto the side of the glass, not onto the base.

, This may take up to 4 or 5 pauses in a champagne flute or may be achieved in a single pour if using a traditional champagne ""Marie Antoinette"" shaped glass.


Twist the bottle as you remove it from the side of the glass to remove any remaining champagne on the edge of the bottle.

, Again, remove any seeds so that people can munch on the fruit without worrying about breaking a molar. Furthermore, seeds are usually bitter, and can impact the final flavor.

, Muddling is simply beating the fruit up a bit with a wooden spoon. This releases sugars and flavors that will work their way into the sangria.

, Like all the other ingredients, you can adjust the brandy to match your taste, and you can add a few other liquids here if you'd like to try something new:



Orange Liquor: Gives a nice, sweet little kick to the drink without water down the alcohol content.

Orange Juice: Sweetens up the drink while adding a little more citrus. Also stretches out the drink a bit more and cuts some of the alcohol., You want a light, refreshing white wine for the best sangria. Traditionally, sangria is made with a Spanish Roja, but most people substitute a nice Merlot without missing anything.

, You can serve the Sangria as is if you add ice, or let it blend in the refrigerator for a few hours. The choice is yours. Either way, serve the drink on ice for a refreshing, wonderful burst of flavor. If you want, you can even leave the drink to blend overnight for the best flavor.


Many recipes claim you must let it sit for 4 hours. While this will taste better, it is not strictly necessary., Everything is a bit more refreshing when it has some fizz to it, and Sangria is no different. Furthermore, this is just one more chance to customize your perfect version of the classic cocktail.



Club Soda: Perfect if you like a little refreshing fizz in your drink. Add as much as you added brandy.

Seltzer Water: Has a bit more pucker to it, making it a great choice to balance out too-sweet sangrias, in particular. You can even try flavored seltzers, like Lemon-Lime.

Champagne or Prosecco: This is sangria, so go nuts! A bubbly, light, and crisp wine or prosecco will keep the drink strong and add a refreshing punch of bubbles."

Nearly any kind of wine can be used to make this drink. You can use to use a lower quality bottle of wine or boxed wine to make spritzers, since the flavor of the wine will be diluted with water and ice, but as with anything, the better the ingredients you use, the better the final product will be.

Assemble your equipment and ingredients for bottling.,
Disinfect the equipment that will be used in the bottling process, including the bottles, funnel, and rubber hose, in a large pot of boiling water for at least three minutes.,
Boil the water to kill any form of bacteria.,
Activate the yeast.,
Use a clean funnel to fill the jug or bottles with the cooled sugar water.,
When you can see that the yeast has been activated (getting foamy) use the funnel to pour it into the bottle.,
Find a safe location where you’ll be able to store the bottle upright, such as inside a bathroom cabinet, in a basement, or behind a desk.,
When you can see that the balloon isn't full of gas anymore, the fermentation is over.,
Separate the dead yeast.,
Add the two packages of Kool Aid powder to the wine in the new bottle, cap the bottle, then shake it for a few seconds to mix it thoroughly.,
After the third week has passed, siphon it again except into small water bottles.,
When the wine is around 4 weeks old or older, it should be ready for consumption.",How to Make Kool Aid Wine,"


Most of the equipment used can be stuff found around the house, and bottles can be fished out of people's recycling bins or reused if you drink bottled water. If you clean the bottles with dish detergent and let them soak in bleach for a few minutes, then rinse them well, you'll have nothing to worry about.
The rubber tubing can be found in Home Depot for about $4. It is intended for use with ice makers. You could also find it in aquarium stores or just about any hardware store, but may pay a bit more.;
, This will kill the critters that could potentially be plaguing your equipment. If you fail to do this step, the bacteria could kill the yeast and/or spoil the wine.


Be sure to use a different pot than the one you use to make the sugar water.

, Use the jug or bottles to measure how much water you will need. Fill a large pot with water and the sugar. As it gets hot stir to dissolve all of the sugar. Let the water and sugar mixture cool to room temperature.

, Pour the packet into half a cup of warm water (not hot or you'll kill the yeast) with a teaspoon of sugar. Let it sit for a couple minutes, then stir it lightly. Move on to the next step.

, Do not overfill. Leave some air space for foaming.

, Add 4 more cups of warm water, cap it, and shake it again. Make sure all the sugar is dissolved and that the yeast is mixed in.

, Take the balloon and poke a few holes in it using the pin. Take the cap off the bottle and stretch the balloon across the opening. Put an elastic around the balloon on the top of the bottle to hold it in position. Carefully put the bottle in a plastic bag that will catch any wine that overflows or spills. Put the bottle in your decided location and leave it there for about 2 weeks, until the balloon isn't full of gas anymore. The balloon will fill up with gas which will leak out the holes in it, but when the gas stops, the holes will close and air won’t be able to get in and ruin your wine. This process is where the alcohol is being produced, and is called fermentation.


If you use 2-Litres, then instead of using balloons you can tighten the cap to just before it is fully sealed, which will let gas escape when it builds up but won't let any in when it stops fermenting.
Instead of a balloon, you can use a common fermenter airlock. They cost about $1.50.

, Remove the bottle from its location, and be very careful not to shake it up. At this point, the alcohol has actually been produced and this stuff will get you drunk, but it is “flavorless” and is an acquired taste. (If it has gone bad, usually from something unsanitary, it will taste like vinegar. It makes you want to puke on one sip, so it's pretty obvious.) Waiting a little bit longer and finishing the rest of this will yield a much better tasting product.

, There should be a fine layer of dead yeast and such lying on the bottom of the bottle. This stuff isn’t poisonous, but it tastes awful and is known to give you bad gas. Place the bottle somewhere relatively high, such as on a counter, and put the second 4L bottle on the floor underneath. Using the rubber hose, siphon the unflavoured wine into the empty bottle without sucking up any of the gunk on the bottom. Try not to let it splash around too much. When only a small amount of wine is left right above the sediment, stop siphoning and throw the rest out.


Another way you can remove the dead yeast is to strain your liquid through a properly cleaned cloth.
Switching containers is not necessary; it's done to get rid of the dead yeasty-beasties. Yeasty-beasties cloud the wine, taste bad and can give you diarrhea. Aesthetics count. It is difficult to be proud of cloudy wine but a crystal clear 14% wine is something to be proud of, regardless of how you did it or how cheap it tastes!

, Try tasting a bit, it will probably be awful. Don’t dump it out, it will get way better! Adding some more sugar here may improve the flavor a bit, but it really needs to age a little while longer. Leave it in the second 4L bottle for about a week or so, and check on it whenever you can to make sure there isn’t gas building up inside the bottle. If it is bulging a bit, just open the cap enough to let the gas escape then close it again.

, You will fill nearly 8 regular 500mL water bottles. The smaller bottles are much easier to hide and to drink from.

, Have fun and don’t be afraid to tell people you made it yourself!

Remove spoiled wine.",How to Make Cheap Wine," Any juice will work for your vinting, but you may want to start with something familiar, like grape juice. The most important thing to be aware of when selecting your juice is the sugar content. This will influence the strength of your finished wine.


The higher your sugar content, the stronger your wine will be.
You may want to avoid juices that list corn syrup as a sweetener. This will make a corn based wine, which may undesirably affect the flavor profile.
For the purest finished wine, you may want to use pure fruit or berry juice.
You can vint your wine with as little as a half gallon of juice, but to keep your measurements simple while getting the hang of the process, a gallon of juice is recommended.;
, This is an optional step. You can simply use whatever juice you have selected without testing, but you won't know how strong the wine will be. Warm or cool your juice to the temperature the hydrometer is calibrated to, usually 60°F (15°C). Clean your hydrometer with soap and water, if necessary, and then:



Insert your hydrometer into your juice, bulb oriented downward. You'll want the inner fluid of the hydrometer to be even with the top of your juice.
Swirl the hydrometer slightly, being sure not to touch the sides or bottom of your container.
Wait until your hydrometer ceases to bubble. Where the inner fluid of your hydrometer reaches will indicate your potential alcohol. For most hydrometers, this value will be between 0.990 to 1.120.
Juice with reading of 1.090 will produce wine that is 12.3% alcohol. The average alcohol content for wine is between 12 and 15%.Many vinting/brewing hydrometers will have a scale on the side to indicate the percentage of potential alcohol., In some cases, the sugar in your wine may be insufficient for the strength that you're aiming for. In this case, you'll have to remove some juice and dissolve sugar into it. For example, if you plan on adding 2 cups of sugar, first remove two cups of juice.


You may have an easier time adding sugar to your juice using a funnel.
If you don't have a funnel, you could use a rolled up piece of paper or parchment paper to form a makeshift one.
As a general rule, you should aim for about 4 cups of sugar for each gallon of juice. However, if you want a weaker wine, you may want to use less., You'll need the sugar to be completely dissolved, with none swirling around in the juice or collecting at the bottom of the container. The best way to speed this process along is to shake the container thoroughly.


To make sure your sugar has dissolved after shaking, you may want to leave it for 5 - 10 minutes. If sugar collects on the bottom, you'll need to shake it some more.
Some juices can be very dark. This may make it difficult to see the sugar. In many cases, you can improve visibility through the juice by holding it up to a light or shining a flashlight on it., Yeast ferments best between 70° and 90°F (21.1°- 32.2°C). The warmer the temperature of your juice, the quicker your yeast will ferment. If your juice is at room temperature, it should ferment acceptably., You can use any yeast that's available, though champagne yeast is recommended. For a gallon of juice, you'll only need about 1/5 of the packet, which will be about the size of a nickel.


For those who do not have access to a nickel, a thin pile of yeast about ¾"" (2 cm) in diameter should be sufficient.
Other kinds of yeast will take longer to ferment your juice into wine, and will often result in a weaker alcohol content.
You don't need to mix your yeast into the juice. It will eventually spread throughout the mixture naturally., Your airlock is the most important piece of equipment for your vinting, and can usually be bought at a brewing store for around a dollar. The airlock will allow the carbon dioxide that is released during the fermenting process to escape while keeping your juice/yeast from outside contaminants. Be sure to clean your airlock with soap and thoroughly rinse it before using.


Keep the original cap that came with your juice. You can use this later to reseal the container. Clean it with soap and hot water and store it in a baggie until you are ready to cap.
You may want to purchase a few airlocks. This way, you can brew multiple batches of wine at the same time.
For the airlock to function, you'll need to fill it with water. There should be a line on the airlock that says ""Max."" Fill it to this line.
To ensure the airlock is free of bacteria or other contaminants, you may want to use vodka to fill it. This can be especially useful if you don't plan on changing your airlock any time soon., For three-fourths to a full gallon of juice, it will usually take about two weeks for the fermentation to finish. You'll know when your juice is done fermenting by the lessening of the bubbling in your airlock.


At the beginning of the fermentation process, your airlock should release bubbles about every five seconds.
When your airlock bubbles once every 50 seconds or so, your wine is ready to be capped.
You can also wait until the airlock ceases to bubble at all., Remove the airlock and seal the juice container with the cap it came with. At this point, you'll notice some sediment along the bottom of the container. This is the dead yeast that fermented your wine, and is a natural byproduct of fermentation., If you leave the wine with the dead yeast for too long, it will affect the flavor. The yeast will be heavier than the liquid, so you can remove it easily by carefully pouring your wine into another suitable container, leaving the sediment at the bottom of your original one.The dead yeast isn't harmful to you, so if you forget to remove it and don't want to waste the wine, you can still drink it.
Yeast byproduct is very nutritious and makes excellent compost. You might want to dump the yeast byproduct in with your compost pile.When using a separate container, you should clean it thoroughly with soap and water before transferring wine to it to prevent contamination and bacterial growth.

, You'll want to include the date it finished fermenting as well as your process, like how much sugar you used, the kind of juice, etc. This has a dual purpose. Labeling your wine will help you remember how long its been aging and will also help you tighten up your process.


For example, you may find that using white sugar in your vinting takes too long to age. In this case, you might try a substitute, like honey., Immediately after you separate your wine and yeast byproduct, it's likely it won't taste very good. You'll want to let your wine age until it suits your tastes. In some cases, this may be as few as two weeks, in other cases it may take up to six months.


Wine vinted with white sugar often takes longer to age before it is palatable. It's likely that the more white sugar you add to your juice, the longer it will take the wine to age to an acceptable taste., You don't need to have a specialized room for storing your wine. However, a cool, dark place is traditional and will help the wine to age without other variables, like heat and light, influencing it. It's common for some yeast to remain active after capping, so be on the lookout for bulging containers.


If you notice a container is bulging, this is from the release of carbon dioxide from active yeast still in the mixture. Simply unscrew the cap to release the gas, then reseal the container.
If you've noticed bulging, it's likely sediment will appear at the bottom of your container once the remaining yeast expires. This means you may have to filter out yeast byproduct again., Wine professionally bottled can have a very long shelf life. Your homemade wine won't likely last as long, but it should still be good for a minimum of six months. Even so, a poor seal or contamination can occur. When checking your wine to see if it's still good, you should be on the lookout for:


A strong odor of applesauce, burnt marshmallow, or one that is nutty. This is sign that your wine has oxidized, meaning it has become stale.
A strong odor of cabbage, burnt rubber, or garlic. These are indicators that your wine had impurities in it that caused it to go bad.
A small taste of bad wine won't hurt you, so if you're unsure if your wine is good, take a sip. If the wine has a sharp vinegar taste that burns, or if the wine has a strong caramelized taste, like applesauce, your wine has likely gone bad."
"
Go nuts with your fruit combinations.,
Try a white wine sangria with new fruits and a dry, crisp white, like a Rioja or Pinto Gris.,
Experiment with less traditional wine types.,
Try out other liquors.,
Blend the citrus juice with spices ahead of time for a smoother drink.",How to Make Sangria2," There is really only one rule when choosing fruits for sangria -- you want one citrus and one non-citrus. Apple and oranges are the classic combination, but far from the only one. Try out:


Peaches
Plums
Pineapples
Strawberries.
Blackberries
Blueberries

, White wine makes incredibly refreshing sangria, especially when paired with a nice bubbly finish. In place of brandy, use a light liquor (apple, lemon, peach schnapps, vermouth.). That said, white wines tend to do better with different fruits than those used for red sangria. Try out:Apples
Lemons and Limes
Peaches
Grapefruit
Fresh mint
Raspberries
Pears
Strawberries
Kiwis, Sangria is not supposed to be complicated or set in stone. Knowing this, chefs and bartenders across the world are considering new bases for their drinks, including:



Rosé: The bubbly pink drink mixes well with fruit and delivers all the bubbles right off the top. Be careful not to let it go flat before serving, however.

Cava: Again, the bubbles are key, but this light and refreshing wine goes great, in particular, with blood oranges.

, The addition of brandy traditionally complements a red sangria lightly, but it is not the only liquor that can pull it off. You want to choose a drink that has natural notes of fruit, or a light floral scent to it. Don't try something strong that will distract from the refreshing fruit notes. You could think about:


Suze
Cointreau
St. Germain
Schnapps
Triple Sec, Instead of chopping all of the fruit, juice oranges, lime and lemon in a small saucepan; add 2-3 tablespoons caster sugar, a pinch of nutmeg, and a ground cinnamon stick and heat just until is steams, removing immediately and letting it cool before adding the wine.


Heat liquid (whilst stirring) until steam rises from surface - do not simmer.
You place the pot in a larger pot filled with cool water in order to cool the juice faster.

, You’ll not only be pouring but also spooning some of the fruit into glasses.

, You should make the drink ahead of time so the fruit and champagne has an hour or two to ferment. Instead of leaving it in the refrigerator open, cover with plastic wrap to protect against other food odors that could be lurking., This means even the lemons and oranges as you will be adding them to the drink with peel in tact.

, Try to make the slices uniform as they will add color but also flavor to the drink.

, Consider de-pitting cherries before adding to drink (or you can still add the cherries with pits in tact).


Make a small slice in the side of the cherry and pop out the pit. Discard pit.
Rough chop mint to release oils and flavor (or you can add mint whole).

, Place the 1 1/2 cup of cherries in first, followed by the two sliced lemons, two sliced oranges and 1/2 cup of mint.

Like many drink recipes, the gin bucket has many variations, and you can experiment with them all until you find your favorite!


G'Vine has a smooth floral taste because it’s infused with vine flowers, and this floral taste goes well with the citrus component in the gin bucket.Gordon’s is recommended by somebecause it’s a traditional gin and has the classic gin bite.;
, Debates about what kind of soda are best for the gin bucket can get heated, but again this element of the drink is something you can experiment with until you find your desired combination. Among the most popular sodas are:

Use any shot glasses that you may have around the house, or pick some up at a local store where alcohol is sold. Clear glasses will best showcase the visual effect of this drink., This dark liqueur resembles the dark body of a Guinness, so it goes in first. If your shot glass is larger or smaller than 1.5 ounces, you can use a bit more or less; you'll want the coffee liqueur to make up about 2/3 of the drink.

, This lighter liqueur will resemble the foamy head of a Guinness. Holding a spoon over the top of the coffee liqueur and pouring the Irish cream over it may help it layer more evenly., Show off your pouring skills to your friends! They'll be impressed by the visual similarity to a Guinness and the shot's rich flavor.

, You'll need 1 packet of plain gelatin, 1 cup boiling water, 1/2 cup cold coffee, 1/2 cup coffee liqueur, 1 packet vanilla pudding, 1/2 cup cold milk and 1/2 cup Irish cream. You'll also need some small plastic cups for your shots.In a bowl, add one 3 oz. packet of plain gelatin and 1 cup of boiling water. Then, stir in 1/2 cup cold coffee and 1/2 cup cold coffee liqueur. This will form the dark coffee base of the jello shot.
Then, in a separate bowl, whisk together 1 packet of vanilla pudding, 1/2 cup cold milk and 1/2 cup Irish cream. This will form the cream top of the Baby Guinness.
Place cups on a tray or platter. Spoon the dark coffee mixture in first to fill 2/3 of the cup. Top carefully with the cream mixture to fill the rest of the cup.

Choose an older liquor.,
Choose a glass.,
Warm the cognac.,
Examine the color.,
Smell the cognac.,
Taste the cognac.",How to Drink Cognac1," Younger, inexpensive cognacs don’t have the complexity or flavor of older cognacs. Instead choose a mid-range Very Superior Old Pale (VSOP) cognac or a luxurious Extra Old (XO) cognac.VSOP cognacs are aged for a minimum of four years.
XO cognacs are aged at least six years. Higher end brands can be aged for twenty years or more.;
, The right kinds of glassware will help warm the cognac and funnel the rich aromas to the top of the glass. Most cognac drinkers choose to use tulip glasses, balloon glasses or wobble snifters. If you don’t have any of these, use a regular wine glass instead.


Tulip glasses are long, bell-like wine glasses. This shape allows the aromas to concentrate on the surface of the cognac.
Balloon glasses have a large body and a short stem. These glasses allow you to evenly warm the cognac.
Wobble glasses look like stemless balloon glasses. These glasses are hard to set down, forcing you to hold the cognac in your hand and bring it to temperature.

, First, pour about 25 milliliters (0.85 ounces) of cognac into your glass.Next, hold the glass in the palm of your hand, allowing your body heat to slowly warm the cognac. This will elevate the flavors and intensify the aromas. Warm the cognac for 8 to 10 minutes before drinking it.

, Look at the surface of the cognac to identify the colors you see. If necessary, tilt the glass under a light to see if the color changes. The more cognac you examine and drink, the more easily you will be able to identify quality cognac by sight.


Light, one-dimensional straw colors indicate a younger cognac.
Dark, layered colors with notes of gold and amber indicate an older cognac., Swirl the glass gently to agitate the cognac. Next, lift the glass to your nose and breathe in deeply. Try to identify the different notes you can smell. With practice, you will be able to easily identify a high-quality cognac by smell.


Younger cognacs have strong floral or fruity notes with a hint of spice.
Older cognacs have many layers of smells. For example, an expensive cognac might have a deep spicy smell with subtle notes of vanilla and nuttiness.

, Take a small sip of cognac and hold it in your mouth. Move it around your mouth and try to identify the different flavors. Once you have thoroughly tasted the cognac, you can swallow it. Continue drinking the cognac one sip at a time, examining the flavors of each mouthful.


Less expensive cognacs often have strong fruity flavors such as raisin, apricot, orange or lemon.
Mid-range cognacs can have floral rose or clover notes.
Expensive cognacs have a variety of flavors, but usually include spiced notes such as nutmeg, cinnamon, or coffee.

However, younger cognacs lack the depth of flavor that older cognacs have. Therefore, they are the perfect choice for mixed drinks. Choose a Very Superior (VS) or Very Superior Old Pale (VSOP) cognac.


VS cognacs are aged for two years. These cognacs are the least expensive.
VSOP cognacs are aged for four years. These cognacs are inexpensive and can be mixed or enjoyed straight., This cocktail is known for its bold almond flavors. First, choose a short old-fashioned glass. Next, fill the glass with the drink ingredients and add a few cubes of ice. Use a long spoon to stir the drink briefly before serving it. The drink ingredients are:


1.5 ounces (44.3 milliliters) of cognac
1 ounce (29.5 milliliters) of Amaretto liquor

, This drink has refreshing citrus notes. First, fill a large metal tumbler with ice. Next, pour the drink ingredients into the tumbler. Cap the tumbler and shake it for about ten seconds. Strain the mixture into a martini glass and serve it with a lemon wedge garnish. To create the drink, combine:


¾ ounces (22 milliliters) of Cointreau
¾ ounces (22 milliliters) of lemon juice

Serve cognac with rich foods.,
Serve a cheese plate.,
Enjoy a cigar with your cognac.",How to Drink Cognac3," The mellow floral notes in cognac pair wonderfully with rich foods, cutting through the richness to bring out bright flavors. When serving cognac, consider pairing it with:


Duck confit
Pates, such as pate du foie gras
Hearty tomato-based pastas
Roasted meats, Cheese plates are excellent as appetizers, snacks, or even a savory “dessert.” There are different cheeses that taste good with different ages of cognac. Arrange the cheese plate with two or three cheeses, dried and fresh fruit, roasted nuts, crackers, and cured meats.


VS cognacs pair well with creamy mellow cheeses such as Roquefort and mascarpone.
VSOP cognacs taste wonderful with mature hard cheeses such as cheddar and aged gouda.
XO cognacs pair wonderfully with a nutty aged Mimolette cheese and pungent Parmesans., Traditionally, expensive cognacs are enjoyed after dinner with a fine cigar. First, pour the cognac and warm it in your hand. Next, light the cigar. Smoke the cigar between sips of cognac.


When choosing a cigar, match the flavors in the cognac. For example, pair a mellow cognac with a mild-flavored cigar."

Do some research.,
Sample different scotches.,
Determine what notes you enjoy.,
Keep a scotch journal.,
Establish a scotch budget.,
Walk into the store prepared.,
Get a second opinion.,
Consider buying scotch as an investment.",How to Buy Scotch," There are countless books, articles, and online guides to consult when first getting acquainted with scotch whiskey. These resources can provide a solid introduction to scotch, including its origins, history, and evolution. Some topics to consider when starting your research might be:


varieties, brands and regions of production
flavor notes and ingredients
the difference between single-malt and blended scotch
age and cask type;
, Scotch is an expensive indulgence, which is why you should take every opportunity to taste different kinds before buying a bottle to see what you like. If you have scotch-drinking friends, ask for a small taste of any new bottles that they might buy. Try to attend any scotch-tasting events held near you, or simply make a point of tasting something new every once in a while at a bar or pub. Keep in mind that there are several ways to drink scotch:


Neat- at room temperature, without water or iceWith a bit of water, to make the whiskey more palatableOn the rocks- with iceIn a cocktail, to phase into scotch-drinking slowly, There are specific flavours in scotch that distinguish different bottles. Since scotches are generally described based on these taste distinctions, knowing what flavour notes you prefer will help you choose one. Some of the notes commonly picked up on are:


peat- a heavy, vegetative flavoursmoke- a flavour evocative of smokemalt- the flavour of malted barleyoak- a spicy, woody flavourspice-a flavour reminiscent of cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg, With so many different brands and types available, the best way to determine your scotch preferences is to record each new scotch you try, and include detailed notes about them. Keeping a journal is an excellent way to document and organize information in a productive way, either for professional or personal benefit.Take note of the brand, year, flavor notes, and other distinguishing attributes for future reference, and you will gradually develop a good sense of what you like most.

, Scotch can get very pricey, so it's important to establish a price range that you will stay within before buying a bottle. Even when trying to save money, it's important to set aside a ""fun fund"" within your monthly budget for splurges to avoid feeling deprived.Knowing how much you can spend on a bottle of scotch before you go shopping will help you avoid overspending and help curb the temptation to buy a bottle outside of your price range.


Use an excel spreadsheet or notebook to list your outstanding bills, upcoming purchases and unavoidable expenses. This will allow you to organize your budget clearly.

, Before you make your purchase, make sure that you've done enough research to choose wisely. It is best to decide what features or attributes the product should have before you go shopping.When buying a bottle of scotch, you should go in knowing the flavors you're looking for (e.g. peaty or smokey notes), what brands you prefer, whether you want a single-malt or blended scotch, and so on.


Be sure to bring a valid form of I.D. with you to prove that you are of legal age to purchase alcohol.

, Keeping in mind all of the criteria you already decided on, you should not hesitate to seek a second opinion when making your purchase. A store clerk might have additional information about the type of scotch you're looking for, and the availability of that scotch in store. Make sure to clearly outline the details of what you are looking for when approaching them. You could say: ""Can you help me? I am looking for a peaty, single-malt scotch between $50 and $75 dollars.""


If you have a friend who is familiar with scotch, bringing him or her along for this mission is an excellent idea as well.

, With the scotch industry booming, more and more people have started to buy scotch as an investment. The right scotch can increase in value tenfold over the course of a decade.Make sure to keep bottles sealed and out of direct sunlight, and choose bottles:
