, Don't add ice, and certainly don't add a mixer. Instead, mix pure still water with your whisky so that it's roughly two parts whisky, one part water.,, Instead, swill the whisky around your mouth. Many of the best whiskeys offer a sensation of different flavours. For instance, the dried fruit and spice of The Balvenie. Give these flavors a chance to wash against the roof of your mouth. Ideally, the taste should linger in your mouth after swallowing, with the warmth and taste remaining for 30 seconds up to a minute."

Ask for suggestions.",How to Choose Brandy," Are you buying brandy for a wedding or holiday party, or for a casual night in? For yourself or as a gift for a friend? Decide if you want something plain and inexpensive, like plain brandy to chug, or if you’re looking to invest in a finer, more expensive brandy that you can sip on like champagne. This will help you to set your sights on a brandy that’ll meet your needs and tastes.;
, Pay a visit to your grocery store, or liquor mart. If you prefer to buy online, visit a wine distillery site, or a cocktail website and do a search for “brandy”. Read the labels and descriptions for each bottle of brandy. This will give you an indication of whether it is where it came from, and how it’s been distilled. Note that the longer a brandy is aged, the more valuable and finer tasting it will be.


Understand that the brandy you purchase will either be fruit brandy, pomace brandy or grape brandy. Fruit brandy is most often used as a digestif or for cooking. It is the cheapest, most common type of brandy, and is distilled from fruit wine, and any fruit with the exception of grapes. This type of brandy will be colorless, un-aged and light on taste. Pomace brandy is also un-aged, and is usually harsher tasting than aged brandies.

, Look out for special characters or fine print in the label or description for each type of brandy. Recognize that the finest of brandies, Cognac and Armagnac, for example, will be branded in a particular style category. This includes: VS (very special); also known as 3-star, VSOP (very special old pale), and XO (extra old).


VS Cognac is aged at least two years, VSOP Cognac is aged for at least four years, and XO Cognac is aged for at least 20 years. XO is considered the most high-end of Cognac, or brandy.
Understand that Armagnac is classified slightly differently from Cognac, in that VSOP Armagnac is aged for a minimum of five years. Armagnac that is considered Hors D’ Age is aged for a minimum of 10 years. , Look for special words on the bottle that tell you where the brandy was distilled and how long it was aged. For example, Marc is French for pomace brandy. A term like Grappa lets you know it was made in Italy or California. Recognize that a term like eau-de-vie is French for colorless, and often times, tasteless.


If you’re having trouble with figuring out the meaning, ask for clarification from a store clerk or someone else who’s knowledgeable about the product.

, Find a wine distillery or beer pub near you and sign up for a spirits tour or tasting. Or, enroll in a wine tasting class. Ask if you can try aged and mature brandy spirits, such as whiskey premium brandies. See what you can observe by examining the color and consistency.


Purchase a brandy cocktail from a bar when you’re at a restaurant or out with family or friends. Ask your server for a brandy cocktail classic, such as the Sidecar, Pisco Sour or Jack Rose, if you’re in the mood for late-night drinking, and are looking for something less expensive than aged brandy.

, Choose a few different types of brandy to sample in a small glass, or in a brandy snifter. Begin with your nose far away from a glass, at recommended chest height. Then, bring it up to your chin. And then lastly, to your nose and mouth. This will allow you to sniff out pepper, cinnamon and other fruit aromas in the brandy. Give your nose time to adjust to the smell of alcohol in the brandy.


The smell of brandy can be overpowering if you’re smelling it for the first time. Keep in mind though, good brandy will have a strong, flavorful aroma.

, Using a brandy snifter or other kind of brandy glass, swirl the brandy at eye level to get a sense of its contents. Be sure to take at least two slow sips to give your tastebuds a sense of like or dislike. Taste each multiple times to give yourself time to adjust your taste palette. If you find the taste is too strong, consider cutting it down with vodka.


Go blind with brandy tasting by pouring out several types of brandy in several different glasses. Mark the bottom of each glass, and then mix them up so you don’t know which kind is which. , Don’t give up on drinking brandy altogether if you don’t enjoy the taste the first few times you’ve tried it. Continue to sample different types of brandies until you find a few that tickle your fancy. This can lead to interesting discoveries and revelations.


Try drinking the brandy unadulterated, without ice or water. Pomace brandies, like grappa or Marc may call for an acquired taste, and at the same time taste fruitier to you, due to its lack of age. You may find your taste leans toward cognac. At the end of the day, it’s all a matter of personal preference.

, Do an online search for the most popular types of brandies enjoyed in your area, or ask a store associate for insight. Opt for a high-end like French Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados if you’re searching for a crisper, finer taste. If you prefer something fruitier or cocktail friendly, look into purchasing Greek Metaxa and South American Pixo brandy. Opt for Brandy de Jerez, Apple Jack or Apple Brandy, Pisco and Eaux-De-Vie if going for a more aromatic taste. Determine what foods you’ll pair it with. Certain brandies, like Apple and Calvados, go especially well with cheese and white-chocolate. , Look up the cost of different types of brandy online. Select a few brands you’re interested in and create a budget. Factor in the expenses of brandy that’s been aged for long. Brandy aged for a year or so can cost $20 a bottle. Cognac and other high-end brandy can be a bit pricy, and run you as much as $60 a bottle.


If Cognac has been aged for 20 years or more, it can get as expensive as $150 a bottle. Cognac that’s been aged for 100 years can run as much as $10,000 dollars per bottle. , Ask your friends and family for suggestions on what brandy you should purchase. Visit distillery and wine sites online and read over their recommendations for the best type of brandy for first-time buyers. Log into a site like Yahoo Answers or Ask.com and ask for suggestions. There will be many opinions, but you’ll ultimately have to decide what you’re willing to try, as well as what works best for your desires and budget.

Create a sweetened coffee base.,
Use a cooking thermometer to take the temperature of the water.,
Add 2 cups of rum and stir.,
Pour your Kahlua into a 1-quart, sealable glass container.,
Label your container.",How to Make Kahlua1," To start, bring 2 cups of water to a full boil. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 cup of dry, instant coffee, 3 1/2 cups of white sugar, and stir until everything is completely dissolved.


If your diet restricts you from consuming processed, white sugar, you can easily substitute brown sugar or your favorite type of refined sugar substitute. There are dozens of recipes out there and plenty use other varieties of sugar.;
, While water boils at 212 degrees F (100 degrees C), alcohol boils at around 172 degrees F (78 degrees C). Wait for your temperature to drop below 172 degrees before adding rum or you will be very disappointed by your Kahlua.If you don't have a cooking thermometer, your best bet is to wait about 15 or 20 minutes for it to cool down. Always err on the safer, cooler side in this situation and wait longer if you're unsure (and it still seems hot).

, What kind of rum? Well, that's up to you. Generally, it's safe to go middle-of-the-road on this part. You don't want to waste your top-shelf rum on making a Kahlua substitute, but you also don't want it to taste like mouthwash either. Any generic rum will do the trick.


You'll notice that the next recipe contains vodka. If you're a bigger vodka fan, you could keep to this recipe if you'd like and switch out the rum for the vodka, no problem. And if you have time and the supplies, why not try both and see which you like better?

, Add the vanilla bean to the container and store in the fridge for at least 30 days to age the flavor. You read that right – to make Kahlua that way your mouth pictures it, it has to be aged. That being said, recipe #3 on this guide is an instant Kahlua you can use right away, though it won't taste the same.


The vanilla needs time to infuse in to give it that essential Kahlua flavor. Vanilla extract can be substituted, but do note that the Kahlua won’t have the same rich, aged flavor.

, Attach a label to the container identifying its contents and the date it was made. That way no one mistakes it for soda! What's more, you may not remember when the 30 days is up, and a note keeps you from guessing.

",How to Make a Cocktail1," It wouldn't be a cocktail without some alcohol, so be sure to get some. The type of alcohol that you use in your cocktail. Here are some ideas for spirits you can use:


Clear or colorless spirits. These are more or less colorless in appearance and much of the time has a milder taste than other spirits. Colorless spirits include:
Vodka
Gin
(Unaged) Cachaça
Neutral Grain Spirit
Soju


Whiskeys. Whiskeys are made from fermented grain mash, with the grain used changing from type to type. Whiskey is popular around the world, but primarily manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, America, and Japan, each of which have distinct flavors. The types of whiskey include:
Bourbon
Scotch
Rye


Other colored spirits. There are dozens of different kinds of spirits that would make sense in a cocktail. Some of the most popular spirits not to have already been listed include:
Tequila
Mezcal
Absinthe
Brandy

;
, Sometimes, a drink with a lower alcohol concentration is chosen to enhance the flavor of the spirit. If you're going to use two types of alcohol in combination, be sure to test whether their tastes are compatible. Gin and light beer may work in a refreshing drink with lemon and honey, or beer and tequila may work as a ""beer-garita,"" but ouzo and red wine probably aren't likely to be paired anytime soon.


Beer and wine cocktails have become increasingly popular over the years. Experiment with beer, for example, by making a simple Shandy, or lemonade and beer. Experiment with wine by making a Kalimotxo, or red wine and coke. Or try a French 75, which combines gin, sparkling wine, lemon, and sugar.

, In order to combine your ingredients together, you're probably going to need a cocktail shaker. Although certain cocktails that cocktails that use distilled spirits or very light mixers are stirred, most other cocktails are shaken.


Cocktails that have fruit juices, dairy products or eggs, simple syrup, sour mix, or any other thick ingredients need to shaken., A jigger is a useful tool if you want to make clean cocktails with exact measurements. Think about it: A cocktail where you ""eyeball"" the amount of alcohol or the amount of mixer can turn out too strong or too weak.


Many jiggers or measuring cups contain two sides, kind of like an hourglass. The small jigger usually holds one ounce of liquid, while the bigger jigger holds two ounces. This makes pouring cocktails that require ""double"" shots much easier.

, Some recipes won't call for muddled fruits, but many will. A mojito, for example, calls for muddled limes and mint to begin with. Simply put the recommended amount of fruit and herbs in the bottom of your cocktail shaker and muddle with a muddler or the end of a wooden spoon. Make sure to get all the juices out of the fruit and break it up sufficiently.

, As directed by your recipe, add the required liquids to your cocktail shaker.

, Add ice once you're ready to shake so that you don't dilute the cocktail unnecessarily. This is a mistake that many people make. They put the ice in at the beginning instead of the end, thereby diluting their drink.

, Vigorous shaking will combine all the ingredients in the drink together, blending them so that you don't taste an overwhelming amount of juice and not alcohol, or vice versa.

, Different drinks call for different glasses. A martini, for example, is always served in a martini glass, whereas a mojito is usually served in a highball glass.


Take the time to find which vessel is best for your cocktail. You may think it's a bunch of hogwash, but there are plenty of people who think that choosing the right glass is what sets a good great apart from a great one.
If you plan on salting the rim of your glass — for a margarita, for example — do it before you pour the drink. It's more difficult to salt a rim after you've poured the drink.
If your cocktail calls for ice to be added after you've shaken it, add fresh ice cubes instead of the ice cubes used while shaking. Fresh ice cubes are larger, meaning they won't melt as quickly, diluting your drink.

, Bitters are aromatic flavorings added to many (usually whiskey) drinks after mixing. Probably the most famous bitters mix is Angostura bitters., The garnish you choose should be suitable for your cocktail. An olive on a skewer, for example, traditionally goes with a martini.

Bottle the vodka.",How to Make Vodka," Vodka is commonly made from wheat, rye, barley, corn, or potatoes. Sugar and molasses can also be used alone or added to other ingredients. One distiller even makes an innovative vodka from Pinot Noir red wine. Whatever you choose, it must have sugars or starches so that alcohol is ultimately produced. Yeast eats sugars or starches and spits out alcohol and carbon dioxide.When making vodka from grains and potatoes, a mash must be made that contains active enzymes that break down the starches from the grains or potatoes and makes fermentable sugars.
Fruit juice already contains sugars so starch-degrading enzymes are not needed. As with fruit juice, vodka made from store-bought sugars need only be fermented, thus bypassing the need for a mash.
When already fermented mediums such as wine are used, the medium can be distilled right away into vodka.;
, If you decide to just use potatoes to make vodka, for example, your potatoes are going to need a little help converting starch into sugar. That's where enzymes come in. Consult this basic chart to figure out whether you need additional enzymes in your mash in order to convert starches into sugar:


Ingredients to Consider when Making your Mash

Ingredients
Requires Enzymes?
Additional Notes


Grains and Potatoes
Yes
Grains and potatoes are sources of starch, not sugar. Enzymes are needed to break down the starch into sugar.


Malted Whole Grains (e.g. malted barley, malted wheat
No. Malted whole grains are rich in natural enzymes that break down starches into fermentable sugars.
Enzymes activate in malted grains when the grain is cracked open and exposed to warm water for a sustained period. Milled, malted grains can be used alone, as they contain starch, or added to a starchy, enzyme-poor mash. Choose malted grains that are high in enzymes, such as malted wheat.


Refined Sugar and Molasses
No. Because the sugar is already there, the yeast doesn't need additional enzymes.
Sugar may be used solely to make vodka or added to starchy mashes to add additional fermentable material.


, Food-grade amylase enzyme powder can be purchased from a homebrew shop and added to the mash to convert the starch into fermentable sugars, if you're using something like potatoes, for example. Use the recommended amount for the amount of starch to be broken down. There is no need to use malted, enzyme-rich grains such as malted barley or wheat when using enzyme powder.

For enzymes to be able to break down starches, even the starches of malted, enzyme-rich grain, the starches must first be gelatinized. Flaked (rolled) grains are often already gelatinized. Un-gelatinised ingredients such as potatoes and unrolled or malted grains are heated in water to the gelatinization temperature of the particular starch that is used. Potatoes usually gelatinize at about 150° F (66° C), and barley and wheat gelatinize at about the same temperature. Theoretically a potato mash should only need to be heated to 150° F (66° C). If a low temperature is used with potatoes, the potatoes should be finely shredded before adding them to the water.
Starch-degrading enzymes only work at specific temperatures and are destroyed at high temperatures. A temperature of 150° F (66° C) is common, but temperatures above 158° F (70° C) will result in the destruction of the enzymes. The absolute maximum temperature is 165° F (74° C); while enzymes will work for a period of time at this temperature and it can be used, much of the enzymes will be destroyed.

, In a 10 gallon (38 l) metal pot with lid, heat 6 gallons (23 l) of water to about 165° F (74° C). Add two gallons of dry, flaked wheat and stir. Check the temperature and ensure that it is between 150° F (66° C) and 155° F (68° C). Stir in one gallon of crushed wheat malt. The temperature should be about 149° F (65°). Cover and let rest for 90 minutes to two hours, stirring occasionally. The starches should convert into fermentable sugars during this time, and the mixture should become much less viscous. After 90 minutes to two hours, cool the mixture to 80° - 85° F (27° - 29° C). Use an immersion chiller for rapid cooling or just let it cool overnight, but don’t let it get much below 80F.

, Clean 20 pounds of potatoes. Without peeling, boil them in a large kettle until gelatinized, about one hour. Discard the water and thoroughly mash the potatoes by hand or with a food processor. Return the mashed potatoes to the kettle and add five to six gallons of tap water. Mix to blend and bring mixture to just over 150° F (66° C). Add two pounds of crushed, malted barley or wheat and stir well. Cover and stir periodically over the course of two hours. Let cool overnight to 80° - 85° F (27° - 29° C).


Letting it cool for a long period of time also gives the barley malt enzymes more time to break down the potato starch.

, Make a mash according to the wheat mash recipe, but substitute flaked, pre-gelatinized corn (maize) for the flaked wheat. Alternatively, sprout your own corn over the course of three days and make a mash from it without added malted grain. A root about two inches long should sprout from each grain. The sprouted corn will contain enzymes that were formed during the germination (sprouting) process.

, Fermentation is conducted in clean, sanitized vessels that are sometimes open but often sealed from the air to prevent cross-contamination. Fermentation usually lasts for three to five days.


Fermentation is also possible in vessels that haven't been cleaned or sanitized, and the distilled product will yield drinkable alcohol, but the fermentation may result in a high level of unwanted flavor compounds and higher alcohols due to the action of unwanted yeast stains and bacteria.
Oxidative cleaners such as B-Brite are available at homebrew shops, as are sanitizers such as iodophor., An airlock is a mechanism that will allow CO2 to escape without letting O2 to get in. Five gallon batches of strained mash can be fermented in a 7.5 gallon (28 l) food-grade bucket or in 6 gallon (23 l) carboys. Lids can be affixed to buckets, as can drilled rubber stoppers to carboys, but when using a lid or a stopper, never seal the vessel completely, as pressure from carbon dioxide production will create explosive pressure. Therefore, affix an airlock to lids and drilled rubber stoppers.

When fermentation is conducted in open vessels, put a cheesecloth over the vessel to keep out bugs and other undesirable things.

, If a mash was made, strain the liquid with a fine mesh strainer from the mash into your cleaned and sanitized fermentation vessel. Try to splash the liquid and pour it from a distance so that it is well aerated. Yeast needs air (oxygen) initially to grow and start a quality fermentation. This is because yeast makes cellular material in the form of lipids from oxygen. However, oxygen is not desired after this initial growth stage, as yeast produces alcohol in the absence of oxygen


As an alternative, ferment the mash without straining. However, the fermented mash should still be aerated in some manner, possibly with an aquarium air pump and an aeration stone. The mash will also need to be strained before it is added to the still, and it may be more convenient to ferment the smaller volume that results from a strained mash, as the fermenting mash may overflow the vessel.
If a sugar solution is to be used, prepare a solution as described in Make Alcohol from Common Table Sugar. Also aerate by pouring from a distance into the fermentation vessel.
If juice is to be fermented, aerate by pouring from a height through a sieve or strainer into the fermentation vessel.

, Hydrate the appropriate amount of dried distillers or other desired yeast and add it to the liquid. Stir with a clean, sanitized spoon to evenly disperse the yeast. If using an airlock, the airlock will bubble during active fermentation, and the bubbling will slow dramatically or cease altogether as the liquid becomes completely fermented. Keep the fermenting liquid in a room that is about 80° - 85° F (27° - 29° C) to facilitate good, efficient fermentation. Alternately, use a heating belt in cold areas.


Distillers yeast will ferment cleanly, produce a high amount of alcohol (ethanol), and produce a relatively low amount of unwanted compounds such as alcohols other than ethanol. The amount of yeast used will depend on the specific brand or type of yeast used.
Nutrients may be included with the yeast in the yeast packet. Yeast nutrients are needed when fermenting a medium that is low in nutrients, such as sugar solutions, but they can also improve fermentations when used with nutrient-rich mediums such as those made from grains.

, Leave the yeast sediment behind in the fermentation vessel, as it can scorch when heated in the still. The siphoned wash may also be further clarified by filtration or other means before distillation.

, Column stills are more complex and sophisticated than pot stills. They can be purchased or, depending on the still design, built using readily available materials. However, column stills and pot stills work in a relatively similar manner:


Cooling water is usually circulated through a sealed compartment in the distillation column, causing the vaporized alcohol and other substances to condense in the column. This means that such a still must be attached directly to a faucet or a mechanical pump to move water from a supply into the still.
If not recirculating water from a single supply, thousands of gallons of water may need to be used to make a small batch of vodka. If water is recirculated from a central reservoir using a pump, about fifty gallons of water can be used, but the water will heat up and become less effective.
See Sources and Citations below for detailed, high quality instructions for the construction and use of column stills.

, Simple pot stills are akin to pressure cookers that are attached to piping or tubing. They can be constructed very easily and cheaply. Unlike column stills that are essentially vertical columns, pot stills may utilize bent or coiled tubing or piping that can be submersed in a vessel of cooling water. Pumps and large volumes of cooling water are not required, but can be used.


See Sources and Citations below for detailed, high-quality instructions for the construction of pot stills.

, Stills heat the fermented, relatively-low alcoholic wash to a temperature that is greater than the boiling point of alcohol, yet less than the boiling point of water. In this way, the alcohol vaporizes while the bulk of the water does not. The vaporized alcohol (along with some vaporized water) travel up into the column, pipe or tube of the still. External cooling in the form of cold water is applied to the column, pipe or tubing, causing the vaporized alcohol to cool and condense back into liquid. This alcoholic liquid is collected and becomes vodka.

, Depending on the type of still being used, gas burners, wood fires, or electric hot plates are all options. A temperature of about 173° F (78.3° C) at sea level is desirable, but the temperature must be kept below the boiling point of water, 212° F (100° C) at sea level. As the wash becomes heated, alcohol and other substances vaporize and condense in the water-cooled area of the still., The first distilled liquid (called the “heads”) that is recovered from the still will be rich in harmful methanol and other volatile chemicals that you don't want to drink. For 5 gallons (19 l) of wash, discard at least the first 2 ounces (60 ml) of distillate., After you discard the heads, the collected distillate will contain the desired alcohol (ethanol), along with some water and other compounds. This is called the “body”. During this time, if using a column still with flowing cold water, the water flow can be adjusted to control the distillate output and purity. Try to shoot for two or three teaspoons of distillate per minute. Increased distillate output results in decreased purity., Towards the end of the distillation process, when the temperature creeps up to 212° F (100° C) and beyond, the distillation process produces other nasty chemicals. These are called the “tails,” which contain fusel alcohols.The tails are undesirable and should be discarded., Cool a sample of the distillate to 68° F (20° C) and use a hydrometer to measure the percentage of alcohol of the distillate. The distillate may be too dilute to serve as acceptable vodka (weaker than 40 percent alcohol), or may be more concentrated than desired (perhaps higher than 50 percent alcohol). Vodka is usually diluted before bottling, so the distillate may have a very high alcohol content. The distillate may also be too flavorful and aromatic and require additional distillations or carbon filtering.

, This increases the alcohol content and further purifies the distillate. It is common to redistill the distillate three or more times to achieve vodka that has a high purity.

, Pass the distillate through a carbon filter, such as those available at homebrewing shops, to remove unwanted volatile flavors and aromas. Carbon water filters can also be modified to purify the distillate.

, Add purified water to the distillate to attain the desired alcohol percentage. Use a hydrometer to measure the alcohol percentage.

, Fill bottles using a gravity bottle filler setup and cork or cap the bottles. Label the bottles with custom labels if desired. Some gravity fillers may consist of a 7.5 gallon (29 L) bottling bucket (with spigot), vinyl tubing, and a simple spring-loaded plastic bottle filler. Multiple-spout wine bottle fillers can also be used.

Brew a pot of strong, good quality coffee.,
Add 4 cups of sugar to the fresh, hot coffee and stir until dissolved.,
Add the vodka once the coffee mixture has cooled to room temperature.,
Add the vanilla and pour the mixture into bottles.,
Store in a cool, dry place for 2-3 weeks.",How to Make Kahlua2," To get that rich Kahlua flavor, you'll want a good-quality base. And it should be strong, too – a weak coffee won't transport the flavors into the final product. Once brewed, prepare to use the coffee immediately.


If you're not so great at brewing a decent pot of coffee (it is definitely harder than it looks), you may wish to have a coffee aficionado do this for you. It can make a world of difference., Once the pot has seen its final drips, transport it over to a large bowl. Then, add in 4 cups of granulated sugar and mix in until the little granules are all dissolved.


Again, you could use brown sugar or raw sugar if you like. Just know that each little change will affect the flavor and it may or may not be to your liking.

, Once the sugar has dissolved and the coffee isn't warm anymore, add the vodka, stirring to combine.


Some bartenders believe in a combination of vodka and rum, or even different types of vodka or different types of rum within the same recipe to give it a fuller flavor. If you have the end of a few bottles laying around, try combining them – it may not hurt., Three 12 oz bottles will work well, but one large bottle works, too. Cut the vanilla bean into thirds and drop one piece into each bottle. After that, put the cap on. Your Kahlua is made.


At this point, you could also add in a cinnamon stick, cocoa nibs (about a tablespoon), or orange peel, if you like. This will give it a more signature, dynamic flavor.

, The vanilla needs this much time to infuse and the flavors need to settle into the coffee to give it that rich, liqueur flavor. Once the time is up, strain it beforehand and then rebottle.


The basement or cellar is good for this stuff, but a closed box in a dark room (or under the bed) will work just as well. Just make sure it has a label on it in case you forget what that mysterious dark bottle is in six months' time.

In a large pot over medium heat, combine the water, sugar, and coffee crystals.,
Let it cool.,
Add the vodka and vanilla and stir well.",How to Make Kahlua3," Don't feel like scrolling up? That was 2 cups of water, 4 cups of sugar, and 3/4 cup instant coffee crystals. Keep stirring until everything dissolves and is one uniform, smooth consistency.


If you're worried about your insta-Kahlua being a little lacking (generally the ones that take more time have a bit more flavor), you could consider adding a few cocoa nibs to give it a tang of chocolate to make the flavor more dynamic., Once everything has dissolved, take it off the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature. This should take 15-20 minutes. A thermometer works well for this, but you could always take taste tests instead to find out!

, When the concoction reaches room temperature, add 2 1/4 cups of vodka (average quality is best), 2 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and stir well. Bingo – your homemade coffee liqueur is made and ready for consumption.


If your guests aren't going to go hog wild over it at the pot, pour the mixture into bottles (three 12 oz. bottles works well) to keep for later. But do know that this recipe is supposed to be enjoyed immediately, so take advantage of not having to wait 2 weeks for infusion!

, The old fashioned is a boozy cocktail — only whiskey and syrup stand between it and your tummy. Although the old fashioned has seemingly fallen out of fashion since its heyday in the '20s and '30s, it remains a go-to for many cocktail drinkers.

Narrow down the vodka choices by selecting a price range for your purchase.,
Consider the flavor of the vodka.,
Determine the alcohol content of the vodka you wish to purchase.,
Research the preparation of the vodka, including the primary ingredients that compose the drink.",How to Choose Vodka," Depending on how you want to use the vodka, price will be an important consideration. More expensive vodkas like Belvedere, Ciroc and Grey Goose offer subtle flavors and aromas for $30 or more. These vodkas are most suitable for making drinks with a high vodka content, or for shots at a special occasion. A liter of less expensive vodkas like Smirnoff and Svedka can be purchased for $10 to $15, and these vodkas are perfect for larger parties with guests more interested in social drinking than flavor profiles. Cheaper vodka is also best for making cocktails or mixed drinks with low alcohol content, as the more pungent taste of fruit in these drinks will drown out the majority of the subtleties in more expensive vodka.;
, Cheap to medium priced brands like Smirnoff and Absolut offer a very wide selection of vodka flavors, from passionfruit to green apple to whipped cream and even fluffed marshmallow. Specialty brands like Bakon provide more interesting flavors like bacon vodka, while more expensive brands focus primarily on the core taste. Consider purchasing flavored vodka if you wish to make the taste of a shot less pungent, or if you are making a mixed drink with complementary flavoring. Bakon's bacon flavored vodka, for example, is an interesting choice for making bloody marys, as the bacon taste matches the bloody mary. Fruit flavored vodka, like raspberry or peach Smirnoff and cherry infused Skyy may work better for fruity flavored mixed drinks.

, Stronger vodkas offer 80 to 100 proof selections, providing drinks with up to 40% alcohol content. Higher alcohol content vodkas will have a more strong taste, and many consumers will prefer to chase these vodkas or use them in a mixed drink. Vodkas with less alcohol content may be more expensive but will generally be less pungent.

, More expensive vodkas will be distilled up to 4 times, enhancing the flavoring and intensity of the drink. These vodkas will also be made of less ingredients, using mostly potato or wheat. If you have a tighter budget, you may sacrifice the number of distillations or filterings for price, impacting the quality of the vodka.

Learn about the different varieties.,
Order your drink.,
Smell the whiskey.,
Sip your drink slowly.,
Understand the terminology.",How to Acquire a Taste for Whiskey1," There are quite a few varieties of whiskey that vary mostly in composition (what it’s made out of) and how it’s aged. Most whiskeys are made out of fermented grain mash (barley, corn, wheat, or rye) and aged in oak casks for a number of yearsScotch is whiskey made in Scotland, usually from malted barley.

Bourbon is whiskey made in the United States, usually from corn.

Single malt whiskey is whiskey created at a single distillery, though the distiller may combine whiskeys from many different casks to achieve the desired taste.

Blended malt whiskey is whiskey made from the products of multiple distilleries.

Single cask whiskey is whiskey is produced from one individual cask at a single distillery location.;
, There are quite a few ways to drink whiskey. You can drink it alone, you can take it as a shot, you can order it as an ingredient in a mixed cocktail. The choice is yours.



Neat: This is a way to order whisky meaning it is served without any ice, water, or mixer. It also means it will be served at room temperature, not chilled.

On the rocks: This is a way to order whiskey meaning it is served with ice cubes., Bring the glass to your nose and take a whiff. Be sure to keep your mouth open slightly while smelling the whiskey to get the full palate of scents. Try to pick up what scents you’re smelling. Perhaps it’s a floral bouquet, or maybe something a bit sweeter. Maybe you notice a woody, earthy tone.Put your nose actually inside the glass to get the best angle for smelling. This will help you fully appreciate the range of the bouquet.

, Take a small sip of the whiskey and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds. Roll it around your tongue. Some people even recommend “chewing” the whiskey a bit while it is inside your mouth to fully appreciate the flavor.Once you have tried the whiskey unaltered, try cutting it with a dropper full of water. The water will bring out different flavors and aromas that complicate the tasting.

, In order to acquire a true appreciation of whiskey, in all its various forms, you need to familiarize yourself with some of the basic terminology used in producing, describing, and ordering whiskey. Some of the most important terms include:Cask: A cask is an oak barrel that the whiskey is stored in while it ages in the distillery. Most whiskeys are aged for at least three years in a cask, while others age for longer periods of time (even as much as 25 years).

Proof: This basically indicates the amount of alcohol in a particular whiskey, or how strong the drink is. The number corresponds to twice the amount of alcohol content by volume. For example, a whiskey that is 60% alcohol would be 120-proof. The larger the number, the stronger the drink will be.

Maturation: This is the amount of time that the whiskey is left in the wooden cask to age (or mature).

Taste various brands of whisky.,
Try whiskeys from other countries.,
Compare different ages of whiskey.,
Go to a whiskey tasting.",How to Acquire a Taste for Whiskey2," Rather than just sticking to one type of whiskey, try branching out and tasting a variety of different brands from different distilleries. This will expose your pallet to new tastes and flavors, and really help you acquire a taste for whiskey.Some of the most popular whiskey brands include Bell’s, Ballantine’s, Black Velvet, Dewar’s, Crown Royal, Jameson, Suntory, and Glenfiddich.

, Different countries produce whiskeys that taste quite different from each other. To become a true connoisseur of whiskey, you’ll need to branch out and begin trying some varieties produced in other countries. Some popular whiskeys include:Scotland: Laphroaig, Glenfiddich, Bunnahabhain

Ireland: Jameson, Tullamore Dew, Bushmills

United States: Jim Beam, Jack Daniel’s, Wild Turkey

Japan: Nikka, Yamazaki, Hakushu

, Try whiskeys of different ages produced by the same distillery. Choose a whiskey you enjoy and try a younger one (three or four years) and then taste an older one (12-15 years). Compare them side by side and consider the different smells, flavors, and aromas that you sense in each.In general, it’s probably true that older whiskeys taste better (and are more expensive) than younger whiskeys because of the greater length of time that was spent aging the liquor. However, this isn’t true across the board.
Many people say that 8-9 years is the best age for most whiskeys.

, One great way to expand your knowledge of whiskey is to attend a whiskey tasting. Many local bars and distilleries will host events in which you are provided with an assortment of whiskeys and you even get to learn a bit about the products.


These events usually aren’t free, but it’s often a good value for the money.
Check your local bars for any information about upcoming events.
You might even want to consider hosting your own whiskey tasting for you and your friends.You could also consider taking a trip to visit a distillery."

Make an Old Fashioned.,
Concoct a Rol and Rye whiskey cocktail.",How to Acquire a Taste for Whiskey3," While many people think of rum and Coke as a classic go-to drink, plenty of people prefer adding whiskey to Coke instead. If you’re making them yourself, just add two parts whiskey and one part Coke.If you’re ordering in a bar, simply ask for a whiskey and Coke. Don’t forget to tell the bartender what kind of whiskey you’d like if you have a preference.
Of course, this will detract from the pure taste of the whiskey, so it’s probably best not to use super expensive whiskey if you’re going to add Coke to it.

, This is a classic, yet simple drink to make and a great way to enjoy whiskey. Simply combine two parts whiskey with one part sweet and sour mix. For example, you could add two fluid ounces of whiskey with one fluid ounce of sweet and sour mix. Add more of both ingredients if you want a stronger drink.If you’re ordering in a bar, just ask for a whiskey sour. You can even specify what kind of whiskey you’d like.

, To make this drink, you’ll need to combine 2 ounces of rye whiskey, ¾ ounce of sweet red vermouth, and 2 dashes of Angostura aromatic bitters.In bartender lingo, a dash equals a few drops. So two dashes would equal approximately 4-6 drops of Angostura aromatic bitters.

, Place one teaspoon of sugar (or one sugar cube) in a glass. Add 2-3 dashes of Angostura bitters and a few drops of water. Pour 2 ounces of bourbon or rye whiskey into the glass and stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Add several big ice cubes and stir the drink quickly to help cool it to the right temperature.This is one of the most classic and highly regarded mixed cocktail drinks in the alcohol world. You can’t go wrong ordering a drink like this.

, Try this recipe: Combine 1 ½ ounces of rye or bourbon whiskey with 1 ½ ounces of Aperol in a tall glass filled with ice. Pour a bit of club soda over the top and add an orange slice as a garnish.There are thousands of cocktail recipes that include whiskey as the main ingredient. Try making a few different kinds to find one that you love. Or order some varieties at your local bar.

Keep in mind, you can add more or less of each ingredient if you choose. What's important is you use roughly the same amount of each ingredient.

, A mind eraser is a layered drink. That means you should pour it in such a way that the layers do not mix into one another. There are several tips and tricks you can use to layer a shot.


The sweetest liquid, in this case the coffee liqueur, will be denser than the others. This makes it the most likely to sink. Pour in sweet liquids first.Make sure to use a narrow shot glass. This helps keep the layers separate.Turn a spoon upside down and pour the shot over the back of the spoon. This helps with the layering process. You should also position the spoon directly above the last layer., Once the drink is done, drink it through a straw. Put the straw at the bottom of the drink, allowing you to experience the coffee liqueur, then the vodka, then the soda water. As it's a shot, it's meant to be consumed quickly. Try to drink it in one quick gulp. This is a fun shot to attempt to do with friends."

It's mixed in a shaker, allowing the ingredients to blend together. If you want to make mind erasers for a big group, you may want to make a large batch in a mixer.


Keep in mind the fun of a mind eraser is using it as a shot. Most people prefer a layered shot, drank with a straw, to a full mind eraser cocktail. However, if guests seem to enjoy the taste of the shot, they may enjoy a mind eraser cocktail as well.

This takes away some of the carbonation, but can add a sweeter taste. This is best if you're making the mind eraser with rum.If you enjoy the carbonation, consider making ice cubes out of coconut water. This can preserve the carbonated taste, while adding a bit of coconut flavor.If you're using rum and coconut, adding a dash of nutmeg on top of the drink can be fun.

If you are having a hard time getting the liqueurs to stack, try tipping the shot glass to the side and gently tipping the Irish cream over the side of the shot glass. This will help regulate the stream of liqueur and prevent them from combining.Although Irish cream is the most common ingredient, there are variations. Instead of using Irish cream, some people prefer Amaretto almond liqueur or banana and orange liqueur. If you make this variation, use a 1 ounce of Amaretto or 1/2 an ounce of each of banana liqueur and orange liqueur. , Once you have stacked the two liqueurs, you need to top the shot with a dollop of whipped cream.

, To split a vanilla pod, simply cut down the middle of the pod with the tip of a sharp knife while keeping the pod flat on a clean, non-slip surface.


Some people prefer to scrape out the middle of the vanilla pod before adding but this is where much of the flavor resides, so it's not recommended.

,, You'll note the vodka turning a light shade of golden brown within a half hour of adding the pods and this will darken with infusion over time. Shake every few days to help distribute the vanilla and store in a cool, dark place while it's infusing.


You can leave the pods in for as long as you wish to allow the vanilla to infuse through the vodka but it should be ready to use within the first week of infusing.

, If you wish to remove any sediment from the vanilla pods, pour through a fine sieve or coffee filter into a clean bottle.


If you don't want to throw out the pods, then you can leave them in the vodka but after a fair while they may get a bit tacky and start disintegrating (this is in the range of many months later).

, Serve as is, or use as part of a cocktail. For one example of using vanilla infused vodka, see How to make a vanilla martini. Or, try vanilla vodka poured over ice and topped up with ginger ale for a creamy drink.Vanilla vodka is excellent used in dessert dishes as well as in drinks.

",How to Infuse Vodka with Flavor1," As the saying goes, if the base isn’t sturdy, the whole building could collapse (or something like that.) If the vodka you use doesn’t have a good flavor (*cough*plastic bottle vodka*cough*) then infusing it with some other flavor won’t work quite as well because you’re still going to get some of that chemical taste. Get a middle shelf vodka—something that is decent but not the classiest bottle out there either.

;
, You can be as creative or as conservative as you like—these days just about every flavor is used in vodka, from whipped cream to bacon (don’t bash it ‘til you’ve tried it.) Decide how you want your vodka to taste, and get plenty of the desired fruits, berries, peppers or herbs (or bacon). You also don’t have to limit yourself to just one ingredient. Some ideas include:






Using just one flavor to spice up your vodka. Options you can choose from include mango, orange peel, watermelon, apple, blueberry, vanilla, cinnamon, basil, chili pepper, horseradish, or bacon.
Combining chili pepper, horseradish and bacon for the best bloody mary you have ever tasted.
Combining orange peels and cinnamon for a sitting-by-the-fire-during-a-snowstorm feel. For a more Christmas-y vibe, combine cranberries and a vanilla pod.
Combining mangoes, pineapple and passionfruit—you’ll feel like you’re sitting on a white sand beach drinking the most delicious cocktail you’ve ever had. See the Tips section for more ideas.
Get the right amount of the ingredient you will be infusing your vodka with. Vodka (as anyone who has drunk it knows) has quite a distinct taste. In order to beat out the natural flavor with the ingredient you’ve chosen, you’ll need to get the right amount of fruit, spice, etc. Use the following guidelines for infusing about one liter of vodka.
If infusing your vodka fruit, use one to three pieces, depending on the size of the fruit. Aim for about two large apples' worth; one is usually enough for larger fruits (i.e. grapefruit), but you'll need three to four for smaller fruits (apricots, plums, etc.)
If infusing fresh herbs, use one to three fist-fulls of the herb, depending on its potency. Use about half as much when using dried herbs or spices.
If infusing your vodka with berries, add at least a cup of the berries (but feel free to add more.)
If infusing with peppers, use as many as you want. The more you use and the longer you infuse, the spicier the end product will be.

, Infusing your vodka with fruits that have dirt on them may lead to an awkward party moment during which you discover you have dirt in your teeth. To avoid this, wash all fresh ingredients thoroughly (except, of course, the dried spices.) Other preparations differ on the ingredient:






Slice fruits finely to increase their surface area and speed up the infusion, removing any pits, seeds, or stems. If you are using larger fruit like mangoes or pineapple, cut the fruit up into large chunks.
When using citrus like oranges or lemons, use a peeler to separate the colorful part of the peel from the pith (the white part of the peel.) The pith is bitter and could add some unwanted bitterness to your vodka.
Leave berries whole, but bruise them slightly by very gently squeezing them and removing any stems.
Crush herbs gently, as it will help to release their flavor. If you are using vanilla beans, slice the bean from top to bottom, keeping the top intact (it should create an upside down ‘V’ shape.)
Create a cut down the center of any peppers you might use. However, do not make too deep of a cut as the seeds need to stay inside the pepper.
For bacon vodka, you are actually using the bacon fat and not the actual bacon. Cook several strips of bacon and then drain the bacon fat. For one (750ml) bottle of vodka, you need 2 tablespoons of bacon fat., Glass jars with tight lids work best for infusing vodka. The amount of vodka you are infusing (a whole bottle, half a bottle, etc.) will determine how many jars you need. Generally, it is easiest to split your ingredients in half and place half in one jar and half in another. However, if you have a glass jar that can hold a whole bottle of vodka, just use that.




The relative proportions of each ingredient, if you're using more than one, are a matter of personal preference.

, Fill the container with vodka, seal it, and put it some place safe. You can place it in the refrigerator to keep it cool or you can leave it out on your counter, so long as it is not sitting in direct sunlight.





, The timing isn't scientific but most recipes will infuse within two to five days. Generally, citrus fruits or strongly flavored ingredients will infuse more quickly, but softly flavored or fibrous ingredients (vanilla beans or fresh ginger) may need up to a week or more. Shake the jar once a day to speed up the infusion process. To ensure that your vodka has the flavor you want it to, sample it after two days have passed and then every day after that until it reaches the desired flavor.






Some advice will recommend two weeks or more infusion time, but this is only necessary for a large restaurant-size batch. A week is plenty of time for a liter of vodka to infuse properly.

, Once you vodka has become infused with the desired flavor, you will want to strain the vodka into a different bottle. You can use a funnel and a mesh strainer to make the straining process easier. The easiest thing to do is to strain the vodka back into its original bottle, but you can also use cute, new bottles bought at a local glass or craft store (this is particularly great to do when giving your vodka away as a gift.)




The reason you should strain the ingredients out of your vodka is that if you leave the ingredients in, the flavor might become too strong (no one wants to drink vodka that has been infused with chili peppers for a month.)
Don't throw the ingredients away. If you used fruit to infuse your vodka, you can actually eat them. They will be packed with fruity vodka flavor (just make sure you don't eat them before you drive.)

Familiarize yourself with the different types of dessert wine.,
Choose a bottle size.,
Find a good place to purchase dessert wine.,
Read the label.,
Work with a wine merchant.,
Set a budget.",How to Buy Dessert Wine1," There are many different types of dessert wines. They vary based on the grapes used and how they are prepared. The dessert wines can be divided up as follows:Noble rot wines: This type of wine is made from rotten grapes. The grapes are covered in a mold called Botrytis cinerea, commonly known as noble rot. The mold removes water content from the grapes, concentrating the sugar. Sauternes (Bordeaux, France), Riesling Auslese (""late picked"") and beerenauslese (Germany), and trockenbeerenauslese are well-known noble rot dessert wines.
Ice wines: Grapes are left on the vine late into the season until they freeze. Freezing the grapes dehydrates the grapes, resulting in a very sweet wine. Ice wines are rare and expensive.
Raisin wines: Similar to ice and noble rot wines, winemakers produce raisin wines by letting grapes air dry on the vine to reduce the grapes' water content. Check the label for “vin de paille” or “pasitto”
Fortified wines: These wines are made by adding alcohol during or after the fermentation process. Stopping fermentation allows the wine to retain more of its natural sugars while the addition of spirits increases the alcohol content. Well known fortified wines include Sherry, Port, and Madeira.
Late harvest wines: Grapes are left on the vine until they get very ripe and sweet. Common late harvest dessert wines include Riesling, Muscat, Pinot Gris, and Gewürztraminer.;
, Most dessert wine is sold in smaller 375 ml (12.7 oz.) bottles because dessert wines are so much richer and flavor intense than standard wines.A little bit goes a long way. Larger sizes are available at greater cost; however, a smaller selection of wines is likely to be available if you choose to purchase a larger size. When choosing the size consider the following:


Take into account that the standard pour when you serve dessert wine is 2 oz. (59.1 ml).
Estimate how much wine you will need based on the number of people you will be serving.

, Wine can be sourced from many places but not all wine retailers will carry quality dessert wines or a large variety of such wines. Check out the local supermarket, liquor store and chain wine stores but don't be afraid of looking at the more boutique or specialized wine selling retailers to broaden the possibilities of finding dessert wines.


For example, you might find a local wine merchant who has taken a particular interest in specializing in dessert wines.
Other more specialized places can include wine clubs and their catalogs, direct buying from a wine producer or buying online.

, You can recognize a dessert wine by looking for key words on the label. The phrases are often in their original language so it is helpful to know what you are looking for. Here are some common words:""Vin de paille"" is French for ""straw wine"" made with grapes that have been dried while still on the vine.
""Passito"" is an Italian wine made from dried raisins.
“Vendage Tardive,” ""auslese,"" and “Spätlese” are late harvest wines.
""Demi-Sec"" means ""off dry"" in French.
""Amabile"" means ""slightly sweet"" in Italian.
""Semi Secco"" means ""off dry"" in Italian.
""Doux"" means ""sweet"" in French.
""Dolce"" means sweet in Italian.
""Dulce"" means ""sweet"" in Spanish.
""Moelleux"" is ""sweet"" for some French wines.

, Visit a liquor store that has a large wine selection and a knowledgeable staff. Tell the staff how you plan to serve the wine, your price range, and any special flavors you may be looking for in a dessert wine.


If you are not looking for anything in particular, tell the staff the flavors you typically enjoy and ask them to pick something out for you.
For example, you may tell the staff that you like flavors like honey and exotic fruits. They will then be able to find a wine that has those flavors.

, It will be difficult to find a quality dessert wine for under $15.Dessert wine is generally more expensive than regular wine due to its more complicated production processes and because twice as many grapes are needed to make each bottle of wine compared to other wines.


Tell the staff at the liquor store how much money you are willing to spend. You will have a lot of good options at the $15-$20 price range.You can also use the website Winesearcher to find dessert wines and see the different prices."

Ask for help.,
Match the color.,
Choose a dessert wine that is sweeter than the dessert.,
Look for complementary flavors.,
Use wine as dessert.",How to Buy Dessert Wine2," The staff at the liquor store or wine shop are your greatest resource when pairing wine with food. Let them know the dessert that you are planning to serve or if you plan to use the wine as dessert.Stores that specialize in wine are usually better places to get help than picking up wine at a grocery store or large retailer.

, The darker the color of your dessert, the darker the color of the wine should be. Desserts can be grouped into three categories: vanilla and custards, fruit and spice, and caramels and chocolates. Common parings include:White wines (e.g. late harvest Riesling) and sparkling wines (e.g. demi-sec champagne, Asti Spumanti) pair well with custard and vanilla.
For desserts that contain fruits and spices (e.g. apple pie, fruit cobblers) white wines and pink champagne are a good choice.
For desserts containing chocolate and caramel, red wines (e.g. late harvest Pinot Noir, Grenache, Port (a fortified wine)),and Grappa are good pairings.

, As a general rule, the wine should be as sweet or sweeter than the dessert you are eating.If the dessert is sweeter than the wine, your wine will taste bitter.This requires knowledge of the sweetness of both the wine and the dessert.


Pairing with chocolate is often the most difficult because it is very sweet and tends to coat your mouth when you eat it. Ruby ports and Hungarian Tokay are usually a good pairing.Most white dessert wines will not pair well with chocolate based desserts.
If you are unsure of the sweetness of the wine, simply smell it. If you smell honey, molasses, or butterscotch, you are on the right track. If you swirl the glass of wine, sweet wines will be thicker and stick to the glass more.

, Although each wine varies, many white dessert wines have fruit and/or honey flavors. If your dessert is fruit , has fruity flavors, and/or honey flavors, a white wine would be best. If your dessert has buttery and caramel flavors, an amber colored sweet wine is a good choice..


If you do not know which wine to choose, a Port or a champagne are very versatile and pair well with most desserts.If drinking the noble rot wines, enjoy them with such desserts as sticky-toffee pudding, sweet syrup dumplings, pineapple upside down cake and custard-based desserts such as crème brulée and crème caramel.

, Dessert wines do not have to be paired with food. Wine can actually be your dessert. A Sauternes, port, or a beerenauslese wine are good choices.


If you are serving wine for dessert, fill the dessert wine glass with 3 oz of wine and sip it slowly.

Pay attention to the temperature.,
Choose how you'd like to serve the wine.,
Serve in a small glass.",How to Buy Dessert Wine3," The temperature of the wine influences how the wine tastes. People tend to drink red wines too warm and white wines too cold. If the white wine is too cold, you will not taste much flavor. If the red wine is too warm, the taste of alcohol will be stronger than usual.Store white wines between 40°F and 55°F. If you store them in a temperature controlled wine cellar, place them in the refrigerator for one hour before you plan to drink them.
Store red wines between 55°F and 70°F. If you store them in a temperature controlled cellar, remove them from the storage 30 minutes before you plan to drink them.
If you do not have temperature controlled cellar, store your reds at room temperature and your whites in the refrigerator. Put the reds in the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to drink them, and take your whites out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to drink them.

, Dessert wine can be served alone or with a dessert.It's a good idea to try it alone first and see how you like it, then to pair it with a dessert another time. There is no wrong way to drink dessert wine.Brandy, port, and grappa are usually served after you eat your dessert.
You can also serve the dessert wine after your main meal and before you eat your dessert.

, Dessert wines should be served in a 3 oz. glass.Sip your wine in a relaxed fashion. It is meant to be savored and enjoyed.The small glass directs the wine to the back of your mouth so that you are not overcome by the sweetness of the wine.Dessert wines typically have a higher alcohol content than other wines. The small glass is helpful for this as well.

, Grab a salt tray or small dish and turn the glass upside down. Turn it slowly, carefully lining all sides with an even amount of salt.









If you notice there's a section that isn't sticking, add more lime juice. You may want to grab a napkin and start over if this is the case (and you're concerned with taste and looks).

, Whisk together a splash of Tabasco, two splashes of Worcestershire sauce, one splash of soy sauce, the juice from the lime, and a pinch of black pepper.









Add the beer to the bowl. Pour slowly -- this allows the mixture to incorporate throughout and makes the beer foam more than usual (a good thing!). Whisk together lightly.

Take the Court of Masters test.",How to Become a Wine Connoisseur," Even if you don't know much about wine, you probably know that there's a certain way you're supposed to drink it. Truly, you can drink it however you want – but to get the most out of its aroma and taste, a legitimate art has been formed. Here are the basics in four steps:See it. Examine the color. If it's older, a white will be darker and a red will be lighter (by and large). The color can also tell you a bit about the aging processed use. A Chardonnay, for example, will be more golden if aged in oak barrels.

Swirl it. Coat the sides of the glass by swirling the wine around gently. This releases the aroma, helping you truly taste what's in front of you.

Smell it. If it's white, look for citrus-y or tropical notes, like lemon and lime, or even melon. You may also be able to detect vanilla or oak. Generally speaking, cooler places produce more citrus-y, tangy wines. If it's red, look for berry or plum scents. Cooler places will fall on the red berry side of the spectrum (like strawberry and cherry), while warmer places will showcase darker scents, like blackberry or plum. You'll also find coffee, smoke, and chocolate as major contenders.

Sip it. This will be a combination of taste and smell. As you sip it, simply ask yourself whether or not you like it. Then you can move onto why.;
, Oenophiles and connoisseurs will throw around the term ""tannin."" This is a textural element of wine that makes it ""dry."" Try a very ""dry"" wine, and you'll get the sense for what this word means (obviously any liquid isn't actually dry). Tannins are naturally occurring in grapes (and bark and wood and leaves, actually) and they add a bitterness, astringency, and complexity to a wine's flavor. For the record, this applies mostly to red wines.""Terroir"" is basically the wine's background – the climate and soil type of where it was grown, the topography, and what other plants were growing in the area. This largely influences the grapes. After all, some wines (American) are bottled by grape, sure, but others (European) are bottled just by region. Terroir is what makes a wine, well, itself.

, Each type of wine should be served at a slightly different temperature for its best taste to surface. Here's what you should know before you throw that wine-tasting gala and invite all your friends over to your house:Red wine should be served at room temperature, or about 68°-77°F (20-25° C)
Pink or rosé wines should be served slightly chilled around 44°-55°F (7-13° C)
White wine and sparkling wine should be kept in the fridge below 40°F (5°C)
After that wonderful wine-tasting party, make sure to drink light wines (less alcohol, around 11%) 3 days after opening. Bolder wines are fine for consumption up to 10 days., Each type of wine does best in a certain size and shape of glass to open up their aroma to the fullest. To do your wine justice, put it in the right glass:A standard wine glass will do well for most reds. A Cabernet Sauvignon should have a slightly taller, narrower bowl, and make sure your Pinot Noir pour is just an ounce or two.
White wines are also good in standard glasses – but Chardonnay needs a slightly wider brim.
A Port needs to be in a large flute; Madeira should be in a large hock glass; Sherry is best in a narrow martini-esque glass.
Vintage sparkling wines are best in a coupe, tulip, or flute.

, You will never be mistaken for a wine connoisseur if you're holding your glass incorrectly. To look like an expert, holding and swilling wine like it's your job, make sure to hold the glass by its stem. This goes double for white wines that are chilled – you don't want the heat of your hands warming the bowl, altering the taste.


To swirl the wine around the bowl, rotate at your wrist, not your entire arm.The smell of the wine will then fill the bowl of the glass, opening up its flavor profile.

, Being a wine connoisseur is mainly about being able to describe what you're tasting and recognize what's happening on your palette. To get at a wine's aroma, there are generally five categories: fruity, mineral, dairy and nutty, sweet and wooden, and spicy and savory. Here's what ""flavors"" fall under each:Fruity. Pretty much any fruit, including the aroma of jam
Mineral. Flint, stones, earthen, gasoline
Dairy and nutty. Butter, cream, yeast, bread, toast, grilled nuts, biscuits, almonds
Sweet and wooden. Chocolate, toffee, butterscotch, honey, vanilla, oak, and cedar
Spicy and savory. Tobacco, smoke, licorice, pepper, truffles, bacon, coffee, cinnamon

, Look for bottles of wine with write-ups near them, award citations and high magazine ratings. Try to go when you know the store is holding a tasting with samples – for many, this is on Saturday mornings. Pick the staff's brains – what are their favorites and why?


Come in with a meal plan in mind. That way you can buy wines that match the taste of the food you're serving and start exploring combinations. As a general rule of thumb, red wines go with red meat; white wines go with white meat. And champagne goes with just about everything, but master the basics first.

, These are held at adult schools, wine-making schools, wineries, and fine restaurants. Don't feel intimidated – many people who think they can distinguish between a $2 bottle of dirt and a nice vintage often can't.


If you visit a winery, make time to go in for more than just the tasting. You'll learn how wine is made, see how the grapes are grown and be taught the proper procedure for drinking wine.

, Wine is trendy. There are wine bars, wine stores, wine newsletters, and even wine podcasts. Finding a group of wine-lovers in your area is probably much easier than you think it is. Finding like-minded people who have connections and know what's going on in the area is the first step to developing your expertise.


Most groups have individuals at all levels – from those that want to buy their own winery to those who just like drinking wine. There will be a place for you in yours.

, This way you can taste a bunch of different things without spending a lot of money. And, not to mention, you get a great deal of wine experience (and wine!).


Make sure you have palette cleansers to munch on or drink between sips. Stick to bland crackers (like water crackers) or bread (a plain french loaf; nothing grainy) and water. Graber olives and rare roast beef are also sometimes used. Stay away from cheeses and fruits that are normally served with wines, as those will mask the true flavor of each.

, Now that you're about to be fully immersed in the wide world of wines, get something to remember your experiences with. This could be as simple as a notebook and pen or an app on your phone (search for ""wine diary"" or something similar). This way you remember which bottles you love, which you hate, and the characteristics of each wine you run across.


Some websites like Cellartracker are community based.You can then share and compare notes with other oenophiles and dive head-first into the cyber wine-loving community, too.

, Many people start with a fruity white white that is subtle in flavor and some happen to stop there. You probably have a couple of wines that you know are safe – so start branching out! Move onto rose wines, and start busting into reds with a vengeance. Even if you don't like it, now you know if you like it or not.


Not only should you switch up varieties, but switch up brands and years, too. Just because you dislike one producer's Chardonnay doesn't mean you won't like another's. Every wine is unique – and it can depend on your mood, too.

, wine. Plenty of people spend years in the realm of, ""Oh, I don't really care for robust reds,"" or ""Moscato is just too sweet,"" and their expertise and understanding stops there. And then bam – an ""aha"" wine hits. It's that wine where you can actually taste the cedar, or the smoke, or the chocolate. All of a sudden, you get it. And how do you find your ""aha"" wine? Trial and error.


And an ""aha"" wine doesn't have to be good or, rather, one you enjoy. It simply has to be one where all of a sudden your palette gets it. It can sort out the variety of aromas in a single glass and knows what it likes and dislikes and better yet, why.

, So you've got the taste of a Pinot Grigio down. You know the difference between a good Merlot and a good Cabernet. But there's so much more to it than that. You've done the basics, so let's get bold. Here's a few to try:


Syrah / Shiraz
Malbec
Petite Sirah
Mourvedre / Monastrell
Touriga Nacional
Cabernet Sauvignon
Petit Verdot

, The difference between someone who loves wine and someone who is a wine connoisseur is largely the fact that they can confidently talk about it to others (and accurately, to boot). Here's a few goals to hit when describing your next few glasses: You can name more than 2 fruits as flavors in the wine
You can name more than 3 other characteristics such as cinnamon, oregano, roses, chalk or baking spices
The palate of the wine changes from the moment you taste it to the moment you swallow, and you can identify how

, You've gone bold, now let's go a bit off the main path: try other wines, like sparkling, dessert, and ice wines (ice wines are made from grapes that have experienced a frost). They're not the wines you'll be experiencing with a main course at a 5-star restaurant, but they're important nonetheless.


Experience wines from a variety of countries and various locales, such as a New Zealand and British wines, or wines from South Dakota and Idaho. Don't just stick to Californian wines or European wines – even when it comes to sweet, dessert wines.

, Traditionally fine wine was made from mainly French grape varieties, but now a much wider range of grape varieties are being used. Wineries are popping up all over the place, and the ""terroir"" of your average grape is changing. How do you feel about each region and variety?


France, Italy, Spain, China,Turkey, and the US are the main producers of wine (though they are by no means the only), and each have specific varieties of grapes that are able to grown in their respective regions.Because of this, wines from different areas of the world will taste different. What's your take on them?

, Now that you're a world traveler when it comes to wine, go back to the very first wines you tried. There will be such difference you'll wonder who the person was that tasted it originally, or how it's possible the wine has completely morphed – but it's undeniable that it has. Take that basic Chardonnay that's been sitting in your cupboard and take a sip, basking in your progress.


It'll become evident to you how much your palette has changed. It'll also become evident which wines you love and which you won't even bother trying anymore. For a real challenge, get blind taste-testing glasses and see if you remain consistent.

, Most host courses or tastings, offering you some sort of ""certificate"" or ""accreditation"" upon finishing. Local adult schools and restaurants also hold wine appreciation classes. When people ask if you know wine, you can mention that you've even studied it.


Though, for the record, just like anything else, you don't need school to become a connoisseur. It's just an easy way to prove that you know your stuff.

, In America, to be a master sommelier, you need to take the Court of Masters test. There's a course you can take (you have to apply), though you can take the test without taking the course. This is as high as you can get in the wine world – and it comes with quite the badge of respect.They also offer international courses. Currently there are only 140 Master Sommeliers in North America.

Learn the four most basic structural descriptions.,
Develop your palate style.,
Learn basic descriptions for flavors.,
Come to know the wine rating experts.,
Buy a wine right off the shelf that you have never seen before.,
Use your new-found skills!",How to Buy Wine Blind," There are only a few basic aspects of wine description - fruit, acid, oak, and tannin.


Fruit is the snobby wine way of saying sweetness or sugar content.






Acid is that crisp burn you get on the sides and back of your tongue.
Oak is the buttery or toasty flavor that wine picks up when barreled in wood.






Tannin is the bitter chewy feeling around your teeth and cheeks similar to chewing on a grape skin.;
, Each person has a preference for how much of each they prefer in their wine. This preference is called your palate style.

In order to find yours, go to the store (or wine bar) and buy (or ask for a taste of) three wines of radically different variations. For instance, if you like white wine choose a Riesling, a Chardonnay, and a Pinot grigio. Red wine lovers might choose a Chianti, a Merlot, and a classic (light) Pinot noir.






Draw yourself a ""one through ten"" chart for each of the four basic descriptions and label them. Make sure you have one full chart for each wine. As you taste each wine, rate each one with what you feel they have of each of the descriptions. You are not rating what you like, yet. You are just deciding how much of each thing the wines have. One would be almost none (if any), and ten, an enormous amount. A typical Pinot grigio might have a three to six for fruit, an eight to ten for acid, a two to four for oak, and a two for tannin.    






When you finish the charts, you can begin to sort out how much of these individual descriptions you like in each wine. A red wine person might decide that they like a medium tannin, a high fruit, a medium oak, and a low acid. In this case, Merlot and other soft, lush varietals or blends might be your personal favorites. A white wine drinker could choose a medium fruit, a medium oak, a medium acid and a low tannin. They might go for a nice California Chardonnay.






Do not be surprised if, in your wine adventures, you find yourself liking something that sneaks in from outside of your box. A declared Chardonnay drinker might find some joy in a nice Sauvignon blanc because, while the acid is higher, the fruit is higher as well and this gives a nice balance.

, Wine gurus speak to each other in food flavor words. Lemony. Chocolate. Earthy (like the lingering taste of raw dirt around a potato skin). Raspberry. Cherries. Crisp Green Apple. Tobacco (the flavor of raw unburnt tobacco on your tongue). If you type ""basic wine descriptors"" into your favorite search engine, you could find a nice dictionary for fun reading at your fingertips. Assume correctly that if you like the flavors of the food descriptions, you might like them in your wine., Wine Spectator, Robert Parker, and Wine Enthusiast are some of the top names. They have a ""One to One Hundred"" rating system with One Hundred being the absolute best in class. Anything with an 85 or better is in the top 15% of those wines produced that year. Eighty five percent of the wines on the shelf at your local store will not be that good. You have just learned what you need to know to buy a bottle of wine blind., Go to the largest wine store you know and find the section of wines you have already decided you like based on your palate style. Find all of the ones with a tag sticking out from the shelf that have an 85 or better from one of the professional rating systems.


Read the tag thoroughly. They always have quotes from the rater with a very professional description. It might say something like this: ""...medium acid and lush tannins combine with hints of raspberry and chocolate."" If this is your palate and price range then you have just struck gold. You can bring it home confidently, know you will love it, and add another brand name to your buying list.







, Understanding palate styles will help you be the most popular gift buyer in your group of friends. You may not be a white wine drinker, but you know that your girlfriend likes fruity whites with low acid. Imagine how happy she will be when you wrap a bottle of something awesome that she has never tried before!"

Pour a glass of wine and let it sit for 5 to 30 minutes.,
Use a proper wine glass.,
Swirl the wine in your glass.,
Take a sip of wine.,
Develop your palate.",How to Acquire the Taste for Wine1," Newly opened wine needs to be exposed to air so that it oxidizes and produces a more mellow and pleasant beverage. Drinking wine as soon as the bottle is opened may give the wine a thin body rather than a fuller taste.;
, The classic wine glass traps the aromas of the wine so that you can smell it more accurately. Some wine aficionados even put their noses into the glass to capture all of the smells. You may experience smells that resemble cut fruit, minced herbs, or even hot tea.

, Observe how the wine sticks to the side of the glass or if it sloshes around quickly. Additionally, look at the color of the wine. Experts can tell how a wine will taste just by looking at it. For now, you want to pay attention to how the wine behaves compared with how it tastes.When a wine has “legs,” that means it sticks to the side of the glass and contains lots of fruit juice.
The darker and deeper the color of a wine, the bolder the taste should be.

, Make sure it flows over the tip of your tongue, both sides, underneath, and into the back of your mouth. After noticing the tastes, either swallow or spit out the wine, then breathe in through your mouth drawing air over all those parts of your tongue again. This will cause the tastes from the wine to change, sometimes quite suddenly and sharply.Tasting notes are the individual flavors you can pick out of the overall experience of a certain wine.At first you might not be able to pick out flavors like chocolate or oak, but practice will train your tastebuds to recognize unusual tastes.
You can cheat by looking at the bottle's label or asking someone else what they taste until you can start picking out specific notes on your own.

, Keep track of what you taste in certain wines and what you like and don’t like. Write down your impressions of each wine. This way you can go back and reference past tastings and look for patterns in your preferences.


Wines have four basic components: taste, tannins, alcohol, and acidity. Each of these components ranges in intensity in different wines and will affect whether you like a certain wine or not.
As you continue to try different wines, you may find that dry red wines are not your favorite, but you enjoy a dry and tart white wine variety.

Know the basic standards that each batch of bourbon must meet.,
Look for bourbons that have hit the right age.,
Know the different colors of bourbon.,
Know the history of bourbon.,
Know the different types of bourbon and their specific flavors.,
Buy several varieties -- a traditional bourbon, a high rye bourbon, a high corn bourbon, and a wheated bourbon -- and conduct a taste test.,
Get a glass suitable for liquors.,
Pour the bourbon into the glass.,
Take a sip of the bourbon.,
Consult a bartender's recipe list for choices.,
Try a bourbon-based cocktail.,
Use bourbon in the kitchen.",How to Drink Bourbon," Bourbon is a type of spirit that is ""a distinctive product of the United States,"" according to U.S. federal law. In 1964, Congress issued federal standards regarding the production of bourbon. These standards include:


It must be made with no less than 51% corn.
It must be aged in ""new"" charred oak barrels. ""Straight"" bourbon refers to bourbon that has been aged in these barrels for two years.
It must be distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume.)
It must be entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).
It must be bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume).;
, Bourbon has no minimum required age, but it is normally aged for four to nine years. ""Straight"" bourbon is only aged for two years. As bourbon ages, it takes on a deeper brownish amber color, a richer flavor, and a slightly increased level of sweetness.Bourbon is aged in barrels, and during the extended aging process, normally seven to eight years, some of the bourbon will permeate through the wood of the barrel. This is called the ""Angels' Share."" There is also a certain amount absorbed into the char of the barrel. This is extracted and labeled the ""Devil's Share."" Jim Beam calls this the ""Devil's Cut.""
The barrels used for aging the bourbon are never used again. Instead, they are used to age soy sauce and whiskey or are made into beautiful pieces of furniture.

, Most bourbons are amber and brown, while some varieties remain white (or clear.) As a first-time bourbon drinker, you will want to start with a brown bourbon. The brown color of bourbon comes from the barrel ""breathing"" into and out of the char and wood of the barrel. The color comes from the char and the wood of the barrel. White whiskey Bourbon is as clear as water. It is aged for one year and is called by several names, including ""The Ghost,"" ""Raw Whiskey,"" ""White Dog Whiskey"" (Jack Daniels), and ""Jacob's Ghost"" (Jim Beam), among others., The name Bourbon comes from the French Bourbon dynasty. Bourbon County, Kentucky, was named after this French royal family, and bourbon was first produced in the old Bourbon county region of Kentucky. Bourbon was originally made in the 18th century but didn't become well known until the 1860's. Due to re-definitions written into NAFTA, bourbon is now made throughout the United States. However, by tradition, true bourbon comes from distilleries located in the original 1786 Old Bourbon County region in northeastern Kentucky which has since been divided into 34 separate counties. The first distillery in present-day Bourbon County to be licensed since Prohibition did not begin operating until 2014. Whiskey makers of good reputation outside of the historic Bourbon County region will not use the term bourbon for their whiskeys.

, Most bourbons are made with corn, rye, and barley. More traditional bourbons contain 8 to 10% rye. However, bourbons can be divided into several additional categories, including High Rye, High Corn, and Wheated.High Rye means that the bourbon is made up of more than 10% rye. Bourbons that have a high rye content are generally spicier than other bourbons and are known for their bold flavor. Common high rye bourbons include Bulleit, Old Grand Dad, and Basil Hayden.
High Corn bourbons contain more than 51% corn. Bourbons with high corn content are often much sweeter than traditional bourbons. High corn bourbons include Old Charter and Baby Bourbon.
Wheated bourbons are bourbons that substitute wheat for rye, making them a combination of corn, wheat, and barley. These bourbons are softer on the palate and have a stronger flavor of caramel or vanilla. Maker’s Mark, Van Winkle bourbons, and Rebel Yell are some of the more common wheated varieties.

, Choose the one that you like the best.


You could also try a blend. A 4-year old blend is a bourbon for which the youngest whiskey used, not including neutral grain spirits, is aged 4 years. (Neutral grains are not whiskeys.)

, Special glasses are not required, but some shapes do enhance the smelling and tasting experience. Glasses with wider mouths are better because they allow you to really smell the bourbon (they also make it easier to add ice if you want to). A richer smell will enhance the taste of the bourbon., The glass should be ¼ full. Let it settle for several seconds. Before you taste it, smell the bourbon. Do this by sticking your nose over the edge of the glass and parting your lips on the edge of the glass. In this way, you will be both smelling and tasting at the same time.The smells of bourbon vary greatly from bottle to bottle, and of course they depend on each person's sense of smell. Some of the more common descriptions of bourbon aromas include old wood, vanilla, caramel, and matches.

, Let it roll across the tongue, and swallow it. Let your tongue ""chew"" on the flavor for a few seconds, and then breathe out through your nose and mouth together to get the full flavor. If you are not used to drinking liquor, be prepared for the ""bite"" the bourbon will give your mouth.

, Bourbons are sipped neat (alone), with water, with ice, or mixed into a cocktail. Indeed, bourbon has gained a great deal of popularity as a standard spirit used in cocktails.

, The Manhattan is probably the most famous of the bourbon-based cocktails. Don’t be shocked if you feel like a mobster while drinking this classic. Another cocktail is the Mint Julep. The Mint Julep is a delightfully refreshing staple cocktail often served in the southern United States. However, if you prefer basic cocktails to the fancier ones, look no further than the Bourbon and Coke. This pairing is easy to drink (and will save you money at bars).

, Bourbon is not just used for drinking; it can also add a delicious flavor to your favorite dishes. Bourbon chicken is a classic dish that infuses the chicken with a delectable bourbon flavor. You could also try making a bourbon-infused brown sugar glaze that tastes fabulous on salmon.

Completely open the top of a 1/2 gallon milk carton and rinse it out well.,
Place a full bottle of vodka in the container.,
Fill the milk carton with cold tap water.,
Carefully lift the filled milk carton and vodka bottle by gripping the top edges of the milk carton.,
Place the filled milk carton and vodka bottle in the freezer on a flat, level area.,
Remove the milk carton from the ice.,
Trim the ice to give a rounder, more pleasant appearance if desired.,
Place the embedded bottle on a serving tray.,
Wrap the embedded bottle of vodka with a cloth napkin.,
Return the bottle to the freezer if the ice has not melted much.",How to Embed a Bottle of Vodka in Solid Ice," If desired, crease each of the walls out slightly to give the container a more rounded shape, and to allow for thicker ice formation. Be aware that while thicker ice will take longer to melt, thinner ice will be easier to see through.;
, Make sure that your bottle of vodka will fit in it with room to spare. You can use any vodka bottle that fits or looks best, and refill it or top it off from a different bottle if desired.

, The water level should come up to the base of the neck of the vodka bottle. It may be desirable to unscrew the very tip of the faucet (the faucet component that aerates the water) before filling the carton, as air that is trapped in the water will make the ice cloudier or more opaque.


To make the ice much clearer, use filtered water that has been boiled and cooled twice. The boiling removes air in the water as well as minerals, while the filtering removes various impurities, all of which cause the opaqueness of ice. Alternatively, buy distilled water and boil it once to remove the air, then cool it. Pour the water carefully and gently to minimize any splashing, as air will become trapped in the water when it is agitated. Gently tap the sides of the filled carton and the neck of the submerged bottle to release air bubbles that are stuck to surfaces. Also try gently rotating the submerged bottle back and forth several times to dislodge air bubbles. Be aware that the ice will still have a tendency to form cosmetic fractures that will make it less clear. Another possible way to make sure you have the clearest ice possible would be to use a small hose and syphon the water from one container into the milk carton, making sure the end of the hose which is in the milk carton is at the bottom of the carton. This will allow for fewer air bubbles to get into the water during the process of filling the milk carton.

,


Place flowers or other decorations in the water, wedging them between the bottle and the inner wall of the milk carton to keep them submerged.

, The bottom of the milk carton needs to be kept as flat as possible so that when the embedded bottle is removed, it can stand upright on its own. Allow the water to freeze totally solid overnight.

, This is done by first running cold or cool water over the carton for a short period of time. Try pulling the bottle from the carton. If the bottle can't be easily pulled from the carton, tear the carton away from the ice in sections.
•Be aware that the ice will fracture somewhat when it is run under the water due to the sudden temperature change, causing the ice to be less clear and uniform.

, Chip or scrape small amounts at a time, using a sturdy, pointed knife. Be careful not to fracture the ice or break the vodka bottle. Also take care not to cut yourself, and be aware that the ice may lose its transparency when it’s chipped, unless it’s run under water afterwards.

, The tray should be able to hold some water that will melt from the ice, and should keep the embedded bottle from sliding around too much. If the bottle is to be carried around on the tray, it can be kept in place by putting it on a folded cloth napkin. However, the ice may freeze to the napkin, so the napkin may need to be removed.
•The bottom of the ice may not be level enough to allow the embedded bottle to remain upright. The bottom may be leveled by standing the embedded bottle on a flat surface that has been heated in the oven or with hot water until the bottom melts somewhat and becomes flat.

, This will make it easier and safer to pick up the bottle.


To prepare the napkin, first fold it in half.
Fold the created edge over twice.
Tie the back into a knot to secure it.

, Reuse and refill the bottle with vodka as needed. Don’t leave a napkin under the bottle, as it will definitely freeze to the bottle and to the tray.

Select a quality bottle of absinthe.,
Be aware that quality absinthe should show the louche effect.,
Select absinthe that is made from natural, whole herbal ingredients.,
Select absinthe that has a high alcohol content.",How to Drink Absinthe1," Absinthe is made using many different methods and ingredients. There are several standards that help one to determine if a particular brand of absinthe is authentic and of high quality. It is also possible to make absinthe, although this is dangerous and not recommended.


Different brands of absinthe will contain anywhere from negligible amounts of thujone up to about 35 mg/kg thujone. See the Tips below for more about the role of thujone in absinthe. International standards require that alcoholic beverages that contain greater than 25 percent alcohol by volume contain no more than 10 mg/kg thujone, while bitter spirits may contain up to 35 mg/kg thujone. If an absinthe is labeled as a bitter, it will probably contain 10 to 35 mg/kg thujone.
Thujone is illegal as a food additive in the United States, but authentic absinthe containing negligible amounts of thujone can be legally sold. Vintage bottles of pre-ban absinthe can be obtained, and it is reputed that some of the lesser quality versions contained inordinately high levels of thujone and harmful adulterants such as copper salts, aniline dye and antimony trichloride. These circumstances may have led to absinthe's poor reputation.

, It is desirable for absinthe to gradually demonstrate increasing turbidity (opaqueness) or turn partially translucent as ice water is gradually added to it. This is known as the louche effect. The louched color should demonstrate complexity as well as nuance, and the absinthe should not turn opaque rapidly.


However, it must be noted that not all quality absinthe will turn opaque, as the louche effect is primarily produced by the herbs anise and fennel. Absinthe typically tastes like licorice due to the addition of such herbs. The louche effect is produced by the precipitation of the herbal essential oils.

, The finest absinthe is made with whole, natural herbs and does not contain any artificial ingredients such as artificial colors and flavors. The herbs are merely ground up so that they can be efficiently used during the distillation and extraction processes. The pale-green color of typical high-quality absinthe is imparted by the chlorophyll that is extracted from whole, natural herbs.


Absinthe that is bright green may be artificially colored. However, not all quality absinthe has a green color. Quality absinthe may also be clear, orange, or red, but the color should be imparted by natural herbal ingredients such as petite wormwood.
Vintage absinthe may have an amber color, as the chlorophyll will have faded over time. If you're lucky enough to obtain a bottle of vintage absinthe, consider opening the bottle with a food scientist in order to ensure that the spirit is indeed safe to drink.

, The best tasting absinthe falls into the range of 45-68 percent alcohol by volume. Absinthe has traditionally been about 136-proof. A very high alcohol content is not considered to be excessive because absinthe is traditionally diluted with water before drinking and it is meant to be sipped slowly over time, so as not to allow the effects of alcohol to overwhelm the subtle and pleasant effect of the herbs.

Try different kinds of wine.,
Narrow things down by starting with one type of wine.,
Experiment with wines from different countries.,
Compare old wine and new wines.,
Mix wine with other ingredients.",How to Acquire the Taste for Wine2," You may think you dislike wine because the ones you've tried aren't compatible with your preferences. But by exposing yourself to a wide variety of wines, you’ll increase the likelihood that you'll find at least one kind that you truly enjoy.

, Don’t be overwhelmed by the amount of wines that are available. The easiest way to break them down is into white and red categories. From there, you can begin testing your palate on blends, ages, and even individual vineyards.Sweeter white wines like Viognier or Riesling may be easier for a novice to appreciate than a very dry Sauvignon Blanc or an oaky Chardonnay.
Similarly for red wines, Zinfandels with more pronounced fruit flavors may be more accessible than drier wines such as Cabernet or Pinot Noir.
Different blends of wine combine the characteristics of varietal grapes to create balanced and complex flavors.
There is more to wines than simply red or white. Blushes, ice wines, sparkling wines, madeiras, ports, and sherries are all different methods to process the fruit, juice, or the wine.

, Depending on where a wine is sourced will determine how it smells and taste. Some of the most popular and accessible wines come from France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, and the United States.


Different countries will vary in soil types as well as production methods. This creates a whole new world of options to try.
In general, new world wines from California and South America have more pronounced fruit flavors and are less dry than wines from France or Italy.

, The age of a wine will also determine its taste and aroma nuances. Try both young and old wines, and if possible purchase a batch of the same wine and drink one from each year to experience the subtle changes a wine goes through as it changes over time.

, Wine snobs turn up their noses at the idea of mixing wine with other things, but wine on ice, mixed with fruit juices, mixed with liquors or liqueurs, or other things often results in great tasting beverages.


Add ice, especially with heavier, sweeter, or very rich wines. The coldness of the ice slightly numbs your taste buds, easing the strength (and the astringent qualities) of some wines, especially reds.

Go to a wine tasting.,
Visit a vineyard and take a tour.,
Pair different wines with different foods at meals.,
Listen to how other people talk about wine.,
Drink wines in various settings and occasions.,
Continue to try different wines.",How to Acquire the Taste for Wine3," The best way to learn more is to attend wine tastings with friends at local wine shops, bars, or even art galleries. The advantage of going to a wine tasting is that you can try several kinds of wines without committing to buying a bottle you may not enjoy.Some wine tastings have small refreshments for cleansing your palate in between wines as well as buckets for spitting out wine so you don’t accidentally drink the equivalent of a whole bottle.
Don’t take advantage of your host. The goal is to taste new wines, not get drunk.

, Wine tours are popular throughout the world and they’re a great way to learn about the process of making wine and all of the details that go into a simple glass.


Come prepared to walk the grounds of the vineyard and remember to stay hydrated.
Look into the fees and prices. Sometimes if you buy a bottle during the tour, some of the costs may be waived.
Go with a group. It can be more fun and may be cheaper as well.

, Oftentimes a review or the wine bottle label will recommend different cheeses or meats to consume with the wine you’re drinking. Eating and cooking is simply balancing the aspects of fats, acids, salt, and sweet tastes.Wine pairings are a great excuse to make a meal centered around a certain red wine and steak and inviting your friends over to try it.Some wines are best paired with foods from the same region. For example, a wine from Northern Italy may pair best with a goat cheese from a farm in the upper regions of Italy.
Pairings are helpful because you may not like wine for its acidity, but if you know that eating a sweet fruit with it helps to balance the flavors, you may enjoy it more.

, You don’t have to learn all of the lingo that wine experts use, but pay attention to how they talk about a wine’s aromas and tastes. Just by listening you might gain a deeper appreciation for a certain variety or grape or production method.


Your friends and family are also good gauges. If you share similar tastes, ask them for a recommendation and why they prefer a particular type.
At the very least, learn to pronounce the names of the various types of wines.

, Wine is appropriate for all sorts of events and places and different wines suit different settings and even seasons of the year. You may find that you prefer to drink wine instead of a beer at sporting events or enjoy wine with dessert only.


A sparkly or sweet wine may be best for a celebration and a dark red might better suit an evening at home with a good book.
Some people agree that chilled wines are best for warm summer days and warm, mulled wines are best for long nights in the winter.

, Your taste buds change all the time and you may find that a wine you couldn’t stand before is now your favorite. There are so many different options for wine that you almost can’t exhaust your options. So be patient and keep exploring.

Pour the water into a mug and let it cool a little.,
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of honey into the mug.,
Stir the honey until it dissolves.,
Taste the honey water, and add more honey, if needed.,
Drink the honey water while it is still warm.",How to Make Honey Water1," You use a kettle or the microwave to do this. Try to use distilled or tap water, if you can, as ordinary tap water contains too many minerals and chemicals.


If you are using the microwave, heat it for 1 to 2 minutes.;
, Ideally, the water should be warm. It can be hot, but it should not boiling. Adding honey to boiling-hot water will destroy the good enzymes in honey that make it so healthy.

, If you don't have a very big sweet tooth, use only 1 tablespoon (15 grams).

, Use the same spoon that you measured the honey with. This way, you won't waste any honey.

, The honey will make the water very sweet, but you might like your water even sweeter. Keep in mind that the honey is only supposed to lightly flavor the water. You don't want to drink something that is practically pure honey.

, This will allow you to get the most benefits out of the honey. One of the most notable benefits of honey is soothing a sore throat."

Pour about one ounce (30ml) of absinthe into a glass.,
Lay a flat, perforated absinthe spoon across the rim of the glass, and place a single cube of sugar on the perforated area of the spoon.,
Drip very pure ice cold water into the absinthe from a small pitcher.,
Stir the drink with the absinthe spoon after the water has been added.",How to Drink Absinthe2," There are various types of glasses that can be used, some of antique or historical design and others of more modern design. French absinthe glasses, such as reservoir pontarlier glasses, are quite suitable for the French absinthe ritual. Different styles of reservoir glasses are available, but every style will have a distinct or bulbous bottom area that indicates the amount of absinthe that is to be initially poured.;
, This is customary but is not necessary. The sugar is traditionally used to balance the bitter taste of the wormwood.

, This very slow and gradual addition of the water forms the heart of the absinthe ritual, and is done with or without the sugar. When using sugar, the cold water is dripped over the sugar and into the drink, causing the sugar to slowly dissolve into the absinthe. Very high quality absinthe can be expertly experienced simply with the ice cold water.


Three or four ounces of water are added per ounce of absinthe.
Ice cubes can be added to the pitcher of water if desired, but be sure that they don't fall into the glass of absinthe.
As the water is added to the absinthe, the absinthe should gradually louche.
Absinthe fountains were traditionally used to drip the ice cold water into absinthe drinks.
Brouilleur devices can also be used to automatically drip the water into individual glasses. The brouilleur is placed over the glass, and water, ice cubes, or ice water (as well as sugar if desired) is added to it. The water will gradually drip through the brouilleur into the absinthe. The brouilleur is removed before drinking the prepared absinthe.


, Two or three ice cubes can be added to the finished drink, but this practice may be frowned upon by absinthe purists.

Pour a dose of absinthe into a glass, then place a sugar cube on an absinthe spoon or teaspoon.

,
Soak the sugar in absinthe by dipping it into the absinthe with the spoon or pouring a little absinthe over it.

,
Light the absinthe-soaked sugar on fire for about one minute, allowing the sugar to begin to caramelize.,
Pour ice-cold water over the sugar cube before it begins turning brown and burning.,
Use this method appropriately.",How to Drink Absinthe3,",, (This is not recommended because it can be extremely dangerous due to the high alcohol content which makes the absinthe very flammable). If an absinthe spoon is used, take care that the sugar does not burn, nor drip into the absinthe, ruining its flavor.

, This process should produce the louche effect.

, Though frowned upon by some absinthe aficionados, this untraditional method has become popular in recent years. Absinthe with a high alcohol content will ignite more readily, but it is certainly not recommended that high-quality absinthe be set aflame.

"
"
Place a small glass full of absinthe (containing one ounce of absinthe) inside a larger empty glass.

,
Drip the cold water into the small glass, causing the contents of the small glass to overflow into the larger glass.,
Remove the small glass from the larger glass before drinking the absinthe from the larger glass.

",How to Drink Absinthe4,", Once the three or four ounces of water have been added, the large glass will contain the absinthe and water mixture, while the small glass will just contain water.

"
Note that this method can be dangerous if done improperly.,
Get a small shot glass and fill about ¾ of it with absinthe.,
With a match or a lighter, set fire to the shot of absinthe.,
Quickly place your palm over the rim of the shot glass, covering it completely and extinguishing the fire.Do this no longer than 5 seconds after setting the drink ablaze.,
Bring the shot glass to your nose, slowly break the suction, and breathe in the alcohol vapor produced by the flame.,
Sip or shoot the shot of absinthe.",How to Drink Absinthe5," Because it involves lighting the absinthe on fire and then placing your palm over the shot glass to extinguish the flame, you're quite literally toying with fire. If you are unsure about the directions or feel unsafe about the thought of performing them, please do not attempt. You're literally toying with fire.


Also understand that this method involves drinking a shot of absinthe straight, without dilution. As absinthe can be an incredibly strong alcohol, this method is not recommended for light drinkers.

, Make sure the absinthe does not fill the shot glass completely. Also make sure that the palm of your hand fits comfortably over the whole rim of the shot glass. You will not be able to perform the backdraft trick if the rim of the glass is bigger than your palm.

, The flame should take immediately and burn easily because of the alcohol content of absinthe.



Note: Do not let the absinthe burn for a long time. Bad things can happen the longer you let the absinthe burn. The shot glass gets hotter, increasing the risk of burning your hand. The flame also burns away the alcohol and herbs of the absinthe, ruining the delicate flavors. Also, your glass can crack if you let the flame burn too long, or, if you're using a plastic cup, it can melt (and also release plastic fumes).

, You should feel a suction effect if you place your hand over the entire rim of the shot glass.


Although you'd think it would burn to place your hand over the flame, the flame is pretty much immediately choked out since it no longer has any oxygen to serve as fuel. Counterintuitively, this process shouldn't hurt at all if you don't let the absinthe burn for very long.

, Lightly remove only a portion of your palm from the shot glass instead of removing your entire hand at once.

, Enjoy it at your leisure or down it in one fell swoop.

Drink absinthe straight (neat).,
Keep in mind that this is not customary due to the very high alcohol content of traditional absinthe.

Remember that the louche effect is a very important quality of absinthe, however, and should therefore be experienced when preparing quality absinthe.

Try your hand at starting your own whisky collection.",How to Drink Scotch Whisky," One of the most important distinctions in Scotch whisky is a technical one. It may not seem terribly important, but being able to identify a single-malt from a blend will tell you a lot about the whisky before you even sip it. So, what is the difference between single-malts and blends?


A single-malt Scotch is made just from water and 100% barley. Although it comes from a single distillery, it can contain whiskies from different barrels, and even from different batches.A single malt from Bruichladdich distillery, therefore, may have whiskies from different barrels, but it will only contain whisky distilled at Bruichladdich.
A blended malt Scotch whisky is made from two or more single-malt whiskies produced at different distilleries.Many distilleries sell their whisky for use in blends. Few independent bottlers identify which distilleries produced the whiskies made in their blends, preferring instead to name only the general geographical area.;
, Although single-malts are arguably more prestigious than blends — their price tag certainly advertises it — there are some very tasty blends out there, sometimes even nicer than single-malts. Overall, you'll probably squeeze more quality out of single-malts, but they're more expensive than blends and not always better.When drinking Scotch, it pays to be judicious and agnostic. Don't be a complete and utter snob., Scotch whisky ages for at least three years in oak barrels. Sometimes, those oak barrels have been previously used to age sherry or bourbon.The provenance of the oak itself often varies: Some distilleries use American oak casks, while others prefer European oak. The process of allowing the whisky to age in oak barrels, sometimes for several decades, often produces a finer whisky. As a wise man once said, ""Never commit Scotch pedophilia!""


Why does whisky improve with age? Oak, like all woods, is porous. Scotch that is housed in oak barrels seeps into the oak barrel's pores, picking up some of the oak's unique flavor. As the whisky ages, a portion of the alcohol evaporates, mellowing the flavor. The whisky that evaporates during the aging process is referred to as the ""angel's share.""Scotch whisky barrels are sometimes charred before the introduction of the spirit. This charring imparts a unique flavor. The charred wood also helps purify the whisky; the carbon left in the charcoal filters away some impurities as it ages.
Whiskies are often given a ""finish,"" so to speak. They are aged in one cask for a majority of the aging process, and then transferred to another cask for an additional 6 to 12 months.This gives the whisky a richer flavor profile.
Whisky does not continue to age once it is bottled. It may lose a bit of alcohol through evaporation and therefore ""mellow,"" but most of its deep flavor is likely to have developed while it was still casked.

, Some whiskies are given caramel color injections before bottling, ostensibly to maintain visual consistency from one bottling to the next. Steer clear of these whiskies. If the whisky tastes good, what does it matter how it looks? Here's the bottom line with Scotch and with other spirits to which colorant are added: If the distiller or bottler is willing to lie about the color of the spirit, what else are they willing to lie about?, While whisky can technically be produced the world 'round — Canada, Australia, and even Japan all make fine whisky — start off with whiskies from the wind-tipped rim of Scotia. You almost can't go wrong. Here's a quick look at the different regions of Scotland, some of their characteristics, and some of their most heralded whiskies:

, While it's certainly fine to drink your whisky out of any old glass, choosing the right one will enhance your whisky experience. Experts agree that a tulip-shaped glass is generally the best: It allows you to swirl the whisky without it spilling, as well as concentrating the whisky aroma near the glass's neck.If you can't find a tulip-shaped whisky glass to sip out of, try using a wine or champagne glass instead.

, Pour yourself a small glass — depending on your pleasure, of course — usually not more than an ounce. Gently swirl the glass, coating the sides of the glass with a thin film of whisky and allowing the spirit to breathe. Enjoy the color of the whisky and its texture as the filmy coat of caramel spindles down the glass.

, Smell your whisky. Bring the whisky glass up to your nose and inhale deeply. Take your nose away (the first nose will smell entirely of alcohol) and then come back to the whisky. Spend a good 20 to 30 seconds breathing in the whisky, setting it down, and coming back to it, all while free-associating about the kinds of smells or flavors the spirit evokes. When nosing, pay attention to the following kinds of smells:

Smokiness. This includes peatiness, as malted barley is often thrown over a peat fire in order to smoke it.
Saltiness. Can you taste the briny spindrift of Islay whiskies? Many Scotch whiskies have a distinctly maritime smell.
Fruitiness. Can you pick out dried currants, apricot, or cherry from your whisky?
Sweetness. Many Scotch whiskies rely on caramel, toffee, vanilla or honey tones. What confections can you smell?
Woodiness. Since oak is such an integral companion in the whisky-aging process, wood smell is often headily present in Scotch. It sometimes interacts with the smell of sweetness.

, Bring in enough whisky so that it coats your entire tongue, but not so much that your taste buds are overwhelmed with the flavor of alcohol. Swirl the Scotch around in your mouth a bit and try to develop a good ""mouthfeel."" How does the whisky taste? What does it taste like?

, Swallow the whisky and open your mouth slightly to help taste the lingering afterglow of the whisky. What flavors, if any, develop after the whisky has been swallowed? This is referred to as the ""finish."" In elegant whiskies, the finish will be distinct from the mouthfeel, and will add another layer of pleasant complexity to your tasting experience., Many whisky aficionados like to add water to their whiskey, enough to dilute the alcohol volume down to about 30%.This is usually less than a teaspoon. Some whiskies will take more water, other will take less; as with most things delicate, it's better to add too little than too much.


Here's a tip for determining how much water to add to your whisky. Add a couple drops at a time until the stinging or burning sensation in your nose you get from smelling the alcohol disappears.
Why add water to your whisky? Water dilutes the whisky. At stronger alcohol contents, the alcohol in the whisky can mask some of the more unpleasant flavors or aromas. When you take that heady alcohol smell and taste away, the true spirit of the whisky starts to shine through. Adding water separates the men from the boys, so to speak.
Try covering the whisky with a cap of some sort (try a clean coaster, for example) and let it mellow for 10 to 30 minutes. This will give the whisky enough time to interact with the water, producing a better drinking experience.

, Swirl, nose, taste, and savor the whisky again. How does it taste diluted? How is the whisky any different from what it was undiluted? What things do you notice now about the whisky that weren't apparent on the first pass? Continue drinking and savoring the whisky slowly, preferably with friends., Who says you have to rely on distilleries to blend the whisky for you? You can make your own blends quickly and easily, and to good effect with a little bit of practice. Here's the basics of how.


Start with two whiskies, preferably from the same distiller. Two different kinds of Bruichladdich might work well together, or two different vintages of Talisker. It's easier to blend whiskeys that were sold by the same distiller.
Blend a very small amount of two or three whiskeys and set aside for a week or two. This is your ""test run,"" designed to see whether you enjoy the final product. If, after two or three weeks, you like the blend, you can be reasonably sure that blending more won't result in total disaster.
Take an empty whiskey bottle and fill it almost to the brim with your new blend. You can use 50/50 of two whiskies, or 45/55, or even 33/33/33 of three. The choice is yours. Filling your bottle up almost to the brim neutralizes some of the oxidation that can affect the taste of your whisky.

, As soon as you expose your precious whisky to O2, the spirit starts losing some of its character. Oxygen starts converting the alcohol into vinegar. So drink responsibly, but don't sip so slowly that your cargo turns into undrinkable acid. Bottoms up!, Whisky is aged in oak barrels, but the whisky entrepreneur can also learn how to age spirits himself using string and a toasted twig of wood. Try experimenting with woods such as birch, cherry, or oak for extra flavor. Of course, only use this technique to enhance whisky that leaves something to be desired; very good whiskies probably won't benefit from extra wood aging.


Make sure the branch or twig is small enough so that it will fit inside your whisky bottle.
Heat your branch or twig in the oven for several hours on low heat to remove all moisture.
With a blowtorch, lightly toast the branch. The goal here isn't to char; you just want to toast the branch or twig to give it extra aroma.
Fasten the branch to a piece of string and submerge it in your whisky, tasting the whisky every 30 minutes. You don't need to submerge the branch long to have a big effect on taste. 30 minutes to an hour is sometimes all it takes to produce a nice enhancement.

Note: Be sure that the type of wood you're using is safe to use in whisky. Some types of wood are poisonous to humans and/or won't produce a pleasant taste or aroma. Your health should always be your first priority.

, Of course, if you like your whisky cold and super-diluted, go for it. But most whisky drinkers consider ice to be passé. Cool temperatures tend to mask certain flavors, and over-diluted whiskey is more water than whisky, anyway, right?

If you really want your whisky cold, try using whisky rocks instead. They can be put in the refrigerator or freezer and, if manufactured properly, don't leave an aftertaste.

, Of course, if you're just a beginner, this may seem a bit odd. But many people consider whisky collecting a fun and enlightening hobby. Here are a couple things for you to consider when starting your own collection:


Buy what you enjoy drinking, not what you think will be worth big bucks later on. The whisky auction market is quite volatile. Prices fluctuate often. The best bet for collecting is to stick what you like; that way, if the price of whisky plummets in ten years, or doesn't outstrip inflation, you'll still be happy drinking your whisky.
Keep your receipts. Keep your receipts in the whisky bottle itself. It's a nice little reminder of what you paid, and helps you enjoy the whisky more once you finally decide to pop the cork.
Keep your stash in different places. If a snooping child or a devastating fire were to hit your stash, it pays to diversify. Don't keep your eggs all in one basket.

Prepare the flavouring for your shaved ice.,
Prepare ice.,
Shave your ice.,
Add your flavouring to your shaved ice.",How to Make Homemade Shaved Ice," There are all kinds of ways to prepare flavouring for your shaved ice. Some include melting sugary drinks, chopping up fruit, or even just using a favourite beverage. There are many ways you can prepare flavourings:



Use powdered drink mixes: The key to this type of flavouring is to have it come out very concentrated and very sweet. A simple way to do this is mix 2 cups of sugar and ¾ cup of water in a pan. Heat the mixture to a full boil and remove the pan from the heat. Then add the powdered drink mix like Kool-Aid into the liquid.

Cut up fruit: Fruits are great when paired with some sugary liquid like condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, or just plain sugar water. Use soft fruits cut into bite-sized squares like mangos, peaches, strawberries, berries, passion fruit, bananas, and kiwis.

Use syrups: You can purchase syrups specifically designed for shaved ice or snow cones. There are variety of flavours that you can drizzle onto your shaved ice.

Use beverages: You can simply pour in your favourite pop, juice, or coffee onto your shaved ice.;
, Whether you're using a shaved ice maker or a blender, you'll need to make or buy ice. Fill several ice trays with water, or any other liquid you want your shaved ice to taste like (and that can be frozen), and let them freeze overnight. Or purchase a bag of ice from your local grocery store.


Some stores may even sell ice shaved.

, You can purchase machines that make shaved ice or make your own shaved ice with a sturdy blender or food processor.


Create shaved ice with a blender by pressing the ""crush"" button for about a minute. If the mix is too thin, add more ice; if too thick, add more liquid. Crush ice thoroughly, then press blend until it is blended to your desired consistency.
If your ice cubes are too large, blend small amounts of ice thoroughly until you've created a powdered like consistency. It may be helpful to get a bag and crush the ice in it with a rolling pin beforehand.

, Put a few spoonfuls of shaved ice in a cup or bowl. Then simply pour your desired flavouring onto your shaved ice. You can also arrange your fruit on top of the ice and pour condensed milk or sugar water over your fruit.


Alternatively, you can add your flavouring into the blender or food processor to mix together.

Stir in 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of honey. Taste the water. Add more warm water if needed.Many people find that honey water with lemon helps them feel better when they have a cold.

, Add one teaspoon (five grams) of cinnamon to a mug. Cover it with one cup (240 milliliters) of hot water and stir. Wait 15 minutes, then stir in one tablespoon (15 grams) of honey, and enjoy., Cut a one inch (2.54 centimeters) segment of ginger into thin slices. Place these slices into a cup, and add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of hot water. Let the ginger steep for five minutes. Fill another mug with one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of lemon juice, and one teaspoon (five grams) of honey. Pour the ginger water through a strainer over the honey and lemon. Discard the ginger slices, and stir the honey lemon mixture with a spoon.If the water is not sweet enough for you, add a little more honey.
For an added kick, add one ounce (30 milliliters) of whiskey.Some people find that this drink helps soothe cold and flu symptoms.

, They are perfect for lemonades and iced teas.


If you will be using these ice cubes in lemonade, consider adding a squeeze of lemon into the honey water before you freeze it., Prepare some regular honey water first. Next, fill a tall glass with ice cubes. Pour the warm honey water over the ice. Stir the iced honey water, and enjoy it before the ice melts.


Pouring a warm drink into a new glass, over ice, helps it cool faster as opposed to just dumping a lot of ice cubes into the warm drink.

If you have something to say, wait until you have swallowed your last bite before jumping into the conversation., It is also a good idea to keep your mouth closed while you are chewing. The sound of food smacking in your mouth can be both annoying and distracting. In fact, the term misophonia describes a revulsion to loud chewing., There are some instances when it is acceptable to eat food with your hands, such as when eating pizza. However, it is never okay to grab food from communal dishes using your fingers. Instead, you should always use the serving utensils that are provided., This is especially true if they have not even taken a bite yet. If you are regretting your meal choice and one of your friends has been presented with a more appealing dish, you could say “Your pasta looks amazing!” If you are lucky, you friend will offer you a small sample., Some cultures follow different rules and table manners. For example, in some Asian cultures soup is eaten without using a spoon. Instead, the bowl is brought directly to the mouth.

Remove any remaining ice in the tray before refilling it.,
Fill the tray up just below the rim.,
Place flat in the freezer.,
Twist the tray gently to pop the cubes out.,
Consider upgrading your ice tray.",How to Make Ice1," Have you ever had the experience of cracked, uneven ice cubes when you try to remove them? That usually happens when room temperature water gets poured over already-frozen cubes. If you want all your ice to be even and consistent, only fill the tray when it's completely empty.


Rinse the tray out beforehand, to remove freezer sediment and little chunks. This also helps to warm up the tray slightly, resulting in more even cubes. Cubes will be easier to get out later if you do this.
If you you need to, empty the ice cubes into a Ziplock freezer bag, or store them in a bowl in the freezer. Easy fix.;
, When the water freezes, it expands. This is why the ice in your drink floats, even in a glass of water. When you make ice, try to account for the fact that the cubes will get a little bigger as they freeze, and don't overfill.Pro tip: If you want perfectly clear ice, instead of cloudy, boil the water first. When it cools, freeze it normally. The more times you boil, the more clear the ice when it freezes.

, For the best ice cubes, place your ice cube tray flat and even. Clear out any freezer bags or other items that might be in the freezer, and set the trays on a flat surface.


Don't stack ice cube trays on top of one another, if you can help it. Sometimes, you'll get weird cubes, or spill the water on the bottom of the freezer.
Freezers are usually set at 32 degrees F (0 C) or below.
In most freezers, water should freeze in about one to three hours, depending on the size of the cubes and the temperature of the freezer.

, After your cubes are frozen, turn the tray to make sure they're not liquid on the inside. To pop them out, you can usually just pry one up and out, or twist the tray very slightly to loosen them from the sides, then pull them out.


Sometimes, it takes some work to get the cubes loose from the sides of the tray. Don't start banging it around, though, or you'll crack the tray. Instead, run a bit of warm water in the tap and wet a cloth. Sit the ice cube tray on the cloth to melt the underside slightly. They'll pop right out.

, Ice cube trays come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and features. You can get an ice cube tray with a cover, to prevent freezer burn and crystals from forming on the top. You can get big cocktail ice trays and individual ice cube trays shaped like the Death Star from Star Wars. Get creative!


If you don't want to buy a tray, don't. Look around your kitchen from strangely-shaped objects you could fill with water. That lobster-shaped pan? Make a big lobster cube. Make a coffee-cup-shaped ice cube. Why not?

Choose the right tray.,
Wash the tray thoroughly.,

Allow the ice to freeze for several hours.,
Remove the cubes from the tray for storage.,
Fill the tray with fruit juice.,
Freeze coffee in the tray.,
Add herbs or fruit to the water in the tray.",How to Make Ice Cubes with an Ice Tray," Ice cube trays are available in several different materials, including plastic, silicone, and stainless steel. Choose the material that best fits your needs. You can also find trays that make cubes in a variety of shapes. A cube shape is obviously the classic option, but you may prefer a tray that makes heart, star, fish, or other novelty-shaped cubes for a party or special occasion.Plastic ice cube trays are usually the most inexpensive. However, they can have a tendency to crack when you remove the ice and may absorb scents from the freezer that affect the finished ice.
Silicone ice cube trays are durable and fairly easy to remove the cubes from. However, they usually absorb the most smells and flavors, which can lead to ill-smelling and tasting ice.
Stainless steel ice cube trays are usually the most durable, and they don’t absorb scents and flavors like plastic and silicone do. However, they’re usually the most costly trays.
However contrary to popular belief science has proven that a quality home-made wooden ice tray leads to superior ice cubes.;
, Even if your ice cube tray is brand new, it’s a good idea to wash it before you fill it. If it is a new tray, rinse it in a hot water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. If it’s an old tray, you should use hot water and dish detergent to wash it in order to remove any ice or food residue from the freezer.To ensure the best tasting and smelling ice, you may want to deodorize an old ice tray. Mix 2 teaspoons (10 g) of baking soda with ½ cup (120 ml) of warm water, and pour the solution into the tray. Scrub all of the compartments with a clean cloth and the solution, and rinse the tray with warm water.

, Once the tray is washed and dried, fill it with water. Try to pour the same amount of water into each compartment so the cubes will all freeze in the same amount of time.You can fill the tray with tap water from the faucet, but the impurities in the water can sometimes lead to poor tasting ice. They can also make finished ice cubes have a cloudy appearance.
Filtered or bottled water typically produces better tasting ice cubes than tap water.
Even if you use filtered or bottled water, your ice cubes may wind up looking cloudy. If you want crystal clear ice, it helps to boil the water first. Allow the water to cool, and then bring it to a boil a second time. Fill the tray with the water.
Filling your ice tray with hot water can also help the cubes freeze faster. That may seem strange, but there’s actually a scientific principle behind it known as the Mpemba effect.

, When the ice cube tray is filled, it’s time to put it in the freezer. Many freezers have an area that’s meant to hold ice cube trays, but if yours doesn’t, find a spot where the tray can sit on a flat surface to allow the cubes to freeze evenly.The back of the freezer tends to be the coldest, so try to place the tray as far back as you can.

, In order for the water to freeze into solid cubes, you’ll need to leave the tray in the freezer for approximately six hours. For best results, however, leave the tray in the freezer overnight.The amount of time that it takes the cubes to freeze depends on several factors, such as how crowded your freezer is and how much you filled the individual compartments in the tray.

, When the ice cubes have frozen solid in the tray, you should remove them. Storing them in the tray exposes them to the scents and tastes in your freezer, which can lead to poor tasting ice. Pop the cubes out of the tray, and store them in an airtight freezer bag or plastic container.Some ice cube trays come with a cover. If yours had a lid, you can store the cubes in the tray.
You shouldn’t leave ice cubes in the freezer for more than a week even if they’re in an airtight container. Make a fresh batch if your ice is old.

, If you don’t want the ice cubes to water down your lemonade, iced tea, soda, or other sweet drinks, you may want to replace the water in your ice cube tray. Fill the tray with your favorite fruit juice to make flavorful ice that won’t dilute your drinks., If you enjoy iced coffee drinks, you probably aren’t a fan of how the ice can water down the drink. Instead of using traditional ice cubes, fill your tray with coffee to ensure that the last sip of your coffee is as delicious as the first.To avoid wasting coffee, use the leftover amount in your morning pot to make the ice cubes.

, If you want decorative ice cubes for a party or other special event, try suspending fruit, herbs, or edible flowers in your cubes. Add water to the tray to fill the compartments halfway, and freeze them for 20 to 30 minutes. Add the fruit, herbs leaves, or flowers of your choice, and fill the compartments the rest of the way with water before freezing fully.Fruits that work well for decorative cubes include raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries, watermelon.
Herbs such as basil and mint are ideal for “fillings” for ice cubes.

Mix in coconut water.",How to Make Flavored Water," Wash 1–3 citrus fruits per quart (liter). Slice into thin rounds and leave in cold water for at least three hours. If you plan to leave it in longer for more intense flavor, cut off the rinds first to avoid bitter flavors.See below for a step-by-step guide covering all fruit and herb recipes.
Try adding ¼ cup (60mL) mint or basil leaves.;
, Use about 1 cup (240mL) fruit per quart (liter) water. Fresh berries won't infuse well until they're crushed with a wooden spoon. Frozen berries are already broken, but you may crush further to speed things up. Infuse for three hours or more, then strain.


This combines well with the juice of half a lemon.

, Slice a cucumber into thin rounds and add to a pitcher of water. Let steep overnight, then drink within a day or two.Optionally, cut the whole cucumber in half lengthwise and scoop out the pulp before slicing.
Enhance this mild flavor with three or four slices of lemon or cubes of pineapple.

, This sophisticated combination is subtle, but delicious. Try 1 cup (240mL) blackberries per quart (liter), plus a handful of sage leaves., Apple and other hard fruits don't seep flavor as quickly as others. Slice very thinly and infuse for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. An hour before serving, transfer to room temperature for added flavor., Follow one of the recipes above, or just choose your favorite fruit. You can play around with the amounts, but start with several small fruits per quart (liter), or 1–2 cups (240–480mL) berries or cubed fruit.


Fresh fruit in season has the best flavor. Frozen fruit won't look as attractive, but may have more flavor than out-of-season fresh fruit., Rub all fresh fruit thoroughly under cool, running water. Since the peel will be sitting in the water, scrubbing contaminants off the surface is extra important.


If the fruit is not organic, consider peeling it to remove pesticides on the surface.
This is not necessary for frozen fruit.

, Round will infuse more quickly on their own, if they are weighed down underneath ice cubes. Wedges may not add much flavor unless you muddle the fruit as described below.


Slice rounds in half for a narrow pitcher.
No slicing is necessary for berries or cubed fruit.

, Drop your fruit into a pitcher of chilled or room temperature water. If you dislike the taste of your tap water, put it through a filtration device before adding fruit.


Hot water will infuse with flavor more quickly, but turns the fruit into mush and may destroy some nutrients., Crushing the fruit will speed up the infusion significantly, but you may end up with a murky, pulpy mixture. For a more attractive pitcher, squeeze some of the juice out using a wooden spoon handle, pressing and twisting but not pulverizing the fruit completely.Leave the fruit untouched if you can wait a few hours.


Alternatively, leave whole slices in for decoration, but squeeze in the juice of one fruit to add more flavor.
To flavor a single glass of water for immediate drinking, pulverize the fruit with a muddling stick.

, Mint and basil are the most common options, but you can use rosemary, sage, or just about any other herb. Rinse the leaves, then rub them between clean hands to bruise them slightly before adding to the water.


You can add dried herbs, but place them in a tea strainer so they don't leave fragments in the drink.

, Besides chilling the water, ice weighs down fruit that floats to the top, and filters out some of the fruit pieces while pouring.

, Chill the water in the refrigerator for 3–4 hours, or up to 12 hours for extra-potent flavor. To avoid bacteria and unpleasant flavors, strain out ingredients after 12 hours and drink within three days.Stir before serving.


The water will infuse faster at room temperature, but also decompose faster. Steep for 1–2 hours, and drink within 4–5 hours of mixing.

, Let your fruit sit in the same pitcher as a tea bag or tea strainer. Keep this at room temperature, so the tea infuses without overpowering the other flavors. Steep for 1–3 hours, remove tea, and drink immediately. Try these recipes, adding each one to a quart (liter) of water:


Black tea bag, three mandarin oranges, four basil leaves, black tea bagTwo green tea bags, ½ mango (sliced), ¼ cup (60mL) strawberries

, Add a stick of cinnamon, a tablespoon (15mL) fresh grated ginger, and/or ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract. These work particularly well in tangy recipes. Try the following:


½ cup (120mL) cubed pineapple, ½ sliced orange, 1 tbsp (15mL) grated ginger1 cup (240mL) blueberries, ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract

, Make your own soda replacement with low sugar and no artificial sweeteners.

, Replace ¼ of your water with coconut water. Try infusing with peaches or honeydew melon.


You may use coconut milk instead, but the thicker, richer drink may be more difficult to balance with fruit.

Arrive on time.,
Disclose food allergies or aversions well ahead of time.,
Don’t bring a plus-one without permission.,
Present yourself in a clean, well-dressed manner.,
Bring a small gift.,
Ignore your phone.,
Carry on polite conversation.,
Thank your host for a lovely evening.",How to Be Polite at a Dinner2," Your host will want to serve the dinner hot and arriving late might delay the meal. As a general rule, you should try to arrive within 15 minutes of the requested start time. Do not show up too early. Your host may still be getting ready and it is a nuisance if someone shows up ahead of schedule.If you arrive early walk around the block a few times or read in your car until the scheduled arrival time.
If you are going to be tardy, text or call the host in advance and tell them your estimated arrival time. If you are going to be over an hour late, tell the host to begin the evening without you and apologize.

, If you are invited over to a friend's for dinner, you should always tell them about any food allergies or taste preferences in advance. Your friend would much rather plan their meal around your allergy, than feel guilty that you are unable to eat anything on the night of.

For instance, if you don't eat pork for religious reasons, or any type of meat on moral grounds, your should communicate this to the host in advance.
You could also offer to bring something along to make it easier for your friend to accommodate your dietary needs.

, If you have been invited over to a friend’s house for dinner, never show up with an additional guest who was not invited. Instead, if you would like your new partner to accompany you to a dinner party, call the host in advance to make sure this is alright. In most cases, your friend will gladly lay out another table setting., Your clothes should make you feel comfortable and confident. Make sure you know the atmosphere and theme in advance. For example, arriving in shorts when the other guests are wearing tuxedos and evening dresses does not make a good impression and you will likely feel uncomfortable and out of place all evening.

, A great gift for the host can range from a bottle of wine, to a bouquet of flowers, to an edible treat, such as fresh jams or chocolates. A gift is a nice way to thank the host for having you over for dinner and signals your appreciation.If you are invited to a casual dinner, such as a backyard barbecue or a close friend or relative's house, you could ask if there is anything you could contribute to the meal. For example, you could make a side-dish or a dessert.
In some instances a host will inform guests not to bring any gifts; if this is the case, you should respect the wishes of the host.

, It is extremely rude to spend your evening texting other people or checking your social media accounts. Instead, you should engage in the conversation. By constantly checking your phone, you are signaling to the host and other guests that you are bored or would rather be somewhere else.There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you receive an emergency call from the babysitter, for example, you can quietly duck out of the room for a few minutes to take the call.

, Talk, but try to keep your voice peaceful and polite. Do not interrupt others. Instead, let them talk and show that you are listening by nodding along and keeping eye contact. Ask questions about the host, the food, and other guests. This is the best way to demonstrate that you are engaged and enjoying the company!Avoid sensitive topics of conversations, such as politics, religion, and sex.
Instead, stick to relatable topics like work, kids, hobbies, or vacations.

, Before leaving for the evening, you should always thank your host for the delicious meal. You can even take this one step further and reciprocate the gesture by inviting the host to dine at your house next time. This is a great way to demonstrate your appreciation.If you forget to say thank-you at the end of the night, you can always send the host an email the following day.

Place your napkin in your lap.,
Use cutlery in the proper order.,
Begin eating once all meals are served.,
Taste the food before seasoning.,
Don’t reach across the table.,
Scoop soup away from you.,
Excuse yourself before leaving the table.",How to Be Polite at a Dinner3," Before you begin eating, unfold your napkin and place it across your lap. This way no food will drop onto your clothing while you are eating. You should never tuck your napkin into the front of your shirt or dress when engaging in a fine dining experience., At a very formal dinner, you may notice three sets of cutlery around your plate. Forks will be positioned to the left of your plate, spoons will be above your plate, and knives will be to the right of your plate. Always work your way inwards with each dish. This means that the cutlery positioned farthest from your plate should be used for the first course.If you are still unsure of which utensils to use first, watch what other people at the table are doing and follow their lead.

, It is rude to begin eating while other people at your table are still waiting for their food to be served. The only exception to this rule is if the host requests that you begin eating, or if your fellow diners tell you to start eating before your food gets cold., Most chefs pride themselves on perfectly seasoning their dishes. As a result, it can be seen as a rude gesture to season your food before tasting it. At some high end restaurants there will not even be salt and pepper available on the table. Always taste the food first and then determine if you would like some added seasoning., If you can't reach the bread basket or table seasoning, do not reach across the table to fetch it yourself. Instead, you should politely ask someone to pass it to you. Try saying something along these lines: “Excuse me, Jim. Could you please pass me the table salt?”, When eating soup, keep the bowl on the table and dip your spoon into the centre of the bowl. Then, scoop the soup moving the spoon away from you, towards the farthest side of the bowl. Bring the spoon to your mouth and sip the soup off of the spoon.Try not to make a slurping noise as you eat your soup.

, If you need to leave the table to go to the washroom, make a quick phone call, or touch up your make-up, that is understandable. Simply stand up, place your napkin on your chair and say “please excuse me.” You don’t need to give any details about why you wish to leave the table, but you should never try to sneak off without excusing yourself first.If you have to leave early and will not be returning, you should give a brief explanation and apologize to the guests before departing.

Make coffee cubes.,
Freeze your favorite fruit juice.,
Make your own popsicles.,
Add berries or other fruit.,
Freeze chopped mint, basil, or other herbs.,
Add food coloring for fun.",How to Make Ice2," Iced coffee is great with regular ice, but it's even better with coffee cubes. Next time you let a pot of morning brew sit too long, pour it into a clean ice cube tray and let it freeze. Next time you want to have iced coffee, drop a few of those into it. Delicious.


These also go great in mixed drinks and cocktails, or as an addition to chocolate milk.
If you don't like coffee, try freezing herbal tea, lemonade, or any drink you prefer.

, Another delicious addition to a fruity cocktail or mixed drink is a fruit-juice ice cube. Freeze cranberry cocktail cubes and add it to your iced tea. Freeze pineapple-mango juice to pop into your next smoothie. This is a great way to spice up any drink.


Generally, citrus juices don't work quite as well as other fruit juices and cocktails. Anything based in apple or grape juice works really well.

, In the summer time, a good way to save money is to make popsicles in the fridge yourself. Mix up a batch of you favorite Kool-Aid flavor or other fruit drink and pop it not the ice cube tray. About halfway through, stick toothpicks into the centers, or just pop them out and let the kids eat them outside.


You can also get molds made specifically for making popsicles, which have plastic holders that you can reuse. They're a lot of fun for kids.

, One great visual treat is to add a single blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, or grape to each section of the ice cube tray and then cover them with water. Squeeze a little lemon juice or lemonade onto the fruit, then cover with water, or the fruit juice of your choice. These make great little additions to any mixed drink, or just a plain glass of water.

, If your garden goes crazy with herbs, a great way to save them for later in the season is to chop up the herbs finely, then pack them into an empty ice cube tray and cover with a small amount of water. When they freeze up, pop them out and keep them in a freezer bag.


These are great for cooking later in the season. You can toss a cube of basil into a soup pot, or toss a cube or mint into a big pitcher of fresh iced tea.
You could also do this with sage, thyme, parsley, cilantro, or any combination of herbs you regularly use.

, While it won't really add any flavor to the cubes, it can be fun to add a drop of food coloring to individual sections on the ice cube tray and let them freeze. It's a fun project for kids, and makes a plain water glass a lot more fun.

Understand the basic components of an ice maker.,
Be gentle with the dispenser arm.,
Change the settings every so often.,
Keep your freezer above -20 F (-4 C).,
Clean the ice bin.,
Finished.

",How to Make Ice3," If your refrigerator automatically makes ice, your job is a whole lot easier. It's still good to understand how to maintain the components, though, to keep it in good working order. All refrigerators are slightly different, but most of them have the same basic components:


The Dispenser. This is where the ice comes from, and is usually operated by pressing a button, or pushing a glass against a lever. Some refrigerators have different settings.
The Freezer. Ice is frozen by cooling coils in the freezer, then routed through the dispenser. Maintaining your freezer and setting it at the proper temperature is important for the life of the ice maker.
The Ice Maker. Usually, ice makers are just small freezing units in the freezer, sometimes with a little metal control arm you can put up or down, to control whether or not ice is made. These typically have water filters that you can change every couple months.

, Jamming your glass into it can make the dispenser malfunction. If you notice the water or ice coming out seems to be erratic, check the dispenser port for signs of buildup and clean it with a clean cloth, if necessary.


If you have very hard water, mineral deposits will often form around the dispenser. This is normal, and can be cleaned off gently with a brush and some vinegar.

, If you have an ice dispenser that makes cubed ice, crushed ice, and all sorts of other options, it's important to toggle between them a few times a week, to keep the machine in good order.If you're not using it, frost and ice particles can build up and make the dispenser malfunction.

, Any colder that that, and ice will start to build up on the components of the ice maker, increasing the chance that something will malfunction.


If you see ice forming in your freezer, it could be because water is leaking from the freezing unit, and you need to check to make sure the ice maker is sealed and installed properly. Make sure the water lines are straight and connected properly, and that your freezer isn't too full of items.
Most newer ice makers will defrost regularly, but if you've got an older one, you may need to defrost your freezer every couple of months to keep the ice maker functioning properly. Ideally, twice a year is perfect.

, Every now and then, it's a good idea to remove the ice from the ice bin in the freezer, and turn off the ice maker. With a clean towel, wipe out the inside of the tray, and check the feeler arm to make sure everything is still working properly. This should help eliminate sediment and other little particles from your ice cubes.


Don't store anything in the ice bin. Some people like to toss things directly into the ice that the maker creates, which can mess up the levels of the device.

Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of juice into a bowl.,
Stir in 4 packets of unflavored gelatin, then let the gelatin bloom.,
Microwave the mixture until the gelatin melts.,
Stir in the sugar and the rest of the juice.,
Prepare your mold.,
Pour the mixture into your mold.,
Allow the gelatin to set in the fridge.,
Cut the gelatin into cubes, then remove the gelatin.",How to Make Gelatin Ice Cubes2," You can also use a 4-cup (950-milliliter) measuring cup instead. For something that looks more ice-like, use a clear or blue-colored juice.You can also use water if you do not care about the flavor.


These gelatin ice cubes are merely cut to look like ice. They are perfect for winter themed parties or desserts where you need something that looks like ice.
You can also try to use a clear soda., Tear open 4 packets of clear, unflavored gelatin, and add them to the water. Give the mixture a brief stir. Wait for the gelatin to bloom. This will take about 5 minutes., Make sure that the bowl or measuring cup you are using is safe to use in the microwave. If it isn't, pour it into a container that is. Heat the mixture in the microwave until the gelatin dissolves. This will take about 1 minute on HIGH., Add in the sugar first. Give it a stir until it dissolves completely. Add in the rest of the juice/water, and stir it again. Keep stirring until the color is consistent., You can use a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 30.02-centimeter) glass pan or an ice cube tray. Spray your mold of choice with cooking spray. This will make the cubes easier to pop out.If you are using a silicone ice cube tray, then you can skip this step.


Use a regular ice cube tray with wells that are shaped like cubes. This will make them look more like ice cubes. Save the novelty trays that are shaped like fish, hearts, stars, dinosaurs, etc. for another project.

, If you used an ice cube tray, you may have leftover gelatin. You can pour it into a smaller baking tray or another ice cube tray, but be sure to spray it with cooking spray first.

, This will take about 1 hour.Again, these gelatin ice cubes will remain jiggly; they will not be solid like real ice cubes.

, Aim to make the cubes about ice cube sized, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) square. You can also make them rectangular instead. If the cubes are stuck to the pan, you can try soaking the bottom of the pan in warm water for a few minutes.


If you used an actual ice cube tray, you can leave the cubes as they are after popping them out, or you can cut them into smaller cubes.

Feel free to ask your hosts questions about Judaism.,
If your friends are Orthodox Jews, don't expect hugs, kisses, and handshakes from the women if you're a man, because touch (even something considered ""casual contact"" in the non-observant world, such as a handshake) is a form of intimacy and therefore, reserved for spouses and immediate family only (children, parents, siblings).,
Dress appropriately.,
If it's Shabbat, ritual handwashing will be done, and there will be blessings for Shabbat candles, wine, challah (bread), children, and guests.,
If it's Passover, (the feast of unleavened bread) matzah is served in place of bread, and no regular flour-containing items will be served.,
Watch what everyone is saying and doing, and don't talk, eat, and drink until everyone else does.",How to Be a Respectful Non Jewish Guest at a Jewish Holiday Dinner," Also note that your participation in Jewish customs, as led by your hosts, does not obligate you to anything in any way, nor will it nullify or ""de-commit"" you from your own spiritual path. Many non-Jews are open-minded to learning about how Jews live.;
, For the same reason, if you are a woman, do not expect hugs, kisses, or handshakes from Orthodox men.

, If it's an Orthodox Jewish home, and you're a woman, wear a modest (covers elbows, knee-length or longer hemline, no exposed decolletage), dressy dress, or blouse and skirt. If you're a man, wear a suit and tie, and you're likely to receive a kippah (skullcap) for your head. If it's NOT an Orthodox home, business casual clothes are likely appropriate.

, Depending on the level of observance, there may be further discussion for you to participate in centered around the biblical narrative for the week (after a brief description of the narrative is given- comments and opinions welcome), and singing. Shabbat is the celebration of The Creation and the Jews' (and humanity's) place in it- completed in 6 days, with G-d resting (and commanding the Jews also to rest) on the 7th day. A festive meal and drinks are served.

, Be prepared to spend at least 2 to 4 hours at the dining room table (you may want to eat a significant snack before you go- the full meal isn't served for an hour or two after your arrival), because Passover is the holiday in which the Jews were freed from slavery in Egypt, and the story itself is read from a Haggadah (Jewish book) along with prayers and songs.

, A good host will help guide you (and be reminding everyone else at the table- it's part of the culture to continuously explain what's going on and why), so relax and enjoy!

Look the part.,
Choose a suitable outfit.,
Sit properly.",How to Act at a Formal Dinner or Fancy Restaurant," If you have long hair consider having your hair up, a less popular, but practical and sleeker option. Although down-dos are more common, up-dos are simple, neat, and stylish. Up-dos will not only make your hair stand out amid combed out hairdos, but keep it clear of your face as you eat. Your nails should be manicured: clean, cut and if painted, coloured to match your outfit. If you put makeup on, highlight either your eyes or your lips, or go for a more natural look. Less is more.;
, Dress codes can be difficult to navigate, so be sure you know what it is. For a restaurant, check their website. For a dinner party, look at the invitation. If you are still in the dark, ask your host or a friend who you know is going. The best bet if you are unsure is a jacket and tie or a chiffon dress to the knee. If you are carrying a handbag match your bag with your shoes.

, Cross your legs at the heels with your knees together and ankles tucked back, this is especially important when wearing skirts and dresses.

Walk slowly.,

Hold the cup or plate with both hands.,
Don't carry drinks on an empty stomach.,
Know which hand is steady and for what things.,
Know your limits.,
Carry a cafeteria tray with one forearm under the tray.",How to Avoid Spilling," Scientists have found that a cup of coffee just happens to be the right size to set up waves when we walk.The faster one walks, the quicker and stronger the waves. You know what happens next—flying coffee! By walking slower, the sympathetic resonances are decreased, and your drink stays where it belongs.;
, Keep your eye on your drink, not your feet. This not only helps you walk slower, by focusing on your drink you are constantly aware and making adjustments for any sloshing that's going on.

, The slower you start moving, the less the drink in your cup will start sloshing. By not dashing from here to there, you make it easier to keep your drink in the cup, and not on the ground. Be alert for others in the area, since a bump or even a close call can result in an accident.

, This makes it easier to control. Make several trips instead of trying to carry a plate in one hand and a glass in the other.

, Have a snack, or drink some juice and eat some fruit if you are going to an event where you're to have food. Holding anything on an empty stomach can be extra difficult.

, If you're using one hand to carry a beverage, use your steady hand. If you're using two hands, use the steady hand to control the sloshing, and the other hand as support.

, Soup is nearly impossible to carry on a cafeteria tray if you have a hand tremor. Avoid it or soak a piece of bread in it.

, Your forearm can be much steadier than your hands. Also, either avoid putting tall drinks on a cafeteria tray or hold both the tray and the drink with one of your hands.

,, When you have finished eating, place them side by side in the center of the plate.

, In the event of being presented with a dish which you feel unable to eat, it is polite to at least make some attempt to do so.

Pick up the first chopstick and place it between your middle finger and the base of your thumb.,
Grip the second chopstick with your index finger and thumb.,
Practice opening and closing the chopsticks.,
Start picking up food!",How to Eat with Chopsticks1," This one is your anchor -- it should not move. Stiffen your hand for a firm grip. Have the broad end of the chopstick lay in the crook of your hand, where your thumb and pointer finger connect. Rest the narrow end between the base of your thumb and the side of your index finger. It should be virtually immobile. It's similar to how you hold a pen, but a bit lower.


Some may prefer to hold the chopstick on the side of their ring finger, with the tip of their ring finger holding it in place. This frees the middle finger to hold the other chopstick more securely and provides that one with more control. It is a more formal approach.;
, This is the stick that moves. Place your thumb over the side of the second chopstick, so it rests above the first. Adjust your grip to a more comfortable position. Make sure the narrow tips of the chopsticks are even with each other to help prevent them from crossing or being unable to ""pinch"" the food.

To get them even, you can tap them on the table. Uneven chopsticks will be very difficult to use.

, Make sure the broad ends of the chopsticks do not make an ""X"" as this will make it difficult to pick up food. Is only the top one moving? Great!

If it helps, move your hand up and down the chopsticks, but maintaining the same position, experimenting with levels of grip. Some find it easier to maneuver closer to the base, others further up.

, Working from a 45° angle may be easiest right now. Once you have it steady, lift 'er up. If it feels unstable, put it down and try again.

When eating rice, be willing to dig in.",How to Eat with Chopsticks2," Often at Asian dining tables (whether at home or at a restaurant) means sharing large plates of food. It's not proper to dive in to the communal meal with chopsticks that have just been in your mouth! You have two options:

Use a public pair of serving chopsticks that never touch your own (or anybody else's) bowl of rice/food
Pick with the other (non-eating) end of your chopsticks. That's the broad end that hopefully you're not chewing on!

, The rules of chopsticking don't end once you have the food in your mouth, unfortunately. Each society has slightly different rules, but in general:

Don't stick your chopsticks upright in your food. It's looked at as a bad omen and is reminiscent of incense at funerals.
Don't spear your food with the ends of your chopsticks. If all else fails, it may seem like a good alternative, but it's viewed as impolite.
Don't pass food from chopstick to chopstick. Also funeral protocol and viewed as bad (or even ominous) table behavior.
Don't cross your chopsticks. If you're done eating, lay them to the side of your dish on the left.
Don't point at people with your chopsticks. Pointing in general is a no-no in Asian cultures and same goes with chopsticks.

This page would be far too long if all the rules were listed. These are the basics.



, If a bowl of rice is placed in front of you and all you have are two small bamboo rods, you may feel like you're up a creek without a paddle. But it's perfectly acceptable (normal, rather) to lift the bowl of rice close to your mouth and work from there. You won't look foolish, you'll look seasoned!

You may feel a little like the Beast during his dinner with Belle, but rest assured, this is how it's done. Don't shovel the rice into your mouth like a caveman, but do lift up the bowl near to you to prevent rice drippings from accumulating around your eating area.

Japan has slightly stricter rules regarding this. If you're in China or Vietnam, for example, you may be able to shovel away."

Remember, there are places in the world where tipping is not compulsory.",How to Be a Good Patron when Dining at a Restaurant," The expectations here depend on what country you live in. In the US, tipping a server less than 15-20% is a strong statement and has a big financial impact on them; most, if not all, servers in this country are being paid an hourly wage of less than the country's minimum wage because they are required to claim tips as a source of their income (usually marking them around $5/hour). Therefore servers need your tips to pay for their bills and to tip out others in the restaurant for their duties to the server (bussers, bartenders, food-runners, etc.).


By not tipping the standard 20% in the US, you are severely hurting this server's financial standing. It is not fair to the server to do this. The old rule of thumb that has been passed through the grapevine, that you can just double the tax of the final bill is far from the truth and almost always falls far below the recommended 20% minimum tip you should be giving to your server. (Refer to the ""Tip Tutorial"" below for the correct tipping process).;
, Do not complain about where you're sitting in a restaurant, most especially if you've already been waiting an extended period of time for a table. This is about your food's quality, timeliness, or what you were expecting from it. These types of complaints should come only if something is truly unbearable and should not be used to the patron's advantage in getting something free or extra simply because they know they can take advantage of that system.

, Snapping, waving, hand raising, or flagging down a server to get their attention is extremely rude and a sign of impatience. Unless the server has neglected your table for an excessive amount of time, there is no need to get their attention in this way.


Be patient and polite. The restaurant might be busy, and your server will come back to your table in a timely manner (when they have all other duties with other tables completed). There is no way that whatever you are going to request from them cannot wait a few more seconds. In addition, there is no way that you need it at that specific and exact moment in time, and need to disrespectfully wave them over for it.

, The server may be in demand, running back and forth. As a guest, you have the power to control how much a server is doing this. Keep in mind that you are not the server's only responsibility, so when you continuously make requests for the server to refill or bring you something, you are making it much harder for that server to abide to those other responsibilities. Have an idea of what you want server to do when they check in on your table, and don't have them make multiple unnecessary trips for each table visit they provide to you. Combine all requests into one trip visit for the server, so they don't need to keep coming back.

, Sitting at a table for an extended period of time after you have paid with the server, or sitting at a table for a long time while waiting for the rest of your party to file in, is very hurtful to your server's earnings. The server can't ""flip"" that table to a new round of customers when you do this; therefore he or she can't make any more money when you take up their table.

, Don't say ""...well they did it for us last time"" because the servers know how the restaurant runs. It is not proper to dupe the workers into believing you by saying that, just because you want to get what you want.

, This gauge of respect is no different in the server-patron relationship as it is in any other kind of interpersonal relationship. Your server is required to give you the utmost respect at the table, and strives to do so. It is only fair to give them the same back when you are their guest. Do not be pretentious or condescending to a server because you think they are lower than you on the totem pole of humanity.

, These words are ones we have all been taught since we were little, and are really easy to say. These words include ""please"" when asking for something, ""thank you"" when something is given to you or being done for you or ""take your time"" when you can see that the restaurant/server is busy. It is suggested that you talk to the server as you would a guest in your mother-in-law's home. In other words, you should never act like something is owed to you simply because your butt is in a seat at a restaurant. This comes off as arrogant and is very unpleasant to have to wait on.

, Compliments are always acceptable and appreciated. Never think that by complimenting a server to their face or to a manager is a waste of time or is something that no one cares about anymore. Whether you're applauding the server directly about their performance, or you are pulling a manager to the side and telling them about how enjoyable your server was, it is always greatly appreciated by servers and managers alike. It is a good feeling for a server to hear this and honestly boosts their performance for the rest of the night.

, A life of a server is one that can be very robotic and brainless at times because they need to say the same 5-10 things at a table to be acceptable and friendly to their tables. To break this chain, you can simply just try to talk and get to know your server a little more than just knowing their first name that they told you when they greeted the table. Even if it means simply telling them that your grandson has the same first name as them, or telling them that they look like someone you know.


Try asking questions that many people see as cliché conversation starters. Questions include ""where are you from?"", ""do you go to school?"", and ""what is your major?"" Keep in mind the apparent age of the server. Even these basic human interactions make it that much easier and enjoyable for the server to come back to your table time after time. And it breaks that brainless robotic server chain of just flipping tables, and get it to a more personal and humanistic level, which is beneficial for the guest and the server alike.

, Waiting on children can also be the most challenging part of being a server due to the parenting accompanied with this child. Telling your child to give the server eye contact, and to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when they order is great.


Make sure your child knows that making a mess of the table or floor, shouting across the restaurant and running around busy gangways are all unacceptable behaviors. When a parent does all of these things - and, simply put, is a parent - it not only makes that child's visit to the restaurant better, it makes the server's experience with your specific table joyous.

, A server will never rush you and your party into ordering quickly. But when a server comes to your table and asks ""all ready to order?"", and you, as a group, respond with ""yes"", then that order should be ready. Have the item and all of its modifications that you are ordering ready when you say that you are ready. Don't say you are ready to order when you are not. When it's your turn to order, don't ask a plethora of questions, or simply not know what you want to order.

, When you are done with a plate, whether it is a bread plate, an appetizer plate, a share plate, a dessert plate, an entrée plate, or empty cups, just help get them off of the table when your server comes over to clear the table. No one like to sit with a mound of dirty plates and cups in front of them, and the server knows this.


One of a server's duties is to pre-bus a table, meaning he/she clears off as many finished cups and plates from the table each time they come back to check up on you. Help yourself and your server by stacking plates, handing them to a server, and putting dirty/finished cups and plates at the edge of the table.

,


Calculator - Type in 34.65 (total bill) and multiple it by .20(20%) = 6.93. This number is the equivalent to $6.93 and is exactly a 20% tip on this bill.
Mental Maths - When doing mental maths to figure out a tip total, it is easiest to simply look at the check's first primary number(s) and just multiply by 2, which is the gauge for 20% tip. This check has a 3 for its primary digit, and 3 x 2 comes to 6. This is less than the tip we have above when using the calculator, so this is where the rounding process comes in to play. If the 2nd number of the total is a 5 or above you need to round up and add one more dollar. Since this check, when rounded up, equals $35 (or 3.5 for your mental maths sake). You will now do 3.5 x 2 instead of the 3 x 2. That will give you a 7 dollar tip (which is essentially equal to the 6.93 we got when using the calculator).

, 27.32 x .20 (20%) = 5.464. Using correct rounding this would be a $5.50 tip.


For the mental maths approach: Simply do 2.7 (primary digit) x 2 (20%) and you come to 5.4. You break that down to a tip and that come to $5.40. Now this is just a rule of thumb as a patron, you can either leave it at the $5.40 or round it up to an easier number and come to $6.00
The idiot's guide to mental maths for this example (that applies to any other example) : round the 2.7 up to the easy number of 3. Do the first number of this multiplied by 2 (20%): 3 x 2 = $6. This idiot's guide to mental maths is the easiest approach.

, So the primary number of this bill, since the bill is 121 and is triple digits, is now 2 numbers instead of one number as shown in the first two examples. That number being 12 in this instance. So just do the same approach as the 1st two examples and do your bill's 1st number, which in this case is 12 and multiply it by 2 (20% tip) and you come to 24. Therefore you should leave a minimum of $24 for your server on this bill.


Use a calculator. So 121.38 x .20= 24.276. Which equals the $24 we came to with your much easier and quicker mental maths approach.

, However, the number following it is another 6, so you can round your primary digit up to 7. Then multiply 7 x 2 (20% tip) and come to 14. The tip you'd leave for this bill would be $14. That's simple!

, Do that primary digit, 23, and multiply it by 2 (20%) and you get 46. The tip you would leave for this bill would be $46.

, 7 x 2=$14. And there you have it. You would leave a $14 tip for this check.

, You are not obligated to tip in the UK. Tips in some places are a reward for a job well done and not a top up to a meagre wage.

Tip your US server at least 15 percent.,
Use math to figure out the tip.,
Check whether the tip is already included.",How to Tip Your Server at a Restaurant1," The baseline for how much you should tip your server in the United States is at least 15 percent when eating in a restaurant. However, this is generally considered the minimum. If you leave anything less than this, it’s likely the server will be very offended.


Be aware that tipping only the basic 15 percent is considered a statement that the service was just average or OK to some servers. Consider tipping more if you thought the service was better than average.
Consider tipping 20 percent if the service was good, 25 percent if the service was great, and 30 percent if the service was exceptional.Some people believe you should also tip $2 for each person at the table if that amount is higher than the tip percentage would be.;
, Some people struggle to figure out how much 15 percent is exactly. You can use an easy math shortcut to determine the amount you need to leave!


To figure out the tip, you will need to do a simple mathematical equation. Some suggest rounding the bill up to the nearest $10 before figuring out the tip on the total.Move the decimal point to the left on your final bill amount. That’s 10 percent. So, if your bill is $55.00, 10 percent is $5.50. To figure out 15%, take half of $5.50 and add it to the $5.50. Thus, 15 percent would be $8.25.
To calculate 20 percent, shift the decimal point on your bill amount to the left. Round up. For example, $35.84 would become $3.58. Remember, that’s 10 percent. Then, double the number to get 20 percent.

, There will be some circumstances where the tip will already be factored into your bill. In those cases, you don’t need to tip again.


Typically, the gratuity will be 15 or 18 percent when it’s automatically included. Some restaurants have a rule that the tip is automatically included when large groups dine. It will usually say “gratuity included” on your bill or the menu in those cases.
This is done because if even one or two people in the group were to skimp on the tip, the server would be unlikely to make the basic amount.
Large groups are very time consuming for a server and more work. You should ask in advance or check the menu or restaurant website to see if the gratuity is included.

"
"
Tip other restaurant staff.,
Use a tip generating app.,
Realize why tipping matters.,
Leave a smaller tip for very poor service.,
Tell your server if the service was great.",How to Tip Your Server at a Restaurant2," If your waiter or waitress is not the only person who’s served you in some way, it’s customary to tip the other servers, too.


For example, if you received the benefit of a wine steward, it’s customary to also tip 15 percent the cost of the bottle of wine.
You can tip the coatroom attendant about $1 per coat or $2 for the parking valet or garage attendant, if you’ve left your car with them while dining. You can leave a smaller tip to your restaurant server if the food is served buffet style or the server brings you drinks only, but you should still tip between 10 and 15 percent.
Some restaurants have washroom attendants; tip them 50 cents to $1. You might want to tip the headwaiter or captain separately also. When buying something over a counter, say morning coffee, you are generally not expected to tip.

, You can download apps to your smart phone that will calculate the tip for you if you plug in the amount of your bill.


Most smart phones also come with a calculator, which will allow you to calculate the tip yourself, depending on the amount you decide to leave.
Various websites will calculate the tip for you. All you have to do is plug in the amount of your bill, and the percentage amount of the tip you want to leave.In some states, the sales tax is about 5 percent. If that’s the case, you could multiply the sales tax listed on your bill by three in order to get 15 percent.
If you used any coupons or discounts, calculate the tip based on how much you would've paid without it. Otherwise, you're punishing the waiter for the restaurant management's efforts to bring you in the door.

, Many servers absolutely rely on tips to survive. The fact they receive tips is calculated into a lower hourly wage in the first place.


It’s not uncommon for servers to make just over $2 an hour before they receive tips. They often make well under minimum wage. Although American states have different minimum wages, the federal minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is just $2.13.Some servers also are required to share or pool their tips at the end of the night or to contribute for tips to bartenders, lowering their overall haul.
You are not legally required to leave a tip, however you’re being very unfair to your server if you do not do so., There’s no upside in being a jerk, but if you truly received awful service, you shouldn’t feel obligated to leave a full tip.


Try communicating with the server first, though, about what’s making you unhappy to give the server a chance to fix it. A tip to a server is meant to acknowledge good service.
If your server ignored you, had a bad attitude, or served your food late, it’s OK to not leave a full tip. Assess how the food matched your order, whether the food was hot and fresh, how attentive the server was, how quickly your empty dishes were removed, and whether the server was courteous.
You might want to explain the lack of a tip, in nice and constructive terms, on the bill when you pay the check, though. Some believe you should still give at least 10 percent even if you’ve received poor service.Take care to determine whether the poor service was really the server’s fault. For example, perhaps the kitchen didn’t get the food to the server on time or management understaffed the restaurant.

, It can make a server’s day to be told you thought their service wasn’t just good but was impeccable. Why not let them know?


Write a little note on the bill when you pay your bill explaining what you thought the server did really well.
Better yet, call over the manager and tell the manager about the good job the server did.
Always treat your server to a smile and be kind and polite. Service jobs can be stressful enough without people taking out their bad days on the server!

Make sure tips are accepted.,
Tip sparingly in Europe.,
Tip wisely in other areas of the world.,
Avoid tipping in most parts of Asia.",How to Tip Your Server at a Restaurant3," In most establishments in the US, tips are not only accepted, but they are encouraged because the servers rely on them to make enough money to survive. In some other countries, tips might be considered insulting or not allowed!


There are some venues where tips may not be allowed. For example, some all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean may discourage tipping because a service fee is already woven into the overall vacation cost.
If you are attending a group gathering paid for in advance by someone else, such as a wedding reception, it’s possible that the gratuity was already paid in advance by the person who paid for the event.There’s no harm in leaving an extra tip in a situation like that, though, if you can afford to do so. The server will likely appreciate it.

, The culture around tipping in Europe is not the same as tipping in the US. Tipping is expected in the US, but in Europe it’s often not expected at all.Start by looking at the restaurant’s menu to see if it lists service as being included. If it’s not, you could leave between 5 and 10 percent. It would be considered a lot and unusual to tip more in some countries.
The difference is that servers in Europe are often better paid than they are in the US, meaning they rely on tips far less to survive, and are likely to consider the tip as a small and unexpected bonus.
It’s a good idea to hand the tip to the server rather than leaving it on the table. You might see a 12.5 percent optional tip on some menus in London.

, Tipping customs vary widely depending on the country you’re visiting. It’s a good idea to research the country’s practices before you embark on your trip.


In the Middle East, tipping will be appreciated even in small amounts. Some governments, like Dubai, mandate a 10 percent service charge to bills at restaurants. In Egypt, the tip is often included in the bill but you can add 5-10 percent above that.
In Israel and Jordan, the tip is usually included in the bill.
Canada is similar to the United States, so tip between 15 and 20 percent there.
In some South American countries, like Chile, a 10 percent tip is included in the bill.
In Mexico, cash is preferred, and the tip should generally be 10-15 percent.
In Australia, leave between 10 to 15 percent.

, Some Asian countries may frown on tipping. Check into the local customs, and make sure that tipping is not seen as an insult.


China has a no tipping culture, although you could leave a tip in fine hotels and restaurants that cater to foreigners.
In Japan, the owner might be insulted by the tip, taking it as a statement by you that they don't pay their servers well enough.
In some Asian countries, though, it's OK to tip. In Thailand, leave about $1 for the waiter.

Act immediately.,
Get your server’s attention.,
Be clear and concise.,
Immediately report any illnesses.,
Ask to speak to a manager.,
Don’t pry for free compensation.,
Stay calm.,
Avoid threats.",How to Complain in a Restaurant," The key to successful complaining is to highlight the problem right away, thereby giving the restaurant the opportunity to resolve the problem with minimum fuss. The sooner you alert the staff of your complaint the quicker it can be resolved.


Don’t complain about a meal after you’ve eaten half of it unless you encounter harmful or dangerous cooking.;
, If you have a complaint slightly raise your hand, politely make eye contact to communicate to your server that you need attention, discreetly call the waiter over, explain the problem, and ask him or her to resolve the situation. If your server is inattentive, or is not aware of your attempts to get their attention, try getting the attention of another server and explain your issue.


Try to avoid leaving your seat to find your server. There should be plenty of opportunity to get the attention of another server or manager.

, The clearer you can be about the issue you would like resolved the easier the restaurant will be able to help you. Speak clearly and avoid mumbling when addressing staff about a complaint.


Try not exaggerate the problem by saying things like “I hate this,” “This is disgusting,” or “I can’t eat this.” Instead, try to state the problem as clearly as possible, “My food is undercooked,” “I asked for no dairy,” or “This isn’t what I ordered.”

, If, once you've left a restaurant, you become ill from food poisoning caused by poor food handling, immediately report it to the restaurant and local health department or food standards agency., The high majority of issues in a restaurant stem from poor organization, training, or recruitment. Asking to speak to a manager will help everyone find the source of the problem as quickly as possible, whether that may be your server, the kitchen, or the management.Politely ask to speak to manager after you’ve finished giving your complaint to your server, as in “I would like to speak to your manager, thank you.”
Managers also tend to have a more comprehensive view of how the restaurant is running that day and may give you a reason as to why the service or food isn’t satisfactory., It is ultimately up to the restaurant to decide how they are going to compensate your complaint. Any decent restaurant knows that they can turn any complaint or criticism into a positive and enjoyable experience. However, if you believe you did not receive what you paid for, such as raw food or ignoring a food allergy, politely speak to a manager about possible reimbursement.Kindly ask the manager if there is a possibility of being compensated by repayment or a voucher if your meal was inadequate, as in “My food was served to me raw and I’m wondering if there is anything you might be able to do.”
Remember, their goal is not only customer service, but customer loyalty. They would like to see you again so their compensation may surprise you., Staying calm will help resolve whatever issue there might be as quickly as possible. The more rude or flippant you are the less likely the management will be to help you. Do not automatically blame the waiter; keep in mind that a long wait for food or a dish that is not cooked to your satisfaction is probably the fault of the chef rather than the server.There should be no reason to raise your voice. Understand that mistakes happen.

, Threatening to leave a bad review on Yelp or TripAdvisor won’t do much toward resolving your complaint. Staff and managers at a restaurant understand the value of constructive criticism in the service industry. Threatening them with a bad review will make you seem flippant and angry and will not inspire the staff to try and make your experience anymore enjoyable.Instead of turning to Yelp or TripAdvisor, write an email to the restaurant expressing your disappointment. You’ll be surprised at how responsive they might be."

Rotate the table.,
Fix the leg that is causing the wobble.,
Tighten the leg.,
Buy a special gadget meant just for this shaky situation.,
Move to another table.",How to Fix a Shaky Table at a Restaurant," The table might only be shaky because of the way it has been positioned or bumped. Check that there is nothing caught under any of the table legs, such as the end of a curtain or a small item like a pebble, utensil, etc. And check to see whether a table leg has become lodged on the edge of a baseboard or some other item jutting out from a wall. Another common issue is where the table is situated on a varied floor surface (such as a mosaic, grout, a floor crack, etc.) and one of the legs is on a different surface from the other three. If any of these issues apply, the table probably simply needs pushing away from this different surface or pulled off whatever it's caught on.

According to physicist Andre Martin, a table can be forced to stop wobbling if you keep rotating it somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees until the no-shake spot is found.Martin even has a mathematical proof to back this solution up, provided the table is square, has a leg in each corner with a narrow tip that touches the ground at a single point and that the floor isn't sloping more than 15 degrees or has a sudden drop-off.So just keep rotating until it hits the sweet spot.

, In case you're shy about rotating the table or feel it just isn't working for your particular table, there are some tried and true methods that have likely been around as long as tables. These engineering solutions are good to try before you bother the waitstaff (often they'll resort to these methods anyway). Just be sure to tell your fellow diners that you suspect there is a problem and that you're about to try to fix it––you don't want someone placing their full weight on the table while you're precariously balanced. You could try any, or all, of the following:


Place a napkin (serviette) under the leg that seems to be causing the problem. You can fold a single napkin over several times or use a stack of napkins, depending on how much of a gap presents itself. Generally, if there is less than an inch (2.5cm) between the leg and the floor, the napkin trick may be the perfect solution.
Stack a few menus underneath the table. If the restaurant offers plastic menus that are easy to stack, try a few shoved under the leg. Or, better yet, a book-menu with a cover will provide the leg with even more height.
Find a piece of cardboard off a box or any other item, or tear out a few magazine pages from the free magazines in the establishment (if they complain, show them the wobble). Wedge the cardboard or pages under the offending leg until the table ceases to shake.
Cram a few matchbooks under the broken leg. An old restaurant trick is to use one or two matchbooks to level an uneven or wobbly leg. Given changing laws about smoking though, some restaurants no longer provide a dish of free matchbooks, so this step may not be an option.

, In some cases, a table leg might be loose if it's attached by screwing on. If you can see that this is the issue (give it a quick look to check), try screwing the loose leg back into place. Grasp the top of the loose leg and twist to tighten it. Once you can’t tighten anymore, test the table to see if it worked. Gently try to rock the table back and forth––if it appears to be sitting steady, your plan worked.

It is a good idea to contact your wait staff before any modifications to a table at a restaurant. If it's obvious that a screw is loose, let them know and ask if you can turn the screw/turn the table sideways.






Not all table legs screw in an easy, circular fashion so make sure you can even attempt this.
If you can tip the table slightly sideways, this will allow you to get a better grasp on the leg. Don't tilt it if drinks and plates are on the table already!
It's recommended that you wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after handling the leg. Anything could be lurking on the inside leg from old gum to squished bits of food someone's kid tried to hide.

, It is possible to purchase an item called a ""WonKey"" that consists of a silicon key shaped wedge, perfect for propping up the shaky leg anytime needed. The idea is that it's always with you because it's on your keyring and if you leave it on the keyring, theoretically you should remember to take it home because you should remember to collect your keys at the end of the meal or drinks. Of course, if you're the forgetful type or you have one drink too many, you might actually forget both the wedge and your keys, so only choose this method if you're usually pretty good at collecting up your belongings after.


You could also try making your own wedge from hard foam or silicon. Simply cut a small wedge shape about one inch (2.5cm) high at the highest end, and descending in wedge shape (like a wedge of cheese). Drill a hole through it for attaching to your keyring or bag so that you can carry it everywhere. In fact, if you attach it to your bag, you won't usually forget to recover the wedge––and potentially the weight of the table on the wedge could be a deterrent to having your bag stolen!

, If you can, simply move to a table that isn't wobbling. If you can't find one, ask your server to assist, explaining what the problem is. Don't be shy or embarrassed––few people want to sit at a wobbly table and most waitstaff will be glad to assist you.


Try booth seating. Such seating isn't usually prone to shaking. Or look for three-legged tables rather than four-legged ones. From an engineering perspective, they're more stable!It's best to let staff know that there's a problem so that they can deal with it. If they roll their eyes with a ""we know"" look, cheerfully suggest that they might consider fixing it rather than continuing to put up with it all the time.

Instead of going to lunch, find an activity you can do together.",How to Take Your Dieting Friend out to Lunch," Obtain as much information as possible about your pal’s diet in order to identify smart restaurant options. Some diets are very restrictive, so knowing what he or she can or cannot eat will be helpful in deciding where to go together.


Are there very specific restrictions? Some diets “forbid” carbs, whereas others are all about counting calories. Find a restaurant that allows him or her more than one menu choice. For example, if your friend cannot eat carbs, an Italian restaurant may not be the best choice unless it also specializes in steaks or seafood.
Is there a certain time of day your friend needs to eat? Some diets have a strict eating schedule (for example, eating every two to three hours) or eating earlier in the day is preferred.
Is there a certain restaurant that is definitely off limits (per his or her plan)? Although you can probably get a good idea of which restaurants are off limits, ask your friend if he or she has a preference or can definitely not eat at a certain place.;
, The best way to have a comfortable lunch is to find out what your friend prefers doing. For special occasions such as a birthday or celebratory lunch, fulfilling his or her ideal choice is the best way to proceed. Some things that might work include:


Cooking together. Many diet and nutrition experts suggest eating as many meals as possible at home, in order to adhere to a diet plan. Consider either cooking a meal together or surprise your friend with a meal taken directly from his or her diet plan. For example, if your friend is doing the South Beach Diet, refer to the South Beach Diet cookbook. That way, your friend can choose healthy ingredients and know exactly what he or she is eating.
Going to a restaurant that includes calorie count on the menu. Some restaurants will include the number of calories (and in some cases other nutritional information such as carbs or fat) next to the main course. Also, numerous diet websites and apps have nutritional information for a variety of restaurants, so consider using that resource if the calories are not on the menu. In some cases, calling the restaurant beforehand may yield useful information on diet options; they may even agree to make up something special.

, Even if your friend selects a restaurant you're unfamiliar with, consider the luncheon to be an adventure and keep an open mind.


If he or she wants to eat at an odd time (either before or after traditional lunchtime), schedule lunch on a day you are both off from work or when you can reschedule your day without too much trouble. If time is a factor, match your schedules until you can agree upon a specific time that works for everyone.

, Look after your needs too––ask about the restaurant and menu your friend chooses if you have specific dietary needs or have a limited palate. Even though your friend may be on a diet, you may have specific dietary needs too, such as food allergies, vegetarianism or an aversion to spicy food. Although you're trying to accommodate your friend's needs, don't forget about your requirements too.


On the odd occasion where you can't find a place suited to both your needs, choose your friend's preference and eat before going. When there, have simple options such as a salad or even just a cup of coffee and something to nibble. At least you will be there and you can explain that you're not feeling hungry today or that you had to partake in a work morning tea before coming and that you suddenly feel full. Or, tell your friend you're on a diet too, in solidarity!

, If your friend is on a diet, chances are he or she is in the process of changing the usual lifestyle patterns and evolving to a healthier way of eating. Instead making the luncheon food-centric, focus on the conversation and interaction.


Engage in dynamic conversation to get caught up in each other’s lives. Stay focused on each other and steer clear of conversations about dieting and food. If your friend looks like he or she has lost weight be sure you tell him or her and compliment your buddy on the obvious progress.

, Consider eating low calorie too, or choosing the same or similar selection/portion size to support your friend. If your friend orders the petite salad, rethink asking for the mega-burger. Sure, it’s your life and you aren’t the one on a diet, but if you want to show your support and really be there as a friend, don’t order something that you know your friend would rather be eating. This show of solidarity with your friend can be a great morale booster and can underline your friendship more than words.


Being supportive includes not making the conversation about all the concerns you have that your friend is getting enough nutrition. Unless you're a nutritionist, don't even start. If your friend seems stressed out, ask after his or her work life and home life but avoid linking it to the diet. There can be any number of causes of feeling tired and stressed out, food being only one of them.

, If you're having trouble finding a restaurant or a time to get together for lunch, consider a fun activity that both of you can do within the time allotted. Some ideas include:


Exercise class or race. Your friend may be integrating exercise into his or her life and enjoying it. If your buddy likes to workout, ask him or her to invite you to a favorite class or to complete a fun run together. Alternatively, introduce your friend to something physical that you enjoy at lunchtime, like running through the park or rock climbing a local climbing wall.
Spa or mani-pedi. Get massages or have your nails done together as your activity instead of eating. This is for guys too!
Visit an art museum or a local festival. Grab a healthy protein shake and then take your friend to enjoy art or a local festival. If you go to an ethnic festival, clear it with your friend first––ethnic festivals are chock full of delicious (and most likely not diet friendly) food. But it will also have music, art and craft, clothing, perfumes and soaps, etc. that you can concentrate on instead of food!
Go to a ballgame, shop or hit a concert or show. Find an activity that you both enjoy doing and either eat at home before you go or bring along a healthy snack such as an apple or almonds.

If you can't find shredded coconut, shaved coconut also works quite well., Every cup of coconut will end up translating into two cups of milk. Measure out the coconut into a blender or high-powered food processor.

, You'll need two cups of water for every cup of coconut you have. Measure out the correct number of cups into a pot. Place the pot on a burner and turn the heat to high. Let the water come to a full boil.

, Pour it directly into the blender. If your blender is small, you may need to do this in batches. Use a spoon to stir the mixture well.

, Place the lid on the blender and blend the coconut and water until the mixture is as smooth as possible. Be sure to hold the lid of the blender tightly in place with one hand, since blending heated substances can cause the lid to fly off unexpectedly.

, Place a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Carefully pour the coconut mixture through the cloth, straining out the solid pieces. The liquid that is left in the bowl is fresh coconut milk. If you're using cheesecloth, pick it up and squeeze out the extra milk before discarding the solid coconut.

, Pour the milk into a jar and store it in the refrigerator with a lid. The fat in the milk will naturally rise to the top of the jar. When you're ready to use the milk, shake it first so that the fat mixes back in with the water.

Store the coconut milk.",How to Make Coconut Milk3," Set a fresh, young coconut on a hard, flat surface in your kitchen. Hold it in place with one hand, and use a butcher knife to make cuts in a circular shape around its eye. The easiest way to do this is to strike the coconut, as you would with a machete, in the same place until a deep enough cut is made. Continue to do this until you've cut a circular lid that can be lifted away from the coconut.


Use a very sharp knife to do this job. A blunt knife could slip and cut your hand.
Another method for opening a coconut is to wrap the coconut in a kitchen towel and set it on a hard surface. Use a rolling pin or a hammer to strike the coconut in the middle, so that it cracks in half. If you use this method, drill a hole in the coconut first, drain out the coconut water, and set it aside.

, Smell the coconut and inspect the meat. If the coconut smells good and the meat looks moist and white, it's fine to use. Discard the coconut if it smells off or if the meat is dried out or discolored. , Pour it straight from the coconut into a blender.

, Use a spoon to scoop the meat from the inside of the coconut. Try to get every last bit of white meat from the walls of the coconut, and don't forget to scrape it off of the lid, too. The meat should have a texture similar to a dense melon and easily curl against the spoon. Place the scraped meat into the blender.

, Put a lid on the blender and pulse it on high until the coconut water and meat are fully combined and smooth. At this point you may either strain the solids from the coconut milk or leave them as part of the mixture. Since fresh coconut meat is soft, many enjoy it in a glass of coconut milk, the way some like orange juice with pulp mixed in.

, Pour the fresh coconut milk into a jar. Put a lid on the jar and keep the milk in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.

Blend the ingredients until the mixture is no longer chunky.,
Line the sides of your glasses with chocolate syrup, and pour the puree into the glasses.,
Garnish the shake.,
Enjoy!",How to Make an Avocado Shake," If you want to make the shake immediately, buy a ripe, brown, ready-to-eat avocado; if you plan to make the shake in a few days, buy a firmer, greener avocado.To tell if it's ripe: Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand. Gently squeeze the avocado, being careful not to press with your fingertips, as this can cause bruising. A ripe avocado will be soft and will yield to the gentle pressure, but will not be overly squishy. If it's suspiciously squishy, there's a good chance that it's beginning to go bad; when avocados are overripe, the insides decay and go brown. If it is still hard, then it is still under ripe and will take a few days to ripen. You may still opt to purchase under-ripe avocados, and ripen them at home.
Store unripe avocados in a paper bag at room temperature between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 and 23.88 degrees Celsius) for up to 5 days, until they are ripe. To slow the ripening process, store the avocado in the refrigerator until you make the shake.
Buy certain varieties of avocado based on their flavor profile: The Hass, Lamb Hass, Gwen, Reed, or Sharwil varieties tend to have a nutty taste, whereas the Bacon and Zutano varieties are lighter in flavor.Half an avocado makes about two servings; a full avocado makes four. If you want an especially rich, thick smoothie, use more avocado per serving--say, use the whole avocado for two people. Bear in mind that if you use less avocado, your shake will be thinner, and it may not be so rich.;
, The richer the milk, the thicker the shake.


If you want an especially rich shake, use whole milk or half-and-half. For a lower-fat option, use 2%, 1%, or skim milk.
Consider using almond milk, soy milk, rice milk, or any other non-dairy milk options. Nut milks, especially, may complement the naturally nutty taste of some avocado varieties. Bear in mind that these choices may not be as thick or rich as dairy milk.
For an especially thick, rich shake, consider substituting ice cream for the milk. Bear in mind that this may make a shake that's too thick--you may only want to substitute ice cream for half the milk that the recipe calls for, or you may want to add an extra half-cup of ice cream to the recipe for a larger, thicker shake. If you're adding ice cream, you may want to compensate by using a lower-fat variety of milk.

, Any type of sugar is fine: brown, white, granulated, etc. Avocados can be bitter, but sugar will mitigate any hint of bitterness.


If you're on a no- or low-sugar diet, feel free to forego the sugar and let the natural richness of the avocado shine.
Consider using natural sweeteners like honey and agave nectar. These ingredients will keep your shake sweet without exposing you to processed, industrially-refined sugar. Add natural sweeteners to taste; as a rule of thumb, start with the same amount of sweetener that's listed in the recipe, and work up or down from there.
Consider substituting 1/4 cup condensed milk for the sugar or sweetener. This will keep the shake rich and sweet without using pure, processed sugar.

, The brand doesn't matter: pick your favorite. The chocolate, again, is not an absolutely necessary ingredient, but it will add dimension to the taste of your shake.


Consider substituting another dessert sauce--such as caramel or butterscotch--for the chocolate syrup if you cannot (or don't want to) eat chocolate.
Be careful not to use too much chocolate syrup, or the shake might be too sweet. If you love chocolate, use more; if you're hesitant to rock the choc, consider adding less.

, You can buy ice from a store, but it may be cheaper to make your own.


If your refrigerator dispenses crushed and cubed ice, hold a measuring cup below the dispenser until you've captured 3/4 of a cup.
This is not a hard, fast rule for the amount of ice. Feel free to experiment. Blended, crushed ice will give your shake a thicker consistency, and it may temper the richness of the avocado and the milk.

, Leave the chocolate syrup aside, for now.



Cut the avocado in half, lengthwise, and use a knife or a spoon to scoop the fruit into the blender. The insides should be green, and perhaps vaguely yellow--but not brown. Slice away any brown bits and leave them out of your shake. Discard the lumpy skin on the outside and the hard pit in the center. Slice a grid into the avocado, crisscrossing grooves all the way through the fruit, to make the fruit easier to remove.
Use as much of the avocado as you like, though as a general rule, half an avocado makes two servings. If you want to garnish the rim of the shake glasses with an avocado slice or two, then save at least a quarter of an avocado.

, Make sure to secure the lid of your blender before firing up the machine.


This may take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes. Keep an eye on the shake while it's blending. You may need to hold the lid down to keep it from jostling loose.
Keep checking the consistency until it's done. With the blender off, use a spoon to stir the mixture and check for lumpy bits. If you find any large chunks of avocado or ice, replace the lid and blend for another 10-15 seconds.
If it's your first time making an avocado shake--and even if it isn't--sample the mixture as you go. Feel free to change the recipe to meet your tastes: add more milk for a thinner shake; more avocado, ice, or ice cream for a thicker shake; more sugar or sweetener for a sweeter shake. As you interact with the recipe and consider what you like, you'll get better and better at making avocado shakes.

,


The chocolate syrup is optional. It will, however, lend an exciting, sweet dimension to the flavor of the shake, and it adds character to the shake's appearance.

,


Decorate the rim of the glass with extra avocado chunks. Scoop ice cream or cherries into the shake to make it a little bit sweeter.
Consider drizzling honey or agave nectar onto the surface of the shake for an extra-sweet kick. Consider garnishing with whipped cream or cool whip.
Consider sprinkling crushed nuts on top of the shake; this may work well with the naturally nutty flavor of the avocado. If you're making shakes for small children, make sure that the nut chunks aren't too large.
Consider salting the shake, lightly, if you're into sweet-and-salty desserts--but don't go overboard!

, Be sure to save any leftover avocado.


If you have any leftover avocado, you can store it in the refrigerator for two or three days Keep the avocado in a clean, airtight container, and sprinkle it with citrus juice--lemon or lime--to preserve its freshness. If you don't want to use citrus (this can make for a slimy avocado), store the opened-up avocado with a piece of cut-up onion. Either option should keep an avocado relatively fresh for 1-3 days--but the sooner you eat it, the better.You can compost or discard the skin, the pit, and any other avocado bits that you don't want to save.
If you want to use the pit to grow your own avocado tree, then save it, clean it, and use toothpicks to prop it with the round end half-submerged in a glass of water. The avocado pit should begin to sprout a taproot, slowly, and it should be ready to plant in 3-4 weeks.

For a weak blender, chop the banana into small pieces, or mash it into a paste with a fork.
For a strong blender, slice the bananas.
For a food processor, break the banana into thirds.;
, If you have time, freeze the chopped banana to make a creamier, colder drink. Otherwise, just move on to the next step.

, Add the banana to a blender. Pour in about ½–¾ cup (120–180mL) crushed ice.


You can skip the ice if you're using a frozen banana, or if the weather is cool.
Ice cubes will take much longer to blend, and may break a weak blender.

, Pour milk or your favorite milk substitute into the blender until it reaches about ¾ the height of your solid ingredients. Even regular tap water will end up creamy after blending.


If you prefer precise measurements, start with 2 cups (240mL) of liquid. After blending, add more in ½ cup (120mL) increments until you reach the desired consistency.
You can use any type of milk.

, Blend until all ingredients are combined and smooth. This will take 1–3 minutes, depending on the power of your blender.

Blend in more ice for a thicker drink.

, Most people enjoy adding a little sugar, honey, or another sweetener. Add a small spoonful, blend, and taste. Repeat until the drink is as sweet as you like it.


If you are serving the banana milk to vegans, keep in mind that some vegans do not eat honey.

, Serve in a tall glass with a thick straw. You can also pour banana milk over cereal, porridge, or fruit.

, Add any or all of the following to make a richer, sweeter drink:


½ tsp (1.25mL) vanilla extract for a more intense flavor
A splash of cream for a richer taste
A scoop of vanilla ice cream to make a banana milkshake
A squeeze of chocolate syrup
Several dates instead of sugar for a rich, natural sweetness

, On the healthier side of the spectrum, a handful of raw oats creates a thicker, creamier texture.

, Dust the top of the drink with powdered cardamom, cinnamon, and/or nutmeg.

, If you enjoy green smoothies, combine the two ideas. The banana will keep the smoothie thick and creamy, while the leafy greens provide vitamins and nutrients.

, Banana milk is basically a fruit smoothie already. Expand on the tropical theme with fresh mango, pineapple, or cantaloupe. Add more milk or a dollop of yogurt to keep it smooth.

",How to Make an Almond Milkshake1," You can choose plain, vanilla, or chocolate depending on your flavor preference. For a healthier shake, choose unsweetened almond milk and let the other ingredients add the sweetness.


If you want to create an almond milk smoothie, rather than a shake, add 8 oz. (237 ml) of non-fat yogurt. Reduce the almond milk to 3/4 of a cup (177 ml). Use almond, soy or coconut yogurt to make the smoothie completely lactose-free.;
, If you do not like bananas, you can omit them or replace them with another thick fruit, like mango. The banana gives the shake a thick consistency and flavor.


For a thicker smoothie, use frozen bananas.

, If you don't like strawberries, you can use another type of fruit instead. If the fruit is larger, like a peach, make sure that you slice it first. Some great choices include:


Blueberries
Mangos
Peaches
Strawberries

, This will make your smoothie nice and thick. If you are already using frozen fruit, however, then you can omit the ice, unless you like your smoothies extra-thick.

, If you are not a fan of agave nectar, you can use another sweetener instead, such as stevia; if you are not a strict vegan, then you can try honey instead.


If you used a flavored almond milk, such as vanilla or chocolate, then you do not have to add the honey or any other sweetener

, You can use almond extract to enhance the almond flavor of your shake, or you can add baking spices instead. Cinnamon and nutmeg are great options!

Add 1 cup (160 milliliters) of acidophilus culture (yogurt or starter) to the cup.,
Stir the mixture into the remaining milk.,
Pour the milk into the sterilized containers you prepared.,
Place the containers in a bath of water at the inoculation temperature.,
Place the cooling bath, with containers, in a warm area to set.",How to Make Acidophilus Milk," Because making acidophilus milk is similar to making yogurt, you can use the same starter, either a cup of plain yogurt with live cultures or a yogurt starter. Both are available at either grocery or health food stores.

If using plain yogurt, read the label to verify that the yogurt contains live acidophilus cultures as well as to check the yogurt's expiration date. Although the starter yogurt will keep up to a month under refrigeration, you want it to be as fresh as possible when making acidophilus milk.;
, Place the containers in a large pot, 5 gallons (18.93 liters) or larger, with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in the bottom. Cover the pot and boil for 10 minutes. Keep the lid on after turning off the heat., Heat the milk slowly in a covered container until the temperature reaches 185 to 195 degrees Fahrenheit (85 to 90 degrees Celsius). This will kill any harmful bacteria in the milk.

You can heat the milk on a stove using either a thick-bottomed pot or a double boiler. You can also heat the milk in a slow cooker, food dehydrator, or yogurt maker.
You can use whole milk, low-fat (1 or 2 percent) milk, skim milk, soy milk, or almond milk. More milk fat imparts a richer taste.
If scalding the milk in a slow cooker, cook the milk for 2 to 2.5 hours on low.
Do not boil the milk; doing so gives the milk a ""cooked"" taste and may cause the milk to burn or boil over.

, Without removing the lid from the scalding pot, let the milk cool to a temperature of 122 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (50 to 55 degrees Celsius). If you heated the milk on a stove, you can do this by placing the scalding pot in a bath of clean, cold water. If you scalded the milk in a slow cooker, let the milk cool for 2 to 3 hours with the lid on.

The exact temperature you need to cool the milk to depends on the strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus you're using. Some strains are adapted to temperatures closer to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), while others thrive best at temperatures closer to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius). If using a starter instead of yogurt, cool the scalded milk to whatever temperature is given on the starter package for the culture's peak activity level, whether it matches the temperatures given here or differs. Temperatures cooler than 95 degrees render the bacterium inert, while temperatures hotter than 130 degrees will kill it.

, You can put the milk in a measuring cup or any other container with a 2-cup (320-milliliter) capacity., Stir the acidophilus into the cup to make a thorough mixture., This will distribute the acidophilus culture throughout the rest of the milk., Fill each container up to its neck, then cover immediately and tighten the lid., You'll need to heat 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of water to the upper range of the inoculation temperature (130 degrees Fahrenheit/55 degrees Celsius), pour it into a large pot or cooler, and let it cool to the lower end of the range (122 degrees Fahrenheit/50 degrees Celsius)., As with buttermilk, acidophilus milk normally requires 24 hours to sit before it's ready to use. After 24 hours, you can put the acidophilus milk in the refrigerator to stop the actions of the acidophilus culture and prevent any harmful bacteria from forming."

For something simple, add a sliced strawberry onto the rim.
For a sundae, swirl some whipped cream on top, and drizzle on some chocolate sauce. Top it off with a maraschino cherry and a dash of colorful sprinkles.
For a wintery treat, pop in a peppermint stick. Garnish with a swirl of strawberry sauce to match the stick. You can also use chocolate sauce and a mint leaf instead.

, Vanilla ice cream doesn't just come plain; sometimes, it has other goodies mixed into it, such as cookies-n-cream or chocolate-swirl. You can also mix and match different ice cream flavors. For example, you could use 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and 1 scoop of peppermint ice cream for a subtle mint flavor., Other ideas include peanut butter, mint or almond extract, and even a tablespoon of jelly or jam for a fruity kick. Try Nutella, marshmallow fluff, and chocolate milk. If it tastes good in a dessert, chances are good it will taste good in a milkshake.

Avoid citrus, like orange juice. It can cause the milk to curdle if it gets too warm.

, Add the cookies halfway through mixing to prevent the cookies from turning to dust.Smash hard candies in a plastic bag with a rolling pin, and add them towards the beginning of the mixing to help them blend better.

For the popular cookies-n-cream milkshake, use Oreo cookies—or a similar chocolate sandwich cookie.
For a wintery milkshake, use crushed peppermint candies. You can often find them pre-crushed in small jars during the holidays in arts and crafts shops and grocery stores.

, Simply add it in with the rest of the ingredients and blend it until smooth for a deliciously sweet variation on a classic vanilla milkshake. Garnish with sprinkles., Strawberries and/or bananas are the most popular choices, but you can experiment with other types of fruit as well, including: blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and pomegranate seeds.

For a smoother milkshake, add the fruit towards the beginning, and keep blending until it is completely mixed in.
For a chunkier smoothie, add the fruit towards the end. This works best with berries, and breaks the fruit up enough to release flavor but not enough to lose texture.

, Cut open a vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds and the empty pod to ½ cup (120 milliliters) of milk, and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes over low heat. Strain out the vanilla seeds/pod and let the milk cool before using it."

You're achieving the same effect at home by adding acid to the milk. The acid curdles the milk slightly, thickening it. The acid is also what helps the baked goods to rise through a chemical reaction. When it mixes with baking soda (a base), the two of them together produce carbon dioxide, creating bubbles in your baked goods. This process achieves an airy texture.In place of the white vinegar, you can substitute lemon juice.You can also use other types of vinegar, but that can affect the flavor of your finished product.

Go with organic.,

Mix healthy fruit juices into vegetable juices.,
Try vegetables with a high water content.,
Go for greens.,
Add a burst of flavor with citrus fruits.,
Don't forget the herbs.,
Top things off with some healthy fats.",How to Make Raw Unpasteurized Juice1," When making unpasteurized juice, using organic vegetables ensures that you do not accidentally take any potentially hazardous chemicals into your body. Pasteurization may sterilize many fruits and vegetables even if they are not organic, but when making unpasteurized juice, organic produce is the way to go.
, One of the easiest ways to ease yourself into juicing is to use flavors that you already know you like. Most fruits and vegetables have at least some nutritional value to offer, even if they are not as beneficial as others might be., When made into juice, though, these vegetables may seem difficult to drink alone, so they are often paired with sweeter vegetables or fruits., The reason why fruit juice is so commonly available and vegetable juice isn't is simply because fruit juice tastes better and is more marketable. Plenty of fruits offer vitamins and minerals that can benefit your raw juice, however. You can either create your own raw, unpasteurized fruit juice and drink it by itself or you can add it to your vegetable juice for a fruity, sweet twist of flavor. Grape juice can make an especially flavorful addition., These vegetables tend to have a more tolerable flavor and may seem more palatable to people who are new to raw juices. Cucumbers and celery are both good choices. Tomatoes, while technically a fruit, are also very juicy and tend to have a flavor that pleases most taste buds., Wheatgrass is a popular and beneficial choice for homemade juices. Dandelion greens also make a good option. These greens are rarely consumed in their solid form but are easier to ingest as juice., Lemon and lime both pack a punch of flavor and vitamin C, but they can be overwhelming on their own. They do, however, make a great addition to other juices, especially if the juices are somewhat bland in taste., Herbs and spices are used to flavor cooking and can be used to flavor juices, as well. Parsley and cilantro make notably good choices for most vegetable juices, especially those made with leafy vegetables or those mixed with a little lime juice. Spices, like cloves or cinnamon, tend to work better with certain types of fruit juices, like raw apple juice., Adding a little ground flax seed, almond milk, coconut milk, or walnut oil can give your juice new dimension while contributing a dose of healthy fatty acids to your diet. The phytonutrients in plants are often fat-soluble, and as a result, they are absorbed into the body's bloodstream better if digested with a little healthy fat."

Use a triturating juicer.These juicers work in two steps.,
Save time with a centrifugal juicer.,
Try a masticating juicer.,
Use a blender.,
Use a hand juicer.",How to Make Raw Unpasteurized Juice2," First, the juicer crushes the fruits and vegetables. Second, the juicer presses the juice from the crushed produce. As a result, fewer vitamins, minerals, and fiber are lost. These juicers take a little longer than other electric juicers, but they make a high-quality choice for leafy greens, wheatgrass, sprouts, root vegetables, and water-dense fruits., Centrifugal juicers are the fastest and most common. The juicer grinds the produce and pushes the juice through an enclosed strainer by quickly spinning the pulp. The pulp and juice are separated, but the pulp does tend to be fairly moist, suggesting that not all the juice has been squeezed out. Most fruits and vegetables work well with a centrifugal juicer, but it should not be used for wheatgrass or dandelion greens., Masticating juicers use a single gear to grind produce fibers using a steady rotating motion. These juicers can take a while, but the juice that is produced is relatively high-quality. Most fruits and vegetables can be juiced using a masticating juicer, and you can also use these juicers to produce baby food, sauce, and nut butter., If you do not have a juicer and do not want to buy one, you can usually use an ordinary blender to create the juice. A blender will not separate the pulp from the juice, of course, so you will need to do that manually by running the blended, pulpy juice through a wire mesh strainer., Hand juicers are a little old-fashioned, but they still work for many applications. Citrus juicers and wheatgrass juicers are the two main types.

Citrus juicers are fairly common. Cut a citrus fruit, like lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit, in half. Wring the half out over the juicer using the juicer's peak.
Wheatgrass juicers are used to literally grind the juice out of wheatgrass or other similar grasses. They work similar to the way that a masticating juicer works, except that you operate it by hand rather than by electricity.

"
"
Wash and dry your produce before juicing.,
Peel and cut your produce.,
Work in batches.,
Strain your juice.",How to Make Raw Unpasteurized Juice3," It is important that you remove as much dirt and bacteria as possible by scrubbing the produce under hot water since your juice will be raw and, therefore, untreated., If using a hand juicer this step is likely unnecessary. If using a blender or electric juicer, though, removing the skin from the produce beforehand exposes more of the flesh, making it easier for the machine to squeeze juice out. Likewise, cutting the produce into smaller pieces also exposes more surface around and makes the produce easier to juice., Only add as much to the juicer or blender as you can fit without having to cram it in. If making a juice with multiple fruits and/or vegetables, be sure to include equal parts of each produce into the juice as you work, and combine all the juice into one container to make sure that equal proportions of each produce type are spread throughout the entire large batch., Unless you are using a juicer that strains the juice automatically, like a centrifugal juicer, you will need to separate the pulp from the juice manually. Do so by pushing the juice through a fine mesh metal strainer. For added thoroughness, you can also line the strainer with coffee filters, cheesecloth, or thin muslin cloth."

Pour the pumpkin juice into a pitcher, and leave it in the fridge to chill.,
Serve the pumpkin juice cold over ice.",How to Make Pumpkin Juice1," If you don't have apple cider, you can use plain apple juice instead. You will have to add some spices later on to give your juice more flavor, however.
, Make sure that you are using plain, canned pumpkin puree and not the ""pumpkin pie"" kind. The pumpkin pie puree has lots of additional ingredients and your juice won't turn out right., If you can't find any, you can use peach nectar instead. This will help thin out your juice without sacrificing flavor. Avoid just adding more apple cider or apple juice; the apple flavor will be too overwhelming., If you used plain apple juice, this is a must. If you are using apple cider, however, then you don't have to add it, because it is already spiced., From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, and scrape the mixture down the sides with a spatula. This will ensure that everything blends evenly., This pumpkin juice will be a little thick, like orange juice or apricot/peach nectar. It won't be thin and clear like apple juice. Make your adjustments based on the list below, and give your pumpkin juice a final blend.

If the juice is not sweet enough, add some agave nectar, honey, white sugar, or brown sugar.
If the pumpkin juice is too bland, add a little bit more pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon.

, This will help improve the flavor of the juice. It will also allow the flavors to infuse better., For an added touch, you could design some ""Pumpkin Juice"" labels on your computer, print them onto adhesive paper, and stick them onto some glass bottles.

Serve the pumpkin juice cold over ice.",How to Make Pumpkin Juice2," It is a great option if you'd like a little more hands-on experience, or if you can't get canned pumpkin puree., Don't use a large ""jack-o-lantern"" type pumpkin. It will give your juice a weird taste and texture., You can do this using a large metal spoon, an ice cream scoop, or even a pulp scooper from a jack-o-lantern carving kit.Discard the pulp; you can save the seeds for roasting or for another recipe., Place the pumpkin pieces face down on a baking sheet filled with ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) of water.Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven, and let the pumpkin roast. You can test whether or not it is done by poking it with a fork. If it's soft, it's done.The water will prevent the pumpkin from burning or becoming too dry. This will give your drink a smoother texture and better taste.

, The skin should peel away easily. If you need to, score some vertical lines in the skin first with a knife, then peel it away. If you need to, use the edge of a spoon to help catch the edge of the skin first. Discard the skin when you are done., Cut the pumpkin into wedges or cubes first, then place it into a blender or food processor. Pour the water over it and blend. Keep blending until the pumpkin and water are evenly mixed. You will get a thick, soupy liquid. This is your pumpkin juice base., This includes the apple juice, the apricot nectar, vanilla essence, pumpkin pie spice, and sugar. If you have any leftover pumpkin juice base, pour it into an airtight container, and save it for another recipe.

For a healthier option, try it with honey instead.
For a twist, try it with brown sugar instead of white.
If you can't find apricot nectar, you can use peach nectar or pear nectar instead.

, Keep stirring until the ingredients are evenly mixed together, then wait for them to come to a boil., This allows all the flavors to infuse into one another. It also reduces the amount of water in the drink, giving you a more flavorful juice., The easiest way to do this is to fill a large bowl with ice and add just enough water to cover the ice. Then, pour the pumpkin juice into a smaller bowl, and place it into the ice; don't let any water get inside! Stir the juice to let the steam escape, then place it into the fridge once it reaches room temperature.

You can drink the juice while it is warm, but many people find that it tastes better while it is cold.

Drain the pressed juice into the olive juice mixture.,
Seal and shake the jar of juice.,
Store your olive juice in the refrigerator until ready to use.",How to Make Olive Juice," Cured olives work best because they are relatively easy to come by and can be preserved longer than fresh olives.


Water-cured olives can be used if you want a fresher flavor, but these olives tend to be considerably bitterer and do not last quite as long as brine-cured olives.
You could use fresh olives during harvest season, which falls out around late September through mid November, but fresh olives have a very bitter taste that may make the juice less palatable.
Dried olives should be avoided, since they do not contain enough juice to extract.
Use whole or pitted olives. Avoid olives that are stuffed with other ingredients.;
, Clean the olives under running water to rinse off any brine or dirt that may be on the surface. Even though you will end up placing the olives in a salty, brine-like solution later on, it is important that you wash off any old brine to avoid contaminating the solution you use with additional salt.

, Make two or three small holes in each olive. Piercing the olive allows the juices inside to soak into the liquid you will eventually sit your olives in.


Crushing the olives beforehand may release too much of the juice too early, causing you to lose it. If you do not pierce the olives, however, the juice may struggle to break through the skin and reach the liquid.

, The olives should fill the jar about halfway.

, Blend the ingredients together with a spoon. The liquid should have a murky appearance. If it still seems clear, you may need to add another 1 teaspoon (4.8 grams) of salt.

, Do not fill the jar to the top. Instead, leave about 4 inches (10 centimeters) of empty space in between the surface of the water and the brim of the jar.

, Push it down so that it sits beneath the surface of the water. This step is only optional, but peppermint does add a dimension of freshness to the olive juice.

, Make sure that the lid is securely held in place and will not loosen or come undone accidentally. Then, give the jar a vigorous shake to loosen the juice inside the olives and mix it with the other ingredients.

, The juice needs time to blend into the water and other ingredients. Leave the olives inside the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes or overnight.

, Shaking it again gives the ingredients one last time to mix together.

, Strain out the olives and the sprig of mint. Set the olives on a glass or plastic cutting board and discard the mint.

, Use the bottom of your larger, now empty glass jar. Press the bottom of the jar over each olive, crushing the olive and releasing additional juice.


Note that it is also important to use a plastic or glass cutting board. If you crush the olives on a wooden board, some of the juice may end up getting absorbed into the wood.
You may also find it helpful to use a plate or bowl. Many cutting boards do not have lips, so some of the juices could run off. If you crush the olives inside a bowl, however, the juices will remain.

, You may need to strain the juice out by scraping or dumping your pile of crushed olives into a strainer.

, Give the jar a vigorous shake to combine the new juice you added to the existing juice solution.

, Shake the jar before each use to make sure that none of the ingredients have settled or separated.

To fit them through the juicer easier, it helps to cut them. Use a sharp knife to cut the cucumber into quarters, the apple cut into eighths, and the pear into eighths.It usually isn’t necessary to cut the celery stalks before you add them to the juicer, but you can chop them into smaller pieces if you prefer.;
, After you’ve cut up the produce, turn your juicer on. Process the celery stalks, cucumber, apple, and pear through the juicer according to the manufacturer’s instructions in succession so all of the juices are combined.While the juices will be combined in the juicer’s receptacle, it’s a good idea to stir the mixture with a spoon to ensure that they’re completely blended.

, When all of the juices are blended, pour the mixture into a glass and drink at room temperature. If you prefer, you can chill the juice in the fridge before drinking.The recipe makes 12 ounces (355 ml) so make sure that you have a large enough glass or cup.

Puree the mango.,
Add cold water.,
Strain the juice into a tall glass.,
Stir in sugar and flavorings to taste.,
Try other mango drinks.",How to Make Mango Juice," Your mango juice will taste much better if your mango is perfectly ripe. To select a ripe mango, look for one that is fragrant when you pick it up. If you press the skin with your fingers, the mango should indent slightly, but it shouldn't feel soft.Judge a mango's ripeness by feel, not color. The skin may be yellow, green, orange, or red, depending on the variety.
If you're able to find Indian mango varieties such as Alphonso or Kesar, they make the best juice without too much fiber. If not, you'll just strain the fiber from the juice after you blend it.;
, Use a sharp knife to slice through the mango until you reach the pit. Cut the fruit around the pit (like you would for an avocado) and pull the two halves apart. Place the mouth of a glass where the skin meets the fruit and push the rim into the fruit to separate it from the skin. Repeat on the other side. Discard the skin and pit.If you don't like the glass method, separate the two mango halves and then use the knife to cut the fruit from the peel in chunks.
Or use a spoon to scoop the flesh from a very ripe mango.

, Place it in a blender and puree the mango until it's completely smooth. Make sure there are no mango chunks in the juice. If you're using a fibrous mango, you may see thin fibers in the juice, which you can later strain., Half a cup of water added to the blended mango will create a drink with the consistency of juice. Use very cold water, and stir it together with the blended mango using a spoon.


Blended mango is usually too thick to drink without adding water to dilute it a bit. Add more or less water depending on your tastes.
You can add milk, coconut water or another liquid in place of the water.

, Pour the mango juice through a fine-mesh strainer placed on top of a glass. You can skip this step if you don't mind having pulpy fiber in your mango juice.

, A very ripe, sweet mango may not need extra sugar. If you like your juice sweet, stir in a spoonful of sugar. You can also use honey, agave nectar or maple syrup in place of sugar. Other ingredients you can stir in for extra flavor include:1 tablespoon of fresh lemon or lime juice
1/2 teaspoon cardamon powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 tablespoon heavy cream or coconut milk

Add coconut whipped cream.,
Top your hot chocolate with paleo fudge.,
Spice your hot chocolate.",How to Make Paleo Hot Chocolate3," Coconut whipped cream is a delicious and paleo-friendly topping that is quite easy to make. To prepare coconut whipped cream, pour a 14 ounce (414 ml) can of chilled coconut cream into a large mixing bowl.Whisk with an electric mixer until creamy, about 30 seconds, then add in 3 tablespoons (44.37 ml) of coconut sugar.
Whisk until firm peaks form, about another 30 seconds, then scoop the coconut whipped cream on top of your hot chocolate.

, Paleo hot fudge is another topping that will make your paleo hot chocolate even more decadent! To make paleo hot fudge, melt 3 ½ tablespoons (51.7 ml) of chopped unsweetened dark chocolate in a double broiler over medium heat.To use a double broiler, place an inch (2.54 ml) of water in the lower pan of the broiler, and place the chocolate in the upper pan. The heat of the simmering water will evenly melt the chocolate.
Stir the chocolate until melted, then add 1 tablespoon of cacao powder, 2 ½ tablespoons of honey, 2 ½ tablespoons (36.97 ml) of full fat coconut milk, ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.
Once you have mixed the hot fudge ingredients together, take the fudge of the stove, let it cool for 5 minutes, then drizzle the hot fudge over your hot chocolate.

, A subtle and calorie- free way to garnish your hot chocolate is to add a pinch of your favorite sweet spice. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and ground anise are all great ways to add an extra touch to your paleo hot chocolate."

Garnish and serve the hot chocolate.",How to Make Peppermint Hot Chocolate2," You can use any type of milk you want, but whole milk will give you a richer hot chocolate than skim milk.

, You can use your fingers, or whack it a few times with a rolling pin. Breaking the chocolate into smaller pieces will help it melt faster. You can also use chocolate chips instead.

, The chocolate will give you a richer hot chocolate once it melts, as opposed to powdered cocoa.

, You can use a whisk or spatula. Don't let it come to a boil, or the chocolate will burn.

, This will give you that peppermint taste. If you want your hot chocolate to be less sweet, you can use less sugar, or skip it.

, Keep an eye on the saucepan, and don't let the sugar burn. If it does, it will caramelize and ruin the flavor.

, You can pour directly from the pot and into the mugs. If the pot is too heavy for you, use a soup ladle to scoop the hot chocolate out, and pour it into the mugs.

, Swirl some whipped cream on top of the hot chocolate, and add a sprinkle of crushed candy cane. If you don't like whipped cream, toss in a few marshmallows instead.


For a more festive treat, stick a candy cane into the hot chocolate.

Make chocolate sauce (optional).,
Blend together all ingredients.,
Serve with toppings.",How to Make Iced Chocolate2," This part is a bit tricky, so there's no shame in starting with store-bought sauce instead. If you're up for making it yourself, browse your options here or try this simple recipe:



Make a double boiler and pour a little water into the lower section.
Combine 7 oz (200g) finely chopped chocolate (any type) and ½ cup (120mL) heavy cream in the top of the double boiler. This is enough to make plenty of leftovers.
Bring to a simmer and stir constantly, until ingredients are mixed. If the chocolate loses its shine, reduce heat. If the sauce turns grainy, it's been overheated and is no longer usable.

, Blend 1 tbsp (15mL) chocolate sauce, 1½ cups (360mL) milk, ¾ cup (180mL) vanilla or chocolate ice cream, and a generous scoop of crushed ice. To make an ice cream float instead of a thick, sludgy drink, add the ice cream after blending instead.


If you don't have a blender, whisk the chocolate sauce into the milk and top with ice cream and crushed ice.
Adjust the amounts however you like. Depending on the type and brand of chocolate, you may need to add more chocolate sauce.

, Serve in a long glass with a straw and spoon. Optionally, add a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top, chopped nuts, or other ice cream toppings.

Sterilize a large jar.,
Pick ripe noni fruit.,
Wash the fruit and allow it to dry.,
Place the fruit into the jar and seal it with a lid.,
Allow the noni to ferment for six to eight weeks.,
Remove the sediment using a filter or strainer.,
Pasteurize the juice.,
Test the pH of the juice.,
Seal the jar and store the juice inside the refrigerator.",How to Make Noni Juice," Fill the jar with hot, soapy water and allow it to soak for at least five minutes. Scrub the inside and outside of the jar with a clean sponge or washcloth and rinse with hot water.


Choose a jar made of glass or food-grade plastic. Metal and plastic jars that are not food-grade may shed potentially harmful chemicals into the juice as it ferments.
The jar must be at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall by 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter. The average noni fruit is about 4 to 5 inches tall (10 to 13 centimeters).;
, Ripe noni fruit is a honey-yellow color. It is important that you pick the fruit before it turns completely white. If picking noni fruits by hand instead of purchasing them, remove the fruit carefully to avoid snapping the thin branches of the plant.

, Rinse the noni fruit under running water to remove any dirt. Place them in the sun and allow the fruit to dry for several hours. After several hours pass, the flesh will appear soft and translucent. The fruit will also begin to take on a foul odor. This is the stage you want the noni fruit to reach before fermenting.

, Fix the lid firmly onto the container, but do not take any additional measures to make the jar airtight. Allowing air to flow into the container openly can lead to contamination, making the lid necessary. Gases build up during the fermentation process, however. If you do not have a big enough jar, they can create a dangerous amount of pressure, but many of these gases may be able to force themselves out through the small gap that exists between the lid and container.

, Place the jar outside, preferably in a sunny location. During this time, the juice will seep out of the fruit naturally. It is initially a light amber color, but it will darken as the weeks pass.

, Juice is not the only thing to develop as the juice ferments. Pulp and other debris will also be mixed into the juice and must be filtered out. Pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer with small gaps and into a second sterilized jar. The juice should pour through relatively easily and should not need much, if any, assistance to flow through the mesh.


You can also use silkscreen, paint strainers, or cheesecloth to make sure that as much sediment as possible is separated from the noni juice.

, You can drink unpasteurized juice, but pasteurized juice lasts longer and is safer to drink. Place the open jar of noni juice into a pot of boiling water. The water level should cover that of the juice, but it should not be so high that it threatens to enter the mouth of the jar. Once the temperature of the juice reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 degrees Celsius), allow the juice to boil for 30 minutes before removing the jar from the water.

, Use litmus paper to check the pH of the juice. Properly fermented juice should have a pH of 3.5 or less. Anything higher may suggest that the noni juice has been contaminated.

, Fermented noni juice can technically be stored at room temperature for an indefinite period of time, but storing it in the refrigerator ensures optimal freshness. As a general rule, you may also want to consider disposing of fermented noni juice after two years just to keep your supply as fresh as possible.

, Stir from time to time with a whisk or spatula so that it does not scorch. Don't let it come to a boil., Set it down on a heat-safe surface.

, You are adding the vanilla extract to help give the white chocolate some flavor, so that it does not taste too much like milk. If you'd like a more minty flavor, use a little bit more peppermint extract.

, Simply pour the hot chocolate straight from the pot and into the mugs. If the saucepan is too heavy for you to lift, use a soup ladle to scoop up the hot chocolate, and transfer it to the mugs.

, Marshmallows go well with hot chocolate, but you can also top it with whipped cream instead. If you really want to get fancy, sprinkle some crushed peppermint candy can over the whipped cream.


If you have any candy canes, you can stick it into the hot chocolate as a final touch.

, Because you are working with such small amounts, you might want to use a spoon or fork. Don't worry about turning the heat on just yet.

, You can use whatever milk you like, such as almond or soy. If you are simply allergic to dairy (and not vegan) you might like lactose-free cow's milk.

, Stir the mixture with a whisk to keep it from scorching.

Finished.

",How to Make Makgeolli," Throughout the process of making the makgeolli, ensure that every utensil and container is properly sterilized. Also see Warnings below.

, For best results, do this for up to 30 times.;
, Let it sit for about an hour.

, Add a cup of sugar to 3 cups of water, bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Put this aside and let it cool to the required temperature for whatever yeast you choose.

, There are multiple methods to use for steaming rice. You can use a steamer and cheesecloth, or you can use a bamboo basket. Be sure to boil the cloth or the basket in water to sterilize it either one.


Steam until rice is slightly yellow.
Stir the rice every so often, to cook it evenly.

, You can do this two ways:


Leave in the bowl and let cool. This will take a longer time and the internal temperature will be higher than the outer sections.
Spread over a clean surface and allow it to cool evenly. Make sure that the surface is sterilized and cleaned very well, otherwise it will be contaminated.

, Use purified water for the best taste. Tap water can be used, but it is not recommended. You can also boil the water before adding it if you are unsure of its quality.


If you choose to boil the water, make sure it is the right temperature before adding the yeast and rice, otherwise you will kill the yeast and ruin the batch.

, The following will explain the two methods:


For nuruk, moisten with water and create a paste, add in the yeast and mix well. Add the paste to the rice and mix well.
For amylase enzyme powder, mix with the rice and work in thoroughly. You can add yeast now, or later, it does not matter for this method.

, Be sure to stir it well.

, Take note of the temperature requirement for the yeast you are using. Avoid exposure to light, especially UV radiation. The paper towel will prevent insects from flying in and dying, but also allow for the mixture to breathe.

, Stir at least once a day with a sterilized spoon.

, You can also use a white t-shirt. Be sure to boil your choice of cloth before using and that it is clean and free of harmful chemicals.

, Usually, adding 3 parts water to 2 parts makgeolli is necessary. (This is optional.)

, You will need to keep the makgeolli cold and covered. You may bottle it if you like, or ""back-sweeten"" it to your taste.


When bottling, make sure you leave the cap slightly unscrewed in order to prevent it from exploding when you open it. Soda bottles or makgeolli bottles (the ones in which the commercial version is sold) can be used because they are built for pressure.

, The traditional method of drinking it is from a bowl.

You can either harvest these on your own if they grow in your area, or you can find them at farmers markets, local farms, or specialty grocers. Because you'll be using the flowers for food, look for spray- or pesticide-free flowers. The supplies you'll need include:Large saucepan
Fruit zester
Sharp knife
Large heat-proof mixing bowl
Large bowl and funnel
Strainer
Cheese cloth
Bottles or mason jars (with lids) for storing
Scissors
Mixing spoon
Two clean tea towels;
, Pour the water and sugar into a large saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Once that happens, increase the heat slightly and bring the mixture to a boil.Once the syrup boils, remove it from the heat. Set it aside to cool as you prepare the other ingredients.

, Use your fingers to pick out any insects, dirt, and dead flowers. You don’t want to wash the flowers, because washing will remove the pollen, which is where the flowers get most of their delicate flavor.Use the scissors to trim the stems off the flowers. The stems are actually poisonous and bitter, so remove as much of them as possible. A few stems in the mix won’t hurt you, but you really only want the flowers to make the cordial.Place the cleaned and trimmed flowers into the heat-proof mixing bowl.

, Use the zester to remove the zest from one lemon and one orange. Add the zest into the bowl with the flowers.Then cut all the lemons and oranges into slices and add them to the bowl as well. Sprinkle the citric acid over the mixture.


With your hands or a spoon, mix the flowers, zest, fruit slices, and citric acid together.
The citric acid serves as a preservative in this recipe.

, Pour the syrup over the fruit and citrus mixture and give it all a stir. Cover the bowl with the clean, dry tea towel and let it sit.

For the best results, let the cordial sit like this, covered and at room temperature, for 24 to 48 hours. This will give the syrup time to become infused with the flavors of the flowers and the citrus., After one or two days, it’s time to strain the cordial. Position the strainer on top of a clean bowl and line the strainer with cheesecloth. Pour in the cordial mixture, using the cheesecloth to strain out the flowers, zest, and fruit slices.Let the mixture drain through for a few minutes. You can also squeeze the fruit inside the cheesecloth to remove as much cordial as possible.
If you don’t have cheesecloth, you can use a piece of muslin, a jelly bag, or a clean tea towel.

, As the cordial drains through the cheesecloth, sterilize the jars to prepare them for bottling. To sterilize them, run the jars through the dishwasher and wash the lids by hand in hot, soapy water.Let them cool before bottling the cordial.

To sterilize without a dishwasher, wash the bottles and lids by hand. Dry the bottles and leave the lids to air dry. Transfer the bottles to a roasting pan and bake them in a 320 F (160 C) oven for 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool., Once all the cordial has been strained from the fruit and flowers, you can bottle it or use it immediately. Use the funnel to pour the cordial into sterilized bottles or mason jars. Transfer the filled bottles to the refrigerator.

Homemade elderflower cordial will last for up to six weeks in the fridge., There are lots of ways you can enjoy elderflower cordial, and one of the simplest is to make a refreshing soda drink. Fill a large glass with ice water or chilled sparkling water, add 1 to 3 tablespoons (15 to 45 ml) of cordial and stir.You can also add elderflower cordial to lemonade, iced tea, and other drinks.

, Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of cordial to a glass of champagne or sparkling wine to make a fresh summer drink.You can also add a dash of cordial to a shot of vodka or gin served on the rocks with water, or to any fruity or floral cocktail.

, Flower and fruit flavors complement each other nicely, so you can add elderflower cordial to fruit salads to add some extra sweetness and a floral aroma.

When your fruit salad is ready, drizzle a bit of cordial over top and give it one final stir before serving., Next time you have to make ice, fill the ice cube tray with water, then pour the water into a bowl. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of cordial, stir, and refill the ice cube trays.Freeze the ice and use in drinks, smoothies, and other concoctions.

, Next time you're baking a cake, making icing or frosting, or enjoying a bowl of ice cream, add a floral hint with elderflower cordial.

For cakes and icings, replace vanilla extract with cordial and add an extra tablespoon or two (15 to 30 ml) of cordial.
For ice cream, simply drizzle the cordial over the ice cream like you would with chocolate syrup.

, You don’t need much to pick elderflowers, but you will need a sharp pair of scissors and a paper bag.

It’s best to store cut flowers in paper, because a paper bag will allow them to breathe., Elder plants tend to flower between mid-May and July, so late spring and early summer are your best bet for harvesting flowers for cordial.

It’s best to harvest elderflowers on bright, dry, sunny days, and preferably in the morning., You want elderflowers that are ripe and ready to use, but not past their prime. Look for large flowers that are fully in bloom, and choose ones with the fewest dead or brown flowers.

Don’t use flowers that still have green buds.

, With your scissors, cut the stalks to separate the flower heads from the stems. Keep the flower heads upright to preserve the pollen, and gently place the flowers in the bag.Only take a few flower heads from each bush, and then move on to gather more from another bush. This leaves plenty of flowers for the plant itself and for other insects.

, Freshly cut flowers that are going to be used for cordial should be used within 24 hours to ensure freshness and maximum flavor.

Store the flowers in a cool, dry place until you're ready to use them.

Choose organic coffee brands.,
Opt for decaf coffee if you have certain health conditions.,
Choose light roasted coffee beans for an antioxidant boost.,
Drink no more than 3-5 cups per day.,
Make other lifestyle changes to reap maximum health benefits.",How to Choose Coffee for Health Benefits1," Organic coffee beans have been grown without the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. While scientists haven’t established whether using pesticides to grow coffee leads to pesticide residues on the beans themselves, pesticides are harmful to the planet and to farm workers. Pesticides increase polluted water runoff, and may lead to symptoms like headaches, dizziness, and difficulty breathing in farm workers. Organic brands may be a little pricey, but they are the healthiest choice for the planet, and probably for your own health.Some studies have shown small increases in nutrients in organic produce compared to conventionally grown produce. This means organic coffee may actually be healthier for you.Check for the USDA organic label on your coffee. Some brands may claim to be organic, but you cannot be sure they adhere to USDA organic standards unless their product bears the label.;
, You should stick to decaf coffee if you are pregnant. Studies suggest that caffeine may stunt fetal growth and increase risk of stillbirth or miscarriage.Caffeine may also complicate regulation of hypertension and diabetes, so decaf is probably the best option if you have either of these conditions.At the same time, caffeine has been linked to health benefits. Caffeinated coffee, but not decaf, has been associated with lower risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and dementia.Talk to your doctor to see what type of coffee, if any, is safe for you to consume.

, Some studies have shown that light roasted coffee beans have higher levels of antioxidants, which protect against molecular damage and may prevent certain diseases. For example, a study published in 2017 found that light roasted coffee beans yielded coffee with higher levels of chlorogenic acid, a major antioxidant, compared to darker roasts. However, more research is needed to verify these findings.Although coffee is high in antioxidants, studies have not conclusively demonstrated that high levels of antioxidants in coffee translate to higher antioxidant levels in the body.Antioxidants in coffee may have negative health effects as well. Chlorogenic acid has been associated with atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by clogged arteries., The USDA 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines state that drinking 3 to 5 8oz cups of caffeinated coffee per day can be part of a healthy diet. This level of consumption has not been linked to health problems.However, the USDA does not encourage people who do not drink coffee to start.

, While evidence shows that drinking up to 6 cups of coffee a day does not have adverse health effects for most populations, the health benefits of coffee are less clear. If you're trying to improve your health, you should turn your attention to other lifestyle factors. Focus on exercising more and eating a diet high in fruits and veggies.Coffee may be protective against certain cancers, Parkinson’s, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, but more research is needed.

Use a filter when brewing your coffee.,
Use filtered water to brew your coffee.,
Drink your coffee black.,
Use non-fat milk.,
Skip the sugar.,
Try flavoring your coffee with spices.",How to Choose Coffee for Health Benefits2," Unfiltered coffee has been associated with higher “bad” cholesterol levels. By contrast, paper filters are able to trap the compounds in coffee that raise cholesterol. Be sure to use a filter when brewing coffee at home.Avoid french press coffee, boiled coffee, or Turkish coffee, as these are unfiltered.

, More than half of the chemicals found in tap water are unregulated, and some experts believe the standards are too lenient for those that are. Filtering your water can remove potentially harmful chemicals like nitrates, arsenic, and lead. Use filtered water to brew a healthier cup of joe.Ask for your water utility company’s annual water quality report. This will tell you about potentially harmful substances in your local water, and can guide your filter purchasing process. Pick a filter that removes problematic chemicals in your water and is NSF International certified.

, Black coffee has the lowest calories per serving. Adding creamer, sugar, and syrups increases caloric content of your coffee, increasing risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. If you can stomach it, opt for black coffee., If you can't get used to black coffee, go for a dash of non-fat milk instead of whole milk and creamers. Whole milk and creamers are high in fat, and those calories can add up over time.Low fat soy, almond, or rice milk are good substitutes for non-fat cow’s milk.

, Sugar sweetened beverages have been associated with significant health consequences, including increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.Black, sugar-free coffee is best, but if you need your coffee sweetened, you should use small amounts of sugar or select an artificial sweetener.

However, data suggests artificial sweeteners may have health consequences of their own. Studies have linked artificial sweetener to weight gain, type II diabetes, and heightened sugar cravings. If you want to sweeten your coffee, it may be better to use a small amount of sugar rather than an artificial sweetener., Instead of using sugar or creamers high in sugar and fat to flavor your coffee, try using natural spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom are all good sources of nutrients.

Cardamom, for example, is rich in vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, and potassium."

Order your coffee black.,
Choose non-fat milk.,
Avoid specialty drinks.,
Try spices instead of syrups to add flavor.",How to Choose Coffee for Health Benefits3," Black coffee is healthier, and easier on your wallet as a bonus., Black coffee isn't for everyone. If you need to, order your coffee drinks with non-fat milk instead of creamer or whole milk. You’ll avoid a lot of unnecessary calories.Some coffeehouses call non-fat milk ""skim milk,"" so don't be confused.

, Avoid specialty drinks, like Frappuccinos, which tend to be high in sugar and fat. Instead, go for a plain coffee.If you decide to go for a specialty coffee drink, order the smallest size.
Many coffeehouses list the calories in each of their drinks. If you really want a specialty drink but aren’t sure which is the healthiest, pick the drink with the lowest calories--it is probably relatively low in sugar and fat.

, You should avoid syrups when possible, as these are high in sugar. Spices are available at most coffee shops, and can be a healthy alternative to flavored syrups."

Garnish as desired.",How to Make a Malt," Place the malt powder and instant dry milk in a small bowl. Whisk the two ingredients together until the mixture appears evenly blended.If you want to make a chocolate malted milkshake, you can use either plain malt powder or chocolate malt powder. To make chocolate malt powder, add the unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry milk and malt powder and whisk together.;
, Pour the powder into a fine mesh sieve. Force it through the sieve by gently agitating the utensil.


Keep a second bowl beneath the sieve to catch the sifted powder.
If necessary, you can also push down on the powder with the top of your whisk to help force it through the sieve.
Note that you will probably need to do this step if you make chocolate malt powder but may not need to if you only make plain malt powder.

, You can use the malt powder immediately or save it for later.


Excess malt powder not used for the malted milkshake can also be stored.
To store the malt powder, spoon it into an airtight container and hold it at room temperature for up to one year.

, Scoop the ice cream into the container of a blender. If you want to add vanilla extract or chocolate syrup, pour that into the blender, as well.


For best results, choose a dense vanilla ice cream. The container will usually say something like ""rich,"" ""creamy,"" or ""premium,"" and it should feel notably heavier when compared to other brands of ice cream available in similarly sized containers.The vanilla extract should only be added if you want to amplify the flavor of a vanilla malt. You do not need to add it to the malt when preparing another flavor.
Change flavors by adding an appropriately flavored syrup. Chocolate malts are the most traditional, but you can add nearly any drink or dessert syrup—strawberry, caramel, cherry, and so on—in similar proportions.
The most authentic flavoring technique is to add flavored syrup to vanilla ice cream, but you can technically save money by skipping the syrup and using a flavored ice cream, instead.

, Add 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of your previously prepared malted milk powder to the blender. Blend on high speed until combined.


Whole milk is strongly recommended since it will lend the creamiest, most authentic flavor to the malt. If desired, though, you could substitute whole milk for 2% milk or skim milk.
You may need to add more malted milk powder, and you'll definitely need to add more milk. It is better to start with too little than too much, however. More can easily be added, but it will be impossible to remove any excess once you already blend it into the malt.

, Gradually add more milk to adjust the consistency and more malted milk powder to adjust the taste.The consistency can usually be gauged without directly touching the milkshake, but to determine whether or not the taste is to your liking, you'll need to pause the blender and take a small sample with a spoon. Make sure that you use a clean spoon each time you sample the taste to avoid contamination.
Add the milk 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time, up to a possible total of 2 cups (500 ml). Use a total of 1 cup (250 ml) for a thicker malt or a total of 2 cups (500 ml) for a thinner malt.
Blend in additional malted milk powder 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) at a time. You can add up to the full amount of prepared malted milk powder. If you prefer a less potent “malt” taste, use less powder and store the rest for another occasion.

, Once the malt satisfies your own sense of taste, blend it just long enough to break up any remaining large chunks of ice cream.


Periodically pause the blender and mix the contents of the blender basin with a spoon. As you hand mix the malt, use the spoon to push any notably large chunks of ice cream further down toward the blender blades.
Avoid over-blending the malt mixture since doing so could cause the mixture to become too thin. You will only need to blend it for about one to two minutes total.

, Evenly distribute the prepared malt between three to four tall glasses.


You may need to use a spoon to help coax the malt into each glass.
For added flair, consider pouring the malt into frosted glasses. To chill your milkshake glasses:

Rinse the outside of the glasses in water but do not dry them.
Place the glasses in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until a thin layer of frost forms on the surface.



, Top each malt with a dollop of whipped cream. Add any other desired garnishes, then enjoy the drink immediately.


Consider cutting a few malted milk balls in half and decorating the top of the malted milkshake with those.Alternatively, you could dust the whipped cream with sprinkles or drop a maraschino cherry on top.
Serve the malt with both a spoon and a straw.

Inquire about green coffee bean storage methods.,
Inquire about the processing methods.,
Purchase green coffee beans in bulk.",How to Buy Green Coffee Beans," Much like wine, coffee beans come from numerous regions all around the world and each has a distinct taste depending on the environment it was grown in. Green coffee beans from Mexico may have hazelnut flavor undertones, whereas green coffee beans from Guatemala may have natural chocolate undertones.;
, The green coffee beans you buy must all be generally the same color, shape and size. Coffee beans of the same size will roast more evenly, whereas smaller beans may roast quicker and affect the overall taste. Green coffee beans of different colors may indicate potential drying problems and different shapes may indicate that a different strain of bean may have been mixed in.

, Defects such as fermenting or smoke damage can be easily detected in raw green coffee beans.

, Coffee beans should not be pliable or too fragile. Flexible beans have not been dried properly and are highly likely to become moldy, whereas fragile or brittle beans have been dried for either too long or at too high of a temperature.

, Find out how the green coffee beans were stored by the producer or on the plantation. Green coffee beans should be always be separated by geographic origin in addition to the strain of bean when storing in silos or other locations.

, Green coffee beans should always be processed immediately after harvesting or else they become fermented immediately. Processing will also help separate any sticks, leaves, overripe coffee cherries and undeveloped coffee cherries from the ripe green coffee beans.

, Plantations will usually sell green coffee beans in increments of 5 lb (2.27 kg) bags or more, which may lower the price you pay for coffee beans considerably.

Consider how the beans are roasted.,
Splurge a little and buy yourself a bag or can of lily or Segafredo coffee.,
Try organic coffee.,
Do not be afraid to buy espresso roast or espresso grinds for brewed coffee.,
Try to avoid buying coffee from grocery stores as even higher end coffee may sit on the shelf for months at a time and even air sealing will not prevent the flavor of the coffee from deteriorating.,
Consider buying Fair Trade or Direct Trade coffee.,
Try using shade grown coffee.",How to Choose Coffee," How the beans were roasted is very important. French roast is pretty strong, Italian roast even stronger. As a rule of thumb, the darker the bean the stronger the coffee.;
, These are two very popular Italian brands and most serious coffee lovers will adore the taste. You may also choose other high quality gourmet brands like Gevalia or even Starbucks.

, Some coffee brands use a lot of chemicals during the growing and roasting process which affects the taste and could possibly affect how your body reacts to the beans. Organic coffee steers clear of the bad stuff. Not all chemicals are toxic or bad, though, and the lack of standards in organic farming can prevent you from making an educated, informed decision. Be sure to do your own careful and thorough research.

, Lavazza and Medaglia D'Oro, or El Pico, are all good espressos that you can brew as a full pot of coffee. Just use a little less and tamp it down after filling the filter basket.

, Buy from coffee shops and local roasters where there is a little more certainty about the age of the coffee.

, Fair Trade certification ensures a minimum price per pound for coffee growers; however, this amount may not reflect changing economic conditions that increase the cost of coffee production. Direct Trade practices---although not monitored by a third-party trade organization---establish a direct exchange between roasters and growers. Roasters engage in face-to-face discussion with growers and see their product first-hand, encouraging higher-quality coffee, better labor standards and higher wages to sustain the grower-roaster relationship.

, If a coffee is shade grown, it means they didn't have to clear-cut land in order to maximize the number of coffee plants they could grow. Instead, they choose a more environmentally sound way to grow the plants. Often shade grown coffee is also organic.

Listen to each step as is.,

Use cheat-sheets.",How to Become an Effective Barista," It's easy to remember a drink if you repeat the exact or similar way they said it. As you repeat it to yourself, retrieve the cup needed (so you know what size), start the number of espresso shots required for the specific drink and as the shots are pouring, steam the milk. Finally, add any necessary items to complete the drink.;
, Use codes or circle the letters on top of the cup cover. Have a system that is comfortable for you or that other baristas working with you know what they are. You might not want to write the entire thing during a rush or if you have a line, especially if the drink is complicated or detailed.

, When items or details get altered, you may have to restart. If a person wants a hot drink, but you accidentally create a cold one, don't worry! Just apologize and make a new one. It happens to everyone! Take your time! It's better to get a drink right than have a customer come back unhappy/disappointed.

, Progress by looking at them every so often or when necessary, until you feel confident to make drinks without the help.

Keep smell in mind.,
Know that the length of your roast is based on the color of the beans.,
Listen for the crackling sound.",How to Roast Coffee Beans1," When you first begin heating your green coffee beans, they will turn a yellowish color and start to emit a grassy smell. When they actually begin to roast, they will start to smoke and smell like true coffee., While you will start out with ‘green’ beans, when they begin to roast, your beans will go through a whole array of color. A good rule of thumb is to keep in mind that the darker the bean, the fuller the body of the bean.


Light brown: This color is generally avoided as it can result in a sour taste. The body is weak, the aroma medium and the sweetness low.
Light-medium brown: This roast is common in the eastern United States. It has a full body, a full aroma, and a mild sweetness.
Full medium brown: This is a common roast in the Western United States. It has a full body, strong aroma, and mild sweetness.
Medium-dark brown: This roast is also known as a Light French or Viennese roast. It has a very full body, a strong aroma, and a strong sweetness.
Dark brown: This is known as espresso or French. It has a full body, a medium aroma, and a full sweetness.
Very dark (nearly black): This is also known as Spanish and Dark French. It has a weak body, a mild aroma, and a low sweetness.

, As the beans begin to roast, the water inside them will begin to evaporate, causing a crackling sound to occur. There are generally two stages of crackling called first and second cracking. These two sounds occur as the temperature rises while the roasting occurs.

Don’t drink the last sip.",How to Make Turkish Coffee," Turkish coffees are small beverages made with strong coffee. Each cup of coffee should be made with about 2 teaspoons (3.5 g) of coffee grounds. If you're working with whole beans that must be ground, measure 2 heaping teaspoons of beans for each coffee.


Arabica beans are most often used for Turkish coffee, and Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi is among the most popular brands.;
, Because Turkish coffee doesn’t get filtered, it’s important to grind the beans extremely finely. You can use a Turkish coffee mill if you have one, or use the finest setting on an electric grinder. You can also grind fresh beans at the grocery store, and many of these grinders have a Turkish coffee setting.Properly ground Turkish coffee beans will look like soft cocoa powder.Because the beans must be so finely ground, many people purchase pre-ground Turkish coffee blends.

, Turkish coffee is served in a special cup known as a fincan. The easiest way to measure the water for the coffee is to pour the water into the fincan. Measure one and a half fincans worth of water for each coffee. This works out to about 1.7 ounces (50 ml) of water.For the best tasting coffee, always use water that’s cold and fresh.

, Sugar is an optional ingredient in Turkish coffee, and everybody has an individual preference. There are typically four sugar levels used to sweeten Turkish coffee:Sade: no sugar (unsweetened)
Az seker: 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of sugar (mildly sweet)
Orta: 2 teaspoons (9 g) of sugar (sweet)
Sekerli: 3 to 4 teaspoons (14 to 18.75 g) of sugar (very sweet)

, Turkish coffee is brewed in a cezve (also called an ibrik). This is a small, long-handled pot made of brass or copper.Combine the coffee, water, and desired amount of sugar in the cezve and stir vigorously to combine all the ingredients.

For an added spice, you can also stir in ⅛ teaspoon (0.25 g) of cardamom to the cezve, or a single cardamom pod.If you don’t have a cezve, you can use a small saucepan instead. A cezve can be purchased online, or from some specialty coffee shops.

, Turn a gas stove to low flame, or an electric stove to low heat. Place the pot on the heat and stir the ingredients together for one minute. After a minute, stop stirring and leave the coffee to brew.Keep the heat or flame low when you brew the coffee. You don’t want the water to boil, or it will change the flavor of the coffee and destroy the foam that you want to build., One of the most important elements of Turkish coffee is the foam that forms on top. As the coffee brews, the dark foam will build around the rim of the beverage. This will take three to four minutes. Pay close attention to the coffee as it brews to watch for the foam, but don’t stir it.If the coffee looks like it might begin to boil, remove it from the heat for a few seconds to cool it down.

, After three to four minutes, when the foam has formed on the top of the coffee, remove the cezve from the heat and pour the foam into your fincan. Then, return the cezve to the heat.To remove the foam from the cezve, you may have to use a spoon to help pour it out.

, Brew the coffee for an additional 15 to 20 seconds after returning it to the heat.This will give the coffee a chance to raise again, which means coming close to a boil and creating new foam.

Some traditions call for three to four raisings (removing the cezve from the heat, pouring out the foam, and returning it to the heat), whereas some say to do this once or not at all. You can experiment with different methods to find your preferred flavors.

, After about 20 seconds, remove the cezve from the heat. Pour the full contents of the cezve into the fincan, foam, grounds, and all. Serve the coffee immediately while it’s still hot and fresh., After pouring the coffee, use a damp cloth to clean any coffee that may have spilled on the rim or down the side of the fincan. Place the fincan on a saucer before serving it., In Turkey and many other areas of the world, it is considered disrespectful to serve younger guests before older ones. When you're making coffee for a group of people, always serve the coffee first to the older guests, and then serve according to age (from eldest to youngest)., As the coffee cools in the fincan, the grounds will settle to the bottom. This will allow you to enjoy the coffee without drinking the grounds. Let the coffee sit for at least 30 seconds before taking your first sip., Turkish coffee is often served with a few small treats or sweet snacks, and a piece of Turkish delight is a wonderful way to complement the coffee. Other treats you can serve with this coffee include:Cookies
Chocolates
Candies

, Sipping water is a great way to clean your palate, so Turkish coffee is usually served with a glass of water. That way, you can take a sip before drinking the coffee and get the most enjoyment out of it., This type of coffee is small and strong, and it’s best consumed in small sips.Not only will this help the coffee last longer, but the air you breathe in when you sip will also help aerate the coffee and bring out its flavors., The final one to two sips of Turkish coffee are coffee grounds that have settled on the bottom. When you get near the end of your coffee, set it down on the saucer without drinking the last bit, otherwise you'll get a mouthful of grounds."

Preheat your oven to 450 °F (232 °C).,
Lay the beans out on the pan.,
Roast the beans for 15 to 20 minutes.,
Remove the beans from the oven.",How to Roast Coffee Beans2," While your oven is preheating, ready your pan. For this method you will need a baking sheet that has many small holes or slots and a lip that will keep all of the beans in the pan. These pans can be found at any kitchen supply store.If you don’t want to buy a new pan but happen to have an old baking sheet with a lip lying around, you can actually make your own roasting sheet. Take your pan and use a ⅛ inch drill bit to carefully drill holes into the sheet. The holes should be ½ inch away from each other and small enough that none of the beans will fall through them.;
, Pour the beans onto the sheet so that they lie in one layer over the entire pan. The beans should be close together but should not be overlapping. Once the oven is preheated, place the baking sheet with the beans onto the middle rack of the oven.

, Listening for a cracking or popping noise. This is the water contained in the beans evaporating. The popping noise signifies that the beans are roasting and darkening. Stir them around every few minutes to help them develop an even roast., When they are roasted to your satisfaction, remove them immediately from the heat. To help them cool down, pour the beans into a metal colander and stir them around. This will help cool the beans as well as remove the chaff.

Place the empty popper onto the stove top.,
Add the coffee beans.,
Listen for the crackling noise.,
Check the beans’ color frequently.",How to Roast Coffee Beans3," Bring it to a medium heat so that the temperature of the popper is about 450 °F (232 °C). If possible, use a deep fryer or candy thermometer to check the temperature of the popper.


If you don’t have a popcorn popper and don’t want to buy one, you can use a large skillet or pan. Make sure that it is very clean or else your beans might pick up the flavor of whatever was cooked before them.

, You should only roast 8 ounces of coffee beans at a time. Close the lid of the popper and begin turning the crank handle. You will need to continue stirring constantly so that your beans are roasted evenly.


If you are using a pan or skillet you will need to stir constantly as well--there is much more of a chance for the beans to burn in a skillet or pan.

, After about four minutes (though it can take up to seven minutes) you should begin to hear a crackling sound--this means that the beans are beginning to roast. At the same time, the beans will start producing coffee-smelling smoke that can be really potent. Turn on your oven hood fan and open a window to let the smoke out. Note the time when the beans start to crackle.

, After the crackling starts, wait one minute and then begin to check the color of the beans. When the beans have reached the color you want, pour them out into a metal colander and continue to stir them until the beans cool.

Consider the pros and cons.,
Consider a hot air roaster.,
Finished.

",How to Roast Coffee Beans4," Mechanized roasters are a more expensive, yet extremely efficient, roasting option. These appliances work in the same way that the popcorn popper does--hot air is blown across the beans. However, these roasters result in a very even roast.

, These types of roasters are also called fluid bed roasters. This type of roaster has a glass container that allows you to monitor the color of the beans as they roast, allowing you to roast them to your desired color.Roasters of this variety include the FreshRoast8, Hearthware I-Roast 2, and the Nesco Professional. Follow your appliance’s instructions to roast your beans to perfection.

Presoak the filter and mug by taking the kettle off the heat and pouring boiling water over the filter.,
Measure out the water.,
Dump out the water that's in the mug.,
Add the grounds to the filter.

,
Pour a little almost boiling water over the grounds, just enough to soak them.,
Pour the rest of the water into the dripper in a spiral pattern, beginning at the center.,
Wait for the water to drain all the way into the mug and enjoy your delicious coffee!

",How to Make Pour Over Coffee," You will need about twelve ounces (340g) if you want to make enough coffee for one mug, although you will need some extra in order to soak the filter, so put much more water to boil than you think you'll need.


The type of water used matters. It should always be fresh and cold and never distilled or chemically softened. If you do not like drinking tap water, it stands to reason that you will probably prefer coffee made with filtered water instead. However, be aware that soft water isn't ideal as a coffee base because it lacks the flavor-enhancing minerals and sodium found in hard water.;
, You will get the best flavor from coffee that has been freshly ground in your kitchen, but you can also use preground coffee. Generally, it's best to use one tablespoon of grounds for every cup of water (or approximate six ounces/170g), but it may differ for the type of coffee and your tastes. Another rule of thumb is one tablespoon of whole coffee beans per three ounces of water. Bear in mind that being generous with the coffee is always better than being stingy. You can always dilute coffee after brewing it but you can't make it stronger.

, Place the dripper on top of the mug, and place a paper filter inside. Usually a ceramic or glass dipper is best for extracting the most of the coffee flavor.


Some filters need to be folded. Check your filter's instructions.

, This will rinse out any persistent paper taste.

, For example, with three tablespoons of beans having been freshly ground, nine ounces of water will do. Use a measuring cup with a good pouring spout if you can. Let it sit and cool to off-boil (195°F or 90°C) while you take the next step.

, Pour any milk and sugar into the mug being used for the coffee. This way you can brew directly into your cup and any sugars will dissolve nicely. If you're making pour over, though, you'll probably enjoy the coffee without any additives.

,, The coffee will begin to froth, and create a ""flume."" Wait 30 seconds for the flume to go down somewhat.

, With some dripper/filter setups it's recommended that you don't pour directly onto the filter; always pour onto the grounds. While pouring, make sure the dripper stays on top of the mug––sometimes it can topple over! As you're pouring, check that the mug does not overflow.

, The fastest way to do this is to press down and roll the beans towards the bag opening. Be sure that there are no air pockets. Zip and seal the bag while it's still rolled up.


Another way to remove air from a bag is to zip the bag except for the last half inch, gently pinch each end of the half inch unzipped seam, push together slightly to open the seam, and use your lips/mouth to gently suck the air from the bag (it is easy if you use a straw to suck the air out), pinching and zipping the bag closed. You can actually get a good ""vacuum"" in the bag this way with practice.

, The ideal place would be next to your usual coffee containers.,


If the bag is puffed up, the beans are within 7-10 days of roasting, signaled by the fact that they're still releasing carbon dioxide.

Find the right popcorn popper.,
Modify it for roasting coffee (optional).,
Buy the beans.,
Ventilate your work area.",How to Roast Coffee in a Popcorn Popper1," The most important thing to look for in your popper is a unit that feeds in hot air from vents in the side of the popping chamber, as opposed to a grate in the bottom. (One with the single grate in the bottom does not force enough air to keep the coffee from burning and would be a major fire hazard). With this in mind, take a look around the marketplace and see what’s around. Brands of poppers to look for are 1) Proctor-Silex Popcorn Pumper and Poppery II by West Bend.;
,


The plastic lid that comes with the unit may be unsuitable for its new role - it might melt, so throw it away.
Extend the chamber to roast larger batches. Glue an extension made from a food tin to the top of the unit using epoxy resin. (See Tips for alternate method.)
Make a simple lid from a kitchen sieve and a flat panel with holes in it (such as pieces of meccano) to collect the chaff.

, You need raw green coffee beans to roast. Luckily there are a lot of places you can get these from. Search the Internet and shop around. Three of many sources are Gen-X Coffee, U-Roast-Em, and Sweet Maria's. (You can insure the future of coffee growers by buying only those beans from sites that support Fair Trade practices).

, While the wafting coffee aroma can be wonderful in small doses, filling the house will soon affect furniture and carpets causing them to emit an unpleasant odor. Ideally, roasting can be done outside.

Weigh out the green beans.,
Pour the beans in the roaster.,
Check the beans often Remove the filter if you’ve fitted one on (it will be very hot!),
Stop roasting once you've got beans of a color you like.",How to Roast Coffee in a Popcorn Popper2," By weight, green beans to roasted beans should be weighed at a ratio of about 1.2:1. A larger volume of green beans will result in a slightly longer roasting time. Just a few scoops might provide a very light, open flavor and increasing the volume will offer more depth. See the Tips below for some guidelines.

, Stick around - watch, listen and smell as the roast progresses. Watch as the sugars slowly caramelize, the water evaporates and the oils begin to cook. After about 2 1/2 minutes of roasting, you’ll hear the beans begin to crack. At about 4-6 minutes, the second crack occurs and small shards will come off the beans, creating a crater appearance on some of the beans.

, and peer into the roaster. If you have a metal measuring scoop you can simply lower this into the popper to take a quick sample to judge for color of the beans.

, When you choose to stop the roast is entirely up to you but a good place is just into the second crack. After about 5 minutes you’ll have a good medium brown roast, and after 6 1/2 minutes you’ll have a great, dark, shiny roast. Any longer than this and the beans will start to burn. Just experiment with a few batches and you’ll soon discover what you like/dislike.

Cool the beans quickly as soon as they are finished to stop further cooking.,
For the best results, rest the beans for at least 24 hours to let the excess C02 escape (called de-gassing).",How to Roast Coffee in a Popcorn Popper3," Put them into a sieve or a colander and take them outside, then stir them around with a wooden spoon (getting the air flowing around them) or pass them from one colander to another. After a minute or so they will have cooled to around room temperature. Alternatively, once you get to know the process, you can stop the roasting prematurely and let them continue to roast the few moments as they cool in a kitchen bowl. Never use water to cool down the beans, as water will affect the oils of the beans that give then their flavour.

, Most teas can be bought in tins of loose tea or in small packages of tea bags. Some people believe that loose leaf teas have a fresher flavor than tea bags. However, many people prefer tea bags because they’re easier to use and don’t require an infuser.


A tea infuser is a small metal or plastic orb that traps the tea leaves in one place so that they can easily be removed.

, You will need a kettle or saucepan to boil water, a teapot or mug, and some tea. If you’re using loose leaf tea, you will also need an infuser to steep the tea. If you’re using tea bags, you don’t need an infuser.


If you want to make more than one cup of tea, use a teapot. If you only want to make one cup of tea, use a mug.
Tea infusers can be purchased online or at most gourmet grocery stores.

, Fill a kettle or saucepan with fresh water and place it on your stove over medium-high heat. Heat the water for five to ten minutes, allowing the water to come to a boil. If your kettle has a whistling feature, you will know that the water is boiling when you hear a loud shrieking sound. Otherwise, wait until you see large bubbles rising quickly to the surface of the water.


You can also use an electric kettle to boil water. Follow the manufacturer instructions when using these appliances.
Avoid boiling water in the microwave. The water can become superheated and explode, causing severe burns., First, carefully measure out the loose leaf tea into your infuser. The instructions on the container of tea will indicate how much tea to add. Generally, only a teaspoon is needed per 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of water.Next, attach the lid onto the infuser and place it in your empty mug or teapot.


Each brand of tea infuser is different. Follow the manufacturer instructions when adding tea and securing the lid of the infuser.

, Some teas come in small, pre-portioned bags instead of tins. To brew a bag of tea, you will need to add one bag for every 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of water. First, carefully open the tea package. Next, place the tea bag in your empty mug or teapot. For example, if your teapot holds sixteen ounces (480 milliliters) of water, you will need two tea bags.
Drape the string and small paper tag over the edge of the mug or teapot. This will allow you to easily remove the tea bag when it’s done steeping.

, Once the water is boiling, carefully pour it from your kettle into your mug or teapot. If you’re using a teapot, fill the pot completely and place the lid on it. Let the tea steep according to the package instructions. For example:


Green tea needs 2-3 minutes of steeping time.
Black tea should be steeped for 3-5 minutes.
White tea should be steeped for 2-3 minutes.
Oolong tea needs 2-4 minutes to steep.
Herbal teas can be steeped for 6-7 minutes ., Once the tea has steeped, remove the tea bag or tea infuser. The tea infuser can be washed and reused. Any used tea bags should be discarded. Next, serve the tea. If you’re serving guests, be sure to warn them that the tea may still be hot.

, Many people all over the world enjoy adding milk and sugar to their tea. These additions can turn a stout, bitter cup of tea into a sweet and creamy delight. Sugar can be added to any kind of tea to give it a sweet flavor boost. However, only Oolong tea and Black tea are enjoyed with milk.Sugar can be substituted for any kind of sweetener. Popular natural sweeteners include honey, molasses, maple syrup, and brown rice syrup., Cold tea is a wonderful drink to enjoy during hot summer days. First, brew a cup or pot of tea. Once the tea is done steeping, remove the tea bags or diffuser and allow the tea to cool to room temperature. Next, fill a tall glass with ice. Carefully pour the cooled tea over the ice to make a tall glass of ice-cold tea.Add any sweeteners to the hot tea before pouring it over the ice. Sweeteners such as sugar and honey are more easily incorporated into warm liquids than cold liquids.
Avoid pouring hot tea into a glass full of ice. The temperature differences can cause the glass to crack.

, In the past, socialites from all over the world have enjoyed serving tea at social events. You can either provide tea at an event or host an event that centers around the tea itself. For example:


Host an “Afternoon Tea” party. This is a British tradition involving a pot of tea, a few friends, and some light snacks. Everyone sits around the teapot, serving themselves tea and gossiping.Provide a pot of hot tea, a small pitcher of milk, and some sugar to your guests after a dinner party.

, Add fresh, cold water to a medium sized pot or a tea kettle that can be heated on the stove. Place the pot or tea kettle over high heat to get the water to boil. Remove the pot or kettle from the heat as soon as the water begins to boil. Different teas require different temperatures of water to steep correctly, so make sure you know what type of tea you plan to brew.Black tea can steep in water that is at the boiling point 200-212º F.
Green and white teas are more delicate and will burn if steeped in water that’s too hot. For these teas, take the water off the heat just before the point of boiling, or before steeping, let the water sit for some time to cool down after boiling. Green tea should be steeped in water between 160º-180ºF. White Tea requires cooler water at 175º F.
A meat or cooking thermometer can help you determine the temperature of the water.

, When the water is at the appropriate temperature for the tea you’re brewing, pour the water into the container that you’ll steep the tea in. There are different types of teapots made from different materials like iron, glass, or porcelain.


Some materials like iron keep the heat longer and are great for teas that need higher heat, and some materials like porcelain lose heat quicker and are better for the more delicate teas.Adding boiling water to a cold container will lower the temperature of the water. Make sure your water is at the proper temperature in your teapot. Use caution when adding boiling water to glass or porcelain as the sudden temperature change may crack the glass.
If you are brewing a single cup of tea, you can add the hot water directly to the mug you plan to drink the tea from.

, Once your hot water is in the appropriate container, you can add the leaves to the water. You can add the tea in tea bags or a tea infuser as well. This will make removing the tea easier, however steeping the tea leaves freely in the teapot sometimes gives a stronger, fuller flavor.

, The biggest mistake people make when making hot tea is over steeping the tea. If you steep the tea too long it loses its flavor and becomes very bitter. Different teas need to steep for different amounts of time so be sure to pay attention to the amount of time your tea is steeping.White tea should steep 1 to 3 minutes.
Green tea should steep 3 minutes.
Oolong and black tea should steep 3-5 minutes.
Many tea manufactures put the suggested steep time on the product’s packaging or their website so check to find out your specific tea’s steep time before making the tea.

, Before pouring the tea into the cups, you need to remove the tea. If you used tea bags or a tea infuser to steep your tea, you can simply remove the bags or infuser from the teapot and then pour the tea. If you’ve steeped tea leaves directly in the teapot, you’ll need to strain the tea first. Pour the the tea through a strainer as you add it to the tea cups.

, Stir in your choice of added sweetener or flavor to your tea before drinking. Stir until the sweetener is fully dissolved so that it's evenly distributed in your cup.

, It’s important to let your tea cool down some before drinking to avoid injury. Drinking tea that is too hot can burn your tongue or the inside of your mouth. Constant consumption of extremely hot tea has been linked to an increased risk to esophageal cancer, so it’s extremely important to let your tea cool down a bit before consuming it., When your tea has cooled down, it’s time to enjoy it. Breathe in deep and experience the aroma of the tea before you take your first sip. Sip your tea knowing that you’re doing something healthy for your body giving it some much needed hydration. Relax with your cup of tea as you give your body a rush of antioxidants and boost your health."

Obtain a brewing vessel.,
Heat the water so the tea will brew.,
Change the temperature depending on the type of tea.,
Pour off the water from the steeped tea.,
Put a teabag into a mug of hot water instead.,
Choose Herbal tea.,
Buy decaffeinated tea.,
Pick green tea.",How to Decaffeinate Tea," You could use a teapot for this purpose. Put tea leaves in the vessel. Cover the tea with a small amount of water. Don’t cover the tea with too much water; apply just enough to cover the leaves.Some people think this method is a myth. Others insist it works. Try it for yourself! The idea may date to a research study in Alabama that pointed out the Chinese would discard the liquid from their first tea infusion.
Other studies have found the process removes some caffeine but not as much as claimed by some. Caffeine can have a negative effect on some people, including increased blood pressure, difficulty with sleep, and rapid eye movement, so reducing your caffeine intake can be a good idea.;
, Steep the tea in the hot water for 30 seconds to a minute. The hot water should remove some of the caffeine from the tea leaves.


One method is to boil twice as much water as you need. You would then use half of the water to decaffeinate the tea, and half of it to actually drink later. You want to make sure that the water is boiling hot to ensure you get more caffeine out of the tea leaves.
Think of this step as giving the tea a boiling bath. Or you can just put enough water on the tea to cover it. Now, you are ready to use the tea., Because different kinds of teas have different levels of caffeine, the recommendations vary.


White tea should be steeped in 175- to 185-degree Fahrenheit (79 to 85 Celsius) water for 1 to 3 minutes. Green tea is steeped in 180- to 185-degree Fahrenheit (82 to 82 Celsius) water for 2 to 3 minutes.
Black tea should steep in 206-degree Fahrenheit (97 Celsius) water for 3 to 5 minutes. Darjeeling tea is steeped in 185-degree Fahrenheit (85 Celsius) water for 3 minutes. Oolong tea should be steeped in 185- to 206-degree Fahrenheit (85 to 97 Celsius) water for 3 to 5 minutes.

, Add fresh water to the same tea leaves. You are now ready to re-brew the tea for drinking.


Use a sieve to catch any tea leaves that come out with the water, and return them to the cup or teapot. Although this method won’t take all caffeine out of the tea, it will reduce the amount of caffeine in the tea. It could remove 20 percent of the caffeine.Now boil some more hot water. Pour it on the same tea leaves. Re-brew. You are now ready to drink the tea. If you boiled twice as much water as you needed, you can use the extra water you boiled to brew tea with the already steeped leaves.

, This process is similar to using a tea kettle, but it can be done with a single teabag. Although some people insist you can only use the “steeping process” on loose tea, others insist it works with teabags too, so give it a whirl!


It’s better if the water is boiling hot. Then, let the teabag sit in the water for 30 seconds. Now, pour out the water, but don’t discard the teabag. Cover the tea with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water, depending on whether you're decaffeinating tea in a cup or a teapot.
Finally, refill the mug with hot or boiling water, and steep your tea bag in the water again! Then, drink your tea. Caffeine is water soluble. That means, most of it will leach into the water, removing about 80 percent of the caffeine.

, If you want to be sure you are drinking tea that doesn’t have caffeine in it, you could just go natural and forget the complex process.


Herbal tea doesn’t have caffeine in it, or only as trace amounts depending on the brand, because it’s made with plant material instead of tea leaf. It will give you the feel of hot tea and provides antioxidants.
Sometimes caffeine is found in small amounts in herbal teas because they are often manufactured at the same factories as non herbal teas, but the amounts are very small. Caffeine is found in 63 different types of plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, and cocoa being most common., You can purchase decaffeinated tea in the store, of course, but it usually has gone through a chemical process.


Some companies use natural ethyl acetate to decaffeinate tea. The tea leaves are moistened with the FDA-approved solvent, are dried, and then heated. This process requires a manufacturer not a home brew.When the water and solvent evaporate, they remove the caffeine from the tea with them., If you want to lower your caffeine intake but still enjoy your favorite tea, pay attention to the color.


White tea and green tea have the lowest amounts of caffeine. Oolong tea is somewhere in the middle. Black tea has the most caffeine, and coffee has the most yet.Tea will dehydrate you, so make sure you drink a glass of water after each cup of tea.Many decaffeination processes use carbon dioxide naturally present in the air to get rid of most of the caffeine in the tea leaves. This is done in the manufacturing process.

Experiment.",How to Buy Loose Leaf Tea," Even if you haven't tried much tea, you probably have an idea of your tastes:


Do you want a strong, black tea, a grassy green tea, or an oolong tea with a roasted aroma?
Do you prefer floral-scented teas, or deep, earthy, or malty qualities?
Do you want your tea to be bitter, sweet, tangy, strong or mild? Or subtle in flavor and mostly aromatic?;
, Not only does tea come in green, black, oolong, white, and Pu-erh, which are broad classes of tea, but each of these teas comes in different varieties, often produced in different regions.



For example, Darjeeling and Assam are both teas from India, but Assam is strong and malty, whereas Darjeeling is lighter and floral. Green and oolong teas are similarly diverse.

, Check to see that people have ordered from a company, and that they have had good experiences with shipping and customer service, and that they have found the company's descriptions to be accurate and honest.

, Buy from a company that offers affordable sample sizes, and the first time you order, instead of ordering a lot of one or two types of tea, order a bunch of samples of many different kinds of tea. You will likely discover a few favorites, and you may find some teas you care less for. This way, the next time you order you'll have a better idea of how to select the best teas to suit your taste, or the taste of others whom you are buying tea for.

Ask whether you like more- or less- oxidized teas.,
Buy small samples of oolongs from different companies.,
Use tea community websites and read tea blogs to locate reviews of oolong tea and see what teas others like the most.

",How to Buy Oolong Tea (Wu Long Tea) Online," These companies are typically selling low-quality tea at high prices. Although ""wu long"" and ""oolong"" are two legitimate spellings of the same word, for chance historical reasons, the spelling ""wu long"" has come to be associated with weight loss fads. The easiest way to avoid these scam companies is to limit your searches to the spelling ""Oolong"" and refrain from using the ""Wu Long"" spelling, but be cautious with either spelling.;
, Avoid tea bags and broken-leaf tea, which tend to be lower in quality. The best oolongs are only available in loose leaf form. With a few exceptions, you are best off buying pure oolongs, rather than flavored oolongs. Although there are some outstanding flavored oolongs out there, flavoring is often a way to mask lower-quality tea. Buying pure tea will also help you to learn more about the different types of oolong.

, Oolong is often classified by region, and the major regions are Taiwan, and then in China, Anxi county and the Wuyi mountains of Fujian province. A few oolongs also originate in other areas of China, and a few oolongs are produced outside of China and Taiwan. Only buy from companies that identify the source of their oolong.

, Oolong tea is roasted to stop its oxidation, and it varies greatly in its level of roast. Roasted teas tend to be darker and have a noticeable roasty aroma. Teas with a lighter roast tend to be more vegetal and floral in aroma. The best sources of oolong often reference the level of roast in describing their teas.

, Less oxidized teas, called ""greener"" oolongs, such as Bao Zhong or Jade Oolong, are more like green teas, and have light, floral aromas. More oxidized oolongs, often called darker oolongs, resemble black tea more in appearance and qualities, although they are often smoother.

I put a long section of drain pipe on the small can to produce a high draft.",How to Build a Small TLUD Burner and Make Tea Using Bamboo As Fuel,"


This larger can had a pull top so it was flattened to allow good airflow.;
,,, If you are careful, you can also poke out the concentrator hole at the same time, in the larger can.

, It is approximately 1/3 of the diameter of the actual can.

, (Be careful of sharp edges here!) On the left you can see the ash grate with holes made as we prepared the concentrator.

, This will allow lots of air flow from the small holes in the inner can.

, It will be a little floppy at first, but when the fuel is put inside, it should be relatively level. The nail can be used later to remove the assembly.

, We used the can opener to shorten the inner can by cutting off the rim. It can be a little tricky the first time since the can wiggles around. Lying the can on the side helps it remain steady so the can opener makes a clean cut. You could also elevate the outer can a little bit later on, but that might be less reliable. One other way to do this is to leave the cans the same height and poke larger holes all the way around the top of the inner can using your large nail.

,, It was weathered at least a year or more and split very well just by stomping on it. The piece in the image was about 3 feet (0.9 m) long and filled the small can.

, This produces some splinters, so watch your fingers.

, And we packed in some paper napkins and drizzled a small amount of vegetable oil on the tips of the sticks and the napkins for a hot start. The napkins work as a little wick at first and heat up the cans and wood very well. Poke those napkins in between the wood sticks very gently and carefully. Use a fork or dull knife to avoid splinters.

, Then light all the paper napkins and slide the outer can on top. The fire should come out the concentrator hole very clean, with low smoke.

,, The fire should hit the middle of the pot and touch it, but should not spread out beyond the sides. The ring of small bricks around the pot concentrates the heat on the sides of the pot very well. At the end of burning, all the bricks were quite warm too.

, I think the draft was slightly improved and heat directed even better at the pot. Still the bricks were all quite warm too.

, The water boiled rapidly after about ten minutes and boiled fiercely for at least ten minutes too. I made two cups of tea.

, I was quite surprised by that power output (hot enough to boil water outside on a freezing cold day.) The overall clean burn was also impressive. Starting produced a little smoke though. I think it was mostly due to the burning labels on the cans and the plastic linings in the food cans. It produced a small amount of charcoal. This can also be used for heat.

, This forced air in through the small holes at the bottom and the charcoal burned with intense heat.

Add a few drops of water from the kettle to the leaves.,

When the tea is ready, cover the gaiwan and pick it up on its plate with your left hand.,
Resteep- One of the benefits of using high quality, full-leaf teas is that they do not instantaneously “leech out"" like the chopped-up tea found in teabags and, as a result, may be resteeped – generally 2 or three times, sometimes more.",How to Brew Gaiwan Tea," Ninety nine percent of tea is water, so it’s important to give some thought to the water you use for brewing. Tap water should be avoided since its chemical treatment imparts undesirable flavors and odors which interfere with the delicate aromatics of tea. Home filters and other water purification systems can minimize and, in some cases, eliminate these problems. The best water for tea brewing is spring water with a natural mineral content that’s neither too hard nor too soft. Since T.D.S. “total dissolved solids"", or mineral content measured in parts per million varies greatly from water to water, you may want to do your own taste-test of waters available in your area to determine which one has the best flavor, body and compatibility with the tea you drink.


Distilled water is not recommended for tea since water purified of its mineral content produces a flat-tasting infusion.;
, This performs two functions: first, it purifies the cup (both practically and symbolically) by rinsing away any dust or residue and symbolizing that the cup is clean, empty and ready to receive the tea. Secondly, rinsing with hot water warms the cup – which, at room temperature, is quite cold and therefore inappropriate for brewing most fine teas whose temperature must be carefully controlled.

, Approximately one to two teaspoons of leaf is a good quantity to begin with and is easily adjusted to taste after the initial infusion. Keep in mind that due to the many variations of tea processing, some leaves are a lot more compact than others. For instance: you’ll need a lot less Dragon Well or Jasmine Pearls than Silver Needles or Formosa Oolong.

, This releases the tea’s aroma and should be savored prior to infusion in order to prepare the palate to appreciate the full flavor of the tea. This process also suggests to the experienced tea maker how to approach the infusion (i.e. in terms of temperature, time, etc.). Alternatively, some people like to cover the leaves with hot water and quickly pour it off. This is known as “flushing"" the tea and is recommended particularly for tightly rolled and aged teas such as oolong and Pu-erh. As above, the wet leaves’ aroma should be appreciated before brewing.

, When it comes to infusion, water temperature and steeping time are just as important as the quality of the water and tea leaves used. Unfortunately there are no set rules for either, but the following guidelines may be used for starters:


Green tea - Many people have heard that it is best to brew green tea with water below boiling, but few know just how low to go. When encountering a new green tea for the first time a good rule is to steep it for one minute with 70ºC (158ºF) water. Green tea is almost always steeped uncovered, which prevents over-heating and allows constant monitoring and visual appreciation of the leaves during infusion. From this test you will be able to adjust the time and temperature of future infusions to bring out the best flavor. If, for example, the taste is too strong or bitter after only a minute, this indicates the water temperature should be dropped, perhaps to 60ºC (140ºF) or even as low as 50ºC (122ºF). Lowering the temperature also allows you to steep the leaves longer and, in many cases, extract more flavor without the infusion becoming bitter. Experimenting with each tea will help you discover how to achieve the flavors that appeal to you most.
Oolong tea - Start out at 80°-85°C (176°-185°F) with a 3 minute infusion.
Black tea - 85°-95°C (185°-203°F) for 3 minutes.
Pu-erh tea - Use water that’s just come to a boil and infuse 3-5 minutes. (Remember to rinse before brewing.)

, Place it on the up-turned fingers of your right hand. The lid should be positioned slightly askew and held in place with the thumb– just enough to allow the tea to pour out while retaining the leaves. (Using two hands may at first appear to be easier, but it actually makes pouring more difficult, while using one hand locks the three pieces in place and holds them together as the gaiwan is inverted for pouring.) Pour the tea into the pitcher and then serve in individual tasting cups.

, To re-steep it is usually necessary to increase the infusion time slightly and also to reheat the water – at least to the original infusion temperature, sometimes higher.


After the initial infusion, the leaves can be re-steeped up to twelve hours later.

",How to Brew Da Hong Pao (Wuyi Rock Tea),";
, For example, if you have 4 ounces of water, measure out 1 ounce of tea (about 5-6 US teaspoons).

, A small teapot (about 4 ounces) is better suited for this tea than a larger teapot because of the high concentration of leaves and short infusion time needed.With a large teapot, you'd need a lot of leaves.

",How to Brew Tea With a Teapot,";
, This warms the pot, and helps the tea brew faster.

, The old rule used to be of one for the pot, and one for each person. If using tea leaves, measuring out the leaves with a teaspoon. Otherwise use a tea bag for each person. Nowadays we drink tea somewhat weaker. Experiment, and discover your own preference.

, Using re-boiled water gives a peculiarly lifeless taste to the brew.

,, Add milk and sugar to taste. If using leaves, remember to put a strainer over the cups - tea leaves taste foul!

, Don't let it stand around for too long or the tea will end up tasting very strong. Hardened tea drinkers like this strong bitter taste which comes from the tannins released - but most tea drinkers prefer the subtlety of the fresh brew.

If the bar isn’t very busy, consider talking to the bartender for drink recommendations. If the bar is busy and you don’t know what you want:


Order a simple well drink, such as a rum and Coke.Look at the beer taps on the wall and choose one that looks interesting.
Look at the bar menu for cocktail or wine choices.;
, Once you’re ready to order, stand close to the bar with your hands on the counter. This will indicate that you want to order a drink. Once the bartender is ready, they will approach you and ask you for your order.


Never whistle, snap, yell, or wave money at the bartender., Speak loudly and clearly, especially if the bar is crowded. If you’re ordering multiple drinks, order them all at the same time. If the bartender needs clarification on your order, they will say so. When ordering mixed drinks, say the liquor type or brand name first and then what kind of mixer you’d like. For example:


“I would like a rum and Coke, please.”
“Two Bacardi and sodas, please.”
“I need one margarita on the rocks and two pints of Guinness. Thank you!”
“May I have a glass of your house Chardonnay?”

, Once the bartender hands you your drinks, they will tell you the total. Make sure you already have your cash or credit card ready. Otherwise, you will waste time rummaging through your pockets or your purse.If you want to keep ordering drinks, use your credit card to open a tab. Your bartender will add drinks to this tab and charge your card at the end of the night.
If you pay with cash, you may not be able to open a tab.

, Depending on where you live, it may be appropriate to tip your bartender. You can leave a cash tip in the tip jar or write a tip on your credit card receipt.


In the US, you should leave 10%-20% of the bill total as a tip.
In France, the service charge is included in the bill.
In Brazil, tips are not expected but they are appreciated. Consider tipping 10% of the bill total., Restaurant bars are bars that are attached to or inside a restaurant. These bars are usually small, consisting of a bar counter and a few tables. The bartenders make drinks for the restaurant as well as for the bar patrons. Order drinks that follow the theme of the restaurant. For example:


Tex-Mex and Mexican restaurants usually specialize in margaritas.
Seafood restaurants that call the bar area the “Tiki Bar” usually serve tropical cocktails.Upscale restaurant bars usually serve wine and expensive cocktails.

, Beer bars specialize in beer and often don’t carry nicer liquors or wine. A beer bar usually has at least twelve beer taps along the wall. Beer bars can also be called taverns, breweries, and craft beer bars. If you’re not sure what kind of beer you like, talk to the bartender for a recommendation or ask for a beer sample.


Wheat beers are lighter colored beers with a crisp yeast flavor.
Ales range in color from light brown to black. These beers have a deep, mellow flavor.
IPAs (India Pale Ales) are golden beers with a hoppy, floral flavor.
Porters are dark, foamy beers with a roasted malty flavor., Wine bars usually have an extensive wine list and may not carry beer or liquor. These bars often serve small appetizers to enjoy with your wine.If you’re not familiar with wine, ask your bartender for recommendations.


Riesling is a sweet, bubbly, white wine.
Chardonnay is a white wine with light citrus notes.
Merlot is a smooth red wine with fruity herbal notes.
Pino Noir is a red wine with light fruity flavors and an earthy undertone.

, Cocktail bars, also called Mixology bars, pride themselves on quality craft cocktails. These bars often have a trendy atmosphere and an extensive cocktail menu.

These strongly flavored drinks can be ordered with or without olives, shaken over ice, or stirred.
A Jack Rose is a mellow, pink drink made with sweet apple brandy.
Order a Bourbon Sweet Tea for a refreshing, boozy drink.
If you want a sweet drink, order a velvety Chocolate Martini., A pint is a customary unit of measurement containing about 16 fluid ounces in the US and 20 fluid ounces in the UK.Pint glasses can come in many shapes that are used for specific types of beer.


A Goblet is usually used to serve dark ales.
A sturdy glass mug can be used to serve American ales and porters.
A standard pint glass has straight sides and can be used to serve any kind of beer.
A snifter is used to serve Scottish and Belgian ales., Well drinks are mixed drinks that are made with well liquor, also called house liquor. This can be any cheap, generic brand of liquor that is stocked for the purpose of making inexpensive mixed drink.If you don’t specify what kind of liquor you want in your drink, you will usually get the well liquor. Most bars stock these well liquors:


Rum
Vodka
Gin
Tequila
Whisky

, When ordering a mixed drink, specify the liquor first and the mixer second. Mixers are non-alcoholic beverages that can dilute and improve the flavor of medium and low quality alcohols. However, it is considered wasteful to add mixers to expensive, premium alcohol as it will ruin the flavor. Standard mixers include:


Soda, or soda water
Coke, such as Coca Cola or Dr. Pepper
Cranberry juice, also called “cran”
Tonic, or tonic water
Lighter colored sodas, such as Sprite, ginger ale, or ginger beer

, The terms “tall” and “short” refer to the size of the drink and the amount of mixer in it. However, both drink sizes have the same amount of alcohol in them. If you don’t specify what size you want, you will usually get a short drink. When ordering, specify the size before the liquor type. For example:


“I would like a tall rum and Coke, please.”
“Can I have a short gin and tonic?”
“I’d like a tall vodka cranberry.”

, You can specify the drink size before or after saying the drink name. For example:


“Give me a double vodka cranberry, please.”
“Can I have a tequila soda, double?”
“I’d like a double gin and tonic, please.”

, These drinks are usually ordered without mixers. However, margaritas are the exception, as they can be served frozen or over ice.Specify how you want the drink served before any other descriptors. For example:


“Can I have a neat double whisky, please?”
“I’d like a margarita on the rocks, please.”
“Can I have two neat Glenlivets?”

Buy from a company that gives details about the exact region of origin of the tea:


Dragon well originated in a specific region of Zhejiang province, near Hangzhou.,
Examine the dried tea leaves.,
Understand the brewing process.,
Know what to look for after brewing is complete:


Tea leaves should be complete and unbroken.",How to Appreciate Dragon Well Tea," Much of the best Dragon Well is produced near West Lake, and the other dragon well from near Hangzhou tends to be of better quality than generic Zhejiang dragon well.
Tea sold as dragon well is also grown in other parts of Zhejiang province. Although it's not always possible to generalize, when the region is specified only as Zhejiang province, the quality is likely to be lower.
Some tea is produced in the style of dragon well in other regions, such as Taiwan, or Anhui province. When the origin is not identified, or is identified only as China, it may be an indicator that the tea is lower in quality. Even when the tea is produced with care, teas from other regions will have their own unique characteristics, different from the historic dragon well.;
, Some criteria to look out for:


Smell. A good Dragon Well tea should have a strong, nutty aroma. It should not smell burnt or weak.
Look and feel. The tea shoots should be complete and unbroken. A tea shoot should be brittle, so that when you rub it with your fingers it turns into powders. The tea shoots are pointed and sharp. They should be smooth and glossy, not dim.
Color. Depend on the varieties. High grade Lion Peak Longjing is yellowish green rather green. Mei Jia Wu Longjing tea is jade green.

, You should be looking for:


Smell. Strong and nutty.
Taste. Savory. Reminiscent of MSG, a food taste enhancer. Long and sweet aftertaste, not grassy or bitter.
Look. Tea liquor should be yellowish or pale green, not brownish or dim. Tea leaves should dance and stand on ends before settling down.

, A standard pick is one bud/one leaf or one bud/two leaves, but never single buds. The smaller the bud, the better. The bud should be longer or equal in length to the adjacent leaves. The tenderer the tea shoots, the higher the grade. The tea should look bright rather than dim.

Know your martini basics.,

Put it all together.",How to Order a Martini," A standard, classic martini is made from gin and vermouth and garnished with an olive.If you do not specify a different concentration of either gin or vermouth, the martini will be prepared with one part dry vermouth and four to five parts gin.
Gin is an alcoholic spirit made from distilled grain or malt. The spirit is also flavored with juniper berries.
Vermouth is a liquor made with wine, also known as a fortified wine, that is flavored with an infusion of herbs, flowers, spices, and other botanical ingredients.;
, Even though a classic martini is made with gin, a fairly recent trend is to opt for vodka, instead. You can specify this change at the start of your order, and it should be the first change you make if you decide to make it.


Vodka refers to an alcoholic spirit made from distilled rye, wheat, or potatoes. On occasion, it is also made from fermented fruits and sugar, but these types of vodka are not often used in martinis.
Older bars will almost always use gin by default, but in some newer bars, the bartender might use vodka as as the default, instead. To be on the safe side, specify which one you want whenever you order a martini.

, By default, you will be given the cheapest brand of gin or vodka available at the bar. If you are particular about your liquor brands, you should specifically state the brand you want in your martini.


The cheapest, default brand is referred to as the ""well.""
If you do not have a preferred brand and are not familiar with the brands that are out there, ask the bartender about the different brands available at the bar. You can either pick one at random if you want to maintain appearances and pretend to know what you're talking about, or ask the bartender for his or her recommendation.
If you decide to specify the brand of alcohol, you only need to state the name of the brand and not the name of the alcohol. For example, you would order ""Beefeater,"" not ""Gin Beefeater"" or ""Beefeater Gin."" Similarly, you would order ""Vox,"" not ""Vodka Vox"" or ""Vox Vodka.""

, Among the various ways you can personalize your martini, you can change the ration of gin to vermouth, the way the cocktail is mixed, and the garnish the martini will be served with.


It is not enough to merely know what your options are; learn the lingo to make your martini ordering experience go smoothly and to order your drink with class.
If you only order a “martini,” some bartenders will ask you questions about how you want it prepared using the lingo. As a result, even if you want the drink in its most basic, generic form, you should still know what the related terms are.

, If you do not specify what you want, you will be served a martini with a standard ratio.


A wet martini is a martini with extra vermouth.
A dry martini refers to a martini with less vermouth in it.
Ordering your martini very dry would mean that it only contains trace amounts of vermouth, if that. The bartender may roll the vermouth in the glass to coat it with a film without leaving any of the liquor itself in the glass upon serving the drink.

, A dirty martini refers to a martini with olive juice or olive brine mixed in.


The olive taste tends to be fairly potent, and the drink itself will usually become cloudy as a result of the addition.

, By default, a martini is served with an olive. You can change the garnish using these terms, though.


Order your martini with a twist if you want it served with a twist of lemon peel instead of an olive.
If you decide to order your martini with a cocktail onion garnish, the name of the drink changes completely from martini to Gibson. In other words, you would ask for a Gibson, not a martini with a Gibson or a martini with an onion.

, A clean martini refers to a martini served without a garnish.


On the other hand, if you want an extra garnish—an extra olive, for instance—you can ask for that, as well. Note that asking for extra olive or extra garnish in general does not have any special terminology.

, The option you choose will determine whether or not you get ice in your martini.


In bar lingo, ordering a drink on the rocks means ordering it served over ice. The drink will stay cooler but may get diluted over time.
If you ask for a neat martini, you are asking for the alcohol to be poured straight from the bottle and into the glass without any ice. As a result, the drink will be room temperature and will not be diluted at all.
Asking for your martini up or straight up means asking for the gin or vodka to be chilled with ice, usually by shaking or stirring, and strained into the martini glass with no ice in the glass itself. This offers the most balance, since the alcohol is chilled but will not be diluted as the ice melts.

, Dry vermouth is the standard type used, but if you would prefer something with a sweeter touch, these are the two options you should be familiar with.


Ask to make your martini sweet if you want the bartender to use sweet vermouth instead of dry vermouth.
Similarly, a perfect martini will use equal parts dry and sweet vermouth, creating a balanced flavor.

, The choice you make will determine how the gin or vodka is mixed with the vermouth in your drink.


A stirred martini is the most traditional way to mix a martini, and at most high-class bars, this is the default preparation method.The alcohol is mixed in the glass with a special stirring rod. This produces a clear martini and, as many purists will claim, the most silky texture since stirring does not break up the oils in the gin.
A shaken martini is mixed in a special cocktail shaker, in which it is literally shaken back and forth. This is fairly common for dirty martinis, but the downside is that shaking the alcohol tends to ""bruise"" or cause the oils to separate in the gin, leading to a cloudier drink.
A naked martini refers to a martini in which all of the ingredients have been chilled in a freezer. The alcohol will then be poured straight into a chilled cocktail glass and served without mixing.

, In a packed bar, good etiquette means knowing what you want before you approach the bartender. A good bar will not rush you along, but nonetheless, you should know as much about what you want as possible before talking with the bartender.


A possible exception, however, would be if you are inquiring about the brands of gin or vodka available.
Also note that if the bar is not particularly crowded, you might be able to take a bit more time ordering, especially if you can tell that no one else is waiting to place a drink order.

, Have a firm presence but be polite. The most appropriate way to get a bartender's attention is to stand at the bar in a spot where you can be seen. Establish eye contact and offer a smile. These actions alone should be enough to tell a good bartender to walk over once he becomes available.When ordering for someone else, make sure you know what that person wants before getting up to the bar. Do not call back and ask for his or her order after you have already caught the attention of the bartender. Moreover, if you are ordering for more than just yourself, you should have enough money in your hand to suggest as much. Do not wave the money around, though, as this is considered a sign of rudeness.
Never try to get the bartender's attention by waving your money, snapping your fingers, or yelling.

, Once you have the bartender's attention, it is time to tell him what you want. Use the lingo you learned to order your martini. Call your base first, specify your preferred concentration of vermouth, indicate if you want ice, ask for your garnish, and finish off with how you want the bartender to mix it together.


For example, order a martini with Beefeater, extra dry and with a twist, straight up if you want a martini made with Beefeater brand gin and very little vermouth. It will have a lemon twist, and the gin will be chilled with ice before being strained into the cocktail glass.
As another example, order a dirty martini with vodka, wet and shaken if you want a martini made with the cheapest vodka at the bar, extra vermouth, and olive brine. It will have the standard olive garnish, and it will be mixed with ice in a cocktail shaker.

Reduce your risk of developing arthritis with white tea.",How to Boost Your Health with Tea2," Heart disease and stroke may be two of the largest causes of death in the world, but green tea can lower cholesterol to dramatically decrease your risk of these diseases.Green tea may be particularly beneficial for your cardiovascular health. It contains polyphenols, which are antioxidants. These antioxidants can help protect cells from the oxidative damage of heart disease.
An observational study in Japan found that people who drank green tea was beneficial to overall cardiac health.
To enjoy this reduced risk, however, you may have to drink a lot of green tea. Fewer than five cups a day might not result in any significant change.

, The antioxidants in green tea give you the power to fight oxidative damage, which can lead to the development of cancer. These antioxidants protect your cells, reducing the risk of some types of cancer significantly.For example, a Chinese study revealed women who drank green tea on a regular basis reduced their risk of developing colorectal cancer by 57 percent.As with other preventative benefits, you must consume significant amounts of green tea to demonstrably reduce your risk of developing cancer.

, Like lavender tea, hibiscus flower tea is made by steeping the dried flowers in boiling water. Some believe this tea might reduce or prevent hypertension and lower your risk of developing other cardiovascular diseases.Hibiscus isn't a product that has been heavily researched. Moreover, hibiscus might provide laxative and diuretic effects. Proceed with caution and talk to your doctor before beginning a hibiscus regimen.Like green tea, hibiscus flower tea also contains significant amounts of antioxidants that can protect your cells from oxidative damage.
Hibiscus flowers often are used in herbal tea blends, such as zinger teas. You typically can find these in regular grocery stores without having to head to a tea specialty shop.

, White tea comes from the Camellia Sinensis plant in China.

, While green tea also helps you lower your stress levels, white tea has a more significant effect. Less caffeine in white tea might explain why it's better at decreasing stress than green tea.The entire ritual of drinking white tea to calm your nerves and reduce stress has been a part of Chinese and other Asian cultures for centuries.
To drink white tea for relaxation, steep the leaves in hot – not boiling – water for just a few minutes in a closed container.
Drinking your tea hot rather than cold may provide a more relaxing and calming effect.

, Caffeine also improves brain performance, but it's a substance called theanine, found in black tea, that has significant power to enhance your cognitive processes.While caffeine can help you stay alert, theanine also has a calming effect. The two compounds working together may explain why you are better able to think and focus after drinking a cup of tea.
Improved cognitive performance is especially noticeable in people over 70 who drink tea on a regular basis.

Invert the mold onto you homemade stand.,
Repeat the process for all molds that can fit in the rack at once.,
Prepare to freeze.,
Freeze.,
Enjoy your drink!",How to Make Whiskey Ice Balls," There are two important factors to produce clear ice: water quality and freezing method.


Water has trapped gas particles and impurities in it that lead to that cloudy appearance. Removing the gases and impurities is the first step to achieving clear ice; therefore pure, distilled water is needed.
The second crucial step to achieving clear ice is the freezing method. In the freezer, a sphere will freeze from all sides to the center, this traps impurities/gases inside the ball and is another reason for the clearer ice.;
,


It is simply a hollow silicon ball with a small hole, about a fingertip size, so you can fill it with water through it. And the mold can be broken into two halves in order to get the ice ball out after the water freezes.

, Placing the mold on a rack in a freezer will freeze the water equally from all sides.


Attach the wooden sticks to one another, using the wires and the craft glue. The rack should be suitable to hold the molds; they should NOT pass through it, but stay hung on it. Make sure to measure the length of the sticks comparing to the size of the pot and the molds to do this step accurately. The pictures shown will help you understand this part well.

,


This will allow for the mold's fill-hole to be submerged under the water of the pot.

, You need enough so fill holes on mold can be submerged but also allow the mold to be partially above water.

,


Simply boil the water, let sit, and do it again. This step is necessary to get a clear and pure ice crystal. Distilled water has no minerals and impurities in it; it has only water molecules. And the double boiling method remove trapped gases from the water. Those are two important factors to get a clear ice ball.

,


Directly after filling the mold place your thumb over the fill hole to prevent any air from entering.
Place the mold upside down so that fill hole faces down into the stand.

, Do not release your thumb from the fill hole until it is submerged to ensure no air enters.

,


The molds need to be upside down and submerged in water to prevent air from entering the molds, and building a rack like the one in the picture will help for this position

, Set the temperature to as close as possible to 0 degrees F.


Remove excess water with baster or syringe if necessary.
The pot needs to be filled to the level which would submerge the fill hole, but leave as much mold above water as possible.
Ensure no air is trapped under molds by slightly shaking the pot.
Wrap the pot ""TIGHTLY"" with a towel to slow down the freezing and force the freezing to take place in a top down method. This will allow the water in the molds to freeze before the water in the container does.
this can be done by folding the towel lengthwise then wrapping around the base of the pot

, Prepare your freezer by setting the temperature to as close as possible to 0 degrees.


Place the entire container, wrapped with a towel, in the freezer being careful not to knock it over or allow air to enter the molds.
Freeze for approximately 18 hours.The key is to ensure the mold is completely frozen and the top of the reservoir is frozen, however, it's okay if there is some liquid at the very bottom.

, Remove the ice ball from the mold and add to your drink!

Bottle and enjoy!",How to Make Whiskey," Place 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of untreated kernel corn in a burlap sack and place that burlap sack in a larger bucket or container. Then, saturate the burlap sack with warm water. Make sure the corn is completely and evenly soaked.


Why sprout the corn for whiskey? In short, sprouting eliminates the need for added sugar in the mash, allowing you to get a more authentic whiskey. Also called ""malting,"" sprouting causes enzymes in the corn to convert starches to sugar.Those sugars then become the building blocks of the alcohol in the whiskey.;
, Keep the bag in a warm, dark environment, such as a well-insulated garage or basement. Make sure the corn remains damp for about a week and a half. During the sprouting phase, keep the temperature of the corn between 62° and 86° F (17° and 30° C).

, Wait for the sprouts to grow 1/4 in. (0.6 cm) long, and then rinse the corn in a bucket of clean water. While doing so, remove as many of the sprouted roots as possible by hand. Discard the sprouts. Reserve the corn.

, Using a rolling pin with a solid end, a wooden muddler, or any other large implement, crush the kernels in the primary fermenter. Stop when all the kernels have been broken apart.


If you want to, you can also use a grist mill to crack apart the corn. You can only do this, however, when your corn is fully dried; wet corn won't go through the grist mill properly.
To dry your corn for use in a grist mill: Lay the sprouted corn in a thin layer over a clean, even surface. Place a box fan near the corn and turn it on. Let the fan dry out the damp corn, stirring a couple times a day.

, You're now ready to ferment.

, Use a thermometer to test the temperature. You want the mash to cool down but still be considerably warm for the yeast to do its job.

, Add the yeast to the top of the mash and close the lid on the fermenter. For about four to five minutes, carefully pitch the fermenter at an angle, slowly moving back and forth, to agitate the yeast.

, An airlock is an essential tool for fermentation. It allows the CO2 to escape but no air to get into the mash. Air getting into mash would minimize the effect that yeast otherwise has.


You can make an airlock yourself quite easily, but buying one is cheap. It's possible to get one for under a couple of bucks.

, The fermentation process will take anywhere from 5 to 10 days, depending on the yeast, the temperature, and how much grain you're using.Use a hydrometer to tell when the primary fermentation is complete. If the reading on the hydrometer is the same for two to three consecutive days, you're ready to begin distillation.Try to keep the mash at a steady 77° F (25° C) while it's fermenting. Again, you need enough heat for the yeast to activate and consume the starch.

, If choosing to strain the mash, use a clean pillowcase. Try to keep as much of the solids as possible away from the still when transferring the mash.

, With whiskeys, you don't want to rush the distillation; heat up the still on medium heat over the course of 30 minutes to an hour until it just begins to boil. Heating the wash too quickly will result in burnt wash and off flavors. The temperature zone in which you'll distill your alcohol will be between 172° and 212° F (78° and 100° C).


Why this temperature? Alcohol and water have different evaporation points. Alcohol begins to evaporate at 172° F, whereas water doesn't begin to evaporate until 212° F. So if you can heat the wash up to at least 172° F but no more than 212° F, the evaporated liquid in the still will be alcohol and not water.

, The condensing tube takes the evaporated alcohol and cools it quickly, turning it back into liquid form. Slowly, the condensing tube should begin to spit out liquid.

, The heads are a mixture of volatile compounds that evaporate from the wash and should not be consumed. They include methanol, which is lethal in large quantities. Luckily, the heads come out of the wash first. For a 5 gallon (18.9 L) wash, prepare to throw out the first 50 - 100 mL of condensed liquid just to be safe., After the heads is collected and dumped, you're ready to collect the good stuff. When the thermometer on the condensing tube hits 175º - 185º F (80º - 85º C), you're starting to collect the valuable prize — moonshine. This is also referred to as the ""body"" of the distillate., Continue collecting the body until the thermometer on the condensing tube begins reading 205º F (96º C). At this point, the evaporated liquids you start distilling are fusel oils, which should be thrown away., Allow your distilled moonshine to cool off as well.

, You want to know how strong your moonshine is, both for aging and as an indication of how well your distillation went.


Be sure not to confuse the proof and tralle readings on the hydrometer. Your proof will always be two times the amount of the tralle.

, If you do decide to age your whiskey, you want it to go into the barrel at around 58% to 70% ABV.Aging will make the whiskey smoother and give it its distinctive taste. Whiskey will only age in barrels. When it is bottled, whiskey will stop aging.


Whiskey is generally aged in oak barrels. The barrels can be carefully charred or toasted first, or can be sourced for another distiller that's kept another spirit in the barrel for added flavor.
If you want to add oak flavor to your moonshine but don't want to have to spring for a barrel, you can also add toasted oak chips to your whiskey. Toast your oak chips over low heat (200º F) in the oven for an hour, until they are aromatic but not yet charred. Remove and cool. Transfer to whiskey container and steep for 5 - 15 days or longer, depending on your tastes. Strain the whiskey through cheesecloth or a clean pillowcase to catch all the wood chips.

, After your whiskey is aged, you'll want to dilute it before you drink it and bottle it. At this point, the whiskey is still probably 60% - 80% ABV, which would make for a fiery, uncomfortable drinking experience. It should be diluted to around 40% or 45% ABV for a much more pleasant drinking experience.

, Bottle your whiskey, along with a note on when you bottled it. Always drink responsibly.

Teas picked earlier in the day (8am-10am) or later in the day (3pm-5pm) will have a weaker quality, but if they ripen during these times, that's when they must be plucked.

People used to pick tea with fingers, but it's easier to do with clippers/shears.






Here is a close-up of a tea plant. Methods in plucking vary by how many leaves you pluck with a bud.Imperial - the bud and first leaf to follow are taken.
Fine - taking the bud and the two leaves that follow; produces the optimal quality of tea.
Average - bud is taken with the first three leaves; allows the plant to grow better, but produces a lesser quality of tea.

;
, It is preferable to dry leaves in the sun rather than under artificial sources of heat. Afternoon sun is usually the best choice. Watch the tea carefully to ensure that it does not get burned.






When moving the tea, use bamboo dust pans.

, Move the tea leaves out of the sun and lay them out to cool so that they don't turn yellow., This is a very important step. Turn the tea carefully in a special bamboo drum to lightly bruise the edges of the leaves, which will accelerate the oxidation. This is critical to the unique character of TGY tea. Avoid turning the drum too much., Put the leaves into an air conditioned storage area and spread thinly for oxidation., You need years of experience to know how many times to toss and dry the tea, depending on the year, plantation, weather, and demand., Use a special round pan to stop the oxidation process., This process involves four smaller steps.

Enjoy the sake.",How to Make Sake," Place the rice in a colander and rinse it under cold, running water. Continue until the water drains clear.White Japanese rice or Japanese sweet rice works best, but any short-grain white rice can be used. Do not use brown rice since the outer kernels can taint the flavor of the finished sake.
Rinsing the rice strips away the starch powder clinging to each grain. The drain water will likely look cloudy at first, but after several minutes, it should eventually turn clear.;
, Place the rice in a large bowl and cover it with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of cool water. Allow the rice to soak for approximately 90 minutes.

Alternatively, you can store the soaking rice in your refrigerator for up to 18 hours if doing so works better with your schedule.
Drain off the rinse water before continuing to the next step.

, Place the rice in a fine mesh colander and rest it inside a large pot filled with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of water. Cover the structure and simmer the water over low heat for approximately 60 minutes.

You may need to add more water throughout the steaming process. Never let all of the water boil off.
When it's ready, the rice should be very sticky. Allow the finished rice to cool down for approximately 10 minutes before using it.

, Soak the brewing bucket, lid, measuring cup, rubber stopper, and airlock in steaming hot water for approximately 10 minutes. Dry each piece well with clean paper towels.

If you want to sterilize the equipment even more thoroughly, you could clean it a ""no rinse"" brewing cleanser. You'll usually need to use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of the cleanser for every 1 gallon (4 L) of water. Soak the equipment in the solution for 2 minutes, the rinse each piece with hot water and dry with paper towels.

, Place the steamed rice, koji, yeast, and 4 qt (3.8 L) of distilled water in the brewing bucket.Lightly stir the ingredients together but do not mash any of the rice.
""Koji"" is also called malt-rice, and it's made when spores of Aspergillus oryzae mold blooms over steamed rice. The grains of rice then become sweet. You can technically perform the process yourself, but it can be difficult to perfect, so it's usually best to start with prepared koji instead.
For the yeast, beer and wine yeasts are usually good choices. You can also use active dry yeast (a.k.a. bread yeast) if you are unable to find either of the other options.
Ideally, the overall temperature should be around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) at the start of the fermentation process. If it's too much hotter than this, the organisms responsible for fermentation will die.

, Cover the top of the bucket with plastic wrap, then place the lid directly on top.

Covering the container with plastic wrap can help prevent unwanted microbes from getting inside and ruining the mixture., If you use an actual brewing bucket, there should be a place for an airlock. Insert a standard brewing airlock into that spot.

The airlock prevents harmful microbes from getting inside while also allowing pressure to escape from the bucket as the beneficial microbes inside generate carbon dioxide.
If you do not use an airlock, you should avoid sealing the bucket too tightly so that some of the built-up pressure can escape during the fermentation process.

, The mixture will immediately begin fermenting, but you should allow it to ferment for roughly 14 days before continuing to the next step.

Keep the brewing bucket in a dry place with an air temperature between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 and 18.3 degrees Celsius). If you have a cool garage, cellar, or basement with an ambient temperature in the appropriate range, you can store the fermenting sake there. Otherwise, you may wish to keep the sake in a wine cooler or miniature refrigerator.
Check the airlock. Bubbling should begin within the first few hours of the fermentation process, and the rate of bubbling will reach its peak between days three and seven.
After 12 to 16 days, the rate of bubbling should slow to one bubble every 15 minutes. At that point, you can move onto the next step.

, Open the lid and scoop out a small sample of the liquid using a ladle. Strain the sake, then sip it to gauge the taste.

The rice should be floating on the top and the yeast should be resting on the bottom. Carefully remove the sample of sake between the two layers to avoid stirring up the yeast and contaminating the sample.
Strain the sample through a piece of cheesecloth. The cloth should catch any grains of rice you scooped up, along with any other pieces of sediment that got into your sample.

, Siphon the sake out of the bucket and into a sanitized glass jar. The jar should be at least 1 gallon (4 L) in volume.

If you don't have a siphon, you can pour the sake into the jar using a funnel. Layer the funnel with clean cheesecloth the filter out any rice or yeast.

, Once all the sake is inside, plug the top of the jar with an airlock.

As before, the airlock allows some of the pressure to escape as the sake ferments. If you don't have an airlock, you'll need to seal the jar with a loose, sanitized plug.

, Store the glass jar in a dry place with an air temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius). Allow it to ferment for another few weeks.

During this secondary fermentation, any remaining sediments should sink to the bottom of the jar. This will result in cleaner-looking and cleaner-tasting sake.
Check the appearance of the sake each day. When it's ready, there should be a very thick layer of sediment at the bottom of the jar, but the liquid above it should be clear.

, Use a siphon to transfer the prepared sake into sanitized beer bottles.

Consider using a special bottling valve for this part of the process. The valve will only allow sake to flow through the tube when it is pressed to the bottom of the bottle. As a result, you'll be less likely to spill any sake during the transfer.
You may also wish the wrap a cloth around the tip of the siphon pump as you work with it. Doing so can prevent rice and other sediments from clogging the pump.

, Set aside several bottles for immediate enjoyment. The remaining bottles should be aged to improve the flavor.

If you plan to enjoy the sake immediately, you don't need to go through any of the remaining steps. Simply seal the bottles with sanitized caps and a hand-operated capper, then store the bottles in a cool place. Drink this portion of sake within two or three months.

, Fill one-third of a large stockpot with water and set it over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a boil.

The stockpot needs to be large enough to fit the bottles of sake inside. If you don't have a large enough stockpot, pasteurize the bottles in separate batches.

, Place the bottles you wish to age inside the boiling water. Monitor the temperature of the sake using a clean food thermometer.

Note that you only need to do this with sake you plan to age. You do not need to do this step if you plan on consuming the sake immediately.
Once the sake reaches 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), it should be sterile and safe to age.

, Use a hand-operated capper to seal the bottles with sanitized caps, then store the pasteurized sake in a cool, dry place.

You can allow it to age for several months or several years—experiment as desired and note the differences in flavor that each different time frame produces.

, Homebrew sake is best enjoyed chilled or at room temperature.

Don't bother heating up the sake before drinking it. Heating sake should only be done when you have a low-quality version and you're trying to mask unappetizing flavor undertones. Homebrew sake is actually fairly pure when you take the time to do it right, so there's no need to heat it up.

, Do notuse an old trash can. Also, you must clean the trash can, even if it is brand new. Let the trash can air dry before moving on.


The trash can needs to be large enough to hold at least 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of liquid, plus other ingredients, such as ice and fruit.

, You will need about two 26.5 ounce (783.7 milliliters) bottles. If you can't find Everclear, you can also use gin, tequila, rum, or Triple Sec instead., You will need about two 26.5 ounce (783.7 milliliters) bottles of vodka. If you'd like, you can experiment with flavored vodka as well; choose fruity flavors, such as apple or orange.

, You can use the type that comes in cans, or in a large jug. If you can't find any Hawaiian Fruit punch, you can use another type of fruit punch. You will need 1.13 gallons (4.28 liters) of fruit punch total.

, This fruit will be going into the drink, peels and all, so you need them to be clean.

, Some guests may want some pieces of fruit in their cups, so make sure to cut them small enough. Add the pieces into the trash can.


Cut the watermelon in half, then cut each half into wedges.
Cut the oranges into thin slices.
Cut the stems off the strawberries, but leave the berries whole.

Age your rum in oak barrels or toasted oak (optional).,

Add flavors of other additives to improve the taste.",How to Make Rum," The operative word is clean. The slightest bit of contamination can spoil the rum. Before you start, make sure you're dealing with the cleanest ingredients and a sanitary area.


Clean and then submerge any utensils you will be using in boiling water. Turn the heat off the boiling water and soak your pot or barrel in the near-boiling water. Then dump the water. This will help kill off any potentially harmful germs.;
, The sugar will dissolve easily, but the molasses will be tougher dissolve, as it is very sticky. Try not to boil the water. Continue to let it heat up until bubbles just start to form, and then turn the burner off.

, You may find it helpful to take out about 1 liter of the mash in a jug first; try dissolving the yeast in the smaller jug. Then, when the mixture begins to foam up, incorporate with the rest of the wort.

, The yeast needs heat to keep converting sugar to alcohol. So be sure to store the wash in a warm place or keep the room artificially heated. The airlock on the pot will let the carbon dioxide out without letting oxygen in.It should take about 24 - 48 hours for the airlock to stop bubbling.


The airlock is a really important piece of the fermentation process. You can make an airlock yourself pretty easily, or you can buy one inexpensively.
Either way, be sure the airlock fits well and doesn't let additional air into the container. Why is it important that no air gets into the wash? The yeast feeds on oxygen from the sugar molecules, leaving ethyl alcohol behind (and spitting out carbon dioxide). If the yeast has a continuous supply of oxygen to eat, it won't be effective scavenging the oxygen from the sugar molecules., You can use a hydrometer to test when the mash is ready. Hydrometers measure the ratio of a density of a liquid to the density of water. Measure once a day starting on the day when your mash should be finished. Take a bit of mash out of the container and put it into a graduated cylinder. Float the hydrometer into the cylinder, gently swirling the cylinder to release any bubbles. When you get the same reading on the hydrometer for three days straight, your wash is ready to distill.

, At this point, your yeast may still be on the surface of your wash. Allowing the yeast to enter the still during distillation will cause bad smells and flavors.To knock the yeast down to the bottom of the mash, you should move your mash to a cool place — ideally, 10° - 14° C (50° - 57° F) — and wait up to two days. At this point, you can siphon your wash directly into the still or rack it and save a part of the yeast for another batch in the refrigerator., It's very important that all connections are tightly sealed and fit well.

, You want a water source to cool the alcohol vapor. As the alcohol vapor cools, it condenses into liquid ethanol. This will then drip from the condenser into a collection vessel.

, Be sure to siphon the mash carefully, avoiding the bottom, where the yeast collected.


A siphon is a tube or conduit bent into legs of unequal length, for use in drawing a liquid from one container into another on a lower level. Siphoning works by placing the shorter leg into the container above and the longer leg into the one below. The liquid is forced up the shorter leg and into the longer leg by the pressure of the atmosphere.

, For rum, a slow boil is best; no need to crank it up. Begin running cold water once the solution reaches between 50-60°C (122-140 °F). The solution will start distilling when clear drops of liquid start to exit the spout into the collection vessel.

, ounces) of clear liquid. This is called the ""heads,"" and is routinely discarded for safety precautions. The heads contains volatile methanol, which can lethal if ingested. Better to be safe than sorry, especially when you're distilling three liters of spirit., Stop collecting once temperature reached 96 °C (204.8 °F).

,,, Often, rum is aged in toasted oak barrels for 10 years or longer to add depth of flavor and color. If you don't have the luxury of a toasted oak barrel, or 10 years' time, you can safely soak your rum in toasted oak chips for three weeks to impart a signature taste. Filter your rum through a cheesecloth or clean cotton shirt to catch any of the wood particles., Depending on the reflux still, your undiluted rum can be up to 95% alcohol, which is dangerously strong for consumption. Use a dilution calculator to bring your rum down to around 45% for the best taste experience.

, Make spiced rum by adding cinnamon, ginger, and cloves to the final rum mixture, soaking for 1 - 2 weeks. Some choose to add a small amount of caramelized sugar to the rum.

Combine the following in a cocktail shaker and shake it till it's cold:3 ounces of tequila
2 ounces of lime juice
1 ounce of vodka
1/2 teaspoon of orange extract
1 tablespoon of zero-calorie sweetener, optional
Ice to mix and serve

, You may think that since gin and tonics don't contain much mixer or sugars, they'd be low in carbs. Unfortunately, most tonic water is high in carbohydrates. To make a low-carb version, use a sugar-free tonic water or a no-carb tonic water. Low-carb tonics are made with natural sweeteners like agave. You'll need to mix together:1 1/2 ounces of gin
4 to 6 ounces of no-sugar or low-carb tonic water
Ice to mix

, A traditional rum and cola runs high in carbohydrates. For a simple replacement that's lower in calories, mix one shot (1.5 ounces) of whiskey with about 4 1/2 ounces of diet cola. Pour the drink over ice and enjoy it immediately.An even better replacement for the high carb rum and cola is just whiskey on the rocks. This cuts out all of the sugar that comes with the soda or diet cola., Most of the carbohydrates in cocktails comes from the sweetener in the drink which could mean the soda, juice, or simple syrup that flavors the cocktail. Try to cut out as much of the sugar as possible or use a diet soda replacement.

For example, instead of drinking a Moscow Mule with ginger beer, vodka, and lime, you could mix diet ginger soda with vodka and a little lime., You may think that a classic cocktail (like a gin and tonic) that relies on tonic water would be low in calories, but most tonic waters are high in carbs. Swap out tonic water in any cocktail for soda water like seltzer water or club soda which are calorie free.

You may be able to purchase low-calorie tonic water in specialty stores.

, Distilled spirits do not have any calories. If you enjoy the taste, consider drinking the distilled spirits without any mixers. You can enjoy gin, tequila, vodka, rum and whiskey. You should also keep these spirits in mind when mixing your own low-calorie cocktails at home.Avoid flavored liqueurs and fortified alcohol which are all higher in carbohydrates.

, Most restaurants and bars offer unsweetened iced tea. You can order a glass of ice tea and a shot of your favorite distilled spirit (gin, tequila, rum, vodka, or whiskey). If you choose an unsweetened ice tea, this will make a great low-calorie cocktail.For a little extra flavor, ask for a few lemon wedges to squeeze into the drink.

, Cream or juice-based cocktails like a white Russian, mudslide, or margarita are high in calories because of the cocktail base, not the alcohol. Try to avoid cocktails that are mainly mixed with cream or juice since these are high in sugar and carbohydrates.

You should also avoid cocktails with garnishes that are high in carbohydrates, like additional fruit or whipped cream.

",How to Make Cucumber Water," Wash the cucumber to remove any dirt or bacteria that may be present. If desired, peel off the skin of the cucumber using a vegetable peeler or paring knife.


One attractive option is to peel thin stripes off, leaving some present for decoration.






Peeling the cucumber is largely a matter of taste, whether you prefer the look and texture of a cucumber with its peel or without.;
, Using a sharp knife, cut the cucumber lengthwise in half. Slice the two halves into pieces .25-.5 inch (.6-1.25 cm) thick.


If desired, seed the cucumber by removing the soft middle portion with a spoon prior to slicing. Cucumber seeds are edible, but some people may prefer not to include them in the drink.







, Cucumber slices will float, so if you desire a stronger infusion put a layer of ice on top of the cucumbers to keep them below the surface of the water.


For best results, allow the cucumber to steep in the water for at least an hour before drinking so the flavor will infuse the water.
Allowing the water to steep overnight will make for a more strongly flavored drink.
Stir it gently before serving.

, How much water will depend on the size of the pitcher, but a good starting ratio would be two quarts of water to one medium sized cucumber.Cucumber water is best when it is chilled, so choose a pitcher that will fit easily into your refrigerator.
If this is not an option, add ice to the pitcher to allow it to chill before serving.

, The same cucumber, or other variations if you include them, can be used for multiple batches of cucumber water. Simply leave the slices of cucumber in the pitcher when serving and refill the pitcher.


When the water seems less flavorful, discard or eat the remaining cucumber slices.
Consume the cucumber water within two days, as the beverage lacks preservatives and over time the cucumbers will rot., Wash several mint leaves under running water. Slice the mint into narrow ribbons to allow the flavor to steep better and to make for smaller pieces in the drink.


Mint is available in most supermarkets and is also hardy enough to be grown in many gardens.
Adding mint to the cucumber water will make it sweeter without adding sugar., Lemons, limes and oranges all add strong flavor to water without adding calories. If serving immediately, slice the fruit in half and squeeze the juice into the prepared cucumber water. Slices of fruit may be left with the cucumbers to steep for a longer period.


Remember to wash the fruit, particularly if you are allowing slices to steep.
Be aware that the fruit may contain seeds which could fall into the drink.
Citrus is also an important source of Vitamin C which is necessary to strengthen bones and muscles., Remove the cap of the strawberry with a paring knife and wash the berries to remove dirt or other impurities. Slice strawberries lengthwise and allow them to steep with the cucumbers.


Strawberries are an important source of potassium which can help lower blood pressure. Strawberries will be most flavorful when they are in season. Look for dark red berries that still have their caps.

, Pineapple chunks will add a tangy acidic flavor to your cucumber water. Slice fresh or canned pineapple into chunks and keep them in the freezer for a quick additive.


Add ½ cup of frozen pineapple to a pitcher of cucumber water

, Fill half the pitcher with seltzer water for the initial steep and add the remaining chilled water just prior to serving for maximum flavor and bubbles.


Club soda or other carbonated waters can give the sensation of drinking soda without adding the calories or sugar of commercially available drinks.
If calories are a consideration, remember to check the label of the sparkling water to be sure you aren’t accidentally adding more than just bubbles.
Remember that sparkling water will go flat over time, so it is better to chill it before opening it rather than after.

Many natural flavorings can significantly change the taste of water without adding calories.,
Make unsweetened tea.",How to Make Drinking Water More Enjoyable1," All-natural flavor additives can allow you to customize your water to your individual taste preferences, often without adding any calories or sweeteners.;
, Tea adds no calories to water but it can provide a wide range of flavor options.


Consider experimenting with black, green, white, rooibos, and herbal teas until you find a flavor that makes water more enjoyable.
Consider storing a pitcher of cold-brewed homemade tea in the refrigerator for a quick beverage.
Add fruits, vegetables, or herbs for flavor. Consider creating a pitcher of water in the refrigerator that contains sliced cucumbers, mint, basil or citrus fruit.
Buy naturally flavored, unsweetened water products. New water brands offer zero-calorie waters with all-natural flavors from fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Check the ingredient list and nutrition label to make sure that no sweeteners, calories, artificial flavors, or preservatives have been added.
Try a carbonated alternative to plain water. If you crave the carbonation in soda, consider purchasing carbonated water or seltzer water with no added sweeteners. Many all-natural flavor options are available at large grocery stores, and carbonated waters can often help soft drink fans replace soda with water.

Determine the pH level of your water.,
Purchase a pH kit.,
Dip a strip into your water before you alkalize.,
Understand the pH of your water.",How to Make Alkaline Water1," Before and after you alkalize your water, you should check to see what you water’s pH level is. Doing this will tell you how much of an adjustment will need to be made to your water. Water is naturally a 7 on the scale, but impurities in the water tend to tip the scale toward the left (more acidic). The ideal pH level for pure drinking water is an 8 or a 9, which is achieved through alkalizing the water., You can buy a pH kit at most health stores. The kit should come with pH strips and a pH color chart.

, Let the strip sit for a moment, and then compare the strip’s color with the colors on the chart. Note what your water’s pH level is and then alkalize your water by performing one of the methods listed below. After you alkalize your water, your water should be roughly 8 or 9 on the pH scale.

, When water is above a 7 on the pH scale, the water is basic, while water below a 7 is acidic. You want your water to be somewhere between 7 and 9.

Place several unopened beers (or other carbonated bottled drinks) in the freezer.,
Take your bottles out of the freezer and bring them to a hard, solid surface.,
Grasp the bottle around its neck and hold it above your hard surface.,
Tap the bottle down against the surface semi-hard.,
Watch as ice spreads through the liquid before your eyes!,
Learn the science behind this trick.",How to Instantly Freeze a Beer or Other Bottled Drink1," Leave these drinks in the freezer until they are nearly frozen, but still 100% liquid. You want your drinks to become very cold in the freezer, but not solid or slushy. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the strength of your freezer, so frequently check on your beer to make sure it hasn't frozen in the bottle.


If you leave your bottles in the freezer for too long, the liquid inside will eventually freeze solid. Since water expands when it freezes, this can cause the bottles to crack or rupture. This is why it's recommended to use several bottles - if you lose one bottle, you may still be able to use another.
Drinks with clear bottles work best for this trick because they allow an unhindered view of the liquid inside the bottle.;
, This trick requires a sturdy surface to work - tile works best, but if you don't have any tile in your home, you can use concrete, stone, or another similar surface. You don't want to use a surface that can scratch, break, or mar easily, so avoid wood and softer metals.


Set any bottles that have frozen solid aside.

, You want a firm grip on your bottle, but not an intense one. Hold the bottle just several inches above the hard surface you've chosen.

, Your goal is to create bubbles in the bottle, but to (obviously) avoid breaking the bottle, so strike it against the hard surface firmly but not violently. When in doubt, be conservative. The bottle may make a noise like a tuning fork.

, If done correctly, the bubbles created by smacking the bottle against the hard surface should freeze instantly, then, ice should spread from the bubbles throughout the bottle, freezing all the liquid within about 5 - 10 seconds.


If you're having trouble getting this trick to work, your liquid may not be cold enough. Return your bottle to the freezer and try again later.
You may also want to try uncapping the bottle right before you smack it against the surface, as this can aid in the production of bubbles.

, This amazing trick works according to the principle of supercooling. Basically, when you leave your beer in your freezer for long enough, it actually drops below its freezing temperature. However, because the inside of the bottle is perfectly smooth, there is nothing for ice crystals to form against, so the beer stays as a ""supercooled"" liquid for a while. When you smack the bottle against your hard surface, bubbles form, as they would in any carbonated liquid. These bubbles give the ice crystals something to ""grab on to"" on the molecular level, so, if you look closely, you should actually see ice radiate outwards from the bubbles throughout the liquid.Now that you understand how this trick works, use it to amaze your friends! Or, if you're at the bar, make a show of it and use it to win free drinks from other patrons!

Buy zero-calorie packets of powdered tea or juice-flavored additives.,
Consider a water tap purifier and flavor pack.,
Look into purchasing a hand-held flavor booster.",How to Make Drinking Water More Enjoyable2," Multiple brands now offer quick mixes in individual packets that can be added to a bottle of water.

, Some water purifiers that can be attached directly to a home water faucet also offer flavor options. Only add the recommended amount (or less) to avoid overloading on sugar and other additive ingredients.

, Some pocket-sized flavor additives offer color and flavor to water without adding calories or other unhealthy ingredients.

Drink water in unorthodox ways.",How to Make Drinking Water More Enjoyable3," When you enjoy a sweet or fattening treat, sip water on the side so that you can focus on the flavor of the food instead of the task of drinking water.

, Even if you intend to order a soda or alcoholic beverage, sipping on water while you peruse the menu can help you anticipate the other beverage even more.

, Make it a habit to always alternate between water and another beverage, have a race with friends or families to drink a glass of water with just a spoon, or take a “shot” of water between servings of other beverages.

Make ginger water first.,
Prepare your lemons.,
Add the ingredients together.",How to Make an Organic Sports Drink1," Add a little more than 2 cups (0.48 liters) of water to a small pot. Heat the water to boiling. Scrub the ginger clean, then cut it into pieces. Add the pieces to the water, and let it boil for about 15 minutes. It doesn't need to be a rolling boil, just a simmer, so turn the heat down if it seems too hot. When it's done, take it off the stove, and let the ginger sit in the water until the water is cool to the touch. It could take 15 to 30 minutes to cool, depending on the temperature of the room. Remove the ginger.Ginger may help with muscle soreness.;
, Scrub the outside of the lemons. To help release the juices, you can either press down and roll the lemon back and forth on a hard surface or heat it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Cut the lemons in half, and squeeze them into the jar you're using for your sports drink.The lemons provide potassium to the drink.

, Pour in the rest of the water, about 4.5 cups (1.08 liters) of it. Add the ginger water to it, along with the 1/2 teaspoon (2.46 milliliters) of salt. Stir until the salt dissolves. Pour or sprinkle in an organic sweetener, such as stevia, until it's at a sweetness you like. Cover and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to drink it."

Use baking soda.,
Use lemons.,
Add pH drops.",How to Make Alkaline Water2," Add 1/8 tbsp (600 mg) baking soda to an 8 oz. (0.237 liters) glass of water. Baking soda has a high alkaline content. When the baking soda mixes with the water, it increases the alkaline properties of the water. Shake (if you are using a water bottle) or stir (if using a glass) the mixture vigorously to make sure the baking soda mixes in thoroughly with the water.If you are on a low sodium diet, do not add baking soda to your water. Baking soda is high in sodium.

, Lemons are anionic, so when you drink lemon water, your body reacts with the anionic properties of the lemon making the water alkaline as your body digests it.Fill one pitcher (64 oz.) with clean water. Filtered water is the best way to go, but if you don’t have a filter, tap water is okay to use.
Cut up one lemon into eighths. Add the lemons to the water but do not squeeze them--simply place them in the water.
Cover the water and let it sit overnight for 8 to 12 hours at room temperature.
You can add one tablespoon of pink Himalayan sea salt to your lemon water if desired. Adding the salt mineralizes your alkaline water.

, pH drops contain potent alkaline minerals and are highly concentrated. You can purchase pH drops at health food stores or online. Follow the directions on your specific pH bottle to determine how many drops you should put into your water.Keep in mind that while pH drops increase the alkalinity of your water, they do not filter out any of the things like chlorine or fluoride that can be found in your tap water.

Buy a water ionizer.,
Purchase an ionizing water filter.,
Buy a reverse osmosis water filter.,
Use a normal water distiller and add pH drops.",How to Make Alkaline Water3," Water ionizers attach to your faucet and are very user friendly. The water becomes electrically enhanced (ionized) because the ionizer runs it over positive and negative electrodes. Doing this separates the water into alkalized water and acidic water. The alkalized water makes up about 70% of the produced water and can be used for drinking.


Don’t just discard the acidic water. Acidic water can kill many types of bacteria. You can use it for washing your body, killing some of the bacteria living on your skin.

, These filters are easily transportable and cheaper than buying an electric ionizer. They work in a similar fashion to a normal filter. Pour water into the filter and let it sit for three to five minutes. While you are waiting, the water is being sent through a series of filters. Once it passes through the filters, it sits in a pool of alkalizing minerals.These filters can often be found with the kitchen appliances in home stores.

, This type of filter is known as a hyperfilter, and it uses an especially fine membrane for filtration. The delicacy of the filter allows it to capture more elements than regular water filters, which ultimately alkalizes the water more completely.


These filters can be purchased at local home improvement or hardware stores and are located alongside traditional water filters.

, Water distillers boil the water put into them, destroying the bacteria and other impurities that may be found in your tap water. Water distillers can make your water slightly more alkaline, but to really alkalize your water, add pH drops to your newly purified water.


Water distillers range in price and size. They can be found alongside other kitchen appliances.

Use salted ice water.,
Use a wet paper towel.,
Use cold mugs or glasses.",How to Instantly Freeze a Beer or Other Bottled Drink2," If you're less interested in the party trick above than you are in getting your beers chilled at the last minute for a party, try dropping your drinks into a mixture of ice, water, and salt. Use about 1 cup of salt for every three pounds of ice you use.If you want your drinks to cool as quickly as possible, use as much ice as you can, but be sure to add enough water so that the mixture retains its liquid property. Liquid water comes into contact with the entire surface area of the bottle or can, rather than touching it at points, like solid ice chunks would, reducing the time that it takes to cool the drink.


Salt further shortens the cooling process. When salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into its component elements - Sodium and Chloride. It takes energy from the water to do this, which causes the temperature of the water to lower.
Note that the thicker and more insulated of container you use to contain your salted ice water, the better it will retain its coldness.

, Another way to quickly cool drinks is to wrap each bottle or can in a damp paper towel, then put the drink in the freezer. Water is a better conductor of heat than air, so, as the water in the paper towel cools, it will pull heat from the drink faster than the cold air of the freezer would on its own. As an added bonus, the evaporation of the water in the rag will have a further cooling effect on the drink.


Don't forget your beers in the freezer! If left in for too long, your bottles or cans may burst, leaving a slushy mess.

, You may have seen this in practice at bars - one way to quickly cool a drink is to pour it into a chilly mug or glass. Though quick and convenient, this method has several drawbacks - it's unlikely to cool a drink to as low of temperature as the other methods in this article and will only work effectively for the first drink you pour into the glass. It also requires you to keep a supply of glasses or mugs in the refrigerator for your beverage emergencies, which can be a non-starter if fridge space is at a premium.


It's tempting to put glasses in the freezer to get them even colder than the fridge allows, but only do so with caution. Rapid drops in temperature can cause glassware to crack or shatter. A better bet is to use plastic cups and mugs specially-designed for chilling in the freezer, which often feature a layer of freeze-able liquid for a long-lasting cooling effect.

Add in your spice.",How to Make an Organic Sports Drink2," The cranberry juice is the base of this drink, so make sure you get 100% juice with no added sugars or other juices. You can also make your own if you have a juicer. Just start with organic cranberries and run them through your juicer., Put the cranberry juice, water, salt, and maple syrup in a jar. Mix the ingredients together until the salt dissolves and the maple syrup is completely incorporated. You can drink it as is or move on to the next step., One good spice for this drink is star anise. Add a single star anise to the drink. Let it sit for an hour before taking the anise out and drinking. If you don't like the flavor of star anise, try a dash of cinnamon or cardamom, again letting it sit for a while.This drink has vitamin C, as well as electrolytes to help you recover after a workout.

Instead, you'll find good, organic chia seeds at most health food stores.Chia seeds make a great addition to a sports drink because they are a complete protein, plus they contain both antioxidants and potassium. They also contain good fats (omega-3 fatty acids) and calcium.

, Warming the water helps chia seeds release their magic. It doesn't have to be boiling. Just heating up a cup (0.24 liters) of water in the microwave for a minute or so should do it. Add the chia seeds, and stir it up. Your seeds should start to get bigger. When they do, put a lid on the container, and leave it in the fridge to soak overnight., When you take your mixture out the next morning, it should be thick. Chia seeds form a gel-like substance in water. To make it drinkable, add your juice to it. You can use any kind of organic, 100% juice you want. Stir it in until it is well incorporated. You can split this drink into two servings."

Alternatively, you can use a hand blender if that's easier. Pour in a cup (0.24 liters) of organic coconut water. Squeeze a dash or two lime, and then blend the ingredients together until smooth.Coconut water provides electrolytes for this drink.

, Taste the mixture once you've blended it. If it doesn't seem sweet enough, try adding a dash of salt. Salt will help bring out the flavor of the watermelon, plus it helps replace some of the salt you lost in your workout. You can also add a dash of sweetener if you prefer."

Boil water.,
Use stainless steel water bottles.,
Drink straight from the spring source.",How to Filter Water1," ""Pump filters"" may be your cheapest option in this category, but can be slow and tedious. For long trips, look into ""gravity filters,"" which are typically a pair of bags connected by a hose. The bag with the filter is filled with water, then hung up to let the water drain through the filter into the clean bag. This is a fast, convenient option that doesn't require you to carry around a supply of disposable filters.These filters do not protect against viruses, but they are effective against bacteria. Not all wilderness areas require protection against viruses, however, especially in the US. Check your regional disease control center or a tourist information center for more information on the risks in your region.;
, Tablets are slow but cheap, and are effective against most bacteria and viruses. Tablets come in two common types:


Iodine tablets should be left in the water for at least 30 minutes. They are sometimes sold with a companion tablet for hiding the iodine taste.Pregnant women and people with thyroid conditions should not use this method, and no one should use it as their main source of water for more than a few weeks.Chlorine dioxide tablets normally have a 30 minute wait time. Unlike iodine, they are effective in areas contaminated by the bacterium Cryptosporidium – but only if you wait 4 hours before drinking., Ultraviolet light lamps can kill bacteria and viruses, but only if the water is clear and the light is applied for long enough.Different UV lamps or light pens have different intensities, so follow the manufacturer's instructions.

, This is an extremely effective method of killing pathogens, as long as you let the water boil for at least one minute. It may not be convenient to boil water several times a day, but be aware that you won't need additional filtration if you're already boiling water for your evening meal or morning coffee.


At high elevations, boil the water for at least three minutes, since the water will boil at a lower temperature in the thin air.The high temperature, not the boiling action itself, is responsible for killing bacteria and viruses.

, Plastic bottles are only designed to be filled an used once, since the plastic can break down over time, adding potentially harmful chemicals to the water and even harboring bacteria. Even aluminum bottles often have an inner plastic coating, and are not dishwasher safe, making them difficult to clean., If you're lucky enough to find a mountain spring bubbling from the rocks, it's usually safe to drink directly from it – but this does not apply even a couple feet (0.6 m) away.This is not a foolproof rule, and may be dangerous in agricultural regions, areas with historic mining, or lower-elevation areas near population centers.

, Most modern canteens have a lid that you twist left to open, but a few go for that rustic look by using a cork. Keep your lid/cork intact though, don't accidentally through it away!

, Tilt it at a 90 degree angle so that you can get the most water in. In place where water is scarce, consider putting another container under it to prevent water wastage.

, With lids, twist it right until you can't twist it any more. For a cork, pop it in as far as possible while able to get it back out again.

Make sure the water is at a comfortable drinking temperature.,
Chug from a wide-mouthed container.,
Don't chug too quickly.",How to Chug Water1," Water that is too cold will cause your throat to contract, making it harder to chug as quickly as you would like. Hot water will burn the lining of your throat, making it painful to go on – and perhaps causing lasting damage.;
, If you want to chug more quickly, drink from a container that has a wide mouth: A glass, a pitcher, a mason jar. Most water bottles feature a very narrow bottleneck, which slows the water as it pours from the container.


Technically speaking, you will be able to chug the most water at once from a bottleneck that most perfectly matches the size of your mouth. Bear in mind that your throat may not be able to keep up with this volume of water.
If you do use a plastic water bottle, you can try scrunching the end of the bottle as you chug. This will force the water out of the bottle more quickly than it would flow otherwise. Again, bear in mind that faster does not mean healthier., If you flood your system with water, you may not be able to keep up with yourself. This could lead to choking, bloating, and water intoxication. If the water source doesn't limit the speed at which the water can pour into your throat, you will need to manually regulate the flow. Don't tip the container on its end – keep the water coming out at a manageable rate.

Use a quick filter in an emergency.,
Make charcoal.,
Prepare two containers.,
Use cloth to cover the top container's filtration hole.,
Tightly pack the charcoal over the cloth.,
Cover the charcoal with pebbles, sand, and more cloth.,
Filter water.,
Repeat until clear.,
Boil the water if possible.,
Change the top materials from time to time.",How to Filter Water2," Strain water through a bandana, shirt, or coffee filters to remove visible debris. Let the water sit for at least a few minutes, so the remaining particles settle on the bottom, then pour into another container. If at all possible, boil this water to kill pathogens before drinking. The steps below will teach you to make a more effective filter, but unless you brought along your own charcoal, the process can take several hours.

, Charcoal makes an excellent water filter, and is in fact the material used to filter water in many manufactured filters. You can make your own charcoal in the wild if you are able to build a fire. Built a hot wood fire and let it burn out completely. Cover it with dirt and ashes, and wait at least a few hours before digging it up again. Once it has completely cooled, break up the charred wood into tiny pieces, or even into dust.You've now created your own charcoal.


While not as effective as store-bought ""activated charcoal,"" which is not feasible to produce in the wilderness, homemade charcoal should be plenty effective in a filter., You'll need a ""top container,"" with a small hole in the bottom for filtering, and a ""bottom container"" to catch the filtered water. Here are a few options:


If you have access to a plastic bottle, you can cut it in half and use each half as a container. Poke a hole in the cap to use as a filtration hole.
Alternatively, use two buckets will also work, one with a hole cut into the bottom.
In a survival situation with little equipment, search for a hollow plant such as bamboo or a fallen log.

, Stretch the fabric over the base of the top container. Use enough cloth to completely cover the base, or the charcoal could be washed through.

, Pack the charcoal dust and pieces as tightly as possible over the cloth. For the filter to be effective, all water must drip slowly through the charcoal. If the water runs easily through your filter, you'll need to try again and tightly pack more charcoal into it. You should end up with a thick, tightly packed layer – up to half the container's depth, if you are using a water bottle as your filter., If you can spare a second layer of cloth, cover the charcoal tightly to prevent is being stirred up when you pour water into the container. Whether or not you add the cloth, of small pebbles and/or sand are recommended to catch larger debris and keep the charcoal in place.


Grass and leaves can also be used, as long as you know they are not poisonous species.

, Place the top container on top of the bottom container, with the pebbles on top and the charcoal on the bottom. Pour water into the top container and watch it drip slowly through the filter, into the bottom container.

, You'll often need to filter water two or three times before all the particles are removed.

, The filtering will remove many toxins and odors, but bacteria often bypass the filtering process. Boil the water if possible for additional safety.

, The top layer of sand will contain microbes and other contaminants that are unsafe to drink. After using the water filter a few times, remove the top layer of sand and replace it with clean sand.

Find out which contaminants are in your water.,
Choose a type of filter.,
Select an installation type.,
Set up the filter according to the manufacturer's instructions.,
Run water through the filter.,
Change the filter cartridge as recommended.",How to Filter Water3," If you live in or near a large U.S. city, look it up on the Environmental Working Group database. Otherwise, you may need to contact your water utility and ask for a water quality report, or ask a local environmental group focused on water issues.

, Once you know the specific chemicals you are trying to filter out, you can read the packaging or online descriptions of water filter products to see whether they are removed. Alternatively, use the EWG filter selection search, or narrow down your options using these tips:Charcoal (or ""carbon"") filters are cheap and widely available. They will filter out most organic contaminants, including lead, mercury, and asbestos.
Reverse osmosis filters remove inorganic contaminants such as arsenic and nitrates. They are extremely water-inefficient, so use only if you know the water is contaminated with a chemical carbon does not filter out.
De-ionizing filters (or ion exchange filters) remove minerals, turning hard water into soft water. They do not remove contaminants.

, There are many types of water filters on the market, designed to accommodate a variety of needs. Here are the most common options for home use:A pitcher water filter. These are convenient for households with low water use, as you can fill the pitcher once or twice a day and keep it cool in the refrigerator.
A faucet-mounted filter is convenient if you want to filter all your tap water, but can slow down flow rate.
On-counter or under-sink water filters required plumbing modifications, but generally use longer-lasting filters, and thus require less maintenance.
Install a whole-house water filter if your water is severely contaminated and unsafe even for bathing.

, Each filter should come with a set of instructions showing you how to set it up so that it works correctly. In most cases assembly is quite simple, but if you have trouble putting it together, call the manufacturer for help.

, Take cold water and pass it through the filter. In most cases the water is poured into the top of the filter; it then makes its way down through the filter mechanism, where impurities are removed. The clean water streams into the bottom of the bottle or pitcher, or out of the bottom of the faucet, depending on what type of filter you have.


Do not submerge the filter while running water through it. Water that backs up into the filter may not be purified.
Some filters are damaged by hot water; check the manufacturer's instructions.

, After a few months of use, a carbon water filter becomes clogged and stops working as well to purify water. Buy a new filter cartridge from the same manufacturer that made the water filter. Remove the old cartridge and discard it, then replace it with the new one.


Some water filters last longer than others. Check the instructions that came with your product for a more detailed time frame, or contact the manufacturer.

Gather supplies.,
Drill holes in the buckets.,
Install the spigot.,
Set up the filter.,
Filter water.,
Clean the water filter.",How to Filter Water4," Homemade ceramic filters work by filtering water through a layer of porous ceramic. The holes are small enough to filter out contaminants, but large enough to let water pass through into a container. To make a ceramic water filter, you'll need the following equipment:


A ceramic filter element. You can buy a candle filter or a pot filter for this purpose. The filters are available online or at hardware stores. Be sure to choose one that meets or exceeds National Safety Foundation standards, which specify what percentage of impurities must be filtered out of the water in order for it to be drinkable.Two food-grade buckets. One bucket is used as a receptacle for the impure water, and the second bucket is for the purified water. Food-grade buckets are available from restaurant supply stores, or you may be able to obtain used buckets from a restaurant in your area.
A spigot. This is attached to the bottom bucket to access the purified water.

, In total, you'll need to drill 3 holes: one in the bottom of the top bucket, one in the lid of the bottom bucket, and a third hole in the side of the bottom bucket (for the spigot).


Start by drilling a 1/2-inch hole in center of the bottom of the top bucket.
Drill a second 1/2-inch hole in the center of the lid of the bottom bucket. This hole should align exactly with the hole in the first bucket. The water will pass from the first bucket through the filter and drip into the second bucket.
Drill a 3/4-inch hole in the side of the bottom bucket. This is where the spigot will be attached, so it should be just an inch or two from the bottom of the bucket.

, Following the installation instructions that came with your spigot, place the back of the spigot into the hole you drilled in the bottom bucket. Tighten it from the inside and make sure it's firmly in place.

, Install the filter element in the hole in the top bucket, so that it sits in the bottom of the bucket with its ""nipple"" poking through the hole. Set the top bucket on the bottom bucket, making sure that the nipple pokes through the hole in the top of the bottom bucket, too. The filter is now installed., Pour impure water into the top bucket. It should begin draining through the filter and come out the nipple into the bottom bucket. The filtration process may take a few hours, depending on how much water you're filtering. When a good amount of water has collected in the bottom bucket, use the spigot to transfer some water to a cup. The water is now clean and ready to drink.

, The impurities in the water will collect at the bottom of the top bucket, so this should be cleaned out from time to time. Take the filter apart and use bleach or vinegar to thoroughly clean it every few months, or more often if you use the filter frequently.

"
"
Tilt your head back about 45 degrees.,
Relax your throat muscles and pour the water downward.,
Make sure that you can breathe.",How to Chug Water2," Try to make your throat passage nearly vertical. Tip your head enough that the water runs down your throat from the force of gravity alone. This way, you won't need to engage your throat muscles to physically suck the water down your gullet. You should be able to chug more quickly as a result.


Don't tip your head back forward until you're done chugging water. If you shift your throat passage while the water is still draining, then that water might be slowed by the muscle contraction. This can cause you to choke.
Never chug while lying down. Chugging while horizontal increases the likelihood that the water will slip into your windpipe, causing you to choke.

, If you feel your throat tense up, try to calm yourself. Do not make any swallowing motions, as these may actually slow the process. Pour at a steady rate to avoid a backup.


Be careful! It is easy to accidentally pour the water into your windpipe, which can cause a series of choking spasms.

, If you are drinking from a bottle, leave a small gap between your upper lip and the top of the mouth of the bottle. This will allow air to flow past the mouth of the bottle. If you have an air source other than the inside of the bottle, then you won't need to pull the water source away from your mouth to take a breath.

Understand the risk of hyponatremia, or ""water intoxication."",
Avoid chugging water when you are doing endurance activities.,
Don't drink so much that you choke or vomit.,
Consider sipping water instead.",How to Chug Water3," If you chug too much water, too fast, you can give yourself an electrolyte imbalance: your kidneys cannot flush the amount of water you've consumed, and your blood becomes waterlogged. This extra water can swell your brain cells, causing your brain to expand dangerously against the skull. Rapid and severe cellular swelling can cause seizures, respiratory arrest, coma, brain stem herniation, and even death.It's estimated that consuming more than 1.5 liters/hour over several hours can greatly increase your risk of hyponatremia., The risk of hyponatremia is especially high if you have been steadily exerting yourself over a long period of time – and even more so if you are performing in a hot environment. You lose sodium (an electrolyte) through sweat. Thus, drinking too much water to re-hydrate during endurance activities—such as marathons and triathlons—can dilute the sodium content of your blood.

, If you consume too much liquid at once, you can choke on it., as water spills into your airways. If you flood your stomach with more water than it can handle, you may involuntarily puke out the excess water.Make sure that there is no ice in the water. It is quite possible to choke to death on a chunk of ice.

, If you are trying to chug water for health and hydration benefits, keep in mind that chugging is no more efficient than sipping water. What's more, chugging can potentially counteract the positive effects of drinking water.If you are chugging water for a competition: remember the risks, and think before you chug. Ask yourself whether winning this chugging contest is worth any potential damage to your body.

Pack the proper water purifying equipment and chemicals.,
Immerse the end of the pump where water flows in in the clearest portion of the water source that you can see.,
Pump until your water container is full.

,
Drop in the amount of purification tablets needed to purify your water.,
Bleed the threads.,
Wait for a little now.",How to Disinfect Drinking Water in the Wilderness1," If you're backpacking you should have a high quality pump with a filter, and/or purifying tablets.;
, Deeper areas are preferable since it will be easier to draw out water.

,, It should say on the package how many tablets to use per liter.

, Once the tablets have dissolved, bleed the threads. Turn your water bottle upside down with the lid on and carefully loosen the cap until a little bit of water leaks out. This will flush the threads of the bottle with the water that has purification chemicals in it, thereby cleaning the threads which often harbor bacteria.

, Most tablets say to wait for 30 minutes before drinking the purified water, but check carefully to see what the specified waiting period is for your tablets. Even though it may not seem like it, this is critical. One backpacking guide once said ""If you don't wait for the tablets to wash your bottle out, they'll wash you out.""


After waiting for the specified amount of time, the water should be safe to drink.

Use a ripe papaya.,
Try to use local papaya.,
Use honey or sugar to sweeten the shake.,
Use cold milk.,
Use ice cubes for a blended-ice shake.,
Consider adding a pinch of black pepper powder.",How to Make a Papaya Milkshake1," Taste the papaya before you use it in your milkshake, just to be sure, even if it was ripe when you bought it. There are three easy ways to tell whether a papaya is ripe without slicing it open:


Look at the color. Unripe papaya is green on the outside. The skin of ripe papaya will be splashed with rich red, orange, and yellow hues. Some types of papaya grow yellow when ripe, and some grow red—the important thing is that the fruit is not completely green.
Squeeze the papaya gently. If it is ripe, the skin will give a little bit. If it is unripe, the fruit will feel hard and firm. If it is overripe, the skin will sag and the fruit may begin to feel squishy.
Smell the papaya where the fruit grew from the stem. You should smell a sweet, pleasant scent—nothing rotten or overly-sweet. This method may be most effective once you are familiar with the natural smell of papaya.;
, Papaya is freshest and tastiest when it is locally grown and picked. Papayas grow in Hawaii, Costa Rica, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Ghana, India, and Peru, among other places. If the fruit grows in your area, pick it fresh or be sure to buy a ripe papaya. If it doesn't grow near you, try to choose fruit that's been imported from as close as possible to your location:


Try Hawaiian Sunrise and Sunset papayas. These small-to-medium-sized red-orange varieties are known for being some of the sweetest papayas on the market. The Sunrise has notably shallow seed cavities, making seed removal much easier than with other types.
Try kapaho papaya. This papaya grows in Hawaii and Costa Rica, and is known for a small-to-medium-sized fruit with sweet, yellow flesh.
Try a Mexican papaya. Mexican papayas are much larger than kapaho papayas, and they can have either red or yellow flesh on the inside. The Mexican varieties are not as sweet as the Hawaiian papayas, and some say that they have a bland or bitter flavor. Mexican yellows are sweeter than Mexican reds, but still not as sweet as the Hawaiian breeds.
Try an Australian variety. The Bettina and Pearson cultivars grow in Queensland—the fruit are large with sweet flesh. Sunnybank and Guinea Gold papayas both grow in Western Australia, and they are characterized by their yellow flesh.

, The sweetener helps liven up the taste of the milkshake if you are using a bitter or bland papaya. Use one tablespoon of honey/sugar, or more, or less, depending on how sweet you want the shake to be. When in doubt, err on the conservative side so that you don't wind up with a milkshake that's too sweet. Bear in mind that some varieties of papaya are already very sweet.


You don't need to limit yourself to honey and sugar. Use your favorite sweetener—agave nectar, Stevia extract, etc.

, You can use dairy milk, almond milk, soy milk, or any other type—but keep in mind that the thickness of your milk will directly impact the consistency of the milkshake. If you use a rich whole milk, you will have a thick milkshake. If you use skim milk, or a thin non-lactose milk like rice milk, your shake will be proportionally thin. You can balance out the consistency with a scoop of ice cream or yogurt, extra ice cubes, or more papaya. Try several ingredients and find the combination that works for you.

, This will thicken the consistency of thin shakes—say, if you use a thin milk—and it will add a bit of crunch to the finished product. Use 3-4 ice cubes to start out. Add more cubes if you like the crunch, or add fewer cubes if you're just trying to thicken the shake a bit. The blender should have no trouble breaking up the ice cubes.

, Black pepper can lend an aromatic punch to the milkshake, and some people love how the bitter bite of the spice complements the sweet scent of papaya.Be careful not to overdo it, unless you particularly love pepper. You can blend the pepper into the mix, or you can sprinkle it onto the surface of the blended shake.

Add your base liquid.,
Add your whey protein mix.,
Add fruits, yogurts, and other ingredients.,
Gradually increase your blending speed.,
Turn off your blender.",How to Make a Protein Shake2," Make sure the blender is in the off position, and then pour 1 cup (240 ml) of milk or juice into the blender.


If you want to make a thicker protein shake, add a few ice cubes first. Then blend your ice and liquid on a medium speed for about 10 seconds to break up the ice.
If you're allergic to dairy, you can use soy milk, non-dairy almond or coconut milk as a substitute. You can also use juice instead of milk.
Non-dairy protein powders are another option if you are allergic to dairy. Instead of a dairy-based protein powder, look for soy protein, rice protein, or dried fruit powders.

, Protein powder is one of the most efficient ways to ensure that your body is getting a proper daily dose of protein. After you add your milk or juice, pour your powder into your blender. Blend with the milk at a medium speed for 15 seconds.


Blending your protein powder with your milk before you add your other ingredients will ensure that the powder completely dissolves and doesn’t leave any chunks.
Follow the serving size directions on your tub of protein powder to get the right amounts in your shake. As a rule of thumb, if you are trying to put on weight or muscle, men should use two scoops; women should use one scoop.

, After you mix your powder and milk, you can add a variety of different ingredients to your protein shake. Fruits and yogurts not only add an extra boost of daily vitamins but add flavor. From nuts to frozen yogurt, your options are endless.If you love your vanilla latte, try adding vanilla protein powder, and a half cup of low-fat frozen yogurt to your shake.
Substitute regular milk for soy milk. Add 1 tablespoon of almonds, 1 tablespoon of sugar-free maple syrup, vanilla extract, and low-fat Greek yogurt to get a delicious soy almond shake. If you're lactose intolerant, make sure the yogurt is lactose-free.
If you love fruit, use a fruit flavored whey protein or dried fruit powder. Then mix in a handful of berries like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and non-fat milk. Add your fruits after you've blended the powder with the milk or juice to get a smoother drink.
Feel free to play around with mixing yogurts, fruit, and nuts together to get your perfect shake. Add these secondary ingredients after you've blended your protein powder with your liquid and ice.

, With all your ingredients mixed in, start at a medium speed. After you hear less of a crunching noise, especially if you've added ice, work up to a high speed.


Make sure to blend the ingredients for at least 45 seconds or until the fruit is completely dissolved.

, Once you’ve blended your protein shake for about 45 seconds, turn off the blender and remove the lid. Pour the shake into a large glass.


Pour a little bit of your shake into your glass first, and do a taste test. See if the consistency is to your liking.
If you see or feel ice chunks, blend again on high for another 10 or so seconds.
If your protein shake is too watery, add a bit more milk or yogurt to thicken it up.

"

Grab a large mixing container.,
Pour your liquids into your bottle.,
Add your protein mix.,
Prepare your fruit or other ingredients.,
Add your other ingredients.",How to Make a Protein Shake3," A water bottle with a sealable lid and large mixing bowl work well when you don't have a blender. Additionally, if you have a blender bottle or a spherical whisk, you can use that to shake up your ingredients.


For this method, it's best to mix your liquids separately from your solids before blending everything together. You will have to mash your solids before adding to your shake.
A nonelectric food processor and chopper will also work well for mixing your fruits and other solid foods.

, Add 1 cup (240 ml) of milk or juice into your container before you add your powder.


If you don’t have a blender, it’s best not to add any ice. The ice won’t be able to break up in your container, and will prevent any of your other ingredients from fully mixing.

, Before adding anything else, just like with a blender, mix in your protein. Use your whisk and shake your bottle, or stir with a fork.


Unless you can mash up nuts or chocolate to a fine powder by hand, use a flavor powder substitute. You can also use peanut butter instead of nuts. Try almond milk instead of almonds, and chocolate powder instead of chocolate.
You can also buy fruit powder, which is similar to your protein powder. Instead of a whey protein powder you can use fruit powder which contains all the nutrients of fruit. If you opt for fruit powder, mix it in like you would your protein powder, after you add your juice or milk. The easiest way to mix all your protein powder is to pour a little in at a time, stir, and then pour more.
By adding a little protein at a time there is less powder that has to absorb at once.
Once you’ve stirred in all your powder, screw the lid of your bottle on tightly and shake for 10 to 15 seconds. Even if you don’t have a spherical whisk, shaking your bottle will help to break up any leftover protein chunks.

, Because you don’t have a blender, you have to turn your fruit and other solid ingredients into a shake-like consistency by hand. Mash your fruit up with a mortar and pestle or in a bowl with a fork and spoon. Mash your fruit until you have a mushy consistency, then add a little juice, milk, yogurt, or water to the mix. Whisk your mix until it is blended to your satisfaction.


It’s easiest to use soft fruits if you don’t have a blender. Fruits like bananas, mangos, and berries work well.

, If you mashed up fruit to add to your smoothie, pour your mixture in now and shake or stir.


Additionally, if you’re adding yogurt mix it in now.
Stir your mix for 10 to 15 seconds or until you’re satisfied.
Screw the lid on your bottle and give it a good shake to make sure everything is mixed together.
Do a taste test. If you’re satisfied, enjoy your shake.

Find flowing water if at all possible.,
Pre-filter the water through cloth.,
Start the fire.,
Heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil.,
After ten minutes the water should be safe to drink.

",How to Disinfect Drinking Water in the Wilderness2," It is possible to sterilize still water, but flowing water is usually much cleaner.

, Take a tightly woven piece of cloth such as a bandana or shirt and group the corners together, forming a bag. Scoop this bag through the water and position it over your water container. The cloth will act as a primitive filter, but will only filter out particles about the size of what you can see.

, Since you may not have tablets when you're lost boil the water to make it drinkable.

, Leave the water at a rolling boil for ten minutes.


Since your only water container will probably be your water bottle you'll have to unscrew the lid so it doesn't explode from the steam pressure.
You should also suspend the bottle so that its bottom is a few inches above the flames. Hopefully, this will keep the bottle from completely melting.

Wash the papaya.,
Refrigerate a ripe papaya until it is cold.,
Lay the papaya on its side and slice off about three inches from the bottom.,
Remove the seeds.,
Peel the papaya.,
Open up the papaya.,
Remove any remaining seeds and fibers.,
Dice the papaya into small chunks using a sharp knife.",How to Make a Papaya Milkshake2," The skin of the fruit is not edible, but it is still important to wash the surface before you eat it. If the outside of the fruit is contaminated with bacteria or chemicals, you might infect the inside of the fruit when you slice it before washing.

, Although papayas can be eaten at room temperature, the flavor is best when served cold. Place a whole or halved papaya into the fridge to prepare it. You can freeze the papaya to cool it more quickly, but bear in mind that you may need to thaw it slightly before using it. When you are ready to make your milkshake, remove the papaya from the fridge.

, You should be able to see into the seed cavity in the center of the fruit. If you don't have access to the seed cavity, slice off a bit more.

, Hold the papaya over a bowl. Use a spoon to scoop out the black, round seeds and the sticky membrane that holds them in place.

, Stand the papaya on the end, using the side that you sliced as the base. Slowly slice off the peel in thin, downward slices—and be thorough. Try to leave a small cap of peel at the top of the fruit so that you can hold the fruit without touching the inside. Lay the papaya back on its side and cut away any remaining peel.

, Chop off the top of the papaya around the stem. Slice the papaya in half, lengthwise.

, Flip each half of the papaya over so that you can see the seed cavity. Use your spoon to scoop out any remaining seeds. Scrape away any white fibers for a smoother shake, although this is not strictly necessary., The chunks do not need to be regular or equally-sized. The smaller the bits, the smoother your milkshake will be—but do not feel obliged to over-dice. As long as the blades of the blender can bite into the papaya and process it into the other ingredients, your milkshake should turn out fine.

First, blend the papaya with honey.,
Pour the milk into the blender.,
Add your sweeteners.,
Add any additional ingredients, to taste.,
Make the shake.,
Add the ice cubes.,
Taste your papaya milkshake before you pour it.",How to Make a Papaya Milkshake3," Put 1 cup of diced papaya (per serving) into a blender with about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey. This may improve the consistency of the papaya extract before you add milk. Blend until the papaya is thoroughly blended and juiced.

, You can always add more milk to adjust the consistency later. If you are supplementing or replacing the milk with ice cream or yogurt, you can add that now as well.

, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey, sugar, or another sweetener should do the trick. If you aren't sure how sweet you want your milkshake, leave out the honey/sugar until after you've blended all of the other ingredients. You can always add more of any ingredient to tweak the taste.

, Consider adding 1 1/2 of vanilla extract for a sweeter shake, or a pinch of black pepper for a spicier shake. If you aren't sure, you can always add extra seasonings after you've blended and tasted the basic shake.

, Blend all the ingredients for 1-2 minutes, or until the milkshake reaches a smooth consistency. Stop blending when you like the texture., If you are adding ice cubes, add them once the milkshake becomes a puree, then blend for another 30 seconds. This will ensure that the ice cubes blend into the shake, but not so much that they lose their texture., You can drink the shake as it is, or you can choose to add more ingredients to tweak the taste of the shake.


If the shake isn't sweet enough, you can add honey, sugar, or ice cream to taste. If you are using a sweet variety of papaya, then you may just choose to add more papaya.
If the shake is too sweet, you can add ice cubes, or milk to dilute the shake. Consider adding black pepper, if you haven't already, for a spicy twist.
If the shake is too thick, you can add more milk to loosen the consistency.
If the shake is too thin, you can add ice cubes, ice cream, or more papaya to thicken it up.

Know the amount of carbohydrates that are in the drink.,
Calculate the percentage of carbohydrates in a sports drink by checking the amount of carbohydrates on the nutrition label.,
Check the types of carbohydrate in the ingredient statement.",How to Assess the Quality of a Sports Drink1," You will need different amounts of carbohydrates, depending on when and why you will be consuming the sports drink. A pre-workout drink may have more carbohydrates than a drink needed during a workout, or, a pre-workout drink may have fewer carbohydrates and only serve to keep you hydrated and help with water retention.

Understand isotonic sports drinks. Isotonic sports drinks have 6 to 8% carbohydrates, water and electrolytes. An isotonic sports drink is an optimum beverage for during a workout. It has the best amount of carbohydrates to help maintain energy. If you are unsure which drink you need, an isotonic beverage is the best way to go because it is versatile and beneficial.
Understand hypotonic sports drinks. This type has less than 6% carbohydrates and electrolytes. It doesn’t contain enough carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen. These types of sports drinks are best for hydration only. They can be consumed during a workout lasting less than 60 minutes, before a workout or after a workout. The electrolytes will help with fluid retention.



 


Understand hypertonic sports drinks. These contain electrolytes and more than 8% carbohydrates. Hypertonic fluids are not good for during a workout or after a workout because of the high carbohydrate load. They can cause digestion to slow and rehydration to slow because of the amount of carbohydrates the body is trying to digest. Hypertonic fluids are best consumed when carbohydrate loading at least an hour before a workout. They will help with pre-workout muscle glycogen stores.





;
, Sports drinks do not usually label the percentage of carbohydrates in the drinks so you will need to calculate it for yourself.


Convert serving size from fluid ounces (oz) or mL to grams (g). For fluid oz, divide the amount of oz by 0.03527 to get the amount in g. To convert mL to g, divide the amount in mL by 1.
Calculate the percentage of carbohydrates in a serving size by dividing the amount of carbohydrate in the drink by the serving size in grams and multiplying by 100.

, Different carbohydrates absorb at different rates. For sports drinks, you will want rapidly digestible carbohydrates with a high glycemic index.


Choose sports drinks with glucose, maltodextrin, dextrose, high glucose corn syrup and glucose and fructose mix. These have a higher glycemic load and will digest more rapidly.
Avoid sports drinks with high fructose corn syrup or fructose as the main ingredient for energy. Alone, fructose slows digestion and will not absorb as quickly as needed to restore muscle glycogen. Most sports drinks use high fructose corn syrup for flavor so it is important to read the ingredient statement to determine what other carbohydrates are being used.

Choose a drink with added protein for a post workout recovery drink.,
Choose a drink with added amino acids to help decrease damage to the muscles and reduce fatigue.",How to Assess the Quality of a Sports Drink2," Electrolytes act as buffers in the blood stream to ensure cells maintain proper function and help with water movement and retention in the body. Most sports drinks add sodium and potassium for this. According to the Institute of Sports Medicine, sodium plays a very important role in helping to retain water to prevent dehydration, so sodium is important. The effect of potassium as hydration aid in sports drinks has been found to be minimal.

, Added calcium and potassium would be good examples of minerals that are important to muscle function. They may help people prone to muscle cramps during exercise. Zinc has been shown to help the body use energy more efficiently. Magnesium can promote relaxation after a workout.

, Studies have shown that caffeine can enhance mental alertness, and, when combined with carbohydrates, can help muscles retain glycogen. This is only recommended for athletes doing more than 60 minutes of exercise. Also, be sure to choose a drink with minimal caffeine content because too much caffeine can cause adverse effects. A common energy drink would have much more caffeine than what is needed. It is best not exceed 200 mg caffeine in a day.

, Studies have shown protein and carbohydrates consumed within an hour after exercise increases muscle synthesis and decreases fatigue. Milk, whey and soy protein have all been shown to be very effective post workout., Amino acids at amounts as low as 1% have been shown to have an effect on performance and fatigue. This would be an ideal addition to a sports drink that would be consumed during endurance exercise, such as a marathon or triathlon.

, This will not only give your milkshake an extra burst of flavor, but it will also replace the ice and give the milkshake some extra thickness.

, Keep blending until the banana has completely broken up. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls. If the milkshake is not blending well enough, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any unblended milkshake down the sides of the canister and towards the bottom.

, For an extra special touch, garnish it with a swirl of whipped cream on top and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Place a thin banana slice on the rim and pop in a straw.

Put a peeled, sliced, and frozen banana into a blender.,
Add 2 tablespoons (30 grams) natural peanut butter.,
Top it off with 1 tablespoon (5 grams) cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder.,
Finish off with 3 to 4 ice cubes, and blend until smooth.,
Blend in the milk, ½ cup (120 milliliters) at a time.,
Pour the milkshake into one or two tall glasses and serve it immediately.",How to Make a Peanut Butter Milkshake4," This will not only give your milkshake some extra flavor, but it will also replace the ice cream using in traditional milkshakes.

, Try to use the salted kind to help cut down on the sweetness of the milkshake. If you don't mind the extra sweetness, then you can use the regular, unsalted peanut butter. Also, try to use the smooth and creamy kind of peanut butter; it will be easier to blend and give you a smoother milkshake in the end.

, You can typically find it in the baking section of a grocery store. Because this is pure cacao/cocoa, it does not have any milk or dairy added to it. Avoid using any chocolate milk mix; that does have dairy in it.

, Don't add in the milk just yet; you will be doing that last. Keep blending the milkshake until the banana and ice have all broken up, and all of the ingredients are evenly mixed together. You may have to pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to push any unmixed milkshake towards the bottom.

, The more milk you add, the thinner your milkshake will be. Plan on using 1 to 1 ½ cups (240 to 360 milliliters) of milk. Unsweetened almond milk is recommended, but you can use any other type of non-dairy milk, such as cashew or soy. You can even use a flavored almond milk, such as vanilla.

, For a special touch, pop a thin banana slice onto the rim, and garnish the top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder.

Scoop your ice cream into your container.,
Add milk.,
Add any other ingredients.,
Mash and stir with a spoon.,
Put the lid on your jar or shaker and shake it up.,
Enjoy your milkshake.",How to Make a Milkshake Without a Blender1," Since you don’t have a blender, you can use a container that has a lid or a cocktail shaker to shake your milkshake ingredients together.


It's best to choose a container with a lid for shaking and storing any leftover milkshake. You can also use a large lidded jar such as a mason jar or blender bottle if you have one.
If you want something like a shake, you can use a drink shaker.
Note. If you decide to use a bottle with a spherical whisk to help mix your ingredients, mix any powder with milk in the bottle first. Then add your ice cream.;
, Since you don’t have a blender, you may want to consider using a lighter ice cream. A light ice cream will make your milkshake fluffier, while a thicker ice cream will make it creamier. However, a thicker ice cream will be harder to mix.To make your ice cream easier to scoop and mix, consider letting it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes, or heating in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
You can also substitute frozen yogurt or sorbet instead of ice cream.
Try homemade ice cream, it tastes great and can be easier to mix., Pour your milk into your container on top of the ice cream. You want to have a ratio of about three parts ice cream to one part milk.


Like your ice cream, the thicker the milk, the creamier your milkshake will be.
If you are adding any powder, like malt powder or protein powder, mix it in with your milk first.
If you have a water bottle that has a spherical whisk, use it to mix up your milk and powder.

, If you want to add fruit or candy in your milkshake, pour it in on top of your milk and ice cream.


If you are adding fruit or chunks of candy, mash up your fruit or candy in a bowl or with a mortar and pestle before adding it to your container. This will make it easier to mix into your milkshake.

, Before you shake up your milkshake to get a nice frothy texture, take a spoon and give your ingredients a good mix. By mashing and stirring with a spoon you will distribute your ingredients evenly and soften the ice cream.


Once you don’t feel many clumps of ice cream, and have a consistent texture, you can stop stirring and mashing.

, Shake your container well so that the milk, flavoring, and ice cream get blended together smoothly.


Shake your container like you would when mixing a cocktail. Grab the top and bottom of your container and shake in an up and down motion.Shake your container for about 15 seconds. If you find your mix is still too solid, you can shake it again.

, Once you’ve shaken up your container, remove the lid, grab a straw, and do a taste test. If your milkshake is too thin, add another scoop of ice cream. If too thick, pour in a bit more milk and give it another shake.


Once you’re satisfied, grab a straw or spoon and enjoy.

, First, wash these ingredients and then removing the stems, cores, and seeds, chop kale, apple, cucumber, and celery into small pieces and put in the blender.

, Continue to add hemp hearts, frozen mango, mint leaves, coconut oil, and ice cubes to the blender. Using frozen mango helps the consistency of the shake, but you can use fresh mango and just add a few more ice cubes.

, Once everything is added to the blender, blend the ingredients on high until the shake is smooth (you don't see chunks of the ingredients). If the shake is looking really thick, add a little water and continue to blend.

, This shake yields about 17 grams of protein, 12 grams of fiber, and is a rich source of Vitamin C + A, iron, and calcium. It makes about 3 cups so enjoy it in a large glass, or split it into two glasses for a more snack-like shake."

Alternatively, you can use an electric mixer or food processor if you have those instead of a blender.
If you don’t have an electric mixer of any sort, a handheld whisk works just as well.

, Lighter ice creams will make your milkshake fluffier, while a thicker ice cream will make it creamier. If you’re using a flavor that has chunks of candy in it, you may want to let it sit out a bit longer so the ice cream is easier to mix.To make your ice cream easier to scoop and mix, consider letting it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes, or heating in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
If you are using frozen yogurt or sherbet, you don’t have to let it sit as long because it will be softer.
If you are adding fruit or chunks of candy, make sure you have cut or mashed those ingredients into small chunks.

, You want to have a ratio of about three parts ice cream to one part milk.


Like your ice cream, the thicker the milk, the creamier your milkshake will be.
Add any powder you may be using to your milk before mixing the milk into your bowl. It’s easier to dissolve any powder in the milk first, rather than trying to do so once it’s in your bowl. Use a bottle with a spherical whisk if you have one, or simply stir with a fork or spoon.

, You have several options for mixing your ingredients together depending on what consistency you want in your milkshake. If you are looking for something a bit chunkier, then you can use a spoon or masher. If you want something smoother, try whisking your mix with a hand whisk.


If you have an electric mixer, you can mix your ingredients together like you would for cake batter.

, Take a spoon and do a taste test to decide if you’re satisfied with the consistency.


You can add a little milk to thin it out, or add more ice cream to make it thicker.

, It’s best to pour as much of your shake into your glass as you can right away. This way you can enjoy your milkshake without it melting, thinning out, or becoming soupy.If you want your milkshake to be extra cold, store your glass in the freezer while you mix all your ingredients together.

Enjoy your chocolaty-bean shake.",How to Make a Homemade Protein Shake Without Protein Powder2," If you are using beans from a can, then simply measure out 1/2 cup and pour into a blender. However, if you are using dry beans, be sure to cook them and drain the excess water. You can cook beans in a crock pot or on the stove. When the beans are ready, add them to your blender.


Cooking beans in a crockpot is an easy way to prepare beans without soaking them beforehand. Simply rinse beans, pour into crockpot, add 6 cups of water for every pound of beans, and set crockpot on high for four to six hours. Once the beans are cooked, drain excess water and they'll be ready to go! It may seem weird to add beans to a shake, but they are similar to spinach in that when mixed with other ingredients they don't have a taste -- they just add a sneaky bit of nutrition!

, Taking a ripe banana, remove the peel and slice it into small discs, and then place in blender. It may help to use a frozen banana to make the shake colder and give it a creamy, thicker consistency.

, Blend ingredients on high until smooth. If you want to add more protein to your shake, substitute almond milk for 1% milk. This will increase the protein by seven grams. , This shake yields about 17 grams of protein, but substituted with regular milk will increase the protein to 24 grams."

Look for a high-density ice cream. Choose two brands of ice cream that are the same size (a pint, a quart, etc.) and hold one in each hand. The one that feels heavier will make the better milkshake.Ice creams that are lighter and fluffier contain more air. When you mix the milkshake you'll be introducing even more air, and won't get the thick, creamy consistency you want in a milkshake. Go for the dense ice cream over the extra-churned ice cream so you'll start out with less air.You can of course use any ice cream flavor you want, so stray from the vanilla base if you want to experiment. If you want a mint chocolate chip milkshake but don't want to mess with mint extract and chocolate chips, go ahead and use a mint chip ice cream.;
, Whole milk is preferable for a milkshake, since it has a fuller flavor and will make a thicker shake. But if you prefer skim, soy, or nut milk, feel free to use those instead. Just remember these milks tend to be a little thinner, so you want to either use less milk or add a little more ice cream for consistency.If you can, look for a high-quality, locally produced milk. The better quality ingredients you put into your milkshake, the better the milkshake., The ideal temperature for milkshake-ready ice cream is 20°F (-7°C) and your freezer will probably keep it at about 0°F (-18°C). Allow the ice cream to sit out on the counter for a few minutes--you'll know it's ready when it's soft and easy to scoop, like soft-serve, but not runny or melted.If you toss your ice cream into the mixer when it's too cold and hard, you will end up adding too much milk to thin it out. The milk to ice cream ratio is important to making a great milkshake, and too much milk will make your shake runny.For the same reason, never add ice to a milkshake. It will water down your shake and dilute the flavor and creaminess. If you prefer a thinner shake, just add a splash more milk instead., A milkshake mixer is best because it churns and aerates your milkshake at the same time.But if you're not ready to invest in professional equipment, a regular kitchen blender or immersion (stick) blender will work fine.If you don't have any of those things, use a large bowl and a whisk to beat the ice cream and milk together.As you begin the recipe, take the glass you plan to use for your milkshake and put it in the freezer. Then it will be nice and chilled when you're ready to serve.,, If you are using a blender, don't just turn it on and let it go. Alternate between pulsing the blender and then hand-mixing with a spoon. This will give you the same effect as a spindle milkshake mixer.No matter which mixing method you use (whisk, stick blender, professional milkshake blender), you want to make sure your shake remains thick. If you insert a spoon and try to pull it out, the thick shake should give a little resistance.If you like a lumpy milkshake, only mix your shake for 30-45 seconds.
If your shake seems too thick, add a splash of milk.If your shake seems too watered down, add another scoop or half-scoop of ice cream and mix., If the milkshake is the right thickness and consistency, you should need to use the spoon to get it out of the blender and into the glass. If it slides out easily, it's too thin or over-mixed and you'll want to add more ice cream.Top your milkshake with a healthy squirt of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.Or garnish with a little extra of your chosen ingredients (like a fresh strawberry for your strawberry shake).
Serve with a spoon and a straw., Add 3 scoops vanilla ice cream, 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, and 1 oz (30 ml) malt powder to the blender.Look for malt powder, not instant malted milk or liquid malt flavoring. Malt powder provides the most authentic taste., Add 3 scoops vanilla ice cream, 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and about 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of chocolate syrup to the blender.Look for a chocolate sauce with a high cocoa unit for the best flavor., Use 1 cup hulled strawberries or 2 oz strawberry syrup, plus 3 scoops vanilla ice cream, 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract., Add 3 cookies of your choice (crumble them up a little in your hand first) to a blender with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream, 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract., Make a basic shake with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream, 2 oz (1/4 cup or 60 ml) of milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.

Repeat the smashing procedure with the remaining cloves of garlic.",How to Make Garlic Juice1," The number of cloves your head has will vary depending on the size and variety of garlic, but a medium-sized head will usually produce around 10 cloves.;
, The flat side, which was closest to the ""heart"" or center of the head, should face down, and the curved side should face up.

, Keep the clove of garlic in between the center of the blade and the handle, with the handle slightly closer than the center of the blade. The sharp cutting edge should face outward.

, Don't be afraid of striking the clove too hard. You should strike with enough force to smash the clove, removing the skin in the process. Be careful to avoid cutting yourself on the knife, however.

, Strike the garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife until each one is peeled.

, Use a bowl with a large enough opening to catch the garlic that falls out of the press.

, Bring the handles together as firmly and tightly as possible. You should be left with garlic ""mush"" inside the bowl.

, If you sense yourself getting tired, you may want to consider taking a break. Otherwise, you could end up with garlic mush that is not as well-pressed as it should be.

Position a coffee filter over a glass bowl.,
Slowly pour the garlic juice through the coffee filter.,
Store the juice in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.",How to Make Garlic Juice4," Use a strainer with small to medium-sized gaps. Fine gaps will allow you to separate as much of the solid from the liquid as possible, but they may make the process go slower. Medium gaps offer a nice balance between speed and quality.

, The bowl should have a wide enough opening to catch any liquid that falls from the strainer. If possible, select a bowl that the strainer can rest on in order to free up both hands.

, You should see juice running through the strainer and into the bowl. Keep pressing until you are unable to produce any more juice.

, Garlic pulp can be used to flavor stews, soups, stir-frys, and a number of other recipes.

, The filter should be secured with a rubber band so that it rests loosely over the bowl, but will not fall inside. Running the juice through a coffee filter will create an even purer product. You can also use your coffee maker, but be aware of the fact that garlic has a potent odor that may linger even after you clean your machine. As a result, any coffee you prepare in the machine afterward may have a hint of garlic flavor.

, If you pour too quickly, you may spill some. Continue pouring until all of the juice is strained into the bowl.

, Keep it in a glass bowl to prevent the odor from contaminating other foods, as well as to prevent any other flavors from contaminating the garlic juice.

, You will know you are done mixing when the butter/sugar mixture is a well-mixed, viscous substance with no clear distinctions. If you are using an electric mixer, use the lowest setting to mix the ingredients.

, Crack the egg and empty its content into the bowl from the previous step, discarding the eggshell. Add the molasses into this bowl. Beat the contents of this bowl until smooth like previously, again with the mixer on the lowest setting.

, Add the contents of the bowl mentioned in the previous two steps to the dry ingredients in the medium-sized bowl from Step 3. With the mixer again set on low, mix the ingredients together until they are thoroughly mixed and a dough forms.

, Set out some plastic wrap about 10 inches (25 cm) in length. Lightly cover the top of the plastic wrap with flour. Then place the dough on the floured plastic wrap. Pat the dough into an approximately 8-inch square. Wrap the dough with more plastic wrap and place the dough in the refrigerator to chill for about 1 to 2 hours.

, With the dough sufficiently firm, preheat oven to 350°. Separate the dough into two halves. Set out waxed paper long enough to hold one half of the dough. Lightly cover the top of the waxed paper with flour. Lightly cover the rolling area of the rolling pin with flour. Place one half of the dough onto the floured waxed paper. With the rolling pin, roll out the dough until it is an eighth of an inch thick, turning, lifting, and flouring dough as necessary. You may also need to apply more flour to the rolling pin to prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. When that is complete, repeat this step for the other half of the dough.

, This step is optional as you will crush the gingerbread cookies into the milkshake later. Place the dough on waxed paper into the freezer to firm for about 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes is up, remove the dough from the paper. You can then use cookie cutters to cut out shapes of your desire from the dough.

, Transfer the dough to a baking sheet, separating the dough into small portions that will become the cookies, and place the baking sheet on the baking tray. Bake until firm and edges just begin to darken for 10 to 18 minutes. The baking time will depend on the size of cookies and how efficiently your oven heats. Once done, remove the baking tray from the oven and take baking sheet off of the tray. Set the baking sheet with the cookies on it somewhere to cool. Repeat this step until you have baked all of your cookies. Alternatively, you could save your unused cookie dough by wrapping it up and placing it in the refrigerator.

, Once the cookies are cool, you can begin work on the milkshake. Combine the ice cream and milk in your blender. Blend until smooth. Add more milk to achieve your desired thickness.

,, You might want to add more ingredients depending on your tastes. If you would like more crunch, then add more crushed cookies to the milkshake. If you want more flavor without additional cookie crunch, add some more ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. If the flavor is too strong, add milk or water.

, Once you are satisfied with the taste and consistency of the milkshake, you are ready to serve your milkshakes by pouring the beverage into glasses. Depending on just how long you have been blending, you may desire to place the milkshakes in the refrigerator or freezer to chill to your taste.

, You're ready to enjoy your gingerbread cookie milkshake with a friend or simply have a second milkshake waiting for you for later with a nice side of gingerbread cookies. Bon appétite!

You now have a simple syrup that will easily mix with the fruit punch to add just the right amount of sweetness. Allow it to cool completely.


If you like your fruit punch extra sweet, make 2 cups simple syrup.
You can skip the simple syrup entirely if you'd prefer not to add extra sugar.

, Pour the simple syrup into the bowl and use a long-handled spoon to stir the mixture until everything is thoroughly incorporated.

, Pour the sodas into the bowl and give the mixture another quick stir. Don't over stir, since you want the punch to stay carbonated.


If you're not serving the fruit punch immediately, store the fruit juice mixture in the refrigerator, and wait until the last minute to add the sodas. That way the punch will be carbonated when you serve it.

, Punch is usually served in a large glass bowl with a ladle you can use to portion it among small cups. If you'd like, keep the punch cold by pouring it over a few trays' worth of ice cubes. Here are a few other serving suggestions:


Make fruit punch ice to keep the punch from getting diluted as the ice melts. Just make an extra batch of punch and freeze it using regular ice cube trays, then add the punch ice cubes to the punch when you're ready to serve it.
If the punch is for a themed party, get creative with your ice! Try making an ice ring (freeze punch or water in a bundt cake pan), an ice hand for halloween (freeze punch or water in a latex glove tied at the end), or a giant ice cube (freeze punch or water in a large, square cake pan).
Serving punch with sherbet is a classic touch at kids' parties. Add several scoops of orange or raspberry sherbet directly to the punch bowl, or serve each cup of punch with a tiny scoop.
If the punch is being served at an adult party, add 2 cups of white rum or vodka to make it alcoholic.

It's a step up from simply serving plain bottled tropical punch at a party. By adding fresh ingredients, you can transform bottled punch into something fit for any occasion.Be sure to mix the ingredients until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can skip the sugar if you don't want your punch to be too sweet.
Add 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice to give your punch a fresh boost.

, Right before serving, pour in the ginger ale to add flavor and carbonation to your punch. Make sure you add it just before serving, or the punch might go flat before the party starts.


You can substitute the ginger ale for lemon-lime soda.
Or try adding plain club soda if you think your punch is already sweet enough.

, Pour it from the bowl into a glass serving bowl or tureen. Serve the punch in small cups with ice. Here are a few optional serving suggestions:

, Pour the syrup into a large bowl and mix it with fresh lime and lemon juice.

, Jamaican punch typically contains strawberry syrup, lending this cocktail a bright fruity flavor and classic red hue. In place of strawberry syrup, you can use cherry syrup or another flavor that's red in appearance.

, Mix in the Jamaican white rum (or spiced rum, if you'd prefer). Add more or less rum according to your preference.

, Start by adding five cups of water, then give the mixture a taste. You can drink it as is or add the last cup of water to dilute it a bit.

Chill and serve!",How to Make Fresh Cranberry Juice," For a quart of juice, you will need one pound of cranberries. These berries can be quite expensive, so consider adding other fruit to make more juice. Try incorporating strawberries, watermelon, bananas and/or grapes – but keep the cranberries dominant. Consider adding apple chunks to make a ""cran-apple"" juice.;
, It's important to do this before you boil them; you never know what bacteria are infesting the fruit.

, Make sure that the pot is large enough to hold not only the boiling water, but the mass of fruit that you're going to add to the water.


If you're in a hurry, just put the cranberries into the pot with the water, then boil them together.

, Put all of your cranberries—again, about one pound for a quart of juice—into the pot of boiling water. At this time, also add any other fruit that you want to include. Be careful not to spill.

, Lower the heat and continue to cook for about ten minutes – until the cranberries begin to pop.

, Turn off the heat, and let the mixture sit for another 10-20 minutes.

, If you want your juice to be extra sweet, add sugar, honey, or another sweetener to taste. Start with 2-3 tablespoons, if you aren't sure. Add cinnamon, nutmeg, or any other spice that you want to try. Consider leaving the cranberry juice sugar-free, this first batch, so that you can better gauge how much sugar it needs.

, If you want a thicker, more smoothie-like cranberry juice, you can blend the berries together with the water. Blend the mixture until it becomes a thick, viscous liquid. Strain it through a cheesecloth to remove skins and other particulates.

, If you don't have a blender, or if want a thinner juice, you can strain the juice directly out of the whole berries. Secure a cheesecloth over a pot or large jar, then carefully pour the cranberries and juice over the cloth so that only the juice passes through. Consider eating the cranberries or making them into a puree!

, You can drink cranberry juice warm, but it may test more appealing if it's cool. Put the juice in the refrigerator for an hour or so, then pour it into glasses to serve.

If you are especially concerned about pesticides on the surface of your carrots, you should peel them. This does not significantly reduce the nutritional value of your juice.You can also buy organically grown carrots, which cost more, but are pesticide-free.;
, Even if you have a high-quality blender or food processor, you don’t want to risk damaging your equipment by throwing four whole carrots in there. Cut your carrots into manageable chunks before breaking them down into a juice. Any food processor or blender should work fine with 1 to 2 inch chunks of carrot., Place your cleaned, cut carrots in a blender or food processor. Process until finely chopped or mashed.









Add a small amount of water if the carrots are not very moist, and need a little help breaking down.
Note that a food processor will not puree the carrot as well as a blender will. It’s not that big of a problem, but use a blender if you have one available., You want to thin out the taste of pure carrot a little by mixing the puree with water. This will both make it taste better, and also give you more juice. .









Bring two cups of water to a boil.
Mix the carrot puree and hot water in a large glass container.
Stir to ensure an even spread of puree throughout the mixture.

, One of water’s most incredible properties is how well it takes on nutrients and flavors when it’s hot. Just like tea, the longer you allow your carrot puree to steep in hot water, the better the juice will taste and serve your body nutritionally. Allow it stand for 15 to 30 minutes.








, Using a hand strainer, strain the juice into a 2 quart (2 L) pitcher.

, Stop when the water is green-tinted, with noticeable chunks of cabbage still floating around. This should only take one or two minutes.

, Do not allow the mixture to blend at high speed for much longer than that. There should still be a few small pieces of cabbage floating around in the juice. You do not want to create a paste or a puree.

, Make sure there is at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) between the surface of the cabbage mixture and the rim of the jar. The liquid will likely expand as it sits, so it needs room.

Often times, apple producers (who will often make their own brand of cider) will blend different apples together to get the right combination. Finding ""your"" blend is just a matter of experimentation, and experimenting will be a delicious endeavor! Here are some basic characteristics of common apple varieties:


Red Delicious: Large, firm red apple with a sweet flavor.

Yellow Delicious: Large, firm yellow apple with a sweet flavor.

Jonathon: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple, with red near the top, descending to green lower down the fruit.

Granny Smith: Medium/small, crisp, tart apple with green color.

Gala: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple with yellow skin blushed with orange to red tinge.;
, Shop the local produce stands, fruit markets or grocery store shelves. If you lean toward a sweet juice, use a ratio of three sweet to one tart, or for medium sweetness, use a ""two sweet to one tart"" ratio. If you intend to make hard cider, use all sweet apples.









It takes about one third of a bushel to make one gallon of cider., Cutting out any bruises or damaged parts, and remove stems. As a rule, it is not recommended to use any fruit for cider that you would not eat as it is.








, Leave the skins on them for the color, flavor, and nutrients that processing will release.








, Use a food processor or blender, and process till your apples have the consistency of applesauce.








, Squeeze the pureed apple through a cheesecloth, extracting all of the juice possible.









If you have a fine-mesh sieve or chinois, you can use the back of a spoon to press even more juice out.

, After enjoying a tall glass of fresh apple cider, store the rest in a sealed container below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (5°C) for up to two weeks, or freeze for extended storage.

;
, If you're using sugar or honey, add it now, too. Give it a quick whirl to get the juices flowing and the flavors combined.









For the first recipe (the creamier, richer version), hold off on the milk for right now and just add the sugar. That part comes next.
For the second recipe (for the health foodie in you), add all the vegetables and fruits you'd like. Add a couple, give it a taste, maybe add a couple more. Experiment!

, You want complete control over the thickness of your drink; should it be more smoothie-like or more like juice? The natural thickness of the avocado opens up the entire spectrum of consistency. Add a small amount, blend it up, and decide whether or not you'd like to add more. Give it a taste test, too!









It probably goes without saying that the thicker and richer your milk, the thicker and richer the final taste will be. Whole milk and avocado will be more smoothie-like while almond milk and avocado will be thinner -- and have a completely different taste.

, Once you've found the right consistency, blend it until everything is combined thoroughly, creating a uniform look throughout. Garnish with whatever your heart desires -- maybe a slice of pineapple or a dollop of whipped cream?

You can technically juice the top greens with the beetroot, but it's more common to prepare the juice with only the beetroot. If you do choose to include the greens, however, rinse them under running water and chop them into lengths measuring 2 inches (5 cm) or smaller. Juice them alongside the prepared beetroot.;
, Rinse the beetroots under cool, running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub off any dirt you cannot scrape away with your fingers.


Beetroot skin contains plenty of nutrients, so if it's relatively thin, you should clean the skin and leave it intact for the juice.
On the other hand, if the skin seems notably tough or dirty, you can peel the beetroot using a vegetable peeler or paring knife before continuing further.

, Cut the beetroots in half, then cut each portion in half again.If the pieces are too large for the appliance, you could burn out the motor. Most juicers, blenders, and foot processors can handle quartered beetroot, but if you have a low-powered appliance or an older model, you may need to cut each quarter in half.

, Place the collection pitcher beneath the pour spout of the juicer.


If you have a model that does not come with its own collection pitcher, place a bowl or large glass beneath the spout before continuing.

, Place one chunk of beetroot into the feed chute. Use the appliance's plunger to gently push the beetroot through the machine.


Work slowly and gently. Beetroots are very hard, so it may take some time for the motor to process it. Do not force the chunk through too quickly or firmly since doing so could burn out the motor.
As soon as one beetroot piece passes through the juicer, start feeding the next chunk through. Continue until the entire prepare beet has been juiced.

, Pour the collected beetroot juice into a serving glass. Drink it immediately or chill it for 30 minutes before enjoying.


You can store beetroot juice in the refrigerator for a day or two, but the flavor is best when enjoyed immediately or shortly thereafter.

, Place the beetroot chunks and water in a high-powered blender or food processor.


Since beetroots are such hard vegetables, most blenders will have difficulty processing them dry. Adding a splash of water should help the appliance move more smoothly at the beginning of the process.

, Puree the beetroots with the water on high speed. Continue until you no longer notice any large pieces of beetroot.Even though the juice should be relatively smooth, it will still seem quite chunky. You'll need to strain the juice from the pulp before it's ready to drink.

, Cut two 24-inch (61-cm) long pieces of cheesecloth. Stack the two on top of one another, then fold them in half to create four layers. Place the layered cheesecloth inside of a large bowl.If you don't have cheesecloth, consider using a jelly bag. Wrap the jelly bag as is over the mouth of a large measuring cup or bowl.
In a pinch, you could simply use a fine-mesh strainer. Balance the strainer over the mouth of a large bowl.

, Pour the contents of the blender into the cheesecloth. Gather the edges of the cloth together over the pulp, twist the opening closed, and squeeze down on the bundle to force the juice through the cloth and into the bowl beneath.


Follow the same procedure if you use a jelly bag.
If you use a fine-mesh strainer, use a rubber spatula to press down on the pulp, squeezing as much juice out as possible.
Note that you should wear a pair of food-grade rubber or plastic gloves while working with the beet pulp. Otherwise, the beetroot juice will stain your hands red.

, Discard the pulp and pour the beetroot juice into a serving glass. Enjoy it immediately or drink it after the juice has chilled in your refrigerator for 30 minutes.


You can technically save beetroot juice in your refrigerator for one or two days, but it tastes best when consumed immediately.

, Rinse, peel, and cut the solid ingredients into chunks.Prepare the beetroot as though you were preparing plain beetroot juice. Scrub off any dirt using a vegetable brush while rinsing the vegetable under cool, running water. Cut the clean beetroot into quarters.
Peel the apple, remove the core, and cut it into quarters.
Use the back of a spoon to peel the skin off the piece of ginger. Since the ginger is so small already, you do not need to chop it down any further.
Chop the greens off each carrot. Peel away the thin outer skin, rinse the carrots under running water, and cut each one into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks.

, Process the solid ingredients through the juicer as though you were preparing basic beetroot juice. Do not add the apple juice.


Feed the apple through first, followed by the carrot and the beetroot. Finish by feeding the ginger through.
Use a spoon to quickly stir the collected juice. Doing so should help blend the flavors together.

, Process the solid ingredients and the apple juice in the blender or food processor as though you were preparing basic beetroot juice.


Blend the apple and apple juice first, continuing until completely liquefied. Afterward, add the carrots, beetroot, and ginger, then blend until smooth.
Strain the juice through four layers of cheesecloth and discard the pulp.

, Pour the beetroot juice into a serving glass. You can drink it immediately or chill it in your refrigerator for 30 minutes before enjoying.

, Clean the beetroot, peel the cucumber, and skin the pineapple. Cut each of these ingredients into relatively small chunks using a sharp knife.Prepare the beetroot as though you were preparing it for basic beetroot juice. Cut off both ends, scrub away the dirt under running water, and chop the beetroot into quarters.
If the cucumber has a waxed skin, you'll need to peel the skin. If the skin isn't waxed, you can simply rinse the cucumber under running water without peeling it. Cut the vegetable into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.
Cut the ends off the pineapple. Stand the fruit on one flat end and slice away the skin with a sharp knife. From there, chop one-quarter to one-half of the pineapple, stopping once you have approximately 1 cup (250 ml) of pineapple chunks.

, If you choose to use an actual juicer, simply feed the solid ingredients through the feed chute, gently depressing them with the juicer's plunger. Do not add the pineapple juice.


Feed the pineapple through first, followed by the cucumber slices. Finish by feeding through the beetroot chunks.
Quickly stir the collected juice with a spoon to help blend the flavors.

, If you decide to use a blender or food processor, blend the pineapple juice and solid ingredients together. Strain the beetroot juice from the chunky pulp.


Blend the pineapple chunks, pineapple juice, and cucumbers together until liquefied. Add the chunks of beetroot juice, then continue blending until mostly smooth.
Strain the juice through four layers of cheesecloth. Discard the leftover pulp.

, Pour the beetroot juice into a serving glass. Drink it immediately or, if desired, chill it in your refrigerator for about 30 minutes prior to consumption.

Make cider.,
Get yeast.,
Make a starter.,
Prepare your cider.,
Prepare the fermentation bucket.,
Pour the cider into the fermentation bucket.,
Let it ferment.,
Bottle your cider.",How to Make Apple Cider2," See above, and prepare enough sweet ciderfor five gallons.








, Visit your local brewing supply store, or look online for cider yeast. Dry wine yeasts are also a good choice, and are more common—and therefore, less expensive.








, A day or two before you plan on brewing your hard cider, make a yeast starter. This will ensure that your yeast is alive and ready to go, and will let you control the final flavor of your brew.









In a sealable jar, add one yeast packet to a half cup of your fresh apple cider. Seal the jar, give it a good shaking for five to ten seconds, then set it aside for five or six hours, or overnight.
When you see it bubbling, release the pressure by partially twisting off the lid, then resealing the jar. Put the start in the refrigerator until a couple hours before you're ready to use it.

, Fill a stock pot or brew pot with fresh cider, and bring it to a very low simmer over medium heat. Continue simmering for about 45 minutes to an hour, to kill off any bacteria or wild yeasts that could alter the flavor of your cider.









Do not boil the cider
Add up to two pounds of brown sugar or honey to boost the sugar content, and make a harder hard cider!

, To ensure that your bucket is clean and ready for hard cider making, sterilize it. Pour a capful of bleach into the bucket, fill with water, and let it sit while you finish simmering your cider. Empty the water, then rinse the bucket thoroughly with cold water.








, Let it cool until it's just warmer than room temperature, then add your starter. Stir with a sterilized spoon, then seal the lid and set the airlock.








, Place the bucket in a cool, dark place—around 60° to 70°F (15° to 20°C). After a couple days, you should see the airlock start to bubble, as the yeast releases carbon dioxide. It should continue to bubble for a couple weeks. When it stops, let the cider rest for another week so that the yeast settles.








, Using a clean, food-grade siphon, gently transfer the cider to sterilized bottles, seal them, and then let them sit for as long as you can stand it—at least a couple weeks. Like wine, hard cider will improve with age.

",How to Make Ambrosia and Nectar from Percy Jackson and the Olympians," This adds the little sour taste needed to make ambrosia. You could use either regular or fat free.;
, You get this at the frozen food isle but you'll need to thaw it out because you're going to have to work it in and mix it. Again, any regular or fat free will do.

, Any solid spoon around one foot will be nice. For slotted spoons, small holes would be perfect. Mix until you are satisfied with the smooth look of the ambrosia

, Some taste differences will occur if you use a light cocktail. Light fruit cocktail is sometimes packed in pear syrup from concentrate while regular is packed in heavy syrup. These often come in 15 ounce cans, so just dump the whole thing in.

, These also come in 15 ounce cans so again dump the whole thing in. You don't have to use the water that the mandarin oranges come in, so it's okay to drain out the water before putting it in.

, You'll need a 16 ounce jar for the solution. Again you'll need to dump the entire container in the ambrosia. The cherries add that extra fruity sensation that will make it more refreshing. Cherries in most stores are expensive, remember to select and store cherries the correct way.

, That is the very distinguishing quantity of ambrosia right there, or if you prefer ""secret ingredient"". Whole coconuts are fine too. If you want to shred them so they become flaked, remember the importance of knowing how to store them and get a good deal on them. Read, Buy and store Coconuts for more information.

, Marshmallows make the sweet side of ambrosia a little sweeter. It makes the taste a little more enjoyable for children too. If you want to try a fun twist instead of buying these read make marshmallows

, A regular soup spoon isn't going to do much if you try to mix the ambrosia with it. Mix until you're satisfied with the way the marshmallows, sour cream and whipped topping lather up on the fruits.

, Mix for about one minute until you're happy with the delicious thick outcome of the ambrosia.

, The nectar will be any kind of fruit that stores sell in nectar juice. Examples of that are apples, mangoes, pears, and peaches.

, 30 seconds to two minutes should be enough.

, The sweetness of ambrosia and nectar counts!

, It's perfect for hanging outside on a hot summer day by the pool or on the porch.

Many recipes will tell you to make your hot chocolate in a small pot or sauce pan on the stove.This allows all the ingredients to get heated evenly and the chocolate to melt.
You'll also need a heat-proof or microwave-safe mug. Some materials, like glass, may not be microwave- or heat-safe. They could break or crack when hot liquid is added or when heated in the microwave. Look at the bottom of your mug to see if there is any notation of whether or not it's heat- or microwave-safe.
Although a plain wooden spoon will do, a whisk is a great tool to help incorporate all the ingredients in your hot chocolate.;
, The main ingredient in hot chocolate is the liquid. If you're looking to make a healthier or lower-calorie version of hot chocolate, heat up 6 – 8 oz of these lower-calorie liquids:


Water. This is plain-jane, but is zero calories. This will help you get a very low-calorie hot chocolate.
Skim milk. This offers you a little more creaminess, protein and calcium. For a 6 – 8 oz serving, you'll total about 80 calories.If you have a milk allergy, are lactose intolerant, vegan or just want to add some creaminess without using dairy, try unsweetened soy, almond, or coconut milk. They have about 30 – 40 calories., Although hot chocolate is mostly milk or water, the tastiest ingredient is the chocolate. Mix or whisk in your desired amount of any of these types of chocolate:


Dutch processed cocoa powder. This is a fairly common form of chocolate to add to hot chocolate recipes. Dutch processed cocoa powder is naturally low in calories, dissolves well in liquids and has a very intense chocolate flavor.Add anywhere from 1 –3 tablespoons per serving depending on your flavor preferences.Chocolate chips or solid chocolate. Use about 2 – 4 tablespoons of chocolate chips or chopped solid chocolate per serving.Choosing a dark chocolate or 70% cocoa solid chocolate bar is best as it's lower in calories and higher in antioxidants.Carob powder or chips. These vegan chocolate chips are all natural, lower in calories, fat, sugar and caffeine compared to regular chocolate, but offer a very similar flavor. They can be substituted one for one for either chocolate chips or cocoa powder.You may want to consider even adding in chocolate protein powder. This is an easy way to add an extra hit of protein to your hot chocolate without changing the flavor.

, If you're making hot chocolate from scratch, you also have the ability to choose what type of sweetener and how much you use to make your chocolate the perfect treat. You'll most likely only need a sweetener if using a cocoa powder which is naturally unsweetened. Try out your desired amounts of any of these sweeteners:


Agave syrup. This is an all natural sweetener that's made from the sap of the agave plant from Mexico. It still has calories like regular sugar, but is significantly less processed.Maple syrup. Although this will impart a distinct flavor to your hot chocolate, maple syrup is another all natural sweetener you can use.
Honey. A tablespoon of honey can naturally sweeten up your cocoa. Just be sure not to serve anything containing honey to children under 12 months.
Sugar substitutes. These are no-calorie sweeteners that vary widely in their level of processing; however, if you're looking to really minimize the calories in your hot chocolate, you may consider adding a sugar substitute or artificial sweetener.

, Most hot chocolate recipes are fairly simple; however, you can spice up your hot chocolate while still making it healthy and low-calorie. Try these flavorful no calorie mix ins:


Vanilla extract
Instant coffee powder
Cinnamon
Cayenne or chili pepper
Orange rind
Chai spices

Look for reduced calorie hot chocolate mixes.,
Read the labels.,
Use low-calorie liquids for mixing.,
Halve the serving size.",How to Make Healthy Hot Chocolate2," Although the idea of making homemade hot chocolate sounds great, it's a bit easier to buy something from the store. Make sure to read the packaging to ensure you're picking a healthier choice.


Many hot chocolate companies do sell either low-calorie, ""diet"" or no-sugar added mixes. Look for this wording on the packaging.
This labeling generally means these mixes are lower in calories and lower in sugar.
Note that they may also contain artificial sweeteners. If you do not want to consume these, make sure you double check the ingredient list to see what type of sweetener is used., In addition to looking at the front of the package or box, you should also flip the box over to take a look at the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list.


First look at the serving size. Many hot chocolates come in a powdered form contained in a packet. Most of the time it's one packet per serving, but always double check.
Review the calories, fat and sugar in your hot chocolate. Make sure it fits into your current diet or eating plan.
Also review the ingredient list. This will show you the type of chocolate used and the types of sweeteners used as well., If you're using a powdered hot chocolate mix from the grocery store, you'll need to mix it with liquid to make your hot chocolate. Stick to lower calorie, natural liquids for the healthiest hot chocolate. Try:


Water
Skim or 1% milk
Almond milk
Soy milk

, You may notice that some of the grocery store brands of hot chocolate aren't as flavorful or as tasty as others. If you truly enjoy the regular or higher calorie versions, incorporate some tricks to lower your overall calories.


Split the package in half. There's generally a large amount of hot chocolate powder per serving. If it's the regular type, not diet, try splitting the serving size in half.
Many of the regular hot chocolates will also tell you to mix the powder with whole milk or cream for the best flavor and texture. However, stick with water or skim milk to lessen the overall calories.
You can also indulge in the regular, higher calorie hot chocolate every once in awhile. Stick to your low-calorie homemade version or the ""diet"" hot chocolate the majority of the time.

Use social media.,
Sign up for email offers from your favorite restaurants.,
Clip coupons from newspapers.",How to Save Money on Meals Out1," These days, many restaurants use social media platforms to advertise discounts and special offers to entice more customers to frequent their establishments. It could be a set menu or an offer for certain days of the week, but you might end up paying a whole lot less for your meal, or you might get an extra course or drinks thrown in.Try social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Scoutmob, etc.
Many people use Yelp to read reviews of businesses, but you can also find deals on there as well. The restaurant may offer a deal if you ""check in"" on Yelp or similar app.
When checking out the social media platforms, make sure you sign up for updates from your favorite restaurants (or any categories of restaurants you’re interested in). Once you sign up for several of these platform notifications, you should have a steady stream of deals coming in on a regular basis.
You may also find online deals on a restaurant’s individual webpage.
You can also try online discount sites like Groupon or Livingsocial.;
, Many restaurants will send out email newsletters that include offers for their valued customers who sign up. These emails often include coupons and other discounted offers that can be redeemed in the restaurant.Go to the restaurant’s webpage to see if there is an option to sign up for an emailed newsletter.

, Look through your local newspaper for coupons for your favorite restaurants. This works for fast food and even for fancier restaurants who advertise in the local paper.You can find offers like “buy one get one free” or a percentage off of your meal. All of these offers will help you save a few bucks when dining out.
Usually local newspapers are the best for finding usable coupons for eating out, rather than national newspapers.
You might consider buying several of the newspapers to stock up on coupons since newspapers are relatively inexpensive. The extra cost for the papers could be countered by the amount you’ll save with the coupons.
You could also ask your friends and neighbors to give you their newspapers after they finish reading them. Then you could get the coupons for free.

Order from the lunch menu.,
Bring your own alcohol.,
Get it to go.,
Look for last minute opportunities.,
Eat before you go out.",How to Save Money on Meals Out2," Many restaurants offer fantastic lunch deals. If you’re not fussy about the time of day that you eat your main meal, try switching the dinner menu for the lunch menu. Lunch can often be a slower time for restaurants so they’re happy to drop their prices to fill the tables.Lunch menus are also often a bit smaller portion sizes, so that partly explains the lower prices.
Even some of the best restaurants in town have lunch menus with incredible price tags, meaning you can check out top eateries for fewer bucks.

, When you eat out, you often end up spending more on wine than you do on the food so why not slash your bill by bringing your own bottle of wine? Lots of restaurants let you bring your own these days, so take them up on their offer. You usually have to pay a few dollars’ corkage fee but this will be a fraction of the price of a bottle of wine in a restaurant.Bring your own also means you get to choose a wine that you know you’ll like, rather than picking from a menu of wines that you have never tried.
Make sure you approve this with the restaurant ahead of time because not all restaurants allow you to bring your own. It could be embarrassing if you bring your own wine to a place that doesn’t have a BYOB policy in place.

, Some restaurants offer cheaper takeaway options at a discounted price since they aren’t serving you. When you opt to forego eating in the restaurant, this leaves the tables open for other paying customers, so the restaurant can make more money.This also means that you can save even more money by buying drinks at home instead of at the restaurant.
You can try calling around to see what restaurants offer these kinds of discounts.
This also means you save on a tip, since you won't have a server (you may still want to leave a small tip to be passed on to those in the kitchen, however).

, If you fancy a last minute meal then you might be in luck in restaurants that have lots of empty tables. Some restaurants offer daily deals to entice people in from the street and you might be lucky to spot something great as you’re walking past. It could be a two-course set meal or a limited choice from the a la carte menu, but if you like what you see then you can duck inside and save a fortune.


Some of these daily deals include a glass of wine or even a half bottle of wine with each meal ordered so you really can grab a bargain.
This can be a great way of discovering a new restaurant or trying out a place that is usually too pricey for your modest budget.

, Another way to save money when dining at a restaurant is by eating something at home before you head to the restaurant. That way you won’t be starving at the restaurant, so you won’t have to break the bank to satiate your hunger.


This gives you the best of both worlds — a cheap meal at home (saving money) and a small fancy meal at a restaurant so you can still enjoy the experience of dining out.

Avoid red meat.,
Share an entrée.,
Skip the drinks.",How to Save Money on Meals Out3," Red meat is notorious for being pricier than other types of meat like chicken or turkey. Try to avoid red meat or, instead, order cheaper cuts of meat when possible — like beef brisket or chicken thighs.Vegetarian options are also usually cheaper when dining out.

, Most restaurants serve portions that are way more than what one person needs for a single meal. And while it can be nice to have leftovers to take home, it’s also nice to have a cheaper bill in the restaurant.Split an entrée with the person you’re dining with so that you both save a little money.
Sometimes restaurants issue a charge for splitting an entrée, but it will still probably end up costing less than ordering a whole second meal.
You can also split appetizers, sides, and dessert with your dining companions.

, Drinks are always expensive at restaurants, especially if you’re considering an alcoholic beverage. One way to cut down seriously on your bill is by refraining from the fancy drinks, alcoholic or otherwise.Order water instead. Most restaurants (even fast food chains) will let you have water for free with your meal.

Research on motels/hotels that offer continental/complimentary breakfasts.,
Research on places that offer kitchenettes.,
Venture around farmer markets.,
Check out online reviews for cheap restaurants.,
Try to make lunch as your main meal of the day.,
Look at dinner appetizer menus.,
Prepare a vehicle cooler for any road trips.,
Be prepared to shop at discount retail stores.,
Visit daily deals sites for your destination.",How to Save Money on Food when Traveling," These are usually presented between 5 am and 9 am. Be very wary and careful on which term they advertise with. Hotels in the UK define ""continental"" as a simple hot coffee, toast, and juice. ""Complimentary"" breakfasts in the United States usually consist of hot items, for example eggs or waffles, along with cereal, juices, fruits, and coffee. Always call places in advance and ask what is typically served. If you're not even up to par with eating breakfast, take a trip anyway and grab some food to take back to your room.;
, Kitchenettes offer a huge relief in hotel rooms during a fairly long stay in the city. Call the hotel to see if they provide them, a refrigerator, microwave, or utensils. Be prepared to be innovated on how you prepare food or store leftovers if there's no availability. Cooking in a hotel room saves you a lot of money instead of finding yourself in restaurants for every meal. A simple coffee machine provided by the hotel can serve as a great way for hot water used in instant oatmeal, noodles, and other quick meals.

, Farmer markets tend to have a variety of fruits and vegetables (depending on the season for each produce), breads/pastries, canned jams, meats, and fish.

, Social networking and online local directory services are becoming more popular than ever. Take it to your advantage and seek out where the ""cheap eat"" spots by locals are. Be very open to this option when traveling to a new city; you might find a local sandwich shop to be cheaper than a national chain restaurant.

, Having a light and healthy breakfast can get your through the morning, but at least think about swaying into a late lunch/early dinner habit while you're out and about. Many restaurants offer similar things between their lunch and dinner menus, but you'll find lunch costs to be a lot cheaper. Even if you order something big and can't finish everything, you're guaranteed to have leftovers if you get hungry later on.

, On a typical basis, meals that do not have an ""all you can eat"" special attached to it, can be shared between people. Ask for extra plates and experience different kinds of food instead of choosing your own meal for a higher price. Call in advance to see if the specific restaurant offers any ""Kids Eat Free"" specials as well.

, Healthy cooler ideas include trail mix, breakfast bars, juice pouches, and graham crackers. Avoid plugging in any caffeinated beverages or junk food. Try to keep the cooler on the floor of back seat or passenger seat, as enclosed spaces like the trunk can heat food and drinks faster.

, If you need extra necessity items, such as plastic forks/paper plates, or a replenishment on snacks, it's best to get them in bulk for a cheap price.

, Check sites like Groupon, Living Social, Amazon Local, and others that offer discounts on food, services, and more. Not only will these sites help you save money, but paying for the deals in advance will help you stay within your vacation budget.

Many restaurants mark up a bottle of wine by 300 to 400 percent, however, making the fee you would pay to bring your own wine considerably cheaper than what you might pay for a glass of theirs.

, Many restaurants make a large portion of the profits through alcohol sales, and one cocktail could cost you almost as much as one entrée. Skipping the alcohol will trim a large portion from your bill.

, Soda and other non-alcoholic drinks may seem fairly cheap on their own, but the price can add up quickly. Most restaurants do not charge for tap water, however.

, Restaurant desserts are often pricey, but you can stop by an ice cream stand on your way back for a sweet treat at a significantly cheaper price. Eating dessert at home, whether store-bought or homemade, will save you the most.

, Even restaurants that do not allow you to split meals will usually allow you to share a dessert. This way, you can try a luxurious option off the dessert menu for a fraction of the price.

, Eating a small snack before dinner may ""ruin your appetite,"" but it will also save you money in the long run. The less hungry you are, the less likely you are to experience ""eyes bigger than your stomach"" syndrome. Instead of ordering too much food, you can order just the right amount.

, Ordering for pick-up saves you the price of a drink, and you can get away with leaving a smaller tip (usually 5 to 10%, as opposed to 20%).

, Prices are usually their highest at dinner. Many restaurants offer lower prices during breakfast and lunch, and a few others offer lower prices just before closing. Dine out during a time of day when you know a restaurant's prices are at their lowest.

You can do this easily by heating the water in a pot on your stovetop or in an electric kettle. Water that is slightly below boiling will better preserve the nutritional value of the coconut., As your water is heating, take two pieces of cheesecloth and layer them inside your strainer.

, When the cocoa is hot, mix in ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) of vanilla extract and remove the pan from the burner. Pour the mixture into a mug, and top with whipped cream, marshmallows, or both.While this recipe makes just a single mug of hot cocoa, you can easily multiply to make as much as you want.

Research the prices of fast food franchises near you before you decide what to eat.


In the United States, Burger King is often seen as the most value-friendly fast food restaurant., Beyond the major differences between chains, individual locations of a given fast food chain will often feature their own local specials as a way to attract diners. Whether it's a money off on a meal or a 2-for-1 deal, you should look around your neighbourhood to see if there are any locations with these special offers.

Use coupons.,
Take advantage of the dollar/pound menu.,
Purchase multiple value items in lieu of a full-price entree.Even though the value items usually consist of lower-grade materials than the full-priced entrees, you can get more food with less money if you rely on the value menu.,
Buy a small drink.,
Capitalize on free extras.,
Give your meal add-ons at home.",How to Eat Cheaply at a Fast Food Restaurant2," Coupons are arguably the easiest way to save money at a fast food restaurant. They're often dropped off as spam mail at a home address. Even though they're freely distributed, coupons can be quite valuable, even shaving several bucks off a single meal purchase.


Because many coupons offer a 2-for-1 deal. With this in mind, it helps to go with another person and split the cost between the two of you.

, Most fast food joints feature a ""dollar menu"" or list of value items. These items are typically simpler than the full-priced entrees, but give you a chance to eat the restaurant's food without paying the full price.

, For instance, by buying two or three dollar burgers, you'll have more food than a full-fledged double cheeseburger.

, The vast majority of fast food locations have transferred over to self-serve drink stations. This means you can help yourself to as many refills as you'd like. Buying the smallest cup the restaurant offers means you can get your unlimited soda for the lowest cost.


If you're especially thrifty, you can save a cup and bring it with you on multiple occasions, although this will be considered stealing by the restaurant management.

, Places like Subway offer lots of free extras for an entree item.If you have value in mind, capitalize on whatever free extras a restaurant offers. Whether it's toppings, condiments or a ""free"" side (like peanuts at Five Guy's), loading up on these while spending a minimum on ordered items can fill you up for less.


While freebies are great, exploiting it past the point of reason could get you in trouble with the restaurant management.

, Most meal add-ons (like extra cheese slices) are vastly over-priced. If you have a habit of bringing fast food home as take-out, you can considerably cut down on added fees by adding your desired sauces and toppings at home. If you want extra cheese and have slices at home, add them yourself. You'll be saving yourself a lot of money over a long run in exchange for a slight amount of effort.

Ask for a real egg in a breakfast item.Fast food joints like McDonalds use up to three kinds of egg during their breakfast hours.,
Get a value menu equivalent of a full-priced entree.Because many of the value menu items are essentially streamlined versions of the full-priced entrees, you can essentially get discounted versions of the same thing with the right choice of words.,
Stack value items together for a mega meal.Putting two or more value burgers together, you can create an entree item that's easily comparable (or greater) than a full-priced entree.,
Customize your order.Many fast food restaurants prepare common menu items in advance in order to speed up the process.,
Order your fries without salt.,
Combine breakfast and lunch items during the breakfast menu shift.Although it's arguably the toughest menu hack to accomplish, placing an order within five minutes of the restaurant's breakfast menu switching to the regular lunch fare means you'll be able to take advantage of both menus.",How to Eat Cheaply at a Fast Food Restaurant3," If you ask for a real egg (the egg used in their McMuffin sandwiches) you can instantly improve a regular breakfast item that would normally come with something inferior without having to pay the extra money.

, Say you would like the value item prepared in the manner of the entree it's supposed to mirror. Although you may have to pay extra for the added toppings, it will still come up as less than what you would have paid for the real deal.

,


The most well-known value item stack is the ""McGangbang"", a McDonalds item where you place a dollar menu Junior Chicken inside a McDouble.

, By customizing your order, you can help ensure that your meal is as fresh as possible.

, Fast food joints salt their fries by default. If you specifically ask to have them without salt, they'll have to make a fresh batch specifically for you. Because fry batches are typically left in a warmer, getting fresh fries is an easy way of improving your dining experience without paying anything more. You can always add salt to the fries manually if you want them.


Keep in mind that this won't get you in the good graces of the restaurant staff, especially if you come in and do this on a regular basis. It means more work for the staff, so only do this if you're really intent on fresh fries.

, ""Hacking"" the menu like this means you can create a ton of combinations on your own, like egg on a cheeseburger.

Read the label.,
Look for drinks with at least 5 billion CFU (colony forming units).,
Purchase a supplement that needs to be refrigerated.,
Try to find a beverage that contains Bifidobacterium or Lactobacilli strains.,
Drink kefir.,
Try kombucha.,
Choose fruit juice-based drinks.,
Drink pre-made yogurt smoothies.,
Consider purchasing supplemental probiotic drinks.,
Include a serving of yogurt daily.,
Try fermented vegetables.,
Eat vegetarian sources of protein.,
Add foods that contain prebiotics.",How to Choose Drinks That Are Good for Gut Bacteria," Whenever you're looking to buy a supplement or food with a specific ingredient, it's important to review the label. You should look at the nutrition fact panel, ingredient list and any other labels available on products.


Pay attention to the expiration date. Since probiotics are live organisms, it's essential to make sure you look at the expiration date to make sure the product is not expired. Also, choose a beverage that has a expiration date that isn't coming up soon. You'll want to make sure you drink it in time.Also look for beverages that say ""contains live or active cultures."" This means the manufacturer has added probiotics to this beverage.
Since you're purchasing a drink, also review the nutrition label. Make sure to purchase something that will fit into your diet guidelines. You may want to look for a lower calorie drink, something without added sugar or something without fat. You'll find this information on the nutrition fact panel.;
, All probiotic supplements (including supplemental beverages) will have the number of individual bacteria contained in the product listed on the label. Aim to find a beverage that has at least 5 billion CFUs.


You will see probiotic drinks containing a wide range of CFUs. The higher the amount, the stronger and the more effective the beverage will be at promoting the good bacteria in your gut.
Studies have shown that certain levels of bacteria provide the best results. Typically, any supplemental beverage that contains at least 5 billion CFUs is encouraged by health professionals.Only supplements and supplemental beverages will list the CFUs; however, not all beverages that contain probiotics will list the CFUs (like kefir or kombucha). Only beverages marketed as a dietary supplement will list the CFUs.
Even though some beverages may not list the CFU count, that doesn't mean they are not effective or will not provide your gut with any benefits. It's just an added benefit if you find a beverage that does provide this information.

, You may notice that some drinks are shelf stable, while others are only found in the refrigerated section. Most health professionals advise to purchase supplements and drinks that need to be refrigerated.


Since probiotics are bacteria that are alive, they need to be kept alive to be active. Drinks that are refrigerated contain live cultures that have been shown to be the most effective at improving gut health.Beverages that are shelf stable will contain probiotics that have been more processed in order to be viable at room temperature.
Make sure that after you buy them that you also keep the beverage refrigerated unless you drink it immediately.

, There are a large variety of different probiotic strains that are found in beverages and supplements. Make sure you're purchasing a beverage that has the best and most beneficial strains of probiotics.


Studies have shown that out of all the different strains of probiotics, two of the most effective are bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli.When you're reading the labels on your probiotic beverages, flip the bottle over and look at or near the ingredient list. This is where you will find the probiotic strains listed (if available).
Not all beverages that contain probiotics will have the type of strain listed. This doesn't mean you shouldn't consume these beverages or that they are not beneficial. It's only an added benefit if you can find the name of the exact probiotic strain.

, Kefir is a traditional drink common to Eastern Europe. It's a fermented dairy beverage that has the consistency of very thin yogurt. It's tart, but very tasty and contains a significant amount of probiotics that are very beneficial to your gut.Studies have shown that in addition to improving the health of your GI system, kefir has also been shown to have antimicrobial, antitumor and anticarcinogenic activity.Since the health benefits of kefir have become more well known, it's easier to find this fermented dairy product in your grocery store. It's typically found in the refrigerated section near yogurt or pre-made smoothies.
Many companies that produce kefir do list the types of live and active cultures they add or use to make their kefir. Look for drinks that advertise the use of bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli strains.
You can drink kefir as is or mix it into a homemade fruit smoothie. Plain kefir is quite tart, however you can find fruit flavored versions that are a little sweeter.

, Kombucha is another fermented beverage that has become more popular. It's a fermented tea that has a little bit of bubbly carbonation to it. There have been many health claims made about kombucha including the promotion of good bacteria in the gut.Kombucha is made by fermenting yeast and bacteria with tea. After fermentation, what results is a slightly sweet, slightly sour drink that has some natural carbonation.
A few studies have shown that kombucha has antibiotic and antioxidant effects which will help support the immune and GI system.You may find kombucha in your local grocery store in the refrigerated beverage area. It needs to stay refrigerated until you consume it. Also make sure to follow the recommended expiration date.

, Some supplement companies also make probiotic beverages that are sold as a dietary supplement. These drinks are generally fruit juice-based with probiotics added to them.


Many people may skip over the typical dairy-based probiotic beverages or foods because of lactose intolerance or a dislike of these foods. Companies are filling the gap by adding probiotics to fruit juices which have been shown to offer the same benefit.Studies have shown that the bacteria added to fruit juices can have a similar effect on the GI system as dairy-based probiotics.
Since these beverages are being marketed as dietary supplements, you will find a lot more specific information on the types and amounts of probiotics they contain. This is an item where you'd want the CFUs to be over 5 billion and the strains included to be either bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli.
You will find these fruit juice probiotic supplements in a refrigerated supplement aisle or in the refrigerated beverage section of your grocery store. These should be consumed immediately or kept in the refrigerated until their expiration date.

, Similar to the probiotic fruit juices, you will also find probiotic smoothies available. These are pre-made beverages that are dairy- and fruit-based and also contain beneficial probiotics.


These probiotic smoothies are generally made from either yogurt or kefir that contain live active cultures or cultures were added during the processing of the smoothie.Many people may enjoy these smoothies as they are a little less tart and more sweet and palatable compared to kefir or kombucha.
Note that some of these yogurt smoothies may have a significant amount of added sugar. Make sure to read the food label to see how much sugar is contained in one serving., Outside of a typical probiotic beverage, some supplement companies sell little ""shots"" or small servings of liquid probiotics. These may be another option if you're looking to improve the healthy bacteria found in your gut.


In the supplement aisle, you may see a small refrigerated section with small-serving drinks listed as a probiotic supplement. They generally have a very high concentration of those good bacteria in a small amount of liquid.These are similar to taking a probiotic pill or tablet except that it's in a drinkable form. The idea is that you can get in an appropriate dose of probiotics in one simple ""shot"" and not have to drink a large amount of other beverages like kefir.
As long as these drinks have at least 5 billion CFUs, the right strains of bacteria and fit into your dietary patterns (for example, being a certain calorie level), these are also appropriate to include.

, One of the most common foods known to be high in probiotics is yogurt. You can find yogurts with live and active cultures at just about any grocery store. Adding this to your diet in addition to probiotic beverages can help support a healthy gut.


Many yogurt companies are now adding probiotics to their yogurts. It's common to see yogurts that are advertising ""live and active cultures"" on their products. Look for this labeling on yogurts before you purchase them.Choose yogurts that have little added sugars to them. You may want to stick to plain yogurt instead of flavored and add your own fruit or flavorings at home.
Including one serving of yogurt daily is a great way to get in a decent amount of probiotics. Aim for 1 cup of yogurt per serving., If you're lactose intolerant or do not enjoy dairy foods, there are plenty of probiotics found in fermented and pickled vegetables. These crunchy and slightly sour foods are a great source of gut-enhancing bacteria.Vegetables that contain probiotics include: kimchi, sauerkraut, pickles, and pickled vegetables (like pickled cauliflower).If you're purchasing these foods from the grocery store, make sure to look for items that have not been pasteurized as this process kills the probiotics. It should say ""naturally fermented"" or ""unpasteurized.""
Include a serving of these tangy vegetables everyday to help increase the amount of probiotics you eat. A typical serving of vegetables is about 1 cup. This may be a lot when it comes to fermented vegetables, so consider splitting up this serving throughout the day., Another interesting place that you can find probiotics are in vegetarian protein sources. Both tofu and tempeh contain probiotics and can be a great alternative to either dairy or fermented vegetables.


Both tofu and tempeh are made from fermented soybeans. The probiotics result from this fermentation process making these protein sources beneficial to your gut.Since tofu and tempeh are considered a protein, it's important to measure out the appropriate serving size. Stick to a 3 – 4 oz portion of either per meal.If you haven't cooked with tofu or tempeh before, it's easy to get started. Both are great when marinated and can take on a lot of flavor. From there, they can be baked, added to stir-fries or crumbled and used in place of ground meat.

, All living organisms need a source of food or fuel — including probiotics. Their food is actually called prebiotics which are apart of different foods and promote the growth of these healthy bacteria.Prebiotics specifically are non-digestible components of foods (like the type of sugar called fructooligosaccharide) that act as food for the probiotics.
These food components are found in a very specific group of foods. They include: leeks, bananas, onions, garlic, artichokes, soybeans, asparagus and whole-wheat foods (like whole wheat bread or whole wheat pasta).
Try to combine these foods or eat a serving of a prebiotic and probiotic daily. For example, you can add sliced bananas to your yogurt or sauté onions, garlic and tempeh together for a stir-fry.

Place the watermelon keg on display.",How to Make a Watermelon Keg," Scrub it well and pat dry. Make sure the surface is clean and free of any dirt, so it will be ready for decoration and carving.;
, Draw a circle around the circumference of one end of the watermelon where you'll remove the top. You may want to use a drawing compass for accuracy, or simply sketch as neat a line as possible.








, Mark parts of the watermelon using a pencil or a Sharpie. You will most likely fill the watermelon with punch three quarters of the way, so if you want to carve any decorative shapes or designs toward the top, map out the design now.








, You'll need the top as a lid that goes back on the melon after you’ve added the punch. Use your sharpest kitchen knife or a box cutter to slice cleanly through the melon. Follow the pre-drawn lines when cutting; this will make it easier.








, Clean it of any residual watermelon, and then set it aside.








, Lay down newspaper or sheeting underneath the watermelon—this is going to get messy! You could also place the watermelon in a deep sink to reduce mess. Just like carving a pumpkin—only wetter—scoop out as much flesh as possible with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.









When scraping out the flesh, take care not to scrape too much of the skin. The idea is to hollow out the watermelon neatly without creating indentations in the outer edge.

, Try to remove the watermelon in chunks so you can use the fruit later either in your punch or as a snack.

, Remove any errant seeds or pieces. You should be left with a smooth, hollow surface.








, Make a hole toward the bottom portion of the watermelon using an apple corer. A hole approximately two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) from the base of the watermelon is appropriate. Then when the watermelon sits on a table, guests can easily place their glass underneath the spigot.









Make the keg hole the same size as the spigot line. You will want to fit the spigot snugly into the hole created by the corer, but not so large that a gap is created.
If the spigot line has a sharp edge and the watermelon skin is not overly tough, try puncturing the skin using the spigot and bypass using the apple corer. You may find that you get a tighter fit this way.

, A punch recipe that infuses watermelon or watermelon flavors would be most desirable, but any punch recipe will work.

, Pour only a few cups of the mixture into the watermelon to determine if the spigot will leak. If it has a leak, fill the gaps with either pieces of rind or even duct tape around the inside the spigot line, inside the watermelon. Hold the duct tape in place with pins if it does not adhere to the watermelon (which it very well may not given the wet and slippery surface).








, Integrate pieces of watermelon flesh into your brew when preparing it. This will further enhance the flavor and taste. If possible, re-use the chunks of watermelon in your punch and float several pieces inside the punch for good visual effect.








, Decorate the watermelon using other pieces of fruit. For example, you could create a fun face using apple pieces, dried fruit and watermelon chunks. Affix fruit pieces to the watermelon using toothpicks.

Try to find packaging labeled ""freeze-dried,"" which tends to produce a truer coffee flavor than ""spray drying.""If the label doesn't specify, check the consistency: granules are more likely to be freeze-dried than powder is, though this is not a guarantee.Finally, more expensive brands tend to taste better.


If you're not sure where to start, try Medaglia d'Oro or Starbucks VIA Colombia. These tend to convert more coffee snobs than most brands.
Instant espresso powder is a different product, meant for baking instead of drinking.;
, Don't use water that's been sitting in your kettle, which can pick up off-flavors or become ""flat"" from repeated boiling. If you live in a hard water area or your tap water just tastes bad, put it through a water filter first.


If you don't have a kettle, microwave a mug of water before adding the coffee.Microwaved water can ""explode"" if overheated. Prevent this by putting a wooden popsicle stick or teaspoon of sugar in the cup., Follow the package instructions the first time you try a brand. If it's too strong or too watery for your tastes, you can adjust the ratio of coffee and water later. Most importantly, use the same spoon and the same mug each time. If you switch to a different size each time, you can't pinpoint a ratio you enjoy.


If there's no recommendation on the package, try 1 slightly rounded teaspoon (5mL) per 8 oz (240mL).

, Add just enough cold water to wet all the coffee, stirring it into a paste.This preparation give your coffee a smoother flavor, although it won't always have a major effect.

, Instant coffee has already been extracted in water before drying, so the flavor is already set. This means the temperature of the water is much less important than for normal coffee. Instant coffee drinkers disagree over whether boiling water can affect the taste. If you're concerned, just let the kettle cool down for a couple minutes first.

, Even if you prefer black coffee, most instant blends could use the flavor help. Stir in as much or as little as you like, making sure all the sugar dissolves. If your instant coffee has a particularly bad taste, cream will hide it better than milk.

, The most effective way to improve your cup is to keep experimenting, and to keep track of what you tried. Try an extra teaspoon (5mL) of coffee next time if the brew was too watery, or add another pinch of sugar if it tastes too bitter. Instant coffee will never be gourmet, but your choices can make it enjoyable.


Use the same spoon and same mug each time so you have a benchmark for the coffee to water ratio.

, Humidity will spoil the flavor of your instant coffee. Keep it out by sealing the container tightly.


If you live in a humid climate, transfer the leftovers to smaller containers as you use them up. This will minimize the amount of air that contacts the coffee. In extra-humid tropics, the refrigerator might be drier than your cupboards., Some say that the coffee itself is a lost cause. If the techniques above don't help, try replacing all the water with hot milk. Heat the milk over the stovetop until it begins to bubble around the edges. Pour it onto the coffee powder instead of water.


Keep an eye on the milk and stir occasionally. Unattended milk can overflow rapidly.

, Your ""instant cappuccino"" won't impress an Italian, but a little froth can go a long way. If you don't have a handheld frother, froth the milk and instant coffee by whisking or shaking it in a jar.


To froth up the mixture with a spoon, add the instant coffee and sugar to a cup, then stir in enough water to make a paste. Beat this with a spoon until foamy, then stir in the hot milk., Strong, usually sweet flavors are another way to hide poor tastes. Here are a few suggestions:


Replace the milk and sugar with flavored creamers, or homemade flavored milk.
Add flavorings such as vanilla extract, cocoa powder, or ground cinnamon, stirred in thoroughly. Careful — it's easy to overdo these if making a single cup.
Replace the sugar with the flavored syrup of your choice. You can even buy liquid coffee essence or extract to add a bigger punch of coffee flavor. Keep in mind that commercial syrups often include high fructose corn syrup.

, Not everyone loves this trend, but you might change your mind when you're slogging through a jar of bad instant. After making your instant coffee, toss it in the blender with 1 tsp (5mL) coconut oil or butter and blend until frothy.

Enjoy the coffee immediately.",How to Make a Good Pot of Coffee," Bad coffee comes down to one of two things: a bad process or a bad bean. For maximum freshness, look for beans that were roasted within the last two weeks, and preferably earlier. Other factors regarding coffee beans come down to personal preference, including:The roast, such as medium or dark
The country of origin for the beans
The type of bean, such as Arabica or robusta;
, The factors that will destroy a coffee bean’s flavor faster are light, heat, air, and moisture. To prevent this deterioration, store your whole beans somewhere cool and out of the sun in an opaque air-tight container.While many people suggest storing beans in the fridge or freezer to help keep them fresh, this can actually expose them to moisture, damaging the flavor., The size of grind you need depends on the type of coffee-making equipment you're using. Check with the manufacturer’s directions regarding the exact grind you should use for your machine. In general, however, you want:Fine grind (like sand) for espresso
Medium–fine grind for pour over coffee
Medium grind (like poppy seeds) for drip coffee
Course grind (like potting soil) for French press coffee

, Tap water is completely acceptable for making coffee, as long as you like the taste of it. If you don’t, try using bottled or filtered water instead.


Avoid using softened or distilled water, which don’t have the same minerals. The minerals in water actually promote proper coffee flavors., The proper coffee grinder is a conical burr grinder. It ensures a consistent grind, which is important for the flavor of the coffee.Regular disc grinders tend to produce coffee grounds that are of varying sizes, and this will negatively impact the coffee. If that’s all that’s available to you, grind your beans in small batches.

, A bad filter can ruin an otherwise perfect pot of coffee, so buying the right filters is an important part of the equipment selection process. You can use either disposable or reusable filters:


The best reusable filter is a gold-plated one. However, with these types of filters, you can’t use extra-fine coffee grounds, because sediment will get through.With disposable paper filters, look for dioxin-free or oxygen-bleached filters., Clean your coffee pot, carafe, dripper, and press mechanism with soap and water after every use. Clean your grinder and storage containers weekly. This will remove oil buildup, which can be bitter or rancid.For drip coffee makers, run your coffee maker monthly with a vinegar and water solution to clean out any leftovers. Run it again with plain water afterward to rinse it out.

, For the freshest coffee, start with whole beans and grind them right before making your coffee. Coffee beans slowly begin to lose their flavor as soon as they're ground. Only grind what you need for the pot of coffee you're making.


Use 1 to 2 tablespoons (7 to 14 g) of coffee grounds per six-ounce (177-ml) cup of coffee. For an eight-ounce (237-ml) cup, use 2¾ tablespoons (19 g) of coffee.To ensure you end up with enough grounds, measure out 1 to 2 heaping tablespoons of coffee beans.
Once you’ve measured out your beans, grind them to the proper size, based on the type of coffee maker you're using.

, The ideal temperature for water to brew coffee is between 195 and 205 F (90.5 and 96 C). Water that’s too cold will result in weak coffee, and water that’s too hot will produce a burnt and bitter taste.For a pot of pour over or press coffee, boil the water in the kettle and let the kettle cool down for about two minutes before pouring the water.
For a drip coffee maker, check the instructions or manufacturer’s directions to see what temperature the coffee maker is set to. Adjust the temperature on your machine if that’s necessary and possible. If you're making drip coffee, boil about ½ cup (120 ml) of water in a kettle so that you can prime the filter and the grounds.
Measure out the water before you boil it, and only heat as much as you need to make your coffee. This will save some energy, and prevent you from having to measure out boiling hot water.

, If you use a drip maker or the pour over method to make coffee, it’s important to prime the filter. Insert a fresh filter in the dripper and position it over a sink or mug. Pour in enough hot water to wet the filter. Let the water drain out, and replace the coffee dripper and filter into its proper position.


The purpose of priming the filter is to remove any paper dust from the filter, and to preheat the dripper so that it won’t cool you’re your coffee prematurely., Add the grounds to your carafe (for a French press) or the primed filter (for a drip machine or pour over setup). When the water is the right temperature, slowly pour in ⅓ cup (80 ml) of water. Let the water sit for 30 seconds to a minute.The purpose of doing this is to let the coffee bloom. The initial shock of hot water saturates the grounds, softens them, and gets them to start releasing their flavors.With a drip machine, you can saturate the grounds manually before turning on the machine. Hold the dripper filled with the primed filter and grounds over the coffee carafe when you pour in the water.

, Once the coffee has bloomed, add the rest of the hot water. With a pour over coffee, add the water in small increments to prevent it from overflowing.If you're making drip coffee, the machine will heat the rest of the water and pour it for you when you turn it on.

, After you pour the correct amount of water over the grounds, let the coffee sit and brew. For a drip coffee maker, the machine will control the percolation time, but it should take about five to six minutes.For pour over coffee, let the coffee brew for three minutes.
For French press coffee, let it brew for four minutes. After four minutes, press down on the plunger to filter the grounds.

, Coffee is best consumed right after brewing. But if you do have any leftover, transfer it to a carafe to keep warm for up to 45 minutes.


To avoid having leftover coffee that loses its flavor as it cools, only brew as much coffee as you need.You can always make a second pot later!

Taste fresh coffee.,
Add milk, cream, and/or sugar.,
Try lighter roasts.,
Add coffee to your regular morning routine.,
Give yourself time.",How to Like Coffee1," Coffee freshness changes the moment the roasting process has completed. Buy coffee from a cafe that brews whole bean coffee, which retains more flavor when grinded.Local coffee shops are more likely to use whole beans than franchises, so frequent smaller, privately-owned cafes.;
, Black coffee has a bitter taste that can be unpleasant for new coffee connoisseurs. Add in a sweetener to your coffee if straight brews disgust you. Experiment with different sweeteners when ordering until you find the perfect balance.


If you want to branch out, try gourmet sweeteners like vanilla sugar, muscovado, raw sugar, or chocolate powder.
Acidic, light roasts taste best with milk or cream, which dulls its bite while letting its delicate flavor come through.

, The degree to which a coffee is roasted changes its flavor. Dark roasts (when the coffee beans are roasted until blackened) is generally more unpalatable for new coffee lovers. Start with the sweetest drinks (like mochas, cappuccinos, and frappuccinos) and move onto darker roasts as your palate changes.


Light roasts retain the most caffeine, whereas darker roasts retain the least. If you're sensitive to caffeine, order a smaller cup.

, Making a morning ritual out of coffee drinking can accustom your tastebuds to the flavor. You'll also feel energized and ready to start your day. Try drinking coffee in the morning for a few weeks and see if you begin to enjoy it as a breakfast beverage.

, Like many acquired tastes, sometimes coffee takes time to warm up to. If you don't like your first drink, don't give up. All coffee blends taste differently: you may not have found the brew for you.


If you've tried many different blends and still don't like coffee, you may just not have a taste for it. This is okay! Other beverages like tea, kombucha, and green smoothies can have similar benefits.

Read your instruction's manual.,
Leave the reservoir lid open.,
Rinse the brew basket in the sink regularly.",How to Clean a Coffee Maker3," If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first.If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet.

, Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment., The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process. Make sure you rinse out the brew basket after each use and make a habit of cleaning it each time you do dishes. This will keep your coffee maker mold and germ free.

Research the benefits of drinking coffee.,
Learn about coffee's history.,
Befriend the regulars at coffee houses.,
Join a coffee club.,
Keep a coffee tasting journal.",How to Like Coffee2," Discovering the health benefits can give you incentive to drink it. Coffee is loaded with antioxidants that can boost your metabolic rate and keep your liver healthy.. Coffee may also have preventative properties, as regular drinkers are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart rhythm problems, and certain kinds of cancers.Approach coffee with a balanced view. While coffee has antioxidants and other health benefits, too much coffee can stunt growth and cause fatigue. Like all things, this drink is best enjoyed in moderation.

, Research the history of coffee to gain more appreciation for the beverage. For over six hundred years, coffee has changed the world politically, socially, and intellectually. Coffee history is not just a part of foodie culture but human culture in general.The more you know, the more you'll understand and respect coffee lovers.

, Spend time in locally owned cafes known by gourmet coffee drinkers as high quality. Coffee connoisseurs often hang around local coffee shops to discuss different coffee blends and chat about other intellectual topics. Chat with the employees and regulars, get to know their personal tastes, and ask for their recommendations. You can enjoy talking with them about coffee and listening to their advice.


Try local coffee blends. Find coffee shops that roast their beans daily using beans harvested nearby. These will yield the freshest brews, and the coffee shop owners will likely know a lot about the brew's history.

, Coffee clubs are a great way to make friends, enjoy drinks, and discuss coffee with like-minded friends. You will learn a lot about coffee in a short amount of time when with coffee enthusiasts. If no coffee clubs are around in your area, join an online society and frequent coffee lover forums.


You can also start a coffee club if you want to discuss coffee intellectually but no clubs are in your area. Co-found the club with a more experienced coffee lover, who can help recruit members and guide the discussions.

, Similar to a wine journal, a coffee journal can help you remember great blends you enjoyed and where you purchased them. Keep a coffee journal to record different coffees you taste, what flavors they yielded, and and any notes you have about the blend. This will help you hone in your tastes and recall particularly delicious brews.

Blend your own coffee.,
Experiment with coffee bean roasting levels.,
Keep your beans fresh.,
Use coffee in recipes if you can't stand the taste alone.",How to Like Coffee3," Purchase a coffee maker and learn how to brew your beans at home. Grinding your own beans allows you to use beans and roast levels you know you love. Start with standard coffee makers and, once you've got the hang of brewing coffee, consider purchasing French presses or espresso makers.


When purchasing coffee beans, make sure that there is no more than ten percent faults in the beans if purchasing a high-quality coffee blend. This will give you the best deal for your money.

, When you're brewing coffee at home, switch around with the depth to which you roast your beans. High-quality beans should be roasted lightly so the flavor comes through. For lower-quality beans, a medium roast (also called a ""city roast"") or a dark roast is best.


For breakfast, light roasts are ideal because of their higher caffeine content.Add milk or cream to lower the acidity and make them more palatable.

, If you brew coffee at home or with a friend, put the packaging in an airtight container after you have made a cup. Although packaging technology can prolong the coffee's freshness, the grounds begin losing their flavor the moment the package is opened. Place the airtight container in a room temperature environment for to preserve its flavor., Even if you don't like coffee as a drink, you might like its taste as a supplementary flavor in a food recipe. That way, you can get the nutritional benefits while enjoying its taste.


Dessert recipes work best with coffee. Coffee cake is especially popular. Try a variety of recipes such as Cinnamon coffee cake, tiramisu, brownie nut cranberry coffee cake, and many others.

Fill a thick glass bowl with water and ice.,
Add a pinch of salt to the water.,
Put your drinks in the ice water solution and rapidly stir them.,
Wait a two minutes.,
Pour your cold drink into a glass.",How to Chill a Drink Quickly1," The thicker and more insulated the bowl, the better. It should be able to trap the cold water and ice mixture. Add as much ice to the water as you can, but not so much that it prevents the entire beverage container from being submerged into the water. A 50/50 mix of ice and water is a good rule of thumb. If you just need to chill one or a few drinks, this is fine. If you have to chill many drinks, you're better off using a cooler or even your bathtub.






;
, A small handful should do. The salt will disassociate into its constituent sodium and chloride ions. The water molecules, being polar, will orient themselves accordingly. This is work, and work requires energy which comes from thermal energy in the water, thus reducing the ambient temperature further.








, Stirring the drinks will help the heat transfer out of your drink and into the ice solution more quickly.








, The temperature should have fallen dramatically in a very short time. If it needs more time chilling, stir the remaining drinks in the salted ice water for another minute or two.

Learn the lingo.",How to Be an Espresso Aficionado1," Before any thing else, if you plan on getting up close and personal with espresso machines, makers or espresso beverages as a lifelong hobby, you'll need to know the terms that go with them. There are many terms associated with coffee making and drinking but here are a few that every espresso aficionado should be aware of:


BAR: This is the pressure rating that you'll find on most espresso machines.
Barista: This is the person responsible for operating the espresso/coffee machine. It's Italian in origin.
Breve: When someone asks for a breve, it's simply using steamed half and half or skimmed milk rather than regular milk.
Coffee Pack: This refers to the tamped volume of coffee grinds in a filter basket before the shot of espresso is brewed.
Demitasse: This is the cup that holds a traditional shot of espresso, namely a 3 ounce (or smaller) cup. Although these can be made from any range of food grade materials, the porcelain type is the most preferred. They need to be thick to retain heat.






Dosage: The dosage means the amount of ground coffee that makes up a shot of espresso. It is usually measured as 7 grams per 1.5 ounce single espresso shots.
Double: This is one option for ordering an espresso or the pour of the espresso. This is usually between 2.5 and 3 ounces of espresso total volume.
Espresso: Another Italian word for the drink made using a pump or lever espresso machine, from 7 grams (+/- 2 grams) of finely ground coffee, producing 1-1.5 ounces (30-45ml) of extracted beverage under 9 bar (135psi) of brewing pressure at brewing temperatures of between 194ºF and 204ºF/90ºC-96ºC, over a period of 25 seconds (+/- 5 seconds and no less than 20 seconds) of brew time. The definitions may be hotly contested by many baristas, for espresso is a subjective pleasure. The age, quality, and origin of the coffee bean, the amount of grounds packed into the basket, the pressure with which the barista tamps, the water temperature, and many other factors all impact the end product.
Filter basket: This is the metal, flat bottomed basket that sits inside the portafilter and holds the bed of ground coffee. It has mesh holes to allow the coffee to drip through to the demitasse.
Froth: This is the result from steaming milk using the espresso machine's steaming wand. Milk froth is ideal when it can be poured rather than spooned onto the coffee.
Ristretto: This is the Italian word for a ""restricted"" shot. In this case only around 1.5 ounces of espresso is poured; it's richer but harder to brew.
Shot: This is simply another way to describe a brewed espresso.;

Know your espresso.,
Be aware of what goes into making an espresso.",How to Be an Espresso Aficionado2," There is a wide variety of espresso drinks available in any good coffee shops or cafès. This can make the choosing difficult but try to see this on the bright side. You can either remain in the same coffee shop for hours or you have a good excuse to return regularly. And even after you've tried out all of the espresso styles and have chosen your own favorite, don't limit yourself to just the favorite. Changes of barista, sourcing of the coffee and even new inventions of espresso styles should keep you curious to keep trying out other styles from time to time.

, Espresso styles have distinct measurement amounts that baristas use to come up with the final product. Excitingly for the intrepid barista or coffee drinker, if you're aiming to serve or drink coffee from country to country, you need to be aware that these measurements change because coffee styles differ from country to country. For example, in England a latte is a single shot of espresso with approximately 200mls of milk, having a very thin layer of froth. On the other hand, in New Zealand, this drink is a double shot with approximately 100mls (or so) of milk and a top layer of froth that is just under an inch (2.5cm) thick, also typically served in either a latte bowl or a pre-heated glass. Here are some of the more common espresso styles (the basic measurements provided are New Zealand in origin, adjust according to your own country's preferences):


Ristretto: 70ml demitasse, 30ml double shot
Flat white: 150ml cup, 40ml double shot, 110ml lightly textured hot milk
Short black/ espresso: 70ml demitasse, 50ml double shot
Caffe latte: 220ml glass or cup, 40ml double shot, 180ml lightly textured hot milk
Long black: 150ml cup, 90ml hot water, 50ml double shot
Cappuccino: 190ml cup, 30ml double shot, 170ml textured hot milk
Macchiato: 70ml demitasse, 50ml double shot, a touch of textured hot milk
Mochaccino or cafè mocha: 300ml cup, 50ml double shot, chocolate powder or syrup, 250ml lightly textured hot milk
Bongo/piccolo latte: 100ml glass, 30ml double shot, 70ml lightly textured hot milk
Affogato: 300ml cup, scoop of ice cream (vanilla) and 50ml double shot.

Note that the ""milk"" can be of dairy, legume, nut or other origin. If substituting other types of milk for dairy milk, you'll need to know the different heating and other properties of the milk being used. Do some reading up beforehand or expect trial and error to teach you as you go.

Enjoy your espresso.",How to Be an Espresso Aficionado3," Drinking an espresso is an experience in and of itself. And to help you make the most of this pleasure, here are a few tips:


Look at the espresso. Ideally, a shot will be rich brown in color with some speckling or flecking of copper or dark gold. The top layer is called crema, a rapidly-evaporating compound of coffee oils and solids. The thicker and richer the crema, the better the shot is likely to be. The heart of the shot is a dark, almost black, syrup-like layer beneath the crema.
Drink fast! Espresso begins to deteriorate within fifteen seconds of extraction.
Take the tiny cup, or demitasse, and slurp to throw the espresso against the back of your palate. Expect a shock. Espresso is one of the most astonishing taste sensations in the world, but if done right, is never bitter.
Keep slurping, tasting for elements such as spice, fruit, wood, or smoke. Every shot is slightly different.
Discuss your findings with your barista to see what he or she “gets” from the shot. Making an espresso is an art form for many baristas and you can learn a lot by engaging them in a discussion.

Open your eyes with a ""red eye"".",How to Be an Espresso Aficionado4," Unless otherwise stated by an espresso recipe, always start with a shot of espresso. With the correct amounts of water, coffee, pressure, and timing, an espresso shot should come out perfectly. In general, a shot should take 20 to 25 seconds to create one to two ounces. However, be aware of the shot requirements for specific drinks and follow the directions provided. The remainder of this section suggests various well-known espresso styles to try.

, Most coffee shop drinks revolve around a latte. A latte is simply an espresso shot and steamed milk. However, to make a delicious latte, good steaming of the milk and froth also plays a key part.


See How to make a latte, How to make a vanilla latte, How to make a caramel latte, How to make a chai latte, How to make a caffee latte freddo and How to make an iced latte for precise details on the latte family drinks.
With a lot of practice, you can also create latte art.

, This essentially the same thing as a latte, but with less milk. You will also end up with less foam on the top (hence the name ""flat"" white). , This is made with steamed half and half rather than regular milk.

, This drink is usually equal parts of espresso, steamed milk and frothed milk. If you're preparing this in North America, you must ask the drinker if they would like a ""dry"" or ""wet"" cappuccino. You'll soon find out that a regular latte is in the middle of the two. A dry cappuccino requires espresso and pure milk froth. A wet cappuccino requires espresso and more milk than froth.


For more ideas, see How to make a cappuccino, How to make iced cappuccino and How to make cappuccino foam.

, Americanos are simply shots of espresso with the rest of the drink being hot or chilled water. This is a larger and cup of smooth coffee. It's also known as espresso lungo, or just as an espresso.


For more details, see How to make an Americano and How to make an iced Americano.

, A caffè macchiato is simply a shot of espresso with a slight amount of milk or foam, making a ""mark"" or ""stain"" in the drink. This is not to be confused with a latte macchiato, which is milk or froth with a very small amount of espresso.


For more ideas, see How to make a macchiato, How to make a caramel macchiato and How to make a marble mocha macchiato.

, As already explained, this is a volume ""restricted"" espresso drink. Less diluted than the regular espresso, it's very strong, so expect a caffeine jolt.


See How to make an espresso ristretto for details.

, This is literally a ""double espresso"" and is the equivalent of two cups of espresso.


See How to make an espresso doppio for more details.

, This is an espresso with a bit of whipped cream added to the top.
Make an espresso Romano. This is espresso served with a small piece of lemon peel on the cup's saucer.
Make an espresso corretto. This is an espresso laced with a spirit or liqueur.

See How to make an espresso corretto for more details.


Make a caffè mocha or mochaccino. This is espresso, steamed milk and chocolate syrup or hot chocolate. On top, frothed milk or whipped cream is added to finish off. In this case, the word mocha refers to the chocolate, not the type of coffee bean.

For a range of ideas, see How to make a mocha, How to make a white chocolate mocha, How to make a black forest mocha, How to make a Starbucks mocha frappuccino, How to make a spicy mocha and How to make a Christmas mocha.


Make an affogato. This is an espresso enhanced by the addition of vanilla ice cream. Perfect for hot days and those with a sweet tooth.






See How to make an affogato and How to make a butterscotch affogato for more ideas.



, This ""eye-opener"" drink should not be confused with an americano. Red eyes are a single shot of espresso with dripped coffee. Variants of this drink are called ""black eye"" (two shots of espresso) and ""dead eye"" (three shots of espresso)."
"
For help in knowing how to pull an espresso shot in a coffee machine, see How to pull a shot of espresso.",How to Be an Espresso Aficionado5," Make sure that you have the proper equipment. An adequate machine should be capable of heating water to desired brew temperatures (approx 192-200ºF, or 90-96ºC) and be capable of delivering the water at least 9BAR (~130PSI) in a consistent manner. For those on a budget, Coffeekid.com recommends the Rancilio Betsy, Saeco Classico, or Gaggia Coffee.

Boil the water.,
Preheat your teacup.,
Put the tea in the bottom of the cup.,
Add hot water.,
Let the tea steep.,
Serve.",How to Make Tea1," Pour more than enough water for a cup of tea into a regular pot, and bring it to a boil.


The better tasting your water, the better tasting your tea. The best water is filtered or bottled (but not distilled). If using tap water, let it run cold for 10 seconds before using it for tea.
Make sure you only boil the water one time. If you boil the water more than once, the oxygen levels in the water will be reduced and make the tea taste flat.
;
, This will prevent the steeping water from dropping in temperature as soon as it is poured in. Add a little boiling water to the individual cups (ceramic and porcelain cups retain heat well). Let the water stand until the cup is warm, then pour out the water and proceed immediately to the next step.








, You can use a tea bag or 1-2 teaspoons of your desired flavor .









When using tea bags, the measuring has already been done for you - generally it's one tea bag per cup. However, make sure that the bags are fresh, since most commercially produced bags consist of small pieces of leaves that are susceptible to becoming stale faster than the loose leaf variety.

, Pour it over the tea. Use an amount in proportion to the quantity of tea you've added (e g. 5 cups of water for 5 teaspoons of tea). The ideal water temperature varies based on the type of tea being steeped. The more oxidized (fermented) the tea (e.g. black tea) the hotter the water should be, whereas less oxidized teas (white, green) should be steeped in water that isn't as hot.White or green teas (full leaf): Well below boiling (170-185 F or 76-85 C). When the water boils, turn off the heat and let the water cool for 30 seconds for white tea and 60 seconds for green tea before pouring it over the leaves.

Oolongs (full leaf): 185-210 F or 85-98 C

Black teas (full leaf): Water must be at a rolling boil (212 F or 100 C). The most common mistake is to steep black tea with water that is not hot enough, which can prevent the active substances in black tea from developing.Pu-erhs: Full rolling boil (212 F or 100 C).

Tea bags: Never let the water boil. Since tea bags often include tea dust and fanning (the smallest tea particle grades) and so have more surface area, use slightly less hot water.

, Cover with the cozy to retain warmth. Different teas require different steeping times. In general, whole-leaf tea should be steeped longer than broken-leaf tea.Check the box for guidance. If there are no instructions, steep for a minute or two, then taste frequently until it's flavorful but not bitter. If practicing gong-fu brewing to make multiple infusions, use shorter infusion times, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.For normal (Western) brewing, the steeping times are longer. The following recommendations are guidelines:



Oolong teas: 4-7 minutes

Black teas: 3-5 minutes

Green teas: 2-3 minutes

, Depending on your taste, you may want to serve black tea with milk, sugar, lemon or honey. Do not serve the tea with lemon and milk or the milk will curdle. If you use milk, add the milk to the cup first and then add the tea; this prevents the hot tea from scalding the milk by heating it gradually.

Place one blooming or flowering tea ball in a clear, medium to large sized glass teapot or tempered glass pitcher.,
Prepare the water.,
Pour the hot water into the glass container.

,
Watch for three to five minutes as it unravels from a tiny ball into a beautiful flower-like bloom.

,
Steep the tea for at least 3 minutes (longer for a darker, more robust tea).,
Pour all the tea into cups.,
Re-steep the tea.,
Finished.

",How to Make Blooming Tea,";
, If you know what kind of tea is in the ball (white, green, or black) follow the guidelines in How to Make Tea when determining how hot to make the water. For example, if it is predominantly white tea, the water should not be boiling (170 degrees is best) when poured onto the tea. If the tea is black, bring the water to a full boil.

,,, Taste the tea as it steeps to see if it has reached a desired strength.

, If you're not going to drink it all, pour it into another teapot where it can stay warm. Leaving the hot water in contact with the tea for too long can adversely affect the taste.

, You may be able to do this 2-3 times, depending on the size, brand, how much tea you made, and how long you steeped the tea the first time. Remember that after a few re-steepings, the flavor will not be as bold as before in other pots.

, Using about a 1/4 cup of vinegar per gallon of tea also works. This keeps the pH low to prevent any foreign molds or yeast from growing while the tea is getting started.


To make sure it's acidic enough, measure the pH (optional). It should be below 4.6 pH. If not, keep adding starter tea, vinegar or citric acid (not Vitamin C; that's too weak) until the desired pH is reached.

,, Temperature should be consistently at least 70ºF (21ºC). 86ºF (30ºC) is best if you can manage. Lower temperatures will make it grow slowly, but below 70ºF makes it more likely that unwanted organisms will start growing too.

, When the tea starts to get smelly like vinegar, you can start tasting it and checking pH levels.


The culture will sink or float or do something in between. It is better that the mushroom floats on top to block aspergillus contamination.The best way to pull a sample is with a straw. Don't drink directly from the straw, as backwash may contaminate the tea. Also, do not dip the test strip into the brewing vessel. Instead, dip the straw about halfway into the tea, cover the end with your finger, pull the straw out and drink the liquid inside or put that liquid on the test strip.
If the kombucha tastes very sweet, it probably needs more time for the culture to consume the sugar.
A pH of 3 tells you that the brewing cycle is complete and the tea is at the correct point to drink. Of course this can vary a bit to suit your needs and taste. If this final pH is too high, then either the tea will need a few more days to complete the brewing cycle, or it should be chucked.

, Note that they may be stuck together. Pour a little of the kombucha on them and cover the bowl to keep them protected.

, Optionally, fill it all the way to the top. If you do not, then it will take forever to get fizzy. If there isn't enough, you can either get smaller containers. Or, if there's just a slight gap, fill the rest with juice or more tea. Use only a small amount, or else you risk watering down the tea. Leave about 10% of old tea in the glass jar as starter tea to start a new batch of kombucha. Begin the cycle again: Pour in freshly brewed tea, put the culture back in, cover, etc.


You may use each layer of culture to make a new batch of tea; some recommend using the new layer of culture and discarding the old one. It is not necessary to put both layers of culture back into a single new batch; one will suffice.
Every fermentation cycle creates a new child from the mother. So once you have fermented your first batch you will now have two mothers, one from the original mother, and one from the new child. This multiplication will occur for every subsequent fermentation.

, Cap them loosely for safety, tightly for carbonation and let sit for about 2 - 5 days at room temperature.

, Kombucha is best enjoyed cold.

",How to Make Tea2," Using a non-reactive tea kettle, bring more than enough water to a boil.


The better tasting your water, the better tasting your tea. The best water is filtered or bottled (but not distilled). If using tap water, let it run cold for 10 seconds before using it for tea.
Make sure you only boil the water one time. If you boil the water more than once, the oxygen levels in the water will be reduced and make the tea taste flat.


, This will prevent the steeping water from dropping in temperature as soon as it is poured in. Add a little boiling water to a ceramic or porcelain teapot or the individual cups--wherever the tea will be steeped (ceramic and porcelain retain heat well). Cover the teapot with the lid and a cozy, if you have one. Let the water stand until the vessel is warm, then pour out the water and proceed immediately to the next step.








, Steeping without an infuser or strainer gives the tea more room to unfold and release additional flavor. Start with one heaped teaspoon per cup of tea to be made, unless you have instructions which say otherwise. The amount of loose tea you use will depend on the type and strength of the tea, as well as your individual taste, so a little experimentation may be in order.








, Pour it over the tea. Use an amount in proportion to the quantity of tea you've added (eg. 5 cups of water for 5 teaspoons of tea). The ideal water temperature varies based on the type of tea being steeped. The more oxidized (fermented) the tea (e.g. black tea) the hotter the water should be, whereas less oxidized teas (white, green) should be steeped in water that isn't as hot.









White or green teas (full leaf): Well below boiling (170-185 F or 76-85 C). When the water boils, turn off the heat and let the water cool for 30 seconds for white tea and 60 seconds for green tea before pouring it over the leaves.

Oolongs (full leaf): 185-210 F or 85-98 C

Black teas (full leaf): Water must be at a rolling boil (212 F or 100 C). The most common mistake is to steep black tea with water that is not hot enough, which can prevent the active substances in black tea from developing.Pu-erhs: Full rolling boil (212 F or 100 C).

Tea bags: Never let the water boil. Since tea bags often include tea dust and fannings (the smallest tea particle grades) and so have more surface area, use slightly less hot water.

, Cover with the cozy to retain warmth. Different teas require different steeping times. In general, whole-leaf tea should be steeped longer than broken-leaf tea.Check the box for guidance. If there are no instructions, steep for a minute or two, then taste frequently until it's flavorful but not bitter. If practicing gong-fu brewing to make multiple infusions, use shorter infusion times, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.For normal (Western) brewing, the steeping times are longer. The following recommendations are guidelines:



Oolong teas: 4-7 minutes

Black teas: 3-5 minutes

Green teas: 2-3 minutes

, Get rid of the tea leaves in the pot (if you have a strainer or infuser) or pour the liquid into another vessel with a strainer to catch any tea leaves. Tuck the teapot back inside a tea cozy if there is tea remaining in the pot after serving everyone. This helps keep the tea hot longer.








, Depending on your taste, you may want to serve black tea with milk, sugar, lemon or honey. Do not serve the tea with both lemon and milk or the milk will curdle. If you use milk, add the milk to the cup first and then add the tea; this prevents the hot tea from scalding the milk by heating it gradually.








, Many teas, especially whole-leaf green and oolong teas, can be infused multiple times, so repeat the above steps, increasing the steeping time with each infusion, to get the most out of your tea.,"

",How to Brew White Tea," White tea is far more expensive than any other tea, so it's not likely you'll be consuming it daily but the price is worth it for weekend treats or other special occasions. Considering that you're spending a lot though, it's important to ensure that you're getting the best quality possible.


White tea has two versions: a traditional budget white tea (Fujian Silver Needle, Anhui, etc.) and a modern new style leaf white tea. They are not interchangeable and appear very different.White tea comes in several varieties, and they can differ significantly in price. Silver tip, jasmine silver tips, pai mu tan (white peony) and silver needle are the best varieties,and they are often also the most popular. You may even need to place an order with your local tea store to ensure that you get a supply each spring.
If you're new to white tea, a good way to start is to buy a sampler kit from an online vendor. That way, you can try small amounts of several varieties to find your favorites.
White tea can be bought as loose leaves or as teabags. However, if the container is opaque and if there is a lack of labeling, be careful as you might get leaf when all you wanted was buds, etc.
Be sure to shop around to get the best deal possible. Since white tea is still relatively scarce, shopping online may be your best option.;
, Ask the vendor to ensure that you're buying the most recent harvest, from the most recent northern hemisphere spring.


Make sure that the tea you buy is packed in as airtight a container as possible. Keep it dry, cool and dark to prevent oxidation. White tea doesn't keep for years like black tea does; it must be consumed within six months of purchase.

, Choose good quality water. If you live in an area with hard water, filter it before you use it to brew. Hard water may ruin white tea, which has very delicate flavors.

, Alternatively, only boil the water to ""first boil"". This is when the water begins to boil but has not yet begin to simmer. The temperature at this stage will be 160ºF (71ºC). Bitter brews come from too high a temperature of water on green tea; prefer a longer steeping time at a cooler temperature instead.

, Before adding the boiled water to the white tea, it should be no more than 158ºF to 167ºF (70ºC to 75ºC) or 160-170ºF (71-77ºC) at the most.If the water is too hot, the tea will be scalded, causing it to become bitter and astringent.

, Use a tea infuser basket, a tea ball, or a teapot.

,, White tea leaves can withstand longer infusion times than other tea types before pouring. It is usual to steep for 7 to 10 minutes.However, you may wish to experiment with a short steep initially (1 to 3 minutes) and then to graduate to longer steeping times, to find the steeping length you prefer.


Use the same leaves for steeping several cups of white tea, with steeping times increasing as needed. Some sources recommend a 90 second to 2 minute steeping if you intend on steeping the leaves several times., White tea should be served as it is, unadulterated. You may choose to pour milk or sugar in the white tea, but the already subtle flavor of the tea will be drowned out.

Serve immediately.",How to Make a Wallaby Darned1," Cover the blender with its lid.


When making this recipe for the first time, it is best to start with the minimum amount of each ingredient. You can add more of certain ingredients later if you want to alter the taste or texture.
To avoid splashes, place the solid ingredients (the ice and frozen peach slices) in the bottom of the blender. Pour the liquid ingredients on top of that.
If necessary, you could substitute a sparkling white wine for high-quality champagne.
Only use peach nectar. Do not use peach juice, since it is not as sweet and not as thick.
Instead of using peach nectar, you could use fuzzy navel drink mix. When using fuzzy navel drink mix, also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar.Do not add the sugar if using peach nectar, though.;
, Switch the blender on, setting it to a high speed, and blend the ingredients together for 30 seconds or until they become smooth.


If your blender has a ""blend burst"" feature, you may need to use it to help crush the ice.
If large ice chunks remain after you blend the drink for a minute or so, turn off the blender and carefully use a spoon or spatula to push the ice further down, toward the blades.
Do not blend the drink for too long. Over-blending the drink can cause it to become too watery.

, Use a spoon or a straw to sample the drink. If you want a stronger peach taste, add more peach schnapps. If you want a stronger alcoholic beverage overall, add more vodka and champagne. You can also add more ice if you would prefer a thicker consistency.


Add up to an additional 1.5 oz (45 ml) peach schnapps, 0.5 oz (15 ml) vodka, and 2 oz (60 ml) champagne.
For a thicker consistency, add up to another 1/2 cup (125 ml) ice.

For this recipe, a smaller amount of peach schnapps, vodka, and champagne is recommended since you will also be adding raspberry liquor. If you prefer strong drinks, however, you can adjust the amounts to your own taste.
Use a full 1 cup (250 ml) of ice. If you use less, the drink may become too thin, and the final addition of liquor may sink as a result.

, Switch the blender on for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture becomes smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed.


Use a ""blend burst"" feature, when available, to help break apart large chunks of ice.
If you need to push any of the ice further down toward the blades, make sure that the blender is off before you do so.

From the fair cup, distribute the tea in the aroma cups, keeping the pitcher close to the cups and pouring slowly.,
After the aroma cups are filled, position one tasting cup, upside down, over each aroma cup.,
At this point, the aroma cup can be brought near the nose to receive the fragrance of the tea by inhaling the steam.

,
After smelling, drink the tea from the tasting cups.",How to Brew Kung Fu Tea," In the Chinese traditional tea culture, Kung Fu tea has a certain etiquette that goes along with it, a procedure that drinkers follow. Each different place adds various details. Study the various ways in which Kung Fu tea is served and enjoyed, and eventually you will develop your own unique way.;
, This should include:


A tea tray (hollow tray with a container inside which can contain all the water that will be spilled during the process);
A teapot;
A fair cup (a separate tea vessel);
Tasting cups; and

Aroma cups (sniffer cups).

, A tea caddy, or “tea presentation vessel,"" is recommended for this purpose, as is a proper set of tea tools. Approximately one to two teaspoons of leaves is a good quantity to begin with and is easily adjusted to taste after the initial infusion.


Keep in mind that due to the many variations of tea processing, some leaves are a lot more compact than others. For instance: in terms of volume of leaves, you will need less Tieguanyin than Yan Cha or Formosa Oolong.

, This signifies that the ritual of tea making has begun by purifying the pot, cleaning it of dust and residue and making it ready to receive the tea. It also warms the vessels since the hot water is then poured into the serving pitcher and from there into the tasting cups. This is done because at room temperature, ceramic teaware is usually quite cold and unsuited to brewing fine teas whose temperature must be carefully controlled. After rinsing, the water should be discarded into the draining tray or a waste water bowl.

, This removes any dust from the leaves and begins to open them up, releasing the tea’s aroma, which should be savored prior to infusion. This act prepares the palate to appreciate the full flavor of the tea.

, Tap water should be avoided, since its chemical treatment imparts undesirable flavors and odors which interfere with the delicate aromatics of tea. (Home filters and other water purification systems can minimize and, in some cases, eliminate these problems.)


The best water for tea brewing is spring water with a natural mineral content that’s neither too hard nor too soft. Since T.D.S., “total dissolved solids"", or mineral content measured in parts per million, varies greatly from water to water, you may want to do your own taste-test of waters available in your area to determine which one has the best flavor, body and compatibility with the tea you drink.

, Pour water over the top of the pot, drawing the stream over the air hole until a little water comes out the spout. When this occurs, you know the pot is full and heated to the right temperature.

, A fair cup allows the tea to be poured from the teapot into a holding vessel. Sometimes these fair cups use a filter to trap unwanted tea particles that may have passed on from the teapot.

,



Oolong Tea: For light oolongs, such as Bao Zhong & Imperial Green, use 70°-80°C (158°-176°F) water and an infusion time of 3 to 5 minutes. For darker styles, including Tieguanyin & Yan Cha—between 80° and 90°C (176-194°F) again steeping 3 to 5 minutes.

Black Tea: You'll probably find that water between 85° and 95°C (185°-203°F) and a three minute infusion works best for black tea. You may want to experiment with lower temperatures and longer steeping times.

Pu-erh Tea: Use water that’s just come to a boil and infuse 3-5 minutes.

, This intermediate step between the teapot and the individual cups allows the tea to be mixed while pouring (the first tea coming out of the teapot will be less strong than the one on the bottom of the teapot). Moreover, it allows to precisely adjust the brewing time in the teapot (all the tea comes out quickly, instead of being slowly poured in the individual cups).

, This reduces the movement of the tea, maintaining its temperature.

, After tasting cups are positioned, take each cup pair and quickly flip it: this is a very delicate step since the cups are becoming hot on the outside. Notice that the tea will not spill out because no air can enter the aroma cups. After this is done, each guest will simply lift the aroma cup from the tasting one.


Another option to this step is to give each guest the aroma cup and separately the tasting cup. The guests will then simply pour the tea from aroma to tasting cups and proceed by smelling in the same manner.

,, Drink by taking small sips that allow to fully enjoy the taste, aromas and qualities of the tea. A good green tea will allow up to four or five brews. Add water to the teapot and start again from point 10 to your will.

Dilute the corn whiskey with plain water.",How to Make Corn Whiskey," Set a large pot (at least 8 gallons or 30 liters in size) on the stove. Pour in 5 gallons (19 liters) of water and put the lid on the pot. Turn the heat to high and heat the water until it reaches 165 degrees F (70 C). Turn off the heat.You should use a brewer's thermometer to make the corn mash and throughout the distillation process.;
, Take the lid off of the pot and pour in 8.5 pounds (3.85 kg) of crushed corn. Set a timer and use a long-handled spoon to stir the corn constantly for 3 to 5 minutes., Once the timer goes off, set the timer for another 5 minutes. Instead of stirring constantly, you only need to stir the corn for 5 to 10 seconds once the timer goes off. Continue briefly stirring the corn every 5 minutes until the temperature reaches 152 degrees F (37 C).The corn will start to gel up when you stir it. This is because the starches are releasing and the mixture is thickening.

, Turn off the heat and stir in 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg) of crushed malted barley. Stir it constantly for a minute or two. Put the lid back on the pot. This corn mash will start to thin out after you've added the malted barley.It's important to use malted barley, since it has the enzymes you need to turn starch into sugar. You'll need that sugar to ferment the corn. Avoid using regular flaked barley., This will give the grain (the malted barley) a chance to turn starch into sugar. You don't need to stir it or check the temperature as it rests., You can make the yeast starter while the mash is sitting. Pour 1 tablespoon (14 g) of active dry bread yeast into a glass of warm water. The water should be 110 degrees F (43 C). Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar until the yeast and sugar are dissolved in the water.The yeast starter will ensure that the yeast is good and active before you add it to the mash. It will also get fermentation started right away.

, Check the temperature of the corn mash once it's rested. It should be around 70 degrees F (20 C) before you add the yeast mixture. You can either let the mash continue to sit or use an immersion chiller to cool the mash.The immersion chiller is also known as a wort chiller.

, Set a clean bucket next to the pot of corn mash. Place a fine mesh strainer over the bucket and slowly pour the corn mash through it, so the liquid passes into the bucket and the strainer catches the solids. Or you could scoop small amounts of the mash into a cheesecloth bag and squeeze the bag over the clean bucket. You can discard the grain solids.The liquid that you're left with after straining the solids is called wort.
If you squeeze the corn mash in the cheesecloth bag, you can actually squeeze more liquid out of the mash which will get you more corn whiskey in the end.

, To aerate the wort, you want to agitate or move the liquid around, so you introduce air into it. Set out two sterilized buckets. Pour the wort into one bucket. Continue to pour the wort back and forth between the buckets, so you see bubbles and froth at the top of the liquid.You'll probably need to pour them between the buckets 10 to 15 times.
Introducing air will give your yeast oxygen that it needs to grow.

, Fill a sterilized test tube with some of the wort. Place a clean hydrometer into it and swirl the liquid a little. The hydrometer will float around and then settle into one spot. Take the specific gravity reading by seeing where the top of the liquid reaches the hydrometer. Write down the specific gravity reading. You'll use this specific gravity reading and one you take after fermentation to determine alcohol content.

, Pour the glass of water, yeast, and sugar into the wort. Once you've added the yeast, the wort is now called wash. Place a large plastic funnel into the container where you'll ferment the wash. Pour the wash into the container.The funnel should be clean and sterilized, so you don't introduce bacteria into the wash.
For example, you could use a 6.5 gallon (24.6 liter) glass carboy.

, Fill the airlock halfway with water and push it into the bung that it came with (this will be made of rubber or cork). Push the bung into your carboy or fermenting container. The container should now be well sealed.You can make your own airlock using zip ties, a rubber stopper, and rubber hose. Or you can purchase one.

, You can ferment the wash for up to three weeks. The wash will bubble while it's fermenting, so just leave it alone until it stops bubbling. Avoid moving or handling the wash while it's fermenting., Once the wash has stopped bubbling, you can transfer it to a pot still. Use a siphon to get it into a still, so the sediment and solids are left in the bottom of your fermenting container or carboy. Avoid pouring the wash into the still, since this will agitate the liquid and mix the sediment back into the wash.If you don't want to siphon the wash, you can strain it. Place cheese cloth over the still and slowly pour the wash through the cheesecloth. Keep in mind that some sediment may end up in your still.

, Set up the still according to the manufacturer's instructions. Turn on the still and slowly heat the wash over medium to medium-high heat. You should heat the wash for 30 to 60 minutes, so it comes to a boil.Avoid heating the wash over high heat. This could cause your wash to burn.

, Watch the temperature of the wash. Once it hits between 120 and 140 degrees F (50 to 60 C), turn on the condenser. You should begin to see liquid dripping out of the condenser tube., Your corn whiskey is now distilling, but the earliest liquid that is fermented is not drinkable. Remove the first 1/4 cup (60 ml) of liquid (the heads) that comes out of the condenser tube.The heads have a higher concentration of methanol and volatile compounds that shouldn't be in your corn whiskey.

, Once you've removed the heads, you can begin collecting the usable corn whiskey. To make it easier to handle, collect the corn whiskey in 500 ml (about 2 cup-size) bottles.Continue to check the temperature. It should be between 175 and 185 degrees F (80 to 85 C).

, When the temperature reaches 205 degrees F (96 C), you're not collecting the body of the whiskey anymore. Stop filling the 500 ml bottles. Instead, throw away the tails.The tails are known as fusel oils and they can ruin the flavor of your corn whiskey.

, Turn off the pot still once you've finished distilling the corn whiskey and have discarded the tails. Turn off the condenser tube and let all of the equipment cool down. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to clean the still completely., Unlike other types of whiskeys, corn whiskey does not need to be aged before you enjoy it. If you'd like to begin drinking your corn whiskey, dilute it first to make it smoother to drink. Start with a small amount, so you can find the ratio you like. For example, mix 1 cup (240 ml) of corn whiskey with 1/4 cup (60 ml) water.

If you'd like a mellower flavored whiskey, consider aging the corn whiskey for several months before you enjoy it.

Spice the drink.",How to Make a Hot Toddy Drink," You will need approximately one cup of a hot liquid as the base of your drink. Traditionally, a hot toddy is made with a base of hot water. This is probably the easiest liquid to use, as you can simply heat water in a kettle or pan on the stove.


Using hot water, as opposed to a flavored liquid, does not mean that your toddy will be flavorless. It just means that the flavors you add to the drink will be stronger and more recognizable in the final drink.;
, Add a herbal tea bag to your hot water. This will give your hot toddy more flavor and it will help your throat, if you are drinking your hot toddy to ease a cold or flu.


Any type of tea will work. If you like a lot of flavor, consider using a bolder tea, such as a spiced blend like chai. This will add tremendously to the flavor.Remember that a lot of teas have caffeine. If you want to go to sleep soon after drinking your toddy, be sure to get an herbal tea instead of one that is caffeinated., Hot cider is a great base for a hot toddy. It is flavorful and sweet, and will add a lot of character to your drink.


Hot cider is best heated in a small saucepan on very low heat. You can also warm it in the glass you are using for your drink in a microwave. Just be careful, as the glass is likely to get very hot in a microwave.

, Because there is no strict recipe for a hot toddy, you can really choose any base liquid that is usually drunk warm. For example, you can use coffee or hot chocolate as the base for your drink.


Remember that you can make your hot toddy any way you want. If you don't like the traditional version, try something new!

, Traditionally, a hot toddy is made with whiskey or brandy, or a combination of the two. Add a small (or generous) amount and gently stir to mix ingredients.What type of whisky or brandy you use is up to you.
Add the amount of whisky or brandy you like. If you like a weak drink, add less than an ounce. If you like a strong drink, add an ounce and a half.

, If you don't like the flavor of whisky or brandy, try a little rum. Use the same amount of liquor as you would if using the other spirits.


The spices in spiced rum in particular go very well in a hot toddy.

, Bartenders are known to add a wide variety of spirits to the traditional hot toddy mixture.This can vary greatly, from replacing the main liquor, with gin for example, to adding a splash of Campari or some other liqueur to add complexity to the flavor.

, Most hot toddy have lemon juice in them. You can either squeeze some lemon juice into the glass or you can simply throw in a slice of lemon, which can serve as a garnish and flavoring. If you would like to put a twist on the traditional recipe, consider using an additional form of citrus, such as orange juice, to give your drink some extra flavor.


The citrus adds a little Vitamin C to your drink, so that may add to its benefits for those fighting a cold., Honey is traditionally used to sweeten a hot toddy. Take a tablespoon of honey and stir it into the warm liquid already in the glass. It will dissolve quickly, adding a nice sweetness to your drink.


If you don't have honey, you can use sugar to sweeten your drink. Sugar won't add as much flavor, however, as honey will.

, A hot toddy is traditionally spiced with cinnamon, usually by putting a whole cinnamon stick right into the glass. You can also add additional spices that complement the cinnamon, such as nutmeg or cloves, which adds to the drinks wintery, aromatic flavor.


Consider adding a splash of bitters to your drink. Bitters are tinctures made from flavorful plants. When you add them to a drink, they create a more complex and interesting flavor.You can even make a pouch of your favourite sweet spices using a square of cheesecloth and a small length of butchers twine. Fill it with a selection of cinnamon sticks, allspice, star anise, cloves, or whatever good mulling spices you have available.
Alternatively, you can used fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg, if you don't mind it in your drink.
Put the spices in the cup while the liquid is very hot. This will help to bring out their flavor.

Lift the glass to your nose for a smell.,
Place a few drops of clean water into your whiskey.,
Taste the whiskey and compare it to its smell.,
Keep any added ice to a minimum.",How to Drink Whiskey1," Rocks glasses, the classic whiskey cup, are short, round glasses made for 12-14oz or liquid. Tulip glasses are curved wide at the bottom and thinner up top, concentrating the smells near your nose, and are used for more high-class whiskey tastings. While any glass will do, these are the two typical glasses used to serve whiskey.Two fingers means that you pour the whiskey up to the height of two fingers held at the bottom of the glass.;
, Whiskey gets its color from contact with the wooden cask it is aged in. In general, the darker the color, the older the whiskey. Purplish tints can mean the whiskey was aged in sherry or port barrels, giving it a slightly fruitier taste.


Some older whiskeys are aged in bourbon barrels that have been used 2-3 times already, and thus stay light colored despite their aging. This is much more common in bourbons.
Some younger, cheaper whiskeys, like Jack Daniels, have caramel coloring added to them to give them the appearance of ""classic"" whiskeys. This is why even cheap whiskey can look dark., Don't jam your nostrils in, as the scent of alcohol will be so overpowering that you won't notice any of the flavors. Instead, bring the glass to your nose slowly until you can smell it well. What do you notice? What sorts of flavors are present? Smell is often the best indicator of a whiskey's flavor, and many master blenders use their noses more than their tongues when making whiskey.Some common smells include:



Vanilla, caramel, and toffee are the classic ""whiskey flavors,"" and are a byproduct of the aging process in wooden casks.

Floral and citrus flavors are becoming more and more common in whiskeys, especially blends.

Maple flavors are common in many American whiskeys, particularly in Tennessee Whiskey like Jack Daniels.

Smokiness is common in Scotch whiskey, particularly from the region of Islay. The smokiness comes from the peat fires used to dry the whiskey out., This drop of water not only dilutes the whiskey slightly, making the flavor a bit more manageable to novice drinkers, it also opens up the flavors and makes them more noticeable. Whenever possible, use distilled or bottled water to preserve the flavor of the whiskey.This is because high-alcohol whiskeys can feel like they burn your tongue, preventing you from enjoying many of the flavors.


If you choose to skip the water, you're ordering the whiskey ""neat,"" which means without water or ice.
The amount of water you add is up to you, but try 1 ""cap-full"" to start. Add more as necessary. Many people like to take one sip without water first in order to compare the flavors, then add a few drops to enjoy the rest of the glass., Take a sip of the whiskey and let it coat your tongue, lingering on your palate before swallowing. Don't chug it or down it like a shot. A medium-sized sip, enjoyed slowly, is the best way to drink whiskey. There is a variety of questions to ask yourself after tasting, but the first and most important is simply, ""Did you enjoy it?"" Other considerations include:


""Was it thick or thin on your palette?""
""Did the flavors change or evolve at all as it was in your mouth and swallowed?""
""Did the taste subside quickly or linger in your mouth?"", Whiskey becomes a bit dull when it chills, so serious whiskey drinkers usually skip the ice or add no more than 1 cube. Ice not only chills the drink, it usually adds more water than you want as it melts, diluting the drink too much and making it watery."

Warm up with a classic Hot Toddy.",How to Drink Whiskey2," When you are ready for some straight whiskey, try it over ice. Fill a glass with ice and pour the whiskey into the glass. Taste it chilled. Whiskey flavors may taste different to you when you consume it chilled instead of at room temperature, and most people find whiskey easier to drink when it is chilled, though not necessarily better tasting.


Most whiskey drinkers only drink blends, not single-malts, on the rocks, as the ice can ruin the strong, distinctive flavor of a single malt., This is the granddaddy of whiskey cocktails. Depending on your tastes, you can use a variety of whiskeys for the drink, from sweeter bourbons (the traditional choice) to more subtle and spicy rye whiskeys. To make an Old Fashioned, stir the following over ice:


2 ounces whiskey
½ ounce simple syrup or 1 sugar cube
2 dashes bitters
1 inch of orange peel or one small orange wedge
1 candied cherry, optional
Ice for mixing and for serving

, The classic Kentucky cocktail is made with sweet bourbon and a lot of it. The better the bourbon, the better the drink. You should always use fresh mint, and you should muddle it (lightly smash it with the sugar cube) at the bottom of the glass before adding the bourbon. To make one, simply mix 2 ounces bourbon with a sugar cube and a handful of crushed ice along with the muddled mint.

, Manhattans are a little sweet for some people, but others swear by the sweet/sour combo. Like the Old Fashioned, you can adjust the whiskey you use for a better cocktail -- rye for something stronger, bourbon for something sweeter. To make a Manhattan, shake the following with ice in a mixer.


2 ounces whiskey
1 ounces sweet vermouth
1 to 2 dashes bitters, such as Angostura
Small length of orange peel.

Technically, using Scotch whisky for this is a Rob Roy, which is a bit sweeter. Bourbon can be used, but it will likely lead to an overly sweet drink for some people., This simple, easy drink doesn't call for much, but adds a nice sour punch to your drink that goes down easily. To make one, simply shake the following together in a mixer with plenty of ice:


2 ounces whiskey
1-ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice or a packet of sours
1 teaspoon sugar
A Boston Sour adds in 1 egg white as well for a frothy, more substantial drink.

, A Hot Toddy is basically brewing tea with whiskey instead of tea leaves and is a fantastic drink on a cold and rainy day. Typically it is made with Irish whiskey.

Compare the different types of whiskey.,
Understand the difference between blends and single malts.,
Familiarize yourself with the typical labeling phrases.",How to Drink Whiskey3," Chemically, whiskey is fermented grain alcohol that has been aged in wooden barrels. The grains are mashed and strained, and the type of aging, grain, and additives determines the flavor and type of whiskey. When shopping, there are a few different variations of whiskey that you can purchase:



Bourbon is a sweater whiskey distilled in the United States. They are often mellow and drinkable, especially in comparison to traditional whiskeys. It is similar to its cousin ""Tennessee Whiskey,"" which is slightly sweeter.

Rye Whiskey is typically made with at least 51% rye in the grain mixture. This leads to a spicy, somewhat bread-like flavor overall. In Canada, rye whiskeys can have any percentage of rye.

Scotch is a single-malt (one distillery only) whisky with strong flavors. They often have a note of smokiness as well.Depending on the country of origin you spell the drink one of two ways. Scottish and Canadian blends have no ""e,"" whereas American and Irish blends end in an ""-ey.



, There is a lot of jargon around whiskey, but the most important one to understand is whether or not your whiskey is a blend or a malt. Neither is inherently better than the other, the difference is just in the distilling methods.



Blended Whiskeys, which make up 80% of the market, are mixtures of grains and malts from different distilleries. They are usually smoother and easier to drink.

Single Malt Whiskys, are made from malted barely at one distillery. They are often stronger flavored than blends, and often go by ""malt"" or ""Scotch whisky"" as well.Single Cask means that a single malt whiskey was mixed and aged in one barrel. It is usually the rarest and most expensive whiskey."", One of the most intimidating things about whiskey is that every bottle seems to boast a new distilling technique. Determining which styles you like, and what those styles do, can be head-spinning if you don't know the vocabulary:



(Not) Chill Filtered. When whiskey gets cold, it can get cloudy or murky, which many people find unappealing. To combat this, some distillers chill the whiskey and then remove all the cloudy particles that form. However, this can severely impact the taste of a good whiskey.

Barrel Proof/Natural Cask Strength. Most whiskey is watered down after it comes out of the barrel to make it more palpitate. However, some brands are releasing whiskey exactly how it comes out of the barrel, making it very strong and alcoholic.

Age: Age is generally an indicator of quality, and more expensive whiskeys are usually aged for longer. If the whiskey is a blend, the age must be the age of the youngest whiskey involved. Aging only refers to the time spent in a barrel, not in the bottle or on the shelf.

Finishing: When a whiskey is placed in a certain barrel for a short period of time to gain flavor. Some whiskeys spend time in rum barrels, or wine barrels, to give them a distinctive taste. This is an easy way to quickly make a ""new"" whiskey for a manufacturer."

This is especially true in the late evening and early morning, when people are driving home from a night out.The risk of a DUI conviction is higher in these situations, even if you're within the legal blood alcohol limit.;
, If an officer pulls you over, demonstrate that you are in control and aware of the situation. Turn off the car, turn on the interior light if it is dark out, and put your hands on the steering wheel., An officer at a traffic stop asks questions to determine whether there is cause to arrest you. Answer politely, but without offering any incriminating information. If the officer asks you how much you drank, say ""I can't recall the exact amount."" or ""I would rather not say."" If you lie about the amount and the breathalyzer proves you wrong, it will be difficult to beat the charge., A small number of states such as New York and Maryland allow you to call an attorney before taking the test. If you take too long to do this, the officer can force you to make a decision: take the test, or refuse.Your attorney can advise you based on the details of your situation.


Careful — if your state does not allow this, the officer may try to interpret your request as refusal to take the test.If you do not know the relevant law, complying at this point is the safest option.
If you were drinking within the last hour, delaying might not help you; your BAC (blood alcohol content) could still be rising. If you were drinking heavily or without food, BAC could rise for two hours after your last drink., If an officer asks you to step out of your car, you must comply. However, in most states, you do not have to submit to field sobriety tests, such as standing on one leg or following a pen with your eyes. Ask the officer if field sobriety tests are voluntary and, if their answer is ""yes"", respectfully decline to take part.Three tests correctly determine sobriety level 90% of the time: following an object with your eyes; walking in a straight line, then turning and walking back; and standing on one leg for thirty seconds.Any other tests could be more subjective, and risky to take even if you're sober.

, Every U.S. state has ""implied consent"" laws, which makes BAC testing mandatory for everyone with a driver's license. Refusal to use the breathalyzer may lead to harsher penalties than a first-time DUI offense.If there are any other signs of intoxication, you could be charged with DUI anyway in addition to those penalties. There are some situations where refusal is worth considering, but rarely correct:You can refuse the roadside test (preliminary breath test or ""PBT"") with less severe consequences, but there's not much point.The result cannot be used in court, and refusal will not prevent the officer taking you to the station.
If the officer has no reasonable grounds to think you are drunk, you could refuse, then challenge the ruling in court to reverse your punishment.The odds are not in your favor with this option.
If you are extremely drunk, you could be charged under your state's ""aggravated DUI"" law for a very high BAC (the cutoff is between 0.15 and 0.18 in most states).The severe legal consequences for refusing the test may still be milder than an aggravated DUI conviction., Breathing rapidly and forcefully before exhaling can reduce the results by 11%, which could save you if you're just above the legal limit. This probably works by raising the air temperature in your mouth, which affects how much alcohol it picks up., As you blow into the device, taper off your breath early. Some roadside breath testers trigger to take the sample as the flow decreases, on the theory that this comes from the deepest part of your lungs.By ending your breath early, you can lower the results.


This works best if you have a large lung capacity, since there is a minimum volume of air required. For most tests, you will need to expel roughly 30% of your maximum exhale (for men) or 40% (for women)., If the breathalyzer does not get a reading from your first couple attempts, stop trying to trick it. The officer may consider this a refusal to comply, which can lead to a DUI conviction with additional consequences., Even if you were arrested for failing the breathalyzer test, you get a chance to defend yourself from the charges. As soon as you are released from jail, usually within 24 hours, find a criminal defense lawyer. Many communities have lawyers whose practice focuses solely on DUI charges.


If your friends and family cannot recommend any good lawyers, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few questions, the service will direct you to various lawyers in your area.

, Talk to your lawyer about the possibility of suppressing the breathalyzer results from court, removing them as evidence. To do this, you'll need to persuade the judge that the police gathered the evidence improperly. If you do not have a lawyer, draft the pretrial motion yourself using examples from a law library or law firm website. These motions typically start in the following format:A caption listing the court, parties involved, case number, and judge. Ask the court staff for the correct format.
Title, such as ""Motion to Suppress.""
A paragraph identifying yourself, your request, and the law allowing it. For example, ""I, Jane Smith, the defendant in this case, respectfully ask that, pursuant to , you suppress the results of the breathalyzer test in this case. This motion is based on the following statement of facts and as grounds in support thereof."", Your motion must include an affidavit (a sworn statement) that lays out all the facts you are using to support your motion. You will personally sign this affidavit because you are the one with personal knowledge of the facts.List the facts in individually numbered sentences.
Only include legally relevant information. For example, state whether you were informed of implied consent, how long the officer observed you before administering the breathalyzer, and whether the officer complied with proper breathalyzer procedures.Your lawyer can request maintenance and calibration records for the device. If the device has not been properly maintained, note this fact., This document will lay out your legal arguments for why the breathalyzer test should be suppressed.In most breathalyzer test suppression motions, you will have to indicate that a breathalyzer test is a search under the Fourth Amendment, that the search in this instance was performed unlawfully (e.g., the officer did not follow the necessary procedures before administering the breath test), and that, under the exclusionary rule, evidence obtained unlawfully should be excluded.This is where your lawyer will really help your case. This memorandum of law will include legal arguments and citations to court cases and statutes.

, Before you file your motion with the court, send a copy of the motion and all the attachments to the prosecutor's.It is usually not necessary to serve these papers personally.

, Once the prosecution has been served, file your motion with the clerk of court. In most cases, this just means handing the paperwork to the clerk.


File the motion to suppress before the trial date has been set if you can. Some states allow you to file a motion within a certain number of days after the trial date has been set (e.g. 21 days in Massachusetts)., At the same time you file your motion, ask the clerk to have a hearing scheduled. A hearing will give you and your lawyer an opportunity to argue your case for suppression in live court in front of a judge. Some courts will schedule a hearing for you, other courts will hear the motion at the next scheduled court date, and others will ask you to find a date that works for all parties., Before your hearing, the prosecution will have an opportunity to file their own responsive motion and memorandum of law disputing your findings. If the prosecution decides to file a response, you will be served with a copy before the hearing date.Read this document carefully, as it will provide insight into how the prosecution plans to attack your motion.

, Arrive early and let your lawyer do the talking. Once both sides have made their argument and counterargument, the judge will decide whether to grant or deny your motion. If your motion is granted, the court will suppress the breathalyzer test results and the prosecution will not be able to use this evidence against you.


If your motion is denied, your lawyer may still attempt to discredit the breathalyzer results during the trial itself.

Since gin rarely comes with an age statement or premium label, it can be difficult to identify high-quality productions. As a general rule, however, opt for gins distilled using traditional methods over those made from concentrate, and try to find gin produced by a copper still; following these two principles should guide you toward smoother gins.;
, Gin is always flavored with juniper berries, but craft gins typically contain flavors from other ingredients, as well. A good balance of flavors can improve the overall taste.Sweet, floral flavors are especially common. Look for delicate botanical elements with floral (e.g. elderflower or hibiscus) and berry (e.g. black currant or blackberry) notes.
Savory flavors are also growing in popularity. For something smooth and complex, look for gins flavored with herbs (e.g. chamomile, basil, thyme, or rosemary), nuts (e.g. almonds), or olives.

, If you aren't sure where to start, trust an expert opinion. Ask bartenders or gin enthusiasts for their favorite varieties. You can also research popular brands online.


Keep in mind that everyone has different tastes, so the gin your bartender or best friend favors may not appeal to you in the same manner.
Some acclaimed gins worth considering include Gin Mare, Tanqueray Rangpur, Beefeater's Summer Gin, Anchor, and Bluecoat., Ultimately, sampling a few different varieties of gin at a bar is the best way to choose a gin that appeals to your sense of taste before buying a full bottle of it.Sample each gin from a stemmed glass that curves inward at the top. Hold the glass by its stem.
Before sampling, mix the gin with an equal amount of still water. The water cuts the alcohol content and makes it easier to taste the underlying flavors of the gin.
Sniff the gin before tasting it. You should be able to detect some of the botanical ingredients used to flavor the gin. If it has a chemical smell, the gin is probably low-quality.
Sip the gin. You should be able to identify the juniper, as well as any other flavors. Determine if the flavor profile appeals to your personal sense of taste.

, Choosing a flavorful, high-quality gin is especially important when drinking it plain. Avoid lower-priced rail gin and invest in something from the top shelf.


Gravitate toward flavored craft gins and shy away from varieties that lean too heavily on the taste of juniper berries.
While price may give you some indication about the quality, keep in mind that not every expensive gin will be one that you find palatable on is own.

, The best method really depends on your own sense of taste. Regardless of the way you serve it, though, it's best to stick with small amounts, usually between 1.25 and 2 fl oz (35 and 60 ml).


To drink gin ""straight up,"" stir the gin with ice and strain it into a stemmed glass.
To drink gin ""neat,"" simply pour room temperature gin into a shot glass and enjoy it without adding anything else.
To drink gin ""on the rocks,"" pour the gin over ice cubes in a rocks glass or short tumbler.

, If you want to make the gin-drinking experience special without mixing the alcohol into a cocktail, consider accenting the glass with an appropriate garnish.


Choose the garnish based on the type of gin you select. If the gin has savory accents or focuses heavily on the juniper, try basil. For citrus based gins, add a lemon wedge, grapefruit wedge, or coriander. Gins flavored with cucumber would do well with a slice a cucumber.Note, however, that you should avoid squeezing the garnish into the gin. Garnishes primarily add value to the drink by triggering your olfactory system (i.e. your sense of smell), which is strongly connected to your sense of taste.

, The gin and tonic is one of the simplest, most classic highball cocktails you can make with gin. Its origin dates back to the early 1800s, when it was commonly used for medicinal purposes.


To make a classic gin and tonic, fill a highball glass with ice and pour about 2 oz (60 ml) of gin over the ice, followed by 3 to 4 oz (90 to 120 ml) of tonic water.Dunk a spoon into the glass to help combine the elements, but do not stir them together since doing so can destroy some of the carbonation. Garnish the glass with a lime wedge or similar accent.
For an easy and interesting variation, try steeping four high-quality Earl Grey tea bags in one bottle of smooth, mild gin for two or more hours. Combine the newly flavored gin with tonic as usual., A true martini is made from a combination of gin and vermouth, and the amount of gin is typically twice as much than that of vermouth, if not more. Its exact origins are unclear, but it dates back to the late 1800s.


For a classic martini, fill a cocktail shaker halfway full with ice, then add 2 oz (60 ml) of gin and 1 oz (30 ml) of sweet or dry vermouth. Shake to combine, then strain the liquid into a chilled martini glass and garnish as desired.
You can vary the recipe by decreasing the amount of vermouth or adding a dash of orange bitters before shaking.
Note that popular garnishes include olives, lemon wedges, and pearl onions.

, Gin is only one of the liquors used in for this drink, but it's still an essential component. While its exact origins are debatable, literary references to the drink date back to the mid-1900s.


To prepare a classic Long Island iced tea, fill a shaker halfway full of ice and add equal amounts of gin, rum, tequila, vodka, triple sec, lemon juice, and gomme syrup (or simple syrup). Shake vigorously for several seconds before straining the liquid into a glass of ice. Top the combined liquors with a splash of cold cola.
While cola is the classic non-alcoholic addition of choice, some versions of the cocktail use actual iced tea instead. Similarly, lime juice can be used instead of lemon if preferred. Furthermore, if you do not have one of the liquors commonly used in the cocktail, you can cheat a bit by omitting it.

, Cocktails combining gin with various juices and syrups are almost too numerous to mention. Some have specific names, like the gin sour, gin rickey, and bee's knees, while others are only identified by their ingredients.


One nameless gin-and-juice cocktail would be a gin and grapefruit. Stir together 1 oz (30 ml) of gin with 4 oz (120 ml) or more of grapefruit juice, and garnish the glass with a wedge of fresh grapefruit or sprig or rosemary.To prepare a bee's knees cocktail, dissolve 2/3 oz (20 ml) of honey in 1/3 oz (10 ml) hot water. Add this to a shaker of ice alongside 1 oz (30 ml) of lemon juice and 2 oz (60 ml) of gin. Shake to combine and serve over ice.For a gin rickey, stir together 1.25 oz (35 ml) of gin with 0.25 oz (7.5 ml) of lime juice, then pour the drink into into a chilled glass of ice. Pour 1 oz (30 ml) of club soda on top, garnish with a lime wedge, and serve.
When making a gin sour, fill a shaker halfway with ice and add 2 oz (60 ml) of gin, 0.75 oz (22.5 ml) of lemon juice, and 0.75 oz (22.5 ml) of simple syrup. Shake briefly yet vigorously to combine, then strain the drink into a cocktail glass.

Look for clear and informative descriptions of specific sakes' characteristics.;
, If you try a sake that you like, ask who the distributor is.Get in touch with the distributor and ask where you can buy their sake locally.

, The old adage “you get what you pay for” applies to sake more often than not. The majority of sake is priced fairly.Costly sake is usually produced using more labor-intensive techniques.

, Although they may not have an extensive range of sake, it's not a bad place to start.


Call local liquor stores first and ask if they stock sake. Look for a store that refrigerates their sakes and keeps them out of strong light., This is handy as the people working there may be able to decipher unfamiliar writing and symbols on the bottle label for you.Call ahead and ask if the store has sake for drinking. You may only be able to buy cooking sake there if the store does not have a liquor license. Cooking sake has added salt and is not made for drinking., Good sake online retailers will attempt to understand your alcoholic taste preferences and match those preferences with a specific sake.Many online retailers offer sake starter packs, so that you can try a few well-known brands and start to work out what type of sake you prefer.

, Sake is generally best within a year of its production. Look for the bottling or shipping date on the bottle.Some sake is aged intentionally, but this is rare.In general, sake does not age well and freshest is best., Grade consists of the rice milling rate of sake, or how much the rice is polished down. Polishing removes the outer layer of the rice, and with it, more unwanted flavors.The more polished down the rice, the more the flavor tends to be clean, light and delicate.Daiginjo is premium sake that uses rice polished down to 50% or less; it has a light and fragrant taste.The top four grades of sake are collectively called Ginjo-shu.

, Umami is an added flavor. Sake with umami pairs well with fish, salad, and fresh vegetables.More delicate sakes tend to pair better with light, simple food, and full-bodied tends to pair well with heavier fare., Ginjo-ka refers to the fruity aroma in sake. Junmai sake is non-fruity.Ginjo sakes are fermented at lower temperatures and have a light fragrance., Light-bodied beverages are less thick and have a consistency more similar to water.Honjozo sakes, for example, are light-bodied., Junmai sake is mild, dry, and and known for its smooth aftertaste.To the contrary, added alcohol sakes have shorter aftertaste.

, There is a Japanese proverb that says “Sake doesn’t get into fights with food.” Pairing sake with food relies heavily on your preferences.If you want some direction, selecting sake is similar to selecting what type of wine you like., A small amount of distilled alcohol results in a light, dry, aromatic consistency.Distilled alcohol is added in the brewing process to “non-junmai” premium sakes. Because adding alcohol also dilutes taste, some sakes will also include seasonings such as sweeteners or amino acids. Premium sake, however, does not use seasoning.Junmai-shu is pure rice wine with no added distilled alcohol.“Ginjo” or “Daiginjo” on the bottle means that distilled alcohol was added. However, “Junmai Ginjo” or “Junmai Daiginjo” means no distilled alcohol was added.

, This refers to the density of sake. Generally, the higher the number, the drier the sake tends to be.Soft water with low mineral content results in sweet sake, whereas hard water with high mineral content makes drier sake., Sake type is a weightier factor than region, however where sakes originate can still play a role in the flavor.Just as with grapes for wine, there are many strains of rice used to make sake, and these strains flourish differently in different climates.Sakes coming from colder climates like northern Japan tend to be drier and more delicate. For instance, Nigori sake from the snowy region of Niigata, is dry and gentle.
Sakes from southern Japan usually taste a little richer and bolder. For example, Junmai ginjo, from the south (Hiroshima), can be sweeter and more complex, with a multitude of savory notes.

, Normal sake is pasteurized twice, ages more slowly, and has a more subtle, softer flavor.Unpasteurized sake, known as Namazake, is usually fresher and more aromatic than pasteurized sake.It is also referred to as Nama Sake or “fresh sake.”

Set a budget.,
Determine the size and type of party you'll be throwing.,
Make a guest list for the party.,
Make final calculations on alcohol quantities.,
Purchase your alcohol.,
Get non-alcoholic beverages.,
Provide mixers.,
Have plenty of garnishes.,
Cool off drinks with ice.,
Offer different foods.,
Get cups and utensils.",How to Buy Alcohol for Your Party," Before you can think about who to invite and how much alcohol to buy, it’s important to set a budget for your party. This can help you not overspend and guide you what types of alcohol may be best for your party.


Let how much money you want to spend overall guide you. For example, if you can spend $150, you may want half to go to alcohol and the other half to food. However, if you’re having friends over for a wine tasting, you may want to spend more on a few bottles of quality wine and offer 2-3 small appetizers.
Consider whether you are going to ask guests to bring a bottle of wine, beer, or another spirit. This will allow you to focus on a couple of types of alcohol.
Figure out what you want to offer at the party. If you’re having alcohol, chances are that you may want to offer snacks or other food like pizza or burgers.;
, The larger the party you throw, the more alcohol you'll need to supply. However, different types of parties will require different amounts of alcohol. For example, a simple lunch party won't require as much alcohol as a cocktail party or a wedding reception.


Decide how long the party will last. The longer your party is, the more alcohol you'll need to supply to your guests.A good rule of thumb for parties is to provide enough alcohol so that each guest has 2 drinks for the first hour of the party, followed by 1 drink for every additional hour of the party., If you’re having a formal or slightly formal party, you’ll need to send out invitations. The list can guide you for the amount and types of alcohol you should get. If it's not a formal, invite-only party, then estimate the number of people that you think may show up. Even a rough figure can help you estimate how much alcohol to buy.


Write a note next to each guest’s name to remind yourself how much and what the person drinks. You can categorize guests by “light drinker, average drinker, heavy drinker.” Add a note of “wine,” “liquor,” or “beer” to help guide you on what specific alcohol and quantities you may need to buy. Make sure to throw away the list before the party so you don’t offend anyone., Once you have your guest list or estimate of how many people will attend and what they will drink, you can put together a shopping list. Make sure to overestimate a bit so that you don’t run out of alcohol during the party. You can always save extra for yourself or the next party.Feel free to play with the ratios of beer, wine, and liquor depending on your audience and occasion. For example, you might want more beer than liquor for a World Cup party. A formal dinner might serve more wine. For a crowd under 35, get more vodka, rum, and beer.Select as wide a variety of alcoholic beverages as you can. If you know for sure that none of your guests will drink a beverage of a certain type, then don’t buy it. Otherwise, try to offer a combination of beer, wine, and several liquors. For reference, a 750-ml bottle of wine has about 5 servings and the same size bottle of liquor will have about 16 drinks. For beer, if you have having a larger group, you may want to get a keg or half keg. If you serve beer in 10-ounce cups, a keg will have about 200 servings and a half-keg 100 servings. For smaller parties, get cans or bottles of beer.

, There are a wide variety of places that sell alcohol. You can get what you need for your party at both online and in person at liquor stores, beer distributors, grocery stores, and some large retailers.Save money on your alcohol by comparing prices. Often, online retailers or wholesale stores have lower price points. Liquor stores and beer distributors may have more of a selection, but they may also be significantly more expensive. Cut costs where you can and splurge a bit on something special like a premium liquor or wine.
Ask store personnel if they are willing to give you a deal. Explain that you will be buying a larger quantity of alcohol and were hoping to help the local economy by supporting the business. Find out if the vendor will refund you for unopened bottles. However, don’t be too push negotiating prices or you might offend the store owner.Bring some friends or family members to help you carry your purchases.

, You may have people who don’t consume alcohol and many guests may want something non-alcoholic in between drinks. Make sure to have either tap or bottled water available to your guests and an assortment of other options such as soda, juice, or tea.


Recognize that you can use many non-alcoholic drinks as mixers with liquor.
Remember that alcohol causes the body to dehydrate, which means that your guests need to drink water to replenish lost fluids. Encourage your guests to drink more than only alcohol.

, In addition to your non-alcoholic beverage drinkers, those guests having liquor may want something with which to make a mixed drink. Having a wide variety of mixer options will keep your guests happy and can also help save on alcohol. You may also want extras such as grenadine or Angostura bitters. Consider all or some of the following mixers for your party:


Club soda or seltzer
Tonic
Ginger ale
Cola
Diet cola
Lemon-lime soda
Tomato juice
Grapefruit juice
Orange juice
Cranberry juice, Some people like a garnish with their mixed drinks and some guests drinking non-alcoholic beverages may also like them in their beverages. Garnishes are relatively cheap, so you can buy extras and use leftovers for other occasions. Figure on ½ lemon, ½ lime, and two each of following for each guest: olives, cherries, cocktail or Gibson onions., Every person has different tastes when it comes to alcohol. Some people like warm beer, while others like ice-cold beer. Some of your guests may like their mixed drinks on the rocks or non-alcoholic beverages with a few ice cubes.Plan on buying or making 1.5 pounds of ice per person. This will ensure that you have plenty of ice for drinks and any ice baths for wine or beer.

, Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can result in sick guests. As host of a party with alcohol, serve food—a meal or finger foods-- alongside the alcohol.Have 5-6 choices of finger foods if your party takes place outside of a mealtime. Calculate 1-2 of each choice per guest. If it is during a mealtime, you’ll need 8-10 foods. You’ll need to figure on 2-3 of each choice per guest in this case.
Think of the type of drinks you’re serving to guide your food selections. For example, things like chicken wings, sliders, and pizza go well with beer. You could do cheese and arugula toasts with herb oil or tomato mozzarella skewers with wine. For liquors, you could do deviled eggs or a guacamole.Consider other options such as soups, tiny sandwiches, fruit squares, cut vegetables and dip, or meats such as salami.Make sure to add extras for hungry or larger men., Your guests won’t be able to enjoy the drinks and food spread you provide if they don’t have anything to drink them out of or off which to eat. Make sure you get plenty of cups, plates, utensils, and napkins for your guests. If you’re using disposable or plastic utensils, plan to get extra in case people throw them away. For cups, have guests write their names on the cups so that they can continue to use them throughout the evening.


Buy disposable bamboo utensils if you want to watch out for the environment. Often, bamboo options look nice than their plastic counterparts, though they may be more expensive.
Make sure to have paper towels or cloth dishtowels on hand to clean up any spills or messes. You may also want to get tablecloths to protect any tables or other furniture from spills.

Strain the water.,
Make your own filter.,
Use sedimentation.",How to Purify Water1," For water that’s contaminated with large particles like pebbles, insects, plant matter, or dirt, you can strain out the contaminants.Line a fine-mesh strainer with muslin, cheesecloth, a clean dish towel, or even a clean cotton shirt. Place the strainer over a bowl, and pour the water through the strainer to remove the particles.


Note that straining the water like this will only remove large particulates, not pathogens, heavy metals, or other contaminants.;
, You can also make your own water filter to remove large sediment from water. You will need some supplies, but you can also use alternatives if necessary, including:


Use birch bark curled into a cone in place of the bottle and cap
Use a shirt or towel in place of the coffee filter
Use nuts, roots, or grass in place of the filtration materials, When you don’t have access to anything that you can use to filter the water, you can remove large particulate from water by letting it settle. Collect the water in a bowl or jar. Leave the water to settle for one to two hours. During this time, heavier particles will sink to the bottom, and lighter material will float to the top.To remove lightweight particles, skim them from the surface of the water.
To remove heavier sediment, gently and slowly pour the water into a clean bowl or jar. Stop pouring before you get to the bottom, as this will leave the heavier sediment behind in the original container.

Use water purification and disinfection tablets.,
Clean water with small amounts of bleach.,
Purify with iodine.",How to Purify Water2," Water purification tablets are made of either chlorine dioxide or iodine, and kill bacteria and viruses in water. To use these tablets, fill a pitcher or jar with water and add enough tablets to treat the water. One tablet typically treats 1 quart (1 L) of water. These tablets generally need anywhere from 30 minutes to four hours to work.Purification tablets do not treat water contaminated with protozoa or chemicals.
Iodine tablets are generally not suitable for pregnant women or people with shellfish allergies.

, Bleach can also be used to kill viruses and bacteria in water, but it’s important to use only small amounts to avoid poisoning. Bleach must not be expired in order to work effectively. To purify water with this chemical:Fill a pitcher or jug with water
Add four drops (1/16 teaspoon) of bleach per quart (liter) of water
Shake or stir the mixture
Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes

, Plain liquid iodine can also be used to kill pathogens in water, but many people are turned off by the taste. To clean water with iodine, simply collect the water and add a 2 percent iodine solution. Stir in four drops of bleach per quart (liter) of water and let it sit for 30 minutes."

Use a commercial water filter.,
Filter out pathogens with pine trees.,
Remove heavy metals with cilantro.,
Drain the water through a clay pot to remove bacteria.",How to Purify Water3," A commercial water filter is the easiest and most effective way to filter sediment, pathogens, metals, and other pollutants from water. These filters contain special materials like charcoal, carbon, ceramic, sand, and cloth that are specially designed to filter out dangerous pollutants.There are many different types of filters you can use, including:

Whole-home filters that filter all the water that comes into your house
Point-of-use filters that get installed on specific taps and filter water that comes out of the faucetCountertop filters that you fill manually with water
Water bottles and straws with built-in water filtersHandheld UV water purifiers that kill bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants from small quantities of water

, Certain plants are effective at removing pathogens from water, and pine trees are among the best. To remove viruses and bacteria from your water, remove a small branch from a pine tree. Strip the bark from the stick and place the bare stick into a bucket. Slowly pour the water, letting it trickle onto the stick and into the bucket.As the water flows over the sap inside the stick, the sap will trap and collect pathogens in the water.

, Just as pine trees are effective at removing pathogens, so too is cilantro excellent at removing heavy metals from water. Fill a pitcher with water and place a handful of cilantro leaves into the pitcher. Stir the water and let the leaves sit in the water for at least an hour. Remove and discard the cilantro before drinking the water.Cilantro has been shown to be effective at removing lead and nickel from water, but it has not been tested for other heavy metals like arsenic and mercury.

, Clay and ceramic are porous materials that allow water to drain through, but they trap bacteria, protozoa, and sediment. Because they trap these contaminants, clay pots can be used to purify water, especially water contaminated with E. coli.To purify water with a clay pot:Place the bottom of a clay pot on top of a jar or bucket with a similar sized opening
Fill the clay pot with water
Allow the water to soak the pot and trickle through the clay, filling the jar below

"
Boil the water.,
Distill the water with a solar still.,
Use the SODIS method.",How to Purify Water4," Boiling is a great way to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites from water. Fill a pot with water and heat it over medium-high heat, or over a fire. Bring the water to a boil and let it sit at a rolling boil for about 10 minutes. Let the water cool before drinking.Water purification typically happens after three to five minutes, but especially at higher elevations, you must boil the water for longer.
Boiling alone will not remove heavy metals or chemical contaminants from water, but boiling the water with the inside of a cactus could remove additional pollutants, such as arsenic., Distillation is an effective way to remove many contaminants from water, including heavy metals, pathogens, salt, and even radiation. You can build your own solar still to collect and distill groundwater. All you need is a jar to collect water, a shovel, and a sheet of plastic.

A solar still will work best in damp soil that has lots of moisture to collect.
To make the still so you don’t have to take it apart, insert a drinking straw or tube into the container., SODIS is an acronym for solar water disinfection, and when done properly, it’s a very effective method for killing pathogens in water. Fill a clear and smooth plastic bottle with water. Twist on the lid, and place the bottle on its side in direct sunlight for six hours to kill parasites, bacteria, and viruses.

This method works because the plastic acts to trap heat from the sun inside the bottle, and the UVA rays pasteurize the water."

First start with researching which types of vodka you may like.,
Make a list of the vodka types you may like and visit your local alcohol retailer.,
Next, retrieve your vodka and glass from the freezer.,
Have light pass through the glass to view the texture of the drink.,
Take a sip and allow the liquid to sit on your tongue, letting the flavor sink in.,
Snack on some food to complement the taste and cleanse your palate.",How to Become a Vodka Connoisseur," You can find websites or other resources that contain information to help narrow down which types of vodka you may like the best.;
, After purchase, place your vodka bottle(s) in the freezer. Also, purchase a 3-5 oz glass and place it in the freezer. Prepare an assortment of food that will complement the type of vodka drink chosen. Vodka is best complemented with starchy, salty foods and fish.

, Fill each glass about halfway and hold until the frost is gone from the glass. Warm vodka has a very overpowering taste, while frozen vodka has almost no taste at all. This allows the drink to warm up just enough to enjoy the flavors.

, The better quality your vodka is the more viscous it should be when frozen. Different brands of vodka have unique “glows” of color that emanate from them.

, Inhale while holding the sip to gain an even stronger sensation of flavor.

, Finish the remainder of your drink in a single sip, but this time allow it to pass straight into your thoughts. Compare the experiences with the different methods of drinking with your friends.

Understand how much water you should plan on drinking every day.,
Carry water with you.,
Develop reminders.,
Lobby for a watercooler in your office.,
Prepare flavored water in advance.",How to Drink More Water Every Day1," The Institute of Medicine recommends an average of 3.7 liters (125 ounces) per day for healthy adult men and 2.7 liters (91 ounces) per day for healthy adult women, allowing adjustments for activity and health levels, climate and elevation, and the amount of water consumed from food and other drinks.


Keeping in mind that 20 percent of daily water intake typically comes from food and 80 percent of water intake typically comes from a combination of plain water and other beverages, the amount of plain water you need to drink every day for optimal hydration will vary.
Perhaps the most important factor to successfully increasing your daily water intake is making it easier for you to drink water. Try some of these suggestions to make it a cinch to up your daily consumption of water.;
, Having your own water supply on hand makes drinking water a no-brainer.


Slip a reusable water bottle into your purse, gym bag, desk drawer, or car, and be sure to refill it regularly.
Having accessible water makes you more likely to sip on water instead of soda or other drinks and can provide a visual cue to drink more water. One way to do that is chugging a bottle of water right when you wake up.

, Try setting alarms or computer reminders that tell you to drink water once per hour, or decide on a few personal “triggers” for drinking water.


Triggers to sip water can be routine activities such as receiving a phone call, passing a drinking fountain, stretching during work or workouts, hearing someone say your name, or watching commercial breaks during television programs.
Other ideas include substituting or adding water for a coffee or tea break, or replacing your lunch beverage with water. This includes water into your routine without making a special break for it.

, If you have a watercooler or purified drinking system available to you and in close proximity throughout the work day, you may be more likely to grab a glass of water than to head to the kitchen to refill your coffee cup.

, Having a large pitcher of pre-flavored or purified water in your home refrigerator makes it easy to refill your water bottle every morning or to grab a glass of water at each home meal.

, The bigger the surface area in relationship with the total amount of water will reduce the amount of time it takes for the water to freeze. For example, an ice cube tray will freeze much faster than a bottle of water. Another example is if you take a bottle of water and empty it out onto a cookie sheet, the cookie sheet will freeze faster than the bottle. The ice cube tray and cookie sheets freeze faster because they have more surface area directly touching the cold air.

, Leaving an empty ice cube tray in the freezer will help quickly freeze water when you are ready to make ice.

, Metal conducts heat better than plastic. If you have an ice cube tray made out of copper, then it helps remove the heat from the water faster than its plastic counterpart., This may seem counterproductive, but hot water can actually freeze faster than cold. This is called the Mpemba effect. There is some debate among scientists about why this is the case, but many agree that it has to do with the fact that the bonds that hold hot water together are similar to the bonds in ice crystals., Most refrigerators have a temperature setting that you can adjust. It sometimes takes several hours before a temperature change can take effect, but if you have the freezer on the coldest setting, then it will help to freeze water faster.Refrain from opening your freezer too often. Every time you open the freezer door, cold air escapes, increasing the temperature inside of it. If you really need to check it periodically, avoid doing so for one hour intervals.

Fill a container with water.,
Place the container in a freezer.,
Wait for 2 to 5 hours.,
Take it out.",How to Freeze Water3," Any container that holds water without leaking will work fine. You can choose to fill it all the way or part way with water.


Don’t use porcelain cups or hard bottles. Water expands as it freezes, so if you use a mug or Nalgene bottle to freeze water in, then it is possible that it will crack the container. A metal cup, ice cube tray, or a plastic disposable water bottle are all good options.
If you boil water before freezing it, the ice will come out crystal clear instead of cloudy.
There are several molds you can find online that will let you freeze ice into different shapes, such as a fish, skull, or even a shot glass.

, The freezer's temperature should be well below 32°F or 0°C.Find a flat spot in your freezer. Place the container on the surface carefully without spilling any water.

, It will take a while for the water to completely freeze. The bigger the container of water, the longer it may take. For example, water in an ice cube tray will freeze faster than an entire bottle full of water.

, Your water should be totally solid. Enjoy your cold ice with a refreshing drink.

Sip on unsweetened tea.,
Add lime, lemon, or other natural flavorings to your water.,
Try carbonated water.",How to Drink More Water Every Day2," Herbal or fruit teas are essentially water with natural, non-caloric flavors.


Try drinking unsweetened tea hot in the morning as a replacement for hot, caffeinated beverages.
For a flavorful drink to get you through the rest of the day, try hot or iced teas in a variety of flavors, such as mint, strawberry, peach, ginseng, or lemon.

, Slipping a slice of citrus fruit into your water can add a subtle flavor to perk up plain water, making it easier to drink more water throughout the day. Try mint leaves, cucumber slices, or berries for other flavor options to add to your water.

,


If you normally drink soda, sparkling water can give you a calorie-free, sweetener-free, fizz-fix with all of the benefits of regular water.
If you prefer flavored carbonated water, opt for one with no added sweeteners and only natural flavors. Otherwise, buy plain carbonated water and flavor it yourself.

"
"
Understand that sweetened beverages or alcohol cannot replace water.,
Replace at least one drink per day with water.,
Make water your drink of choice.,
Quench your thirst with water.",How to Drink More Water Every Day3," If you are a habitual soda or juice drinker, or if you routinely drink beer or wine with evening meals, consider swapping water for your typical drink of choice to increase your plain water intake. Although each of these beverages are very high in water content, you can increase your total water intake and remove the side effects of sweetened, caffeinated, and alcoholic beverages by drinking just water.

,


Consider a glass of water instead of a second cup of your morning vanilla lattes.
Plan to drink a full glass of water with your lunch before opening a can of soda or other beverage.
Alternate between alcoholic drinks and water at parties, bars, or meals.

, Replacing soda or sports drinks with water altogether may seem like overkill, but it is the easiest way to increase the amount of regular water you drink every day.


Instead of keeping a case of soda cans at your desk, consider lugging in a pack of bottled water, or use your new water habit as an excuse to stretch your legs a few times each day on your way to the water fountain.

, Studies show that when you are thirsty, water will satisfy your thirst just as well as other beverages, such as sports drinks, soft drinks, or juice."
"
Make it a habit to down a quick glass around mealtimes.,
Sip water with each meal.,
Follow up each meal with a small glass of water.",How to Drink More Water Every Day4," Drinking a glass of water — or at least a few sips — before, during, and after eating any meal is a great way to up your daily water intake.

, Replace your typical drink during meals with water, or at least have water to drink on the side. Not only can this save you money when you eat out, but it can also cut the calories you consume by drinking and make you less likely to consume additional calories from food., Drinking water during and after each meal can help you feel full longer after eating and aid in the digestion of your food."

Play Water Pong.,
Play Water Bank.,
Get a Water Card.,
Have a Charity Water Drive.",How to Drink More Water Every Day5," Water drinking games can help you drink more water. Just remember not to drink excessive amounts water, since that can be fatal. (This is rare,and takes an excessive amount of water but it can happen.)Water pong is similar to Beer Pong, just with water. If you commit to playing it once a week, you'll manage to increase your water intake considerably by month's end. If you want an added incentive to win at this game, decide on a prize before you start playing. You'll need a large stable table with a durable flat (and waterproof) surface, 20 cups, and 2 ping pong balls. Here's how to play:


Clear everything off your table.
Fill each cup with 4 oz. of water. Make sure all the cups are equally filled.
Arrange 10 cups at each end of your table. You'll want to position the two groups of cups as far away from each other as possible, so if your table is rectangular, set them up at the long ends of the table.

Align 4 cups in a row at the edge of the short end of the table.
Line up 3 more cups in a row in front of the line of 4.
Place 2 more cups in a row right in front of the row of 3 cups.
Place a final cup in front of the row of 2 cups. You'll notice that you just formed a flat pyramid out of the 10 cups.
Arrange the remaining 10 cups at the opposite end of the table in the same pattern. Both peaks of the pyramids should be facing in, pointing in toward the center of the table.


Take turns trying to throw your ball into one of your cups at the opposite end of the table. When you get a ball into a cup, you get to drink the water in that cup. The person who finishes all their cups of water first, wins!

, This is a great game for a family to enjoy together, but you can also play it with your roommates if you live with other people. Not only do you motivate yourself to drink more water while playing this game, but the winner also gets a cash prize at the end! You'll need a piggy bank, a jar or a decorative bowl to hold the money you collect, and a notepad or a mobile phone to log your water intake each day. Here's how to play:


Determine how long you will be playing the game. An easy time-frame to remember is the first to the last day of the month.
Decide how much each glass of water is worth. Since you'll be contributing that amount of money to the piggy bank (or collection jar or bowl), make sure it's an amount that everyone playing can afford.
Every time you drink a full 8 oz. glass of water, make a note of it. You can keep a simple tally in a notebook you carry around with you, keep track on your mobile phone, or create a log on your computer. Make sure that you play this game with people who you trust won't cheat!
At the end of each day or week, deposit the value of water you drank into your communal bank.
When the game ends, count who contributed the most money to the bank. That person not only earned all the money, but they also drank the most water that month! If there's a tie, split the bounty.

, A water card is just like a coffee card–you get a stamp each time you drink a full 8 oz. glass of water. Once you fill up your card with stamps, you get a prize. You'll need to make yourself a card and either have a pen on hand to cross off your boxes, stickers, or a stamp. Here's how to play:


Create a table in a word processing program. Draw a 9 x 8 grid, label the top row 1 to 8 and the first column with the days of the week.
Copy the table 3 times on the page so that when you print it out, you'll have three cards on each sheet.
Cut the cards out and put one in your wallet for the upcoming week.
Each time you finish drinking an 8 oz. glass of water, mark it off on your card.
Each day or week that you manage to fill your card with marks, give yourself a reward. Rewards can be anything from a chocolate at the end of the day, your favorite scone with your next cup of coffee, or even a new book or movie rental at week's end.

, Drink water to help a local charity. Pool together with your co-workers to see how much water you can drink in a month. The number of glasses you drink represents the amount of money you donate to your favorite charity. You'll need a white board or a flip chart to log your office's water consumption, and a jar or large envelope in which to store donations. Here's how to play:


Send out an email inviting people to participate in the Charity Water Drive. Ask them to respond with their top three favorite charities, and the amount they would be willing to contribute per glass of water. The amount can range from a few cents to a few dollars.
Determine the length of time that the drive will last and when it will start. Your charity water drive can last a week, or even as long as a month. It all depends on how determined you are as a team to raise money for your chosen charity.
Create a grid on your whiteboard or flip chart to track your progress. List the names of everyone participating, and leave a place next to everyone's name where they can tick off their water consumption each day.
Mark off your progress at the end of each day to help you determine when you've reached your goal. You can color in the inside of a drawing of a thermometer and celebrate once you've filled it all in.
Make your donation at the end of your charity drive.

Buy a traditional botijo.,
Fill the botijo with fresh water.,
Refill the botijo every time you drink water, or else it will run out.,
Drink from the botijo.",How to Use a Spanish Botijo," They are made of white or red clay. You might be able to pick one up on one of your travels to Spain, or purchase one in a specialty store (either in your area or online) or through an importer.


The shapes and colours vary, dependent on where you've purchased the botijo from.
If the botijo is glazed and very artsy or heavily decorated, it's not suitable to drink from.Look for a plainer one.;
, Fill with water from the tap (this is what it is designed to take). Simply pour straight into the large central hole. Cover with either a cork stopper made for the hole shape or with something like muslin or cheesecloth. You may need to tie the cloth in place with string or a rubber band. Place the botijo in the shade, away from sunlight.


If you live in Spain or you're vacationing there, it is usual to put the botijo out in the garden or near a window. However, it is important to always cover it under some fabric netting, to avoid any insects getting in and spoiling the water. This is probably no different wherever you live, unless you're somewhere that is miraculously hot and insect-free!

, Since you can't actually see through the clay, you'll just need to get into the habit of refilling it either after each use or whenever you know you've used up a lot of the water.

, There is no need to be on ceremony looking for a glass. The botijo is made to drink from directly! Look at your own botijo––you should see that is has both a wide belly and at least one spout (it may have more). These spouts (or ""mouths"") are known in Spanish as ""pitón"" or ""pitorro"". It is from the spout that you consume the water. Follow this process to drink water:


Lift the botijo in the air, holding it by the handle. Direct the small spout (pitón or pitorro) toward your mouth by tilting it.
Do not put the spout too near your lips––the water has to be about 5–6 centimeter (2–2 in) (2-2.5"") distance from your lips. The botijo is meant to be shared among others and germ-sharing is not a part of the deal.
Drink. Don't be surprised if it doesn't work at first; it takes a bit of skill and likely some water will spill rather than reaching your mouth. Keep practicing; it'll eventually feel natural. (And all the water spilled on you on a hot day should be a pleasant feeling!)

Reconsider your water source.,
Change the taste of water.,
Drink only water for a while.,
Trick yourself into liking water.,
Always keep water near you.,
Learn about the benefits of drinking water.,
Understand the importance of replenishing water regularly.,
Know how much water you need.",How to Love the Taste of Water," Not all drinking water is created equal. Water tastes differently depending on its source, and perhaps your impression of water is based on having only tried one or two specific types. Some differences are subtle, some are obvious immediately, while some take a bit of faith that there is something ""special"" about the water according to your beliefs or preferences. Here are some of the principal sources of water:Mains or tap water: This water is usually treated and you can often taste the chemicals. Chlorine is the most well-known treatment agent and few people enjoy its distinctive after-taste. Chlorine kills microorganisms in the water but it can also deplete your body of certain vitamins and harm your beneficial intestinal flora.Filter such water before drinking it. Note that while boiling water will kill most germs, it won't remove chemicals. However, as the chlorine used in water treatment is generally in a gaseous form, one easy way to reduce the chlorine content is to refrigerate the water overnight. The chlorine gas is released and the water tastes better chilled.

Filtered water: Filters can go directly on a tap (faucet) or the water can be filtered through a jug, watercooler, or other system. Filters tend to be charcoal and reverse-osmosis, though there are other types. Most filters need to be changed regularly to ensure effectiveness. This water usually tastes much better than water straight from the tap. See How to choose a home water filter for more information.

Well water: Provided you know that the source of this water is pure and clean as clean, this can be a fantastic way to get the trace minerals your body needs. However, well water is extremely easily contaminated so you need to be constantly vigilant and test it often. If it's confirmed good, then enjoy it as it will usually be very pleasant tasting water.

Distilled water: This water has been heated into steam and then collected and condensed back to water. It's great for an iron and machinery but it's not good as drinking water. Distilled water has no minerals and will pull minerals from your body and cooked foods.While it's fine to drink it if you have no choice (such as camping or traveling), don't drink it regularly or you may find your essential minerals have been depleted.

Spring or mineral water: This water is usually collected from underground water springs containing soluble matter (minerals) and bottled for home use. It is usually chosen because is has a superior taste and is filled with minerals. Provided the company is subject to tests, you are also reassured that the quality of the water is excellent; if you own your own spring, test it regularly to ensure its purity. Whether or not this is a good choice is dependent on quite a number of factors. Do you know if the company has treated the water post collection? If so, how (e.g., filtration, chlorination)? Has anything more been added to it (e.g., carbonation for bubbles)? And what containers has it been placed in for transportation and storage? Plastics and water are considered a bad combination, as plastics may leach. If you have your own spring, or you have a commercial source of good repute, spring water can be a great tasting water source.

Bottled water: Similar to spring water in some respects, some even claiming to be spring or artesian sourced, bottled water is now considered a bit of a pariah in the water supply industry. The use of plastics, the worries about chemical leaching, the landfill problems with disposed bottles, and the ridiculous bottling of municipal water and selling it for a hundred times its original cost have placed a dent in this way of consuming water. However, there are good points to consider too - in some places, bottled water is the only safe source of drinking water and when traveling, this water will keep you hydrated and away from contamination problems. There are also more eco-friendly bottle options, such as glass and safer plastics, so be a savvy consumer and make a good choice to weigh up the real costs behind consuming bottled water. On the whole, most bottled waters will taste fine, although if the plastic has a strong odor, it's likely the water will also taste of it (and that should worry you).

Hard water with water softener added: Hard water concerns householders as the high level of minerals stop shampoos and soaps from lathering well. The problem resides in the solution – by adding water softener to the system, your soap starts showing suds again but the high sodium content makes this water less than optimal for regular consumption. Consider this when worrying about hard water!;
, It's simple to make slight improvements to the taste of the water without adding too many calories and without making it unhealthy. Some suggestions:


Add a little squirt of lemon or lime into the water. It will add a little bit of sourness and will taste good.
Add fresh, clean mint leaves to the water and some ice. Chill in the fridge for a bit and then drink as needed. Many other fragrant herbs can be experimented with.
Add a drop or two of bitters (regular or orange), which can also mask the flavor of tap water, if your building has old pipes or the water has other unpleasant off-flavors.
Add strawberry halves and leave to sit for about 5 minutes before drinking. In fact, many berries are suitable for this treatment and you can eat the berries too!
Some people find it helps to slightly warm water during the cooler months, especially first thing in the morning. A small squeeze of lemon juice in slightly warmed water is an excellent, refreshing way to wake up in the morning and also has detoxing properties.

, This might seem counterintuitive, but when you drink super-sweet beverages like soda pop and juice all the time, it is hard for water to compete. Your affinity for sweetness can decrease if you expose yourself to less of it. In addition, if you eliminate all the unhealthy sources of fluids, such as sodas, fruit juices, and sugary drinks or flavored milks, you will be healthier and you are likely to lose weight. An occasional treat is fine, as you don't have to totally restrict yourself but be very disciplined about such ""candy drinks"". You might even find that after not drinking them for a while, they are too sweet!

, Learn to love the taste of water by associating it with pleasant things. Each time you drink water, think of something that makes you happy – a person you love, an activity you enjoy, a food you like, a merry song, a beautiful scenery – whatever works best. And try to drink water when you are enjoying good company, or when you are doing things you enjoy. This is called classical, or Pavlovian, conditioning. When something you love (the conditioned stimulus) is paired with drinking water (the unconditioned stimulus), you eventually associate the two stimuli together, and, in this case, you will learn to love the taste of water because you associate it with things you love.


Keep telling yourself that you love the taste of water. And tell it to others as well. The more you reinforce the idea, the deeper the idea will become rooted in your mind, and, in order to avoid cognitive dissonance, you will eventually love the taste of water when it matches your beliefs.

, Having water with you is a certain means for getting you to drink it! The more you resort to drinking it in place of other liquids, the more it will taste the very best to you.


If you're going to be sitting for a long time, keep a glass of water near, and you will reach for it and drink without even noticing.
Always bring a reusable eco-friendly water bottle with you so that you're not tempted to buy bottled water.
Keep a glass of water next to your bed at night.

, The more you know about why water is good for you, the stronger your desire will become to drink it, and the more enjoyable it will be. Just some benefits of drinking water include:


Drinking an adequate amount of water will prevent excess thirst or dry mouth.
Water is very important for the body. An estimated 60 to 70 percent of our bodies consists of water, and our bodily fluids (urine, sweat, blood, tears and the fluids in and between the cells) are comprised principally of water.Water aids digestion, keeps our skin hydrated (and supple) and keeps the mucous membranes moist.Most importantly, water carries nutrients to every cell in our body.Water helps us to get rid of toxins in the body.Water increases kidney filtration rate, so you can eliminate waste products more effectively and keep the kidneys healthy. And water helps to keep your body's waste disposal system (liver, kidneys, lungs, digestive system, lymphatic system, and skin) functioning efficiently.Water can help your mind function better. If you are not drinking enough fluids, you may get lightheaded, dizzy, or have a headache. These are symptoms of dehydration.Drinking enough water will prevent fatigue or muscle weakness resulting from dehydration. Muscles and joints can feel pain and you may experience backache when you haven't had enough water.Water helps to reduce bloating.Water can be an aid in weight loss by helping to increase your metabolism rate. Water also helps to lose weight because ""thirst"" can be misinterpreted by your body as ""hunger"" and cause you to eat unnecessarily. As such, drinking water instead of juice and soda can help to regulate your appetite.
Water is vital in regulating your body's temperature.Drinking water is the best preventive measure for kidney stones, as water lowers the risk of crystal precipitation and helps to wash out any small stones that do form.Moreover, there is some evidence that women with high water intakes have a reduced level of lower urinary tract cancers and colon cancer.Water saves you money! Water is cheaper than other sources of fluid.

, As already noted above, water is an important part of removing toxins from our bodies and in keeping our entire system well hydrated and functioning properly. Another factor to consider is the loss of water. Urine, waste elimination, sweat, tears, and breathing cause us to lose water all the time and this needs to be replenished constantly., The amount you need is dependent on your level of activity, the types of activities you undertake, the climate, and the food and other sources of liquid that you're consuming.And the advice about eight glasses of water a day is not based in science; it's advice with unfounded origin but has stuck as an urban nutrition myth, possibly because it's an easy guide to remember.That said however, getting adequate water daily is vital for your ongoing health. When gauging your water level need, some indicators that might help you include:


Color of your urine: If your urine is pale yellow or straw color, and is of a good quantity, that's a good sign that you're getting plenty of fluids.However, vitamin supplements, some foods, and medications can affect the color. For example, vitamins from the B group can cause urine to become bright yellow or green; this is not bad, it is simply excess B being secreted but it could leave you concerned about your fluid intake!Frequency of urinating: If you urinate frequently and you don't have a medical condition such as diabetes, this is usually a good indicator of adequate fluid intake.Remember that some medications and foods can increase your need to urinate though.

Thirst is not a good indicator of how much water you need or when.For most of us, thirst is a sign that fluid loss is already somewhere between 0.8 percent and 2 percent of total body weight, meaning that the body is already mildly dehydrated at this point.The older you are, the less sensitive your thirst indicators are.
If you are very active, such as an athlete, an outdoor worker, a frequent sauna user, filled with nervous energy, sitting in indoor heating all day, living in the tropics and eating a lot of dehydrating foods, then you will need to increase your water intake accordingly.Pregnancy, breastfeeding, illness, age, gender, sedentary or active lifestyles, food intake, weight, etc., are all factors in your fluid intake requirements.
Some people are strongly of the belief that adequate fluid can come from soups, herbal teas, watery foods, etc., such as those following macrobiotic diets.If that is your case, read up carefully on the requirements of your special diet and speak with your doctor for more advice to ensure optimal health.
Water is lost rapidly during exercise.Dehydration occurs when fluid loss amounts to 1 percent or more of body weight; by 10 percent loss, it is life-threatening.Most people are dehydrated to a small degree rather than having enough.Bear this in mind when assessing your water needs. (See ""Warnings"" below for excessive water consumption.)

Repeat the process twice more to completely fill the tray.,
Remove the cubes from the tray and add them to drinks.,
Choose organically-grown edible flowers.,
Pay attention to the size of the blossoms.,
Pick the flowers at the right time.",How to Make Blossom Ice Cubes," Before placing the flowers in the ice tray, you should wash away any dirt, bugs, or other debris that might be on the petals. Fill a bowl with cool water and carefully dip the flowers in to rinse them clean. Set them out on a clean towel to dry for 30 minutes to an hour.It’s especially important to rinse the flowers if you’ve picked them yourself. If you’ve purchased edible flowers for a store or website, they’ve likely already been rinsed. However, it’s a good idea to rinse them yourself to be sure that all of the dirt is removed.;
, You want your ice cubes to be as clear as possible so the blooms stand out. Start with distilled water so the impurities have been removed, and place it in a saucepan. Heat the water on the stove at high heat until it comes to a boil, and then allow the water to boil for 2 to 3 minute.The amount of water that you’ll need to boil depends on how many ice cubes you plan to make. Add water to the tray until they’re full and dump it directly into the saucepan to ensure that you have enough.

, You shouldn’t add the boiled water to the ice tray right after you remove it from the stove. Instead, let the water sit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes or until it’s cooled completely to avoid imperfections in the finished ice cubes., Before you add the flowers and water to the ice tray, you should clean the tray to ensure that dirt and debris don’t wind up in your ice cubes. Rinse the tray with cool water and dishwashing soap, and wipe out each compartment with a clean kitchen towel or piece of paper towel.Silicone ice trays are usually the best option when making blossom ice cubes. It’s easier to remove the cubes from the tray without breaking them because the tray is flexible.
If possible, use a tray that has larger compartments. If your finished ice cubes are large, they’ll melt more slowly in drinks.

, When the tray is clean and the flowers are dry, start placing the blossoms in the compartments. Set the flowers in face down so they’ll be visible at the top of the finished ice cubes.The flowers may shift slightly during melting, so you shouldn’t worry about placing them perfectly in the tray.
Depending on the size of the flowers, you may want to add one blossom to each compartment or several. If you’re using more than one type of edible flower, you can also mix them in the compartments for more colorful ice cubes.

, With the blossoms in place, pour a small amount of the cooled water into tray’s compartments over the flowers. You want to add just enough water to cover the blossoms. Place the tray in the freezer and freeze until the ice is solid, which should take 30 minutes to 1 hour.When you add the water, the tray’s compartments should be approximately ¼ of the way full.
Pour the water into the tray slowly to avoid disrupting the flowers too much.

, When the first layer of ice is frozen solid, remove the tray from the freezer. Pour more of the water into the tray, stopping when the compartments are halfway full. Return the tray to the freezer and allow the ice to freeze until solid again, which should take another 30 minutes to 1 hour., Once the second layer of ice is solid, remove the tray from the freezer again and repeat the process two more times. First, add enough water to fill the compartments ¾’s of the way full. Once that layer is frozen, top the compartments off with water so they’re completely full and freeze a final time.Each of the final two freezing periods should take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour.

, When the final layer of ice is frozen solid, remove the tray from the freezer. Carefully remove the ice cubes from the tray by twisting or tapping it against the counter to loosen them. Add the blossom ice cubes to beverages before serving.If you don’t plan to use the ice right away, store it in an airtight container in the freezer.
The blossom ice cubes will add a slightly floral flavor to whatever drink you add them to, so keep that in mind when you’re choosing a beverage to pair them with. Water, lemonade, and cocktails that feature floral liqueurs usually work best.

, To avoid getting sick, it’s important to use edible flowers in your ice cubes. Fortunately, there are several varieties of flowers that are safe to eat. You should still select organic edible flowers, though, to ensure that they haven’t been treated with chemicals.Honeysuckle, violas, and pansies have a sweet flavor, and are completely edible.
Violets have a sweet to sour flavor, and are completely edible.
Nasturtium has a peppery flavor, and is completely edible.
If you can’t find edible flowers in the herb section of your local grocery store or your own garden, you can order them from a variety of online shops.

, When you’re choosing flowers to add to your ice cubes, it’s important to consider how large the blossoms are. For the best looking ice cubes, you want to use the largest possible blossom that will fit inside the ice tray’s compartments.If you don’t have flowers that are large enough to fill most to the compartment, you can use several smaller blossoms for maximum impact.

, If you’re picking the edible flowers for the ice cubes yourself, you want to harvest them when they’re at the peak of their flavor. Pick the flowers either early in the day before 10 am or later in the day after the sun has gone down. The blossoms will be cool and have the best flavor.Avoid any flowers that are wilted or have noticeable marks or blemishes on the petals.

Purchase some kefir grains.,
Place the kefir grains into a glass or plastic jar.,
Fill the jar with milk.,
Remove the kefir grains from the milk.,
Pour more milk into the jar with the kefir grains.,
Store the kefir grains in the refrigerator if necessary.",How to Maintain Kefir Grains," There are several ways to obtain kefir grains. The cheapest way is to ask a kefir hobbyist in your area for some of their excess kefir grains. Anyone who prepares kefir regularly will be constantly throwing out excess grains, as the yeast and bacteria reproduce quickly. They may be willing to give you some at little or no cost. Another option is purchasing kefir grains from either a health food store or a specialty store that sells culturing supplies.;
, When you receive your kefir grains, you can choose to rinse away some of the fat solids if desired, but do not use chlorinated water. The chlorine will kill the microorganisms in the grains. Place the grains into a clean jar.


Do not use metal utensils when handling the kefir grains, as this can adversely affect the microorganisms' health. Use only plastic utensils.

, The exact ratio of milk to kefir grains is not crucial, but a general rule is to use 20 parts milk to 1 part grains by volume. The milk provides food for the yeast and bacteria, and will keep your kefir grains healthy and active. Place a loose-fitting lid on the jar, and leave it out at room temperature for 24 hours.

, After 24 hours, use a plastic spoon to remove the kefir grains, which will be floating on the milk's surface. Place them in another clean jar. The milk has now been transformed into kefir, which can be consumed immediately or stored in the refrigerator.

, The simplest way to maintain your kefir grains indefinitely is to continually use them to prepare kefir. By pouring more milk into the new jar, you can prepare another batch of kefir in 24 hours, after which you can remove the grains. Repeating this process endlessly will keep your kefir grains healthy and active, while providing you with a continuous supply of kefir.


If you don't need this much kefir, you can still keep the grains healthy in milk at room temperature. Instead of adding a full jar's worth of milk each day, simply pour off a portion of the old milk and top it off with some fresh milk. Doing this daily will provide enough food for the microorganisms to stay healthy.






You don't need to be concerned about the milk spoiling, even at room temperature. The beneficial yeast and bacteria in the grains reproduce so rapidly in the milk that harmful bacteria do not have a chance to proliferate.







, If you will be away from home and cannot add fresh milk to the jar for several days, you can place the jar in the refrigerator. This will slow the microorganisms' growth, and fresh milk only needs to be added once a week. Leaving the kefir grains in the refrigerator for longer than 3 weeks may render them unusable in the future, however.

Buy organic milk.,
Be aware that if you are trying to drink more milk by putting milk inside your tea, the benefits of the tea will be cancelled entirely.,
Be aware of all the vitamins and minerals found in milk:



Calcium: Keeps bones and teeth healthy; helps your body maintain bone mass.,
Drink milk to avoid illnesses.,
Be aware as to whether or not milk or milk products are made out of pasteurized milk or not.,
Drink milk to help reduce acidity.,
Drink milk to have clear skin.,
Drink milk for healthy teeth.,
Drink milk to lose weight.",How to Drink Milk for Better Health," Studies have shown that organic milk is much healthier than regular milk. Some benefits of organic milk is the fact that organic milk is from cows that haven't been given growth hormones, it is wholesome, produced without harmful pesticides, etc.


Organic milk isn't produced with antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics is a serious health problem. Today, of all the main places that antibiotics is overused is in agriculture. Organic milk comes from cows that were not given antibiotics, so it doesn't contribute to the growing problem of bacterial resistance.
Organic milk is very high in conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). CLAs are important healthy fats that has been proven to have been linked to reduced heart disease and diabetes. As a matter of fact, in the May 9th issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health reported that dairy products that are low in fat, including milk, is shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (in men).
Another big advantage of organic milk over regular milk is its ability to go for a long time without turning sour: organic milk is heated to around 280 °F (138 °C), so it would take up to two months for it to turn sour. Because of the fact that regular, pasteurized milk is heated to 145 °F (63 °C), it doesn't have the same life. So if you are worried about milk turning sour fairly quickly, then organic milk may actually allow you to save money. Understand that it's the right thing to do. Organic cows must be able to access open air, unlike factory cows. Cows that produce organic milk, or organic cows from many dairy farms are allowed to graze freely in organic pasture. This type of farming is considerate to animals, and isn't cruel, is very supportive of wildlife, good for many rural communities, respectful of air, water and soil, and is healthy for people.;
, Rather than putting milk in your tea, try putting in honey instead. Also, try to put milk inside coffee rather than tea, as milk doesn't affect coffee.

,

Protein: A good source of energy: builds and repairs your muscle tissue; good after work-outs.

Potassium: Helps you keep a good blood pressure.

Phosphorus: Helps strengthen your bones and gives you energy.

Vitamin D: Helps your body maintain your bones.

Vitamin B12: Helps maintain healthy red blood cells and helps maintain nerve tissue.

Vitamin A: Helps maintain the immune system; helps maintain normal vision and good skin.

Niacin: Improves your metabolism; have a glass before doing aerobics. , The USDA has shown drinking milk to prevent osteoporosis, because of its nutrients: calcium and vitamin D. Other evidence shows the intake of milk and milk products is linked to improved bone health and the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. , Pasteurization kills bacteria and other harmful microorganisms that are found in raw milk, and it is dangerous to drink raw milk.


Be sure to read the label. Safe milk, meaning pasteurized milk, will have the word ""pasteurized"" on the label. If the word ""pasteurized"" is not found on the label of a product, it may contain raw milk.
Do not be afraid to ask your grocer or store clerk whether milk or dairy products have been pasteurized, especially milk or milk products sold in refrigerated cases. Do not buy milk or milk products at farm stands or farmers' markets unless you can confirm that it has been pasteurized. , Heartburn is caused a lot of the time by acidity, so logically milk naturally relieves heartburn.

, For thousands of years, milk has been known to keep skin clear. The lactic acid found in milk aids in removing dead skin cells, and therefore keeps your skin clear and rejuvenated., Milk has been shown to protect the enamel against acidic foods. Also, the calcium and vitamin D found in milk keeps bones strong, although teeth are not considered bones. , Many dieters do not consume dairy, because they think that milk will not help them lose weight. Recent studies performed by the Ben-Gurion University has shown that including more calcium in your diet may lead to continuous weight-loss. Drinking 12 ounces (580 g) of milk every day assists the loss of more than 12 lbs on average, while people who only consume a cup of milk a day lose on average 7 lbs.

Heat it in the microwave.,
Boil milk on the stovetop in a large, deep pot.,
Try keeping a long-handled spoon in the pot.,
Heat milk for culturing slowly.",How to Heat Milk1," The easiest way to heat milk is in the microwave, but you’ll have to keep an eye on it. One cup (250 mL) of milk should reach room temperature within 45 seconds and boil within two and a half minutes. Stir it every 15 seconds to keep it from boiling over.You can also try setting your microwave to 70 percent power for a slower boil. You should still stir the milk every 15 seconds.;
, When boiling milk on the stovetop, use a deep pot so the milk has room to bubble and crawl up the sides. If you’re making a sauce or a glass of warm milk, set the heat to medium. To keep the milk from boiling over, don’t turn your back on it and stir it every few minutes.Lower the heat when the milk starts to boil to avoid scorching it.

, Milk boils over when a layer of protein and fat forms at the top and prevents steam below from escaping as it heats. Eventually, the steam breaks through violently and the milk boils over the sides of the pot. Keeping a long-handled spoon gives the steam a way out before too much pressure builds.You should still put the spoon to use every few minutes and stir the milk to release steam.

, If you’re making cheese or yogurt, you should heat milk by one degree per minute. Heat it at low to medium-low for 30 to 40 minutes and stir it every few minutes. When you see tiny bubbles and steam, the milk has met its boiling point of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).

If your stove runs hot and you can’t boil milk slowly enough directly over a flame, you could use the double boiler method.

Bring a small amount of water to a simmer.,
Place a heatproof bowl over the simmering water.,
Add the milk to the heatproof bowl.",How to Heat Milk2," You’ll only need to add a couple inches (three or four centimeters) of water to a saucepan. Put it on the stove and set the heat to low. Heat it slowly until it starts to simmer., Use a glass or stainless steel bowl, and place it into the saucepan so that it sits within the pot but doesn’t touch the simmering water. There should be at least an inch of space between the bottom of the bowl and the top of the water.Indirectly heating the milk in the glass or stainless steel bowl will ensure a slower, more even boil.

, Keep the heat on low so the water in the saucepan continues to simmer. Carefully pour the milk into the glass or stainless steel bowl. Stir frequently, and heat it until you see tiny bubbles around the edge of the bowl and steam rising from the milk.When the milk boils, turn the heat off and either use it or cool it according to your recipe.

Submerge a bottle in warm water to heat it evenly.,
Avoid using the microwave or stovetop.,
Invest in a bottle warmer.",How to Heat Milk3," Place the bottle in a bowl filled with warm water, or hold it under running warm water. As the water in the bowl cools, you might need to replace it with more warm water. Warm the bottle until it’s reached room or body temperature, depending on your baby’s preferences.You don’t want to get the milk or formula too hot. If it’s too hot, it’ll lose nutritional value and could burn your infant’s mouth.

, You can run warm water from a faucet or heat milk over the stove, but you should avoid heating the bottle itself in a microwave or directly over the stove. A microwave can heat the milk or formula unevenly, causing dangerous hot spots.Heating a bottle over the stove can have the same effect and could melt the bottle if it’s made of plastic., A bottle warmer is the quickest and most convenient way to warm milk or formula for an infant. They’ll evenly heat a bottle to room temperature in two to four minutes, depending on the model.A bottle warmer can make late night feedings a bit easier. Instead of heating water on the stove or holding a bottle under warm running water, you could just pop it in the warmer and wait a couple minutes.

Ask your local market to carry almond milk, if it's not currently in stock.",How to Buy Almond Milk," There are sweetened and unsweetened versions of plain almond milk, which will have a distinctive nutty flavor. There are also chocolate and vanilla varieties.


If you are drinking almond milk as part of a healthy diet, shop for unsweetened varieties. Sweetened plain, chocolate and vanilla almond milk can have up to 5 tsp. (20 g) of added sugar per serving. Check the sugar content before buying.;
, These coupons can be used online or in a grocery store.


These sites may also have an online store where you can buy the milk. Silk Pure Almond provides a store locator, where you can input your zip code and find stores near you that carry the product.

, With more almond milk brands coming on the market, there are often coupons available to encourage you to try new products. Safeway, Albertsons and other large chains may offer increased discounts if you buy 2 or more.

, Certain brands of boxed almond milk are vacuum sealed so they can be kept on the shelf for a long period of time. If you have a large family or a business that uses a lot of almond milk, you can buy in bulk on Amazon.com or BuyTheCase.net.

, Customer service representatives should be able to tell you whether or not it is in stock.

, They are usually kept in 2 sections: the dairy section next to the soy milk and the natural foods section. The varieties in the dairy section are often larger but require refrigeration, while the varieties in the natural foods section will be smaller boxes with a longer shelf life.

, Some stores, such as Whole Foods, carry specialty kinds of almond milk in their dairy section. This milk often contains fewer preservatives, but costs substantially more.

, Some small grocery store owners rely on their customers to tell them what will sell. If they stock soy milk, then it is likely they will be willing to try selling almond milk.

Check whether the milk needs to be boiled.,
Pour the milk into a large, clean pot.,
Heat the milk until it starts to bubble.,
Stir occasionally.,
Break up the foam as it forms.,
Boil for two or three minutes, stirring constantly.,
Store immediately.",How to Boil Milk1," Some milk is safe to drink without boiling. Follow this guide when deciding whether to boil milk:


Raw milk should be boiled whenever possible.
Pasteurized milk should be boiled if it has been stored at room temperature. It does not need to be boiled if it's been in the refrigerator or a very cold room.
A sealed tetra pack with ""UHT"" on the label is safe to drink, even if it's been stored at room temperature. UHT stand for ""ultra high temperature,"" a type of processing which kills all harmful microbes.;
, Choose a taller pot than you need, so there's plenty of space. Milk foams up when it boils, and will often overflow from a small pot.


Clean the pot thoroughly, or residue might curdle your milk. If this becomes a problem, choose a pot to use only for milk.
Copper, aluminum, and stainless steel heat up much faster than cast iron and other heavy material. This saves time, but you'll need to pay extra close attention to prevent burning and overflow.

, Heat the milk over medium heat and give it your full attention. A shiny layer of cream will rise to the top as it heats. Eventually, small bubbles will rise up from underneath the cream, starting around the outside edge. Once this happens, reduce heat to low.


You may heat the milk over high heat to save time, but watch it constantly and be ready to reduce heat. Over high heat, the milk will rapidly move from the first bubbles to a rising layer of foam.

, If your pot heats unevenly, the milk may burn in places. Stir once every couple minutes with a wooden spoon or a heat-safe spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan.

, The cream at the top of the milk traps steam as the milk boils. This steam will break up the cream into foam, which will rise rapidly and overflow out the pot. Respond quickly to prevent this:


Reduce heat until the milk bubbles at a steady rate.
Stir constantly to break up the foam.
Leave the utensil in the pot (optional). This breaks up the cream surface, creating a gap for steam to escape through.Just make sure the utensil can handle prolonged heat without burning.

, This is long enough to make your milk safe to drink. Further boiling will just destroy nutrients in the milk., Pour the milk into a closed container right away. Store in the refrigerator, or in the coldest place in your home. If you keep the milk in the refrigerator, it does not need to be boiled a second time. If storing the milk at room temperature, you may need to boil it before each use.


Boiling too many times will destroy nutrients. If you do not have a refrigerator, try to buy only as much milk as you can use in one sitting.

"
"
Do not rely on this method to make raw milk safe.,
Pour milk into a clean mug.,
Place a wooden utensil in the mug.,
Microwave for 20 seconds at a time.",How to Boil Milk2," Microwaves can only boil the milk for a brief time before the milk overflows. This will still kill some microbes, but not enough to treat raw milk or milk stored at room temperature. Heat these over the stove instead.

, Avoid mugs with metallic paint, which are not microwave safe.

, Place a wooden spoon or chopstick in the mug. Use a utensil long enough that it can't fall under the milk. This lets steam escape up the handle instead of causing a foamy explosion.

, Between each ""zap,"" take out the milk and stir it for 5–10 seconds. This cautious method minimizes the risk of overflow.

Scald milk for use in recipes.,
Pour the milk into a clean pot.,
Heat over medium heat.,
Stir occasionally.,
Watch for light bubbling and steaming.,
Continue heating for about fifteen seconds.,
Store the leftover milk.",How to Boil Milk3," Scalding, or heating to a temperature just below boiling, changes the milk's behavior in bread recipes.Some people like to scald pasteurized milk as an extra precaution against microbes, but this is not necessary if it's been stored in a refrigerator.


If the milk is unpasteurized or if it's been stored at room temperature, boil it instead.

, A thick-bottomed pot will heat the milk more evenly, reducing the chance of burning.


Impurities can spoil the milk, so clean the pot thoroughly.

, Never heat over high heat, which is much more likely to burn the milk or cause overflow.

, Keep an eye on the milk, stirring every minute or so. A wide spatula works best, since you can scrape the base of the pot if the milk starts to stick., The milk is ""scalded"" once it has a tiny layer of foam at the top of the milk. Small bubbles will appear around the edge of the pot, and the surface will just barely steam.If you have an infrared thermometer, confirm that the milk has reached 82ºC (180ºF).

, Stir constantly to prevent overflow.

, If you have milk left over after drinking or cooking, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If this is not possible, store the container in a cool room. At warm temperatures, where bacteria thrive, milk will only stay good for four hours at most."

Place a funnel into the mouth of an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass bottle.,
Pour 4 ounces (125 milliliters) of your favorite flavor of juice into the funnel.,
Slowly pour 4 ounces (125 milliliters) of carbonated water through the funnel.,
Add 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of sugar or honey.,
Allow the ingredients to combine.,
Cork the bottle.,
Combine the remaining ingredients into a second bottle.,
Refrigerate the bottles or keep them in a bucket of ice.",How to Make a Juice Spritzer1," Make sure that the funnel can sit in the bottle firmly without moving around too much or falling out.;
, Orange juice and grape juice are two of the most commonly used juices for spritzers, but any flavor—apple, cranberry, pomegranate, mixed berry, tropical punch—will work. Select a brand that is 100% juice over one made with a lot of extra sugar.

, Carbonated water refers to any type of fizzy water that contains bubbles of carbon dioxide.


Mineral water is naturally fizzy and offers the most benefits, but it tends to be fairly expensive.
Seltzer is plain water with artificial carbonation. Of all carbonated waters, it has the cleanest taste.
Club soda is artificially carbonated water with a few extra ingredients. These ingredients are not harmful and tend to add a slight twist or zing to the water.

, This step is entirely optional. If you want your fruit spritzer to have a little more sweetness than the juice itself, a little sugar or honey should go a long way.

, Do not stir or shake the spritzer together, since doing so will remove some of the bubbles, leaving your juice spritzer flat. Simply wait for a minute or two as the liquids combine naturally.


Note that if you added sugar or honey, you may want to gently mix it in by slowly moving the bottle in a circular motion, causing the liquid inside to slosh around slightly. Stop if you hear rapid ""fizzing"" noises, however.

, Remove the funnel and insert a cork tightly into the top of the bottle to hold in as much carbonation as possible. You can also use any other cap designed to plug or cover a bottle top.

, Pour in the juice, the carbonated water, and the sugar, and plug the bottle with a cork.

, Serve shortly after making so that the spritzer does not lose too much of its ""fizz"" or carbonation.

Place 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of frozen juice concentrate into an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass.,
Slowly pour 8 ounces (250 milliliters) of carbonated water over the concentrate.,
Gently stir the spritzer with a spoon.,
Repeat the procedure with a second spoonful of concentrate.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make a Juice Spritzer2," You can use any flavor juice you want. The juice concentrate must be frozen, but if you cannot spoon out a solid spoonful, you may let it thaw slightly until it is soft enough to work with.

, Seltzer will produce the purest taste, but any type of carbonated water will work. Pour the water directly over the frozen juice, allowing the juice to ""fizz"" or dissolve as you pour.

, Use a slow circular motion and stop once the frozen juice is completely dissolved. Stirring too fast or too long can lead to a drop in carbonation.

, Drop the frozen juice concentrate into a glass and pour seltzer or other carbonated water over it. Stir until dissolved.

, The drink should still be plenty cold from the juice concentrate, but you can add more ice if you want it even colder.

Gently stir the drink with a spoon.,
Split the drink into two separate 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glasses.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make a Juice Spritzer3," Two to four ice cubes should be enough to keep the spritzer cold.

, Use orange juice if you want to create a ""screwdriver"" spritzer, since a screwdriver is a cocktail commonly made with orange juice and vodka. You can experiment with other juices, as well.

, Club soda will give your spritzer extra bite, but seltzer water works just as well.

, A standard shot glass is 1.5 ounces (44.4 milliliters), so you should add approximately 3 ounces (88.8 milliliters) to your juice spritzer.

, Use a slow circular motion, only stirring the drink a few times to combine it. Stirring too fast or too much will destroy too much of the carbonation.

, Pour the juice spritzer and the ice into each glass slowly. Carefully allow the ice cubes to slip into the glass, but do not dump them into the glass since they may create an unnecessary splash upon doing so.

, The longer you wait to drink to spritzer, the more carbonation it will lose.

, The spines are the harder jagged points along the surface of the cactus where the needles grew from. Removing the spines decreases the risk of running across a stray needle, and it also makes it easier to juice the cactus since the hard spines contain no juice.


Steady the cactus with one hand.
Dig the knife or pliers into the cactus under each spine bud.
Gradually push up on the bud from underneath until it comes out.

, Each portion can be juiced, but both parts must be juiced differently. The pads are the flat ""vegetable"" or leaf part of the cactus while the pears are the rounded ""fruit"" of the plant. Cut the pads and pears away from the cactus using a sharp knife.

"

Wash the pads beneath running water.,
Place the pad on a flat counter.,
Transfer the pads to a large bowl.,
Crush the pads.,
Strain the juice out.",How to Extract Cactus Juice2," Lightly scrub the pads with a potato brush under lukewarm water. Scrubbing the pads removes any sand or dirt from the exterior of the pad, but scrubbing too hard may pierce the pad and cause some of the juice to leak out prematurely.

, Cut away any bruised parts of the pad using a small, sharp knife.

, The bowl should be large enough to fit the pads, and it must also have a large enough mouth for you to work with the pads inside the bowl.

, Use the flat top of a hammer-style meat tenderizer or other flat kitchen utensil. Press the tenderizer against the pads, crushing the juice out. Continue pressing until the pads are thoroughly broken and removed of most of their juice.

, The pad pieces should be relatively large, so the juice should not be too pulpy. Simply pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer and into a separate glass or bowl, allowing the solid portions to remain trapped on the other side of the strainer. Discard the solids once you are finished.

, Cut off approximately 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters) from both ends of the fruit, essentially removing just enough to cut away the skin and expose the inner flesh.

, Use a sharp, heavy knife. The slit should only cut halfway into the fruit instead of the entire way through, and it should extend from the top end of the fruit straight through to the bottom end.

, Fill the pot with enough water to cover the fruit by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Bring the water to boil over high heat.

, The fruit needs to simmer until the interior becomes soft and mushy. This may take between 45 and 60 minutes. Check the softness of the interior by inserting a fork through the slit. If it is still hard, continue to simmer it in 10 minute intervals until it softens.

, Allow it to cool to room temperature before attempting to handle it.

, Cut into the slit, slicing the fruit through to the other side.

, It should be soft enough to remove with a spoon by this point. Place the pulp, seeds and all, into the center of a large square of cheesecloth.

, Knot or twist the ends into a tight bundle to prevent any pulp from escaping through the top. Hold the cheesecloth over a large bowl.

, Squeeze the bundle of cactus pulp through the cheesecloth, pushing in a downward motion to direct the juice out through the bottom of the cloth and into the bowl below. Continue squeezing until juice no longer drips from the bottom of the cloth.

, Do not cut all your tomatoes before you begin working. Instead, cut about 1 lb (450 g) of tomatoes at a time. Working gradually helps prevent the juice from separating from cut tomatoes.

, Immediately begin heating the tomatoes on medium-high to high heat, crushing them with a potato masher as you work. The juice that separates out should begin to boil before long.

, Continue cutting the remainder of your tomatoes as you work, and add these quarters to the crushed tomatoes already in the pot. The mixture should be at a rolling boil throughout the entire process.

, Once all the tomatoes have been added and crushed, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low and simmer for five additional minutes.

, Pour the pulpy juice through a sieve or food mill. Alternatively, you can pour the juice through a fine mesh strainer layered with cheesecloth or coffee filters. Any of these methods will be able to remove the skin and seeds.

, Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice per pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.


You could also you straight, food-grade citric acid instead of lemon juice. Use 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) citric acid for every pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.

, Boil the tomato juice again, stirring it frequently to combine it with the lemon juice.

, Salt does not impact how well tomato juice is preserved, so the addition of salt is purely optional. Add about 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt per pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.

Consider which vegetables and fruit will you be juicing most.,
Consider how much time you have.,
If you don't have the patience for chopping and slicing the products, opt for a juicer with a wide feed tube.,
Consider whether you'll be traveling.,
Look at size.",How to Compare Juicers,"


A centrifugal juicer is great at juicing hard fruit and vegetables. It is not so good at extracting high yields of juice from leafy greens.
If you plan to juice mostly leafy greens (spinach, parsley, wheat grass) a twin gear juicer or a masticating juicer is more suitable for this job.;
, If you're you short for time, look for a centrifugal juicer that does the job fast.


A twin gear juicer and a masticating juicer are slower, but they do a more efficient job at extracting high yields of juice.

, This type of juicer allows for juicing whole carrots, beets and apples.

, You can take your juicer along if you purchase a compact juicer. These are so light you can put them in your backpack.

, Are you juicing for the whole family? Skip the compact juicers and look for a powerful motor with a long warranty.

If you don’t have a juicer, you can also use a blender to make juice. Once all the fruit and vegetables have been pureed, you can press the smoothie through cheesecloth to extract the juice.
You can either work from a recipe to make your juice, or you can improvise with some of your favorite fruits and veggies. It’s important to work with fresh produce, because frozen fruits and vegetables won’t juice properly.;
, It’s important to wash fruits and vegetables with clean running water to remove dirt, bacteria, and other residue.Rinse delicate berries, rub soft fruit and vegetables with your hands, and scrub harder produce with a vegetable brush.









When your produce is clean, pat it all dry with a clean towel.

, One of the nice things about juicing is that you don’t have to remove thin skins, cores, stems, and other parts that you normally don’t eat. This is because the juicer will separate and remove these parts for you. However, you do have to remove thicker skins, seeds, and pits from certain fruits and vegetables.








Remove thick skins from fruits like pineapple, mango, papaya, citrus fruits, and melons.
Remove the pits from fruits like cherries, peaches, nectarines, mangos, and plums.
Remove shells from any nuts and seeds that you want to juice.

, Most juicers are designed to handle large chunks of fruit and vegetable, so some produce can even be left whole. Large and medium produce should be cut into more manageable pieces:









For large fruits and vegetables, chop them into two inch (five cm) cubes. This includes things like cabbage, pineapple, and watermelon.
Medium fruits and vegetables, like apples, tomatoes, and beets, should be cut into quarters.
Small and skinny produce like carrots, celery, asparagus, radishes, berries, and kiwis can be juiced whole.

, Juicing machines often come with multiple components. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to put your juicer together. Most juicers follow a similar assembly process, which includes:









Fit the juicing bowl into the center of the juicer. This will catch the produce and separate the juice and pulp.
Insert the auger into the juicing screen and the screen into the holder. Place the assembled component inside the juicing basket.
Place the lid on the juicer, and position a pitcher or cup beside the spout to catch the juice., Turn on your juicer. Take a handful of your first ingredient and feed it into the feed chute. Insert the pusher into the chute and press it down all the way to push all the produce through the screen. Remove the pusher and add another small batch of the same ingredient.









When you’ve finished with your first ingredient, move on to the next.
As you juice, make sure you adjust the speed setting depending on the type of produce you're juicing. Many juicers have different settings for hard, medium, and soft produce.

, To make juice using a blender, combine all the ingredients in the blender. Puree everything together, adding a few splashes of water if you need to loosen the pulp.









When you’ve blended all the ingredients and there are no large chunks left, pour the smoothie into a cheesecloth or fine-mesh strainer.
Position the cheesecloth over a bowl or cup and squeeze the cheesecloth to separate the pulp from the juice.

, Once you’ve juiced all your ingredients, remove the cup or pitcher holding the juice. Give the juice a good stir to mix and incorporate all the different juices.









Serve the juice as is, or chill it for a few hours before serving. You can also serve the juice fresh on ice.
Refrigerate any unused portions and consume within a couple days.

, The fiber contained in the flesh of the fruit or vegetable is removed in the juicing process, and this can lead to spikes in your blood sugar when you drink juice. Because vegetables have less sugar than fruits, it’s better to drink juices that are primarily vegetable-based.


Good vegetables for juicing include carrots, tomatoes, celery, cucumber, spinach, kale, broccoli, beets, cabbage, sweet potatoes, radishes, and peppers.Many vegetables make tasty juices, even if you don’t like eating those vegetables whole.
For slightly sweeter juices, add one or two fruits to your vegetable juices. Fruits like pears and apples will add sweetness without adding a lot of fruit flavor.

, Juices in the grocery store can be pretty basic, and many people often just see things like orange, grape, cranberry, and apple juice. But you can juice just about any fruit or vegetable you like, and the more variety you eat, the more nutrients you'll get.


Fruits like kiwis, strawberries, pomegranates, mangoes, papayas, apricots, plums, and peaches are great juicing candidates.
Bananas, avocados, and other creamy fruits tend to clog juicers.If you want to juice these types of produce, use the a blender to puree the fruit and then strain out the juice.

, Herbs add new flavor and provide additional nutritional benefits to juices. The moisture in seeds and nuts gets converted to creamy substance when the fiber is removed, resulting in a richer juice that's more filling.


Consider adding a fresh flavor to your juice by incorporating fresh mint, lemon balm, rosemary, basil, dill, or other herbs.
Wheatgrass is popular with many juice enthusiasts. Be careful with this, though, because the straw-like texture of wheatgrass clogs many conventional juicing machines.
You can also juice shelled cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, and many other seeds and nuts. When you juice nuts and seeds, it’s important to soak them overnight to ensure you can extract as much from the meat as possible., Ripe fruits and vegetables will taste better and have more nutrients than unripe fruit, making your juice better tasting and be more nutritious. Also, seasonal local fruit will have less of an environmental impact than imported fruit.


Local farmers markets are a great place to get fruits and vegetables for juicing. Many farms also have on-farm markets where you can buy or pick your own produce.
Both conventional and organic produce may be grown with pesticides, so wash your fruits and vegetables well before juicing.

",How to Can Tomato Juice2," You may also use a deep, heavy stockpot if you do not have a canner. Fill the canner halfway with water and gradually begin heating it over medium heat.

, Do not wait for the juice to cool. Moreover, you must only use standard, food-grade glass canning jars, complete with new metal lids and clean metal screw bands. Place a funnel in each jar and ladle the hot juice through the funnel. Fill each jar, leaving only 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of empty space in between the juice and the top of the jar.

,, Twist the metal lid onto the mouth of the jar. Secure the lid in place by tightly screwing the sealing ring over the lid and the jar.

, Use canning tongs, also called a jar lifter, to lower the jars into the water. Place the jars into the hot water carefully, preventing them from touching. The glass jars could chip or break of allowed to clink together.

, The jars should be covered by about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of water.

, Cover the pot and increase the heat to high. Once the water begins to boil, begin keeping track of the processing time.For pint (500 ml) jars, allow the juice to sit in boiling water for 35 minutes.
For quart (1000 ml) jars, allow the juice to sit in boiling water for 40 minutes.
Add an additional 5 minutes onto the processing time if you live at an altitude between 1000 and 3000 ft (305 to 914 m), and extra 10 minutes for altitudes between 3000 and 6000 ft (914 m to 1.8 km), and an extra 15 minutes for altitudes above 6000 ft (1.8 km).

, Use canning tongs to avoid splashing yourself with hot water. Do not tighten the rings and do not allow the jars to strike one another.

, Keep them on folded towels at room temperature. Do not place them in a drafty area.

, Gently press the center of the lid. If the dome does not pop up, the jar is sealed. If it does pop up, you will need to reheat and re-jar the juice.

, Remove the rings before storing them to prevent the rings from rusting.

Use pineapple juice to make a cake from a boxed mix.,
Substitute pineapple juice for oil in quick breads.,
Replace water or milk in a recipe for pineapple juice.,
Reduce the amount of sugar in a recipe when you use pineapple juice.",How to Bake With Pineapple Juice1," Boxed cake mixes are easy enough for even the most novice bakers to make, so you can enjoy pineapple-flavored baked goods no matter what level your cooking skills are at. Simply replace the oil, milk, or water called for in the recipe with pineapple juice in equal proportions.


A yellow or white cake works best, since the pineapple flavor could clash or get lost if you use chocolate or another flavor.
Alternatively, you can use a fruit flavored boxed cake, like orange or strawberry. The pineapple juice will complement the flavor of the fruit already included in the cake mix.;
, A quick bread is any bread made with a leavening agent other than yeast, including baking soda and baking powder. Common examples include banana bread, biscuits, and muffins. If the recipe you use calls for oil, you can replace the oil with equal amounts of pineapple juice to create a sweet, moist bread.


This substitution can taste especially good if the quick bread already has some hint of fruit flavor, such as banana bread or blueberry muffins.

, This works well for most cookie, cake, and bread recipes. Simply replace either the water or milk with pineapple juice in equal proportions.


Note that if a recipe calls for multiple liquids, like milk and oil, you should only substitute the juice for one of the liquids.
When making yeast bread, you generally warm the yeast in milk or water before adding it to the dry ingredients. Replace the water or milk with pineapple juice to create a simple pineapple bread. The pineapple taste may not be especially strong, but there will be a hint of fruitiness.
Replace the milk in a simple pancake batter with pineapple juice. Your pancakes will immediately get a boost of tropical flavor. You can further accentuate this flavor by mixing shredded coconut into the batter, as well.

, Fruit contains a sugar called fructose, so any fruit juice will make a recipe sweeter than milk, water, or oil would. When you choose to replace one liquid in a recipe with pineapple juice, you may also want to consider reducing the amount of sugar you use in the recipe by 1/4 the original amount.

Turn the pineapple a quarter turn a repeat.,
Cut the pineapple into fourths vertically.,
Chunk the pineapple.",How to Make Pineapple Juice1," If your pineapple is under ripe it will be sour. If it is overripe, it may be way too sweet. Picking the right pineapple is the most important step for making delicious pineapple juice.


Smell the pineapple. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's not ripe.
Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it.
Look at the pineapple's color. It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green pineapple is not necessarily unripe.
Be aware that some pineapples are considered ripe when green. Place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance.
Avoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves.
You want the pineapple to be firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it.
While you can use frozen or canned pineapple, fresh pineapples usually produce a better tasting juice.;
, Set the pineapple on your cutting board. You will need a very sharp chef’s knife to peel a pineapple well. Lay it on its side. Place your knife one-fourth inch (0.6cm) below the leaves. Slice until you reach the leaves. Turn the pineapple and repeat until you have cut the top of the pineapple and many of the leaves away in a circle. Lift them up through the center leaves and discard them.


You can use the remaining center leaves to hold the pineapple steady as you cut it.
Some cooks suggest cutting the entire top off. You can do this also, but you should be careful not to let your hand slip from the top of the pineapple. Cutting the pineapple releases a lot of slippery juice.

, Start at the top of the pineapple and slice through the outside peel until you reach the bottom. You can cut in a slight outward facing arc in order to save more pineapple fruit. Turn the pineapple clockwise about two to four inches (five to 10cm) and repeat. Turn, slice and repeat until you have removed the peel and only the eyes remain. Place the pineapple on its side and cut the bottom off horizontally.


Discard the skin of the pineapple in your compost or the garbage can.

, Hold the pineapple vertically and notice how the eyes are arranged in diagonal lines. Removing just the eyes will reserve the largest amount of fruit.

, Cut in at a 45-degree angle just underneath the eyes.

, Cut in at a 45-degree angle in the opposite direction. When you slice this groove into the pineapple, the line of eyes will come free, keeping most of the sweet flesh on the rind.

, Continue cutting from the top diagonal line to the bottom diagonal line, creating long parallel grooves in the pineapple’s flesh. It will start to look like a spiral.

, When you have worked your way around the pineapple, you will have a beautiful spiral pattern and bright yellow flesh., Cut the center core of the pineapple away in a vertical slice. Discard the core. This part of the pineapple is tough and fibrous. It is also not very sweet.

, Cutting your pineapple slices into chunks will help with blending it into juice later. It doesn’t really matter what size chunks you cut, but aim for about 1-inch chunks or smaller.

Bring the contents up to a boil.,
When finished, strain the mixture.,
Simmer the strained liquid until it thickens like maple syrup.,
To serve this drink, put one or two spoons of it into a glass of soda water.",How to Make Tart Cherry Juice1," If you want your cherries on the super-tart side, add less sugar. You can also use a sugar substitute (like Splenda), honey, or agave syrup.


To get the cherry pits out, score them along their sides with a knife. You may be able to pop the pits right out -- or just take a butter knife and wedge them out if they're being difficult.;
, The cherries need time to soak up the sweetness of the sugar. It'll be so tangy that you'll need the water to dilute it later.

, You're looking for one mostly uniform consistency (the cherry chunks will keep it from being entirely uniform).

, Then reduce the heat and simmer for fifteen minutes. It should maintain a light bubble the entire time, reducing the liquid and turning almost syrupy.

, Squeeze all the moisture from the cherries into a separate saucepan. Don't just strain it -- really squeeze out all the juices.


You're finished with the cherries; you can throw them away. Or keep them for a topping or a preserve!

, Then take the pan off, let it cool to room temperature and move it to a sealed vessel for storage in a refrigerator. That's it!


The consistency is right; this is basically tart cherry juice concentrate. It's not supposed to be like juice -- it should be much thicker.

, Sparkling water (or even just water) works, too. Feel free to experiment with the ratio to find your personal taste. It may take a try or two -- but once you find the right combination, it'll be easy.


Keep the rest in a resealable container to save for later. It'll keep for a couple weeks if kept tight and in the refrigerator.

Pour your pineapple chunks into a blender.,
Make it a little sweet (optional).,
Add some ice (optional).,
Add water.,
Blend your pineapple.,
Strain your juice (optional).,
Serve.",How to Make Pineapple Juice2," Depending on the size of your blender, you may not be able to use all of the chunks at once. Fill you blender a little less than half way full with pineapple.

, Straight pineapple juice can be very enjoyable, but it is often a little tart. If you have ever had pineapple juice before and enjoyed it, it probably had some sugar in it. Add 2 to 3 tbsp of sugar or honey to give it a little sweetness.

, If you are looking for a chilled slushier drink, add 6 to 8 ice cubs. More ice will create a thicker drink.


If you want your drink chilled but not slushy, simply pour the blended juice over ice and enjoy.

, Add 1 cup of water. If you want very think juice, just add 1/4 or 1/2 cup. Adding water will dilute the taste of the juice slightly, making it smoother and less tart.


You don't actually have to add any water at all, although a little bit of water at the bottom of your blender will help it juice the pineapple chunks.

, At this point, you want to blend until smooth. The blending time may vary depending on your blender and the amount of water and ice you've added. Try blending for 1 minute and then stopping the blender and stir your mixture with a spoon.


After stirring, put the lid back on the blender and blend in 1-minute increments until smooth.

, If you tend to prefer juices without pulp, you may like to strain your pineapple juice before you drink it. Otherwise, it is perfectly fine to drink just the way it is.

, Pour your pineapple juice into a tall chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedges. Pour your juice over ice and add a straw if you prefer.

Put your pineapple chunks into the top of your fruit juicer.,

, Press your chunks down with the lid of your juicer and turn the juicer on. Make sure to hold the lid down and apply gentle pressure until your pineapple chunks go through the juicer.

, Pour your juice from your fruit juicer and enjoy. Because fruit juicers are so efficient, your juice should come out very thin and pure with little need of straining.

To make a piña colada, add 1 oz of coconut cream to the blender. This will add a hint of coconut to your tasty drink without overwhelming it.Add 2 oz of white rum to the blender. This alcohol will give the piña colada the kick you're looking for. For a virgin piña colada, you can skip this step.

Add the cherries (cleaned and pits removed) to a blender.,

Filter the juice with a strainer.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Make Tart Cherry Juice2," About 15 is good if you're just making a glass for yourself; use more if you plan on serving to a group. Or if you just want some for later!


The easiest way to clean and de-pit the cherries is to place them in a bowl, run them under cold water, and strain. Then score the cherries vertically, and remove the pit with the edge of a butter knife.

, If you want some serious tartness, stay away from the sugar. Otherwise, start with about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) -- you can always add more later if you need it.


You can also use a no-calorie sweetener, honey, or agave syrup.

, With no water, your juice will be more like a syrup-y concentrate. Add a bit tablespoon by tablespoon, blending in between. Stop when it reaches the consistency you want.


There will probably be tiny chunks floating around preventing you from having a smooth consistency; this is normal. We'll take care of those in the next step.

, Unless you like your cherry juice particularly pulpy, of course. It's easiest if you have a glass strainer (like one you might use for cocktails) that you can just set over a glass and pour in. This'll remove all the chunks of skin that your blender didn't take care of.


If the result after the straining is still too thick, add a bit more water. Taste it periodically to see if it tastes how you like.

, Et voila! Throw some ice in, a straw, and maybe even a garnish to get fancy. Who needs the stuff from the grocery store when you can whip up your own in jiff?

Invite your guests to start tasting the hot chocolate samples.,
Send guests home with sample bags.",How to Hold a Hot Chocolate Party," To have a successful hot chocolate party, you need to have variety. There are many different sorts of drinking chocolates available, so try to get a good selection from the possibilities. Consider such varieties as:


flavoured hot chocolates (vanilla, mint, hazelnut etc.)
different cocoa level hot chocolate mixes (72%, 60% etc.)
white/milk/dark hot chocolate mixes, powdered chocolate and shavings of chocolate mixes
different country hot chocolate styles; and
different brands, as each brand tastes different.;
, Have urns for hot water, hot milk (and don't forget those who can't consume dairy - have soy/rice milk available also) and cold milk arranged for guests to help themselves to. Place bowls filled with each hot chocolate powder or shavings. Put a sign in front of each one indicating what type of hot chocolate it is and any significant features, such as that it is imported from Switzerland, is allergy-free, is dairy-free, is flavored etc. Provide a teaspoon next to each bowl. If you have a chocolate pot, put it on display or even use it. You should have a variety of hot chocolate already made up in chocolate pots or jugs and hot chocolate that guests can add hot milk or water to along with the chocolate powder or shavings.

, Keep the chocolate theme, as well as having some less sugary snacks available, such as slices of fruit dipped in dark chocolate. Anything that goes well with hot chocolate is perfect! Put side plates out for guests to help themselves and include serving tongs etc. needed to pick up the dainties easily.

, Which one you choose is entirely up to you - cups are more dainty (especially fine bone china), mugs are larger and more meaty and glasses are modern (make sure they are strong and heat-resistant). The French drink hot chocolate in bowls, so you might like to try this idea too!

, Encourage them to try at least 3 different sorts and to compare notes on which they like the most. You might even run a competition for the person who manages to try all of them and who can describe the flavors well; or you can even run a blind taste competition to see if guests can guess the hot chocolate!

, Make hot chocolate sample bags to send guests home with. Label each sample clearly and add some print-outs on the background to each hot chocolate. You could add other goodies too, such as a truffle or two, a book on chocolate and some chocolate recipes. You might even let them take home their tasting cup/mug/glass - consider having specially printed mugs with the occasion and date embossed on each mug.

They work quicker than other options and function as a more hands-off approach to aging whiskey. You won’t need to char wood or store a barrel.DIY kits can be bought online and may also be found in some brewing supply stores. You will need to buy your own whiskey.;
, Find the oak staves in the package. Typically, the directions will indicate that you need one stave for every 350 mL (12 oz) of whiskey. For a standard bottle, you’ll need both pieces of oak in the kit. Drop the oak into the bottle.


An unaged, corn-based whiskey works well here.

, Sunlight will affect the taste of the whiskey. Store the bottle in a cupboard, closet, or similar area at room temperature. Slight changes in temperature will cause the wood to expand and contract, infusing the whiskey with its flavor.

, The oak will rapidly change the taste of the whiskey. You’ll notice the whiskey change color within a day or two. The kit may come with an aging guide, which will recommend a very brief aging period of about a week or two. After this point, the whiskey may taste too woody.

, If the kit comes with cheesecloth, you can use it to strain out any charred flecks of wood. Place the cheesecloth over your glass so the whiskey doesn’t spill. Pour the whiskey over it. Remove the cheesecloth along with the collected debris.

, Bring along the whiskey bottle or mason jar you’ll use to age the whiskey. You need to shorten the wood so that it’ll fit inside the jar. Split the wood into a thin stick. The wood will expand during the aging process, so don’t be afraid to cut the wood very thin or even break the stick into a few strips.White oak is used by professionals to age whiskey. If you can’t get oak, you can try another non-poisonous, chemical-free wood such as maple, cherry, or birch.Get fresh oak from brewing supply stores and home improvement stores. Old oak can also be scavenged sources such as old furniture.

, Take protective precautions by wearing gloves and goggles. Hold the wood in place over the open flame. The temperature you use will change the flavor the wood gives the whiskey. 250-360℉ (121-182℃) creates a sweet, oaky combination. 380-480℉ (193-249℃) leads to a vanilla, toasted flavor. Char the wood until it appears black and shiny on all sides.You can also bake the wood before you char. This can help you get the right flavor profile without depending on charring at the right temperature. Simply let the wood bake in an oven at the desired temperature for three hours before charring.Brewing supply shops also sell pre-charred oak chips.

, Wait for the wood to feel cool to the touch. Keep on the protective gloves or pick up the wood with tongs to protect yourself. Rinse the wood under lukewarm water. Wipe down the wood with a cloth to remove ash and other debris that could get into the whiskey., Place the ingredients into the mason jar or simply add the wood to the whiskey bottle. An average, unaged whiskey works best here. Opt for whiskey of proof 115 or higher, if possible. Higher proof whiskey tends to age better and is used by whiskey companies in their products., Now you must wait for the whiskey to age. Ideally, store the jar in a place where the temperature changes, such as outdoors. Warm days and cool nights cause the wood to change size. Keep the jar out of direct sunlight. At home, you can leave it in a closet, a garage, or similar area.

, Though the small container size means the whiskey will age faster, it’ll still take several weeks to a year to get the flavor you desire. Set up a testing schedule to make sure the whiskey doesn’t over-age. Early on, your batch will likely taste terrible and woody, but stick with it. The pleasant flavors will eventually come out.

, Barrels can be found online or in brewing supply stores. They come in all sizes, from small, liter-sized barrels to big tanks used by commercial manufacturers. Smaller barrels are easier to use and smaller batches of whiskey age faster.


Look for charred white oak barrels. This is the kind of wood used by the professionals. You may also char the inside of the barrel yourself with a blowtorch.

, Find the spigot, which looks like a faucet. Set it in the hole you’ll see on one of the flat ends of the barrel. Next, get the bung, which looks like a cork. Place it nearby.

, If you have a funnel, you can set it in the bunghole, which will be on the rounded midsection of the barrel. Pour in enough water to fill the barrel. Plug the bunghole with the bung. Turn on the spigot for a moment to see if water flows. Afterwards, check the rest of the barrel for leaks. Leave the barrel alone until it stops leaking.It can take a day or more for the barrel to stop leaking.
You’ll have to do this process before every use. When the barrel is not in use, keep water in it to save time.

, Get enough whiskey to fill the barrel. For a small barrel, you’ll need a bottle or two. Opt for an unaged or younger whiskey. Higher proof whiskey ages better, so aim for a proof of 90 or higher., Keep the barrel in a closet, cellar, shed, or other area away from direct sunlight. The barrel will last longer when the temperature stays constant. Spray the barrel with water or pass a damp cloth over it when it looks dry. This will protect the barrel and limit evaporation as the whiskey ages.

, Smaller barrels of whiskey will age faster. Typically, a one or two liter batch will be done in a month or two. The biggest barrels can take several years. Barrels can be used several times, but will take longer to age the whiskey each time.The longer you age the whiskey, the more you’ll lose to evaporation.

, Once the whiskey’s taste is to your liking, remove it from the barrel. You can pour it out one glass at a time as you strain it. Straining is good for removing char and wood pieces. Place a cheesecloth over a mason jar or other storage container. Pour the whiskey over the cheesecloth. Remove the cheesecloth and the debris it has collected.

Serve champagne as a part of another drink or food.",How to Serve Champagne," For a long time, all sparkling wine was referred to as ""champagne"" until many countries chose to apply the ""rules of appellation."" This restored the technical designation of champagne so that it referred only to those sparkling wines grown and made in the Champagne in the Northeastern region of France.


Champagne from the Champagne region continues to be the ""gold standard"" of sparkling wine because the climate is cool and combines with the chalky soil to produce very acidic grapes, ideal for making sparkling wine. Moreover, champagne from this region tends to be aged for years rather than the months of aging allowed for most other varieties.In other regions where sparkling wine is produced, it tends to be referred to as: Cava in Spain; Sekt in Germany; Spumante in Italy; and sparkling wine in Australia, the US, New Zealand, and South Africa.;
, Bottle-fermented champagne and sparkling wine have a more labor-intensive production and the price should reflect this, while carbonated styles should be a lot cheaper. Mostly you get what you pay for with champagne and sparkling wine – so the more you pay, the better the experience.

, Different methods can be used to create champagne, including the method champenoise, charmat, or cube close, which require varied lengths of time of fermentation in the bottle. A less time and labor intensive process is that of carbonating a still wine (known in some places as ""carbonated pop wines""), which can still produce a pleasant sparkling wine., Most, but not all, sparkling wine is white and dry (brut) following the French Champagne style, while others are sweet in the Italian Asti Spumante style. Historically, champagne was a sweet wine, but with changing tastes the drier variety won greater favor; today, there is no right or wrong about preferring either style, it's a personal choice.If you don't want too sweet a champagne, there is a choice of mid-sweet champagnes, such as Chandon Cuvée Riche, which might be the right in-between sweetness and dryness to suit your palate. And if you fancy a little color for your dinner party, there are also some rose sparkling wines (pinkish to red shades), as well as some red sparkling wines from such places as Australia and Argentina.While there is a wide variety available to choose from, some good choices include:


Champagne: Dom Pérignon, Taittinger Comtes de Champagne, and Krug Grande Cuvée.
Spumante: Asti, Franciacorta, and Trento.
Sparkling wine: Schramsberg, Roederer Estate, Domaine Carneros, Tasmanian sparkling wines, and Marlborough region sparkling wines.

, Before you're ready to serve it, keep your champagne (and all wine) in cool-but-not-cold conditions with little direct light and very little variation in temperature. Basements that stay between 40ºF and 60ºF (4ºC-15ºC) are perfect., This allows the cork to remain moist which will help keep the air out and keep the gas in. This is an important factor in maintaining the flavor and bubbles in your champagne., Colder champagne tastes better, but it is also less likely to bubble over when you open it. The ideal drinking temperature is between 45ºF and 48ºF (7ºC-9ºC). If you've got the time, four hours or more in a typically set US refrigerator will be enough to put your champagne into the proper range.But the classic way to chill champagne is in an ice bucket. Champagne buckets are frequently larger than other wine chilling buckets to allow for more water and ice. You should fill the bucket with half water and half ice and let it chill for 15-20 minutes before serving., The traditional champagne flute – a tall, narrow glass – will preserve carbonation best. A wine glass with a slight belly-bulge at the bottom will allow more of the nose of the wine to accumulate without providing too much loss of carbonation. A champagne coupe is a wide mouth glass seen most often in the champagne glass pyramids at weddings. These are not ideal for the dry champagnes that are popular today, as they give up lots of the carbonation and do not maintain the vapors as well for the pungent aroma part of the experience.Despite the less ideal shape of the champagne coupe, a champagne pyramid can be an incredibly exciting and beautiful way to present champagne where you have a large party to entertain, such as at a wedding or an office function, so perhaps use the sweeter or cheaper champagne varieties for such a presentation. If making a champagne pyramid, get help from people who know how to build it because it requires precision and great care to succeed.

, To pop the cork of a champagne bottle quietly and safely, first you need to loosen the muselet (the wire cage that fits over the outside of the cork), but don’t remove it completely. Then hold the champagne bottle at a 45̊ angle and begin rotating the base of the champagne bottle. Keep doing this until the cork.At this point, the cork will start coming out on its own and you should be able to continue putting pressure on the cork/muselet while the cork slowly pops out with a quiet fizz sound.

, If you are serving champagne in a restaurant setting, it is common practice to present the bottle to the host of the party you are serving with the label facing them so they can read inspect and read the bottle.You may also serve a small sample to the host for their approval before dispensing the champagne to the other guests.


You should serve your customers in a clockwise fashion.

, The pouring aspect is very important because if the champagne is poured incorrectly, it can lose its distinctive bubbly taste. To correctly pour champagne, you should hold the bottle with one hand firmly at the base with your thumb in the punt (the depression) and spread your fingers out along the body of the bottle.Pour the champagne against the side of the glass rather than directly into the bottom. This will help the champagne maintain more of its bubbles.Additionally, remember that many bottles of champagne are stored in dank cellars that are less than spotless as far as clean storage conditions go. For this reason, you should never let the bottle touch the glass in any way as you pour.

, When you read pairing notes for a wine, don't be too swayed by having to follow ""the rules"" religiously, as personal tastes vary considerably. However, in general you'll find that champagne varieties pair well with cheeses, shellfish, lobster, shrimp and crab (in light sauces), oysters,sashimi, salmon roe, fish cakes, tempura, poultry, Asian foods, dishes with basil and coriander in them, soy, wasabi, and desserts, including, of course, wedding cake.The effervescent ""bubbliness"" of champagne means that it also tends to match well with crunchy foods. As well as considering suggestions, always be willing to try other combinations and see how they work for you personally.


Dry champagne styles can be used as a palate cleansing aperitif, such as after eating salty snacks or sushi. Or, finish a meal with champagne to cleanse the palate, rather than having dessert.
Champagne and sparkling wines are a good combination with rich and creamy food because of the strong acidity of the wine, especially dry champagne styles.
Mid-sweet champagne styles aren't great matches for food unless it's sweet dessert or afternoon tea style food. Perfect for garden parties!
Very sweet sparkling wine styles (carbonated pop wines and very sweet spumantes) are best for drinking for fun, adding to punch, and enjoying with ice cream or gelato.
Rosé styles contain tannin and are good for matching with rich fish dishes, such as ocean trout or salmon. Serious red champagne styles (bottle-fermented, not the carbonated pop wine style) are great matched with red meat, game, and turkey dishes.

, Champagne can also be made into champagne cocktails, paired with a range of liqueurs and spirits that result in a mixed drink or even used in cooking or baking. It's just another twist on a way to serve your champagne, although it's probably best to reserve this serving use for less esteemed champagnes!


For example, to make a very simple champagne cocktail, place one sugar cube in a champagne glass, add 5 drops of Angostura bitters, then fill two thirds with chilled champagne. Garnish with a slice of orange or a strawberry half. If you use slightly less than two thirds a glass of champagne, then you should get approximately five cocktails from one standard champagne bottle.Make champagne sorbet for dessert.And if you have flat champagne, don't let it go to waste! Try making champagne cake, a brilliant solution to using leftover champagne in a tasty way."

Gather and sanitize all the items listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" below.,
Mix approximately 3.5 pounds honey with 1 gallon (3.8 L) distilled water.,
Rehydrate your chosen yeast per the manufacturer's directions then add it to your must.

,
Put in a large container with plenty of room for fermentation to occur.,
Put in a quiet place at an optimal temperature range for your chosen yeast.,
There are a few different ways to know when the mead is done fermenting:The most accurate way to know is to measure the specific gravity with a hydrometer when you first mix it, then measure it every two weeks.,
Once the fermentation has completed, transfer your mead to a container with little to no headspace for aging.,
Transfer the mead into bottles, seal, and store in a cool dark place.",How to Make Mead," Anything that will touch the mead-in-the-making should be sanitized first. The environment you are creating to encourage fermentation can also encourage the growth of any microorganisms left behind from inadequate sanitation. You can use a weak bleach solution (remember to rinse well) but it is better to use a sanitizing solution that can be found at any beer or wine-making store (and online).;
, DO NOT HEAT OR BOIL. There is no need to do this with an FDA regulated honey and clean drinking water. Boiling used to be done to drive off germs and bacteria in the water, honey is naturally anti-bacterial.


This mixture, by the way, is called ""must"".
Adding fruits or spices to the must will drastically change the flavour, and just about anything can go with a mead. It's really fun to experiment with flavours as a home-brewer!

,, If there isn't enough space, a vigorous ferment can escape and cause a mess. You'll want to prevent air from getting into the container, but carbon dioxide needs to be able to escape. One way to do this is to poke a few holes in a balloon and then stretch it over the mouth of the bottle. Secure it by putting a rubber band or tape around it. This, however, is not a very good way to seal your mead as you can not add nutrients or aerate very well with the balloon in place, requiring the balloon to be replaced several times. The best method is to purchase an airlock from a local brew store or online as they are reusable, sanitizable, and won't disintegrate over time.

, This information should be published by the manufacturer. If you have a hydrometer and know the starting gravity of your must, you can determine the sugar breaks of your fermentation. To determine your three sugar breaks, take your original gravity, determine what your final gravity should be based on the ABV tolerance of your yeast, then break that total number into thirds. Aerate (introduce oxygen) at least once daily during the first sugar break, the more times a the better.

, The chosen yeast has a published ABV tolerance, and the hydrometer reading can be used to determine what the final gravity of the mead should be. When the mead reaches this gravity, wait a minimum of 4-6 months before bottling to ensure all CO2 that was in suspension in the mead has degassed. If the mead has not properly degassed and too much CO2 for the rating of the type of bottle the mead is bottled in is transferred, there is a risk of bottle explosion with temperature swings.
Wait at least 8 weeks. The amount of time it takes for the mead to ferment will depend on a variety of factors, but 8 weeks should be enough time for most scenarios.
If you're using an airlock, wait until 3 weeks after it stops bubbling.

, The less surface area that oxygen can get to, the better. Siphoning is the best way to go so that you leave as much sediment behind as possible. The longer you wait, the better your mead will be, an average wait time is 8 months to a year for a home brewer.

, Your mead is now drinkable, but it is even better when aged even longer.

Prepare.,
Purchase all the items required.,
Present it well.,
Wait for all guests to arrive before digging in.,
Get comfy!,
Watch a film or some TV.,
When all is finished, take some time to relax and have a few light snacks and refreshing drinks.",How to Have a Chocolate Night In," Invite friends or even family around beforehand, and plan where the chocolate night will take place in the house. Its probably best to take place somewhere where there will be a TV - or at least comfy chairs and lots of atmosphere!;
, Buy sweet, sugary snacks for everyone to enjoy. This includes:




Hot chocolate
Slushie drinks
Tea
Sugar (to add to drinks)
Full fat cream/gold top milk
Chocolate chunks
Popcorn
Big multiple chocolate bar
Chocolate milkshake
Whipped cream
Chocolate sprinkles
Marshmallows
Chocolate flakes



, Before the guests arrive, make sure you have good presentation. Take a few snacks, like a bowl of popcorn and chocolate milkshake for each. Present each item on a table or on a tray. Keep the rest in the kitchen and bring in when necessary.

, Eat a few popcorn or something while you wait, though.

, There is no point in getting all this ready if you are going to be uncomfortable!

, Perhaps your favourite soap to keep your minds occupied? Watching a soap will enable you to discuss what you think will happen next afterwards, too. Watching a film or another programme can be just as excited, too.

, If guests are staying the night, you could each take a bowl of marshmallows to bed to feast on during the night? It all depends on how you've planned the night - if you were going to stay up to very late hours, then you'll probably need more food and drink, more films, more music, and more things to keep you occupied. But if guests go home early, be sure to invite them back again another time! The fun never stops as long as you want it to stay!

Drink straight vodka.,
Try flavor-infused vodkas.,
Combine vodka with low-calorie mixers.",How to Make Low Calorie Vodka Drinks1," This is the simplest choice. It doesn’t get any lower calorie when it comes to vodka than to drink it straight. Because this option requires absolutely no other ingredients, you won’t need to worry about having a stocked refrigerator or pantry—just pour and enjoy!


There are a couple of common ways to enjoy vodka straight. You can drink it very quickly, as a shot. Or, you can put it over ice and sip it (this is called ""on the rocks"").
For even fewer calories, consider brands that market a lower calorie vodka. Skinny Girl Cocktails makes a few different reduced-calorie vodkas. A 1.5 ounce serving has 75.6 calories, compared to typical vodkas which have 96 calories per 1.5 ounce serving on average.This can definitely add up!
Do note that most reduced-calorie liquors achieve lower calories by reducing the proof. So, you would need to drink more to achieve the same effects as regular liquors. But, depending on the reason for your alcohol consumption, this may not matter to you.;
, Flavor-infused vodkas are flavored vodkas without any extra calories. Many brands of vodka sell infused varieties, including Belvedere, Burnett's, and Gray Goose, and it’s been a trend for years in the vodka world to come out with different flavors of infused vodkas.


Infused vodkas can make for a more flavorful and interesting experience when drinking vodka straight and can also eliminate the need for various traditional higher-calorie mixers like juice. Many of the infused vodkas sold in stores are infused with things you might expect, like lemon or berries or cucumber. But there are also exotic infusions like horseradish, bacon, and smoked salmon.It’s also very easy to make your own infused vodka! You can use most types of fresh fruits and vegetables. Some people even infuse their vodka with coffee beans. Simply place your flavor in a canning jar and pour vodka inside. Wait a few days and then strain the liquid out and voila: flavored vodka!You can make your own delicious watermelon-infused vodka. Fresh watermelon or watermelon-flavored candy will do the trick.

, Diet Coke and other diet sodas are popular mixers that add zero calories to vodka. Other common options are light cranberry juice, diet iced tea, diet lemonade, and lime juice.Because the calories in vodka tend to be pretty standard across the board (unless you opt for reduced-calorie vodka) the only way to have a cocktail without a lot of calories is to be mindful of what you mix in with your alcohol.
Sugar is the main culprit for calories in mixed drinks. This is why so many of the options for low-calorie mixers are low in sugar or have switched out the sugar with a sugar substitute like Stevia or Sweet'n Low. There’s even sugar-free Triple Sec.
If you’re using mixers that do have a fair bit of calories, simply use less. It may end up tasting different that you’re used to, but it may still be delicious. However, using a small amount of a caloric mixture doesn’t have to affect the taste. In fact, a traditional vodka martini uses dry vermouth but uses so little that it doesn’t make the drink very high in calories.

",How to Make Low Calorie Vodka Drinks2," Add a shot to vodka to an 8 oz. glass with ice; then fill with fresh club soda. Top with two squeezes of your favorite flavor of Mio, stir, and garnish with a lemon.The fresher the club soda, the more bubbles you will get!

, Make Crystal Light in your preferred flavor beforehand and put it in the fridge for a few hours. Place ice into an 8 oz. glass, add a shot of vodka, then fill with Crystal Light. Squeeze a lime wedge in and stir.Crystal Light only has 5 calories per serving and comes in a variety of flavors (lemonade, strawberry, orange, etc.), so you can tweak this drink depending on your mood or your individual taste buds.

, In a blender combine 1/2 cup of ice or several ice cubes, 8 oz. Minute Maid Light Raspberry Passion, and 1.5 oz. vodka. Garnish with fresh raspberries.This drink only has 115 total calories, so you can splurge on two!

Mix two parts alcohol to three parts punch.,
Add some optional fruit garnishes and serve.",How to Quickly Make an Alcoholic Party Punch1," Hawaiian Punch brand fruit drink or any generic equivalent fruit punch is the easiest ""base"" to mix alcoholic punch. It covers a lot of alcohol well and still maintains a smooth taste when mixed. It’s also very flexible and can be blended with a lot of different types of alcohols and/or fruit juices.;
, Hawaiian punch mixes well with just about any alcohol. Remember, this isn't an exact science, so play around with what you like. Some types of alcohol you can try mixing include:


Vodka
White rum
Fruit schnapps (watermelon, strawberry, peach, etc.)
Champagne
Southern Comfort

, In a bowl, add a generous amount of ice and pour measured quantities of fruit juice and alcohol into the bowl. Adjust for taste.









If you use Everclear grain alcohol, only add five or six shots per gallon of punch.

, Jazz up your punch with lemon or lime slices, or skewer pieces of fruit such as pineapple, watermelon, orange, or cherry on a toothpick and put one in each glass.

Gather Supplies.,
Mix the ingredients.,
Chill in a carafe or large pitcher and serve.",How to Quickly Make an Alcoholic Party Punch2," Sangria, which originates in Spain, is a classic wine punch that tastes delicious and will add a flair of the exotic at your next party. The classic combination consists of wine, chopped fruit, and brandy, but you can easily leave the brandy out for a quick combination to make at home. When pressed for time, you can leave out the sweetener and sugar and rely on the tart but fruity flavor of cranberry juice to give your drink sweetness and body. All you need to add to that is red wine and your favorite fruit. The best ratio consists of:


1 bottle of your favorite red wine. No need to splurge on expensive wine, because the flavors will be heavily masked by the juice and fruit. White wine can be used instead, in which case the result is often called sangria blanca. White wines tend to be sweeter and, therefore, you can adjust the mixer to taste.
1 - 2 cups fresh fruit pieces, such as orange, lemon, lime, apple, peach, melon, grapes. Cube the fruit into about half an inch pieces so it mixes well with the liquid while still keeping its substance. Experiment with different types of fruit and how they flavor the sangria. Fresh fruit will hold up best after long saturation in the liquid, maintaining a bit of crunch to keep the drink interesting.
2 cups of a mixer to dilute the wine. Any fruit juice or carbonated beverage can work, but be careful to consider the sweetness vs. the flavors of the fruit and wine.
For an even more festive treat, add a carbonated beverage, such as 7 Up or Sprite, or seltzer water to give your drink a pleasant fizz. If you’re going to use a carbonated beverage, be sure to wait until just before serving to mix this in, as the bubbles will quickly dissipate.

, Empty the bottle of wine into a large container, and add the fruit pieces. Combine with the mixer to taste; it should maintain the taste of the wine, but be less noticeably alcoholic.








, Immediately before serving, add ice to your carafe so the drink stays cool. Because of the fruit pieces, your choice of container is slightly more important than with other punches. A lid or other strainer will help you regulate the ratio of ice and fruit pieces in each glass. In Spain and other parts of Europe, sangria is often served with a wooden spoon to help get fruit out of the bottom of the punch bowl.

Having concocted the delicious combination of iced tea and lemonade at home, he began ordering it in bars and the drink quickly caught on. A Spiked Arnold Palmer has three simple ingredients: iced tea, lemonade, and bourbon. The best ratio is 4 parts tea and 4 parts lemonade to 1 part bourbon, but the drink is very forgiving, and can be scaled up based on the size of your crowd.

, Add 5 regular tea bags to 4 cups boiling water. Let steep for 5 minutes before discarding tea bags. If you don't want to make the tea, you can buy it pre-made.

, To prepare lemonade from scratch, squeeze the juice from 8 lemons. Combine with 1 ½ cups sugar and up to 6 cups water, adjusting to your desired sweetness. Chill until you plan to serve. If you don't want to make the lemonade, buy some pre-made.

, Combine 4 cups tea, 4 cups lemonade and 1 cup bourbon in a large container. Adjust the ratios to taste.

Swap out the milk for coconut milk.,
Try a banana peel.,
Stir in some peanut butter.,
Splash in some espresso.,
Add a spoonful of caramel.,
Stir in some chocolate chips.",How to Enhance Hot Chocolate1," You probably know that milk makes a creamier hot chocolate than water. However, you may not have thought about swapping out regular milk for coconut milk or cream. It gives your drink a tropical edge, much like your favorite coconut-chocolate bar.You can also add a dash of cream or half-n-half for more richness.;
, This advice may sound a bit crazy, but if you're making a large pot of hot chocolate, try adding a banana peel to it while you cook it. The banana peel will give your hot chocolate a banana flavor. Just toss it out at the end.You can also use orange peel for a similar effect., If you can't get enough peanut butter cups, then this addition is the one for you. Once you've heated your hot chocolate, stir in a spoonful of smooth peanut butter. Make sure to keep stirring until it's well blended. This addition will also make your hot chocolate extra rich.If you don't like peanut butter, you can try any other nut butter. You can even use chocolate hazelnut spread.

, If you're a coffee lover, then a shot or so of espresso can take your hot chocolate to the next level. If you don't have an espresso machine, you can use a packet of instant coffee to similar effect., If you like your hot chocolate sweeter, try adding a spoonful of caramel sauce. It will give it extra flavor and add sweetness. Maple syrup or even a bit of honey will also work to give it a boost of flavor and sweetness., Adding real chocolate to your hot chocolate can make it all that much richer. You can use plain or flavored chocolate chips. You can also use chocolate shavings instead. Either way, make sure to stir them in well. You may need to let the chocolate sit in the hot beverage for a minute or two before stirring."

Say no directly.,
Be polite, but firm.,
Turn down a drink with humor.,
Ask for a non-alcoholic drink as an alternative.,
Repeat yourself.,
Explain your reasons for staying sober, if you want to.,
Change the subject.,
Have an escape plan, if you feel cornered.,
Don't spend time with people who disrespect you.,
Become the designated driver.,
Let your friends know so you have allies.,
Give the host an advance notice, if applicable.,
Prepare a few stock phrases in advance.,
Avoid situations where you know you'll be triggered.",How to Turn Down a Drink," If someone offers you alcohol, the best and easiest response is a simple, ""No, thanks."" Oftentimes people will not push you for a reason and respect your choices. Should the person offering question you, you can try more detailed responses.

For example, you could say, ""Thanks, but I'm the designated driver."";
, Have confidence in your reasons not to drink. Sometimes saying no can make you feel boring. But understanding your reasons for sobriety and standing by them will help others know that you're serious.Complimenting the person can help them respect your decision. You could say, ""It means so much that you'd think of me, but I'm not drinking tonight.""If someone challenges your refusal, you could tell them that you feel uncomfortable when they disrespect your choices.

, Humor can lighten up a situation. You can use jokes to distract your friends from the situation, especially if they don't drop the conversation. Try saying something like, ""Nah, man, I've already had my share. And probably yours, too!"" Or, ""Haha, no thanks. No drink in the world could have enough alcohol to solve my problems.""

Keep your jokes polite and tasteful. Others might feel attacked if you insult them for drinking.

, Having a non-alcoholic drink in hand will make others less likely to offer you a drink. Ask the bartender for your favorite soda, or go for a water if you're cutting back sugary drinks in general. If you opt for a virgin drink (like an Arnold Palmer or Shirley Temple), others will probably not even notice.Many cocktails can be ordered ""virgin,"" or without alcohol. Try a virgin piña colada or daiquiri.

, If someone continually offers you a drink, don't be afraid to sound like a broken record. Restate yourself and firmly tell them you won't be drinking tonight. You don't owe anyone an explanation you don't want to give., Maybe your doctor advised you to give up drinking or you're training for an athletic competition. Maybe you're pregnant and don't want to harm the baby. Whatever your reason, state it calmly and answer any questions you feel comfortable with.

For example, you could say, ""Hey, I appreciate the offer, but I don't drink for religious reasons."" Or you could say, ""You know, I'm a recovering alcoholic and am two years sober. It'd be a shame to break the streak now.""

, Turn their attention elsewhere, if someone persistently offers you a drink. Maybe you could ask if anyone else wants the drink, or you could use the subject of drinks to bring up a new juice cleanse you want to try.

Complimenting is a great means of distraction, as the attention shifts from you to the other person. You could say, for example, ""Wow, you're always looking out for me. You are such a good friend! How are you holding up lately? Did you finish that presentation you were stressing over?"", Prepare a backup plan with your friends beforehand, and involve others in it. Tell a trusted friend or family member about this special event, and ask them if you can call them if you feel pressured. If you're underage, have a code word with your parents. That way, they can pick you up if uncomfortable situations arise.

If your code word is ""third period Biology"" for example, you could call them and say, ""I just met a guy from my third period Biology class here, small world!""

, Friends who don't respect your choices do not have your best interests in mind. Walk away from people who pressure you into drinking, and avoid situations around them that involve alcohol. Make friends with people who accept your decisions, even if they don't understand them., If you're driving to this event in a group, offer to be the designated driver. Having a reason to stay sober will help others respect your decision. Very few people will offer a drink to someone who's driving people home afterward. If they do, you'll have an understandable excuse.

Spend time with other designated drivers when at the party or special event. There is often strength in numbers when it comes to peer pressure.

, Go with a group to this special event, and let them know beforehand you don't plan to drink. You can tell them why if you feel comfortable, or you can just tell them you're cutting back on alcohol. Your friends can offer their support if others start pressuring you.

Choose friends you trust and know will respect your decision. If you have a friend who also doesn't drink, ask them to come.
Don't rely too heavily on your friends' support. You may spend time without them at this event and will need your own motivation.

, Tell the host you do not drink to avoid awkward situations. Your host will them know not to offer you a drink or toast with you. You can avoid hurting their feelings, and they can avoid putting you in an uncomfortable situation., Decide on a few phrases you will say beforehand if someone offers you a drink. If you don't plan a response or two, you might feel tongue-tied when the moment comes. Your response doesn't have to be vulnerable or complicated: even a simple, ""I appreciate it, but no thanks!"" will do., If you think you might be tempted, stay away from people or places you might give into pressure. Drinking when you've decided not to will only hurt your self-respect in the long run. Prevent putting yourself in a compromising situation by avoiding it entirely.Ask yourself personal questions if you feel pressured: why do I want to give in? What will I lose if I have a drink? What's more important: long-term satisfaction or short-term comfort?
Don't let anyone or anything compromise your personal convictions.

Pick out your favorite winter spice.,
Give it a kick.,
Make it adult.,
Pick your favorite extract.",How to Enhance Hot Chocolate2," Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves can all add interesting flavors to your hot chocolate. You can also try cardamom, though go easy on it, as it can be strong. You can add a dash of spice to the mix or pour in a bit of extract to enhance the flavor., While cinnamon might seem a natural addition to hot chocolate, cayenne pepper or chili powder may not seem as natural. However, many cultures add a hint of spice to chocolate. Just a small pinch will do, as you don't want it to be burning hot, just a bit warming., Nothing's quite as warming as a warm drink with a bit of booze, and hot chocolate is no exception. Try adding creme de cacao, Irish cream, or cognac to your hot chocolate, or even a splash of amaretto or raspberry liqueur.A touch of stout can also be a nice addition.

, Another way to add flavor is to simply spike it with a bit of your favorite extract. You could add vanilla, for instance, or a bit of almond extract. Peppermint is, of course, a classic addition to chocolate. You could also try raspberry, banana, or amaretto.

Use a peppermint stick.,
Splash in a couple of cherries.,
Go classic with marshmallows.,
Stick with whipped cream.",How to Enhance Hot Chocolate3," One easy way to make better hot chocolate is to use a peppermint stick or candy cane to stir it up. Leave the stick in there as you drink it. The stick will flavor the hot chocolate with peppermint, plus you get a nice treat at the end., Maraschino cherries aren't just for cocktails and ice creams. They also make a nice addition to hot chocolate. Just stir them in after you've made your hot chocolate, making sure to include a bit of the juice, too., Of course, mini marshmallows are a classic hot chocolate topping. If you want to take it up a notch, try making your own marshmallows. Alternatively, add a scoop of marshmallow cream and toast it a bit with a creme brulee torch.For a s'mores effect, add crushed graham crackers on top of the marshmallows.

, Another classic addition to hot chocolate is whipped cream. You can use the kind from a spray can or from the freezer, or you can make your own. Whichever way you choose, just dollop on as much as you want.


To make your own whipped cream, add heavy whipping cream, a touch of sugar, and a touch of vanilla extract to a bowl. Use a hand or stand mixer to whip the cream until it forms peaks.

The glass should become chilled so it will keep your gin and tonic cooler for longer.If you prefer a less sweet gin and tonic, consider serving the drink in a short, fat glass. This will give you a stronger gin flavor since you'll use less tonic water.;
, Get out a handful of clear ice cubes. Place them in the chilled highball glass. The ice should come almost to the top of the glass. If you have time, consider making your own ice cubes using tonic water. This will prevent the ice cubes from diluting the cocktail as they melt., Measure 2 ounces (60 ml) of gin into the serving glass filled with ice. You can use a 2-ounce (60 ml) jigger or small measuring cup for accuracy. Use your favorite gin or the best gin you can afford. Higher quality gins will have more of a botanical flavor., Get out 1 to 3 lime wedges and squeeze them gently. The juice should squirt into the serving glass. Drop the wedges into the glass with the ice and gin.Choose fresh limes with a bright green color. The lime wedges shouldn't feel mushy or have any brown spots.
For a stronger lime flavor, add all 3 wedges. If you prefer a light lime flavor, just add one.

, Measure 3 to 4 ounces (90 to 120 ml) of chilled tonic water and slowly pour it into the glass. Try to choose a tonic water that contains real quinine instead of artificial flavoring. Pouring the tonic water slowly will help it keep its carbonation longer., Take a swizzle stick and gently stir the the drink. This will combine the juice of the lime with the gin and tonic water. Avoid stirring the drink too quickly or your cocktail may lose its carbonation.If you don't have a swizzle stick, you can use a butter knife or long spoon.

, You can serve the gin and tonic once it's served or add a cocktail straw. For an extra garnish, you could slice a fresh lime wedge and stick it on the edge of the glass.Avoid squeezing the lime wedge before sticking it on the edge of the glass.

, One of the simplest variations on a classic gin and tonic is to substitute lemon for the lime. This gives the cocktail a brighter flavor. If you'd like to make the cocktail even fresher tasting, slice some cucumber to add to the glass.

Lemon also works well with fresh mint, basil, or rosemary. Consider using a few sprigs of these in your drink.

, Use 2 ounces (60 ml) of a gin that has noticeable herbal flavors and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of elderflower liqueur. Pour in 2 ounces (60 ml) of tonic water and 2 ounces (60 ml) of Champagne. Stir the cocktail gently and serve it with a slice of lemon., Make a classic gin and tonic using gin that has a fresh cucumber flavor. You can also use a tonic that's flavored with elderflower.

Find a clean plastic or paper cup.,
Find a cup that is approximately shot-sized.,
Coat the sides of the shot glass with oil if they're not waxy shot glasses.,
Push the smaller cup to the bottom of the big cup—it should fill with water.,

Place the molded frozen shot glass back in the freezer until you're ready to use it.",How to Make Frozen Shot Glasses1," Fill it with the liquid of your choice. As explained in the method above, for a standard ice shot glass, just use water, or try filling it with orange juice or Gatorade for a colorful effect. Or, use a virgin version of the alcoholic drink.;
, Keep in mind that a standard shot glass holds 1.5 oz of liquid. Consider using a plastic shot glass so you can be sure of the volume.

, This will help to ensure that you can pull the cup out later. It only needs to be a very fine layer, either brushed on or dipped.








, Pour out excess water until there is just a lip at the top of the small cup that's exposed. Use toothpicks, duct tape, or a heavy object such as a clean pebble to keep the smaller cup in place (otherwise you'll notice it trying to bob about).








, Leave there until the water freezes solid.

, Pull the smaller shot glass out. If it's waxy or you've oiled it, it should slide out fairly easily.








, This will make it easier to slide the frozen shot glass out. Note: do not use hot water, or the ice may crack. Slightly warmer than room temperature should be sufficient.








, Obviously, only pour cold or chilled drinks into the glass, to avoid speeding up the melting process.








,, Then, fill with your favorite beverage and enjoy!

",How to Make Frozen Shot Glasses2," A specialty party store or a liquor store with drink equipment might be able to assist, or check online for specialty suppliers.

, For a standard ice shot glass, it's usual to just use water. However, you can get fancy here––try filling it with orange juice, cola or Gatorade for a colorful effect (see the third method below for layering). If you know the alcoholic drink you'll be serving, consider matching the colors (unless it's clear, in which case, anything goes). You could also consider using a virgin version of your favorite mixed drink, since the actual alcohol will go in the frozen glass.









If you want, you can put a lollipop or popsicle stick coming from the bottom of each glass. This will help your guests to take the shot without touching the glass, which may turn slightly sticky as it melts, depending on which liquid you used. If you do this, it's recommended to find lollipops with plastic over the candy, and let guests remove this plastic at their convenience, as this is the most hygienic.

,, The shot glasses should pop right out, ready for immediate use.








, Obviously, only pour cold or chilled drinks into the glass, to avoid speeding up the melting process.

Follow the instructions above for the pre-made mold.,
Remove from the freezer and unmold.",How to Make Frozen Shot Glasses3," However, instead of pouring in just water or all one color of liquid, pour in layers. For example, a green, orange and clear layered shot glass would be made as follows:









Pour a third green liquid into the mold. Then freeze.
Pour in a third of chilled clear liquid. Then freeze.
Pour in a third of chilled orange liquid. Then freeze.

, The three layers should now form a complete shot glass. It's a little extra work but it looks very effective. Use as outlined above.

Pour the vodka though a standard water filter.,
Agitate your vodka and keep it in a cool place.,
Filter your vodka two to three more times.,
Allow your filtered vodka to stand briefly.",How to Make Cheap Vodka Taste Better1," The key ingredient in your filter that removes impurities from the vodka is generally a charcoal filter. This kind of filter removes oil and sugar, along with any other impurities, from the vodka that that make it taste less than delicious.Using a small funnel can help you pour your vodka into your filter’s reservoir more easily, resulting in less liquor spilled.;
, Give your vodka a firm swirl after completing each filtration cycle so that impurities are evenly distributed. This will create a consistent taste throughout your filtered batch and prepare it for the next round of filtration.You should also keep your vodka chilled, as colder temperatures will cause impurities to be easier for your filter to catch.While your vodka is dripping through the filter, you might place it in a freezer to help the filter catch impurities.

, Continue to regularly agitate your vodka and keep it in a cold place as you continue to filter. You’ll want to use a clean container for the filtered vodka to collect into, and for best results, you may want to change your filter every few filtration cycles.As your filter strains impurities out of your vodka, its ability to continue to do so diminishes.
While it’s unlikely you’ll need to change your filter after a single filtration, you should pay attention to your “change filter” indicator and swap in a new one when necessary.
For filters without a “change filter” indicator, you may want to use a new filter every two to three filtration cycles for best results.
Remember to swirl each completely filtered batch of vodka to improve its consistency.

, The filtration process causes the composition of the vodka to become disturbed. You’ll want to give your recently filtered vodka some rest time, 15 to 30 minutes should do the trick, before you then use it for drinking.

"
"
Gather your filtration materials.,
Prepare your activated carbon.,
Chill your vodka and prepare a cold place for filtration.,
Drip filter your vodka into your container.,
Prepare for round two of filtration.",How to Make Cheap Vodka Taste Better2," The key to this filtration technique is food safe activated carbon, which can be bought at your local pet supply store. Activated carbon is a substance created to have holes in it smaller than the eye can see, making it ideal for filtering out fine impurities from a substance. You'll want at least three cups (375 g) of this for filtering. It should be relatively cheap to purchase from your local pet store, or you can buy bags in bulk from online retailers for even less. In addition to your activated carbon, you’ll also need:


Cheap vodka
Coffee filters
Colander
Two bottles/containers (larger than the amount of vodka purchased)
Funnel
Strainer/colander, Straight from the bag, your activated carbon will have some dust remaining on it from processing and handling. You don’t want this residue getting into your vodka, so you should remove it from the carbon first by running your carbon under water while in a colander or strainer.Then you should:


Place your activated carbon in a coffee filter. Cone shaped filters that will roughly match the shape of your funnel will make the filtration process easier, but standard coffee filters will work as well.
Put about 2 inches (5cm) of food safe activated charcoal into your filter, and then place the filter inside your funnel.

, The colder your vodka is, the more easily the impurities will be soaked up by your carbon activated filter. You may want to chill your vodka in your freezer beforehand. For best results, you might consider clearing a space in your freezer so the vodka can filter in the cold., Place your funnel firmly into the mouth of your container so that it is stable and will not fall over. Then pour vodka into your funnel until it is ¾ of the way full, though you’ll want to keep the level of your vodka from going over the top line of your filter.If your vodka rises above the filter, there’s a chance that it will trickle between the filter and funnel without receiving the purifying effects of the activated carbon.
It may take a considerable amount of time for your vodka to drip filter through the carbon into your container.

, Filter your cheap vodka until none remains. When the level of your vodka begins to diminish in your funnel, you should add more to continue the filtration process. When finished the first filtered batch:


Move your funnel with its filter and activated carbon securely into your second container to prepare for round two of filtration.
Run your filtered batch through your carbon several times. The more times you pass your vodka through your activated carbon, the more impurities the carbon will soak up from it.
Since fresh activated carbon filters at a better rate, after your second or third filtration cycle, you may want to change your coffee filter and activated carbon.
Don’t forget to rinse your fresh activated carbon to remove any silt or dust from it before using it for filtration.
You should aim to keep your vodka exposed to the activated carbon for a minimum of five minutes to ensure the best results."
"
Gather vodka polishing materials.,
Pour your vodka into your container.,
Add activated carbon straight to your vodka.,
Allow the vodka to soak for a length of time.,
Strain your carbon from your vodka.",How to Make Cheap Vodka Taste Better3," The main ingredient in liquor polishing is activated carbon, though adding your carbon to a full container of vodka may cause your container to overflow. You'll also have to strain the carbon out at some point, so you'll need:


Activated carbon (food safe; 3 to 5 cups (375 - 625 g) depending on amount of liquor being polished)
Container (freezer safe)
Funnel
Strainer/colander

, You'll want a container that is larger than your amount of vodka, otherwise, when you add your carbon, you might lose some vodka to overflow. Place your funnel in the container, and pour your vodka from its original vessel into the container.

, Impurities in alcohol, like aldehydes, amino acids, and oils are likely the culprits making your cheap vodka taste foul. Polishing alcohol is the process of soaking it for a length of time in activated carbon to remove these impurities.


Rinse your activated carbon in a colander/strainer under cold water to remove any dust that may have formed on it during the packaging and handling process.
Add 1 cup of food safe activated carbon per every 4 to 5 liters (1 to 1.3 gallons)., At minimum, you should allow your vodka to soak in the activated carbon you’ve added for a week. For even better results, you can allow the vodka to soak for a month, though after a few months you’ll reach the carbon’s limit and see little change in quality.


Shake the vodka in its container for a few minutes every day to ensure the consistently filtration throughout the mixture.
Keep your vodka in a cold location, like your freezer, to make the impurities in it easier for the activated carbon to absorb., A regular kitchen strainer should be sufficient to catch your activated carbon while letting the vodka drain through into a container. You may want to nest your strainer into your funnel so the vodka flows directly down the nozzle of the funnel and into a container, preventing lost liquor.

Infuse your cheap vodka with other flavors.,
Make cocktails with your cheap vodka.,
Cook with your cheap vodka.",How to Make Cheap Vodka Taste Better4," By adding a new flavor to your vodka you can mask its harsh, cheap quality. This can be done through a process called infusion, where your cheap vodka takes on flavors from other ingredients, improving its taste. Some ideas that you might use to improve your vodka include:



Make chocolate vodka – the sweetness of chocolate will cut the sharp, biting taste of your cheap vodka.

Make Skittles vodka – sugar is often added to vodka to mask its burn. The sweetness of Skittles will mellow your cheap vodka’s harshness.

Infuse the vodka – there are many fruits, berry, and herb infusions you can add to your vodka. Choose your favorite to create a better tasting vodka!, Adding certain mixers to cheap vodka can cut its burn or hide its low quality flavor. Common mixers include sour mix, pineapple juice, orange juice, lemonade, and cola. For a more complete list of vodka cocktail ideas, visit wikiHow's Vodka based cocktail selection.


The ratios you use for different cocktail recipes will vary, but generally you should follow the spirits:liqueur:mixer ratio of three parts to two parts to one part (3:2:1) for more liquor forward drinks, or two parts to one part to one part (2:1:1) for less biting cocktails., When you cook with vodka, most of the alcohol gets cooked off in the process, which disguises its poor flavor. This is why chefs prefer using lower quality wine when cooking. There are many recipes you could use your cheap vodka to make, including:



Vodka sauce for pasta
Seafood cooked in lemon and vodkaDrunken shrimpSunshine bittersHerbal tinctures

"
"
Use materials safe for consumption.,
Leave extra room.,
Prepare the lid.,
Clean and/or sanitize the equipment.",How to Make Alcohol from Common Table Sugar1," You should only use food grade plastic buckets or glass carboys as your fermentation vessel. Make sure that the lid is food grade as well. A 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel will allow for 5.5 to 6 gallon (21 to 23 L) batches. Keep in mind that you may occasionally need to stir the batch, so containers such as buckets are often ideal., You need about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space in a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination., You need to make a hole in the lid that is the right size for a rubber grommet and airlock. Push the grommet into the hole. Then fit the airlock into the top of the grommet. Install a rubber gasket around the lip of the lid to form an airtight seal between the lid and the container., The fermentation vessel (and rubber stopper for glass vessels or lid for a plastic bucket), airlock, and a large spoon should be cleaned and sanitized. Fill the fermentation vessel to the brim with a sanitizer, such as iodophor, that is made for brewing and winemaking. All these items are available at homebrewing and wine-making shops."
"
Determine how much sugar (sucrose) to use.,
Dissolve the sugar.,
Pour the sugar solution into the vessel.,
Add the yeast.,
Wait one day.,
Affix the lid to the bucket.,
Add water to the airlock.,
Let the mixture ferment.,
Stop the process.",How to Make Alcohol from Common Table Sugar2," More sugar will result in more alcohol as long as the yeast can process it all. If you want a weaker batch (less alcohol) you can use less sugar. As a general guide, each packet of yeast will have directions that indicate how much sugar can be used.If making two batches, be sure to use twice as much yeast (two packets).

, Mix the sugar into a pot of warm water to dissolve it. You can use tap water or bottled water. The water should be about 90 °F (32 °C). Use roughly 13 to 17 kilograms (29 to 37 lb) of sugar., When all of the sugar has been dissolved, carefully pour the sugar and water solution into the plastic bucket or glass carboy that you are using as a fermentation vessel. For a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel, pour 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) of solution. This sugar will be broken down by the yeast to produce alcohol.It is not necessary to sterilize the sucrose solution before fermenting, but if desired this can be done by boiling the sucrose solution for fifteen to twenty minutes. Take into account that some of the water will evaporate, so add a little more water before boiling.

, Open the yeast packet and dump the yeast into the sugar water solution. If using a plastic bucket, stir to get an even mixture. Use a sanitized, dry funnel to help prevent a mess when adding the yeast to the narrow opening of a carboy.Use one packet of yeast. More yeast can speed up the process, but it will not lead to a better yield of alcohol.
Do not put the yeast into the sugar water until it has cooled. If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast.

, In the first days of fermentation, the yeast will expend most of its energy multiplying itself. Since this process requires oxygen, leave the lid off for the first 24 hours. If you cut off oxygen to the yeast immediately, the fermentation process will take much longer and may proceed sluggishly., If using a plastic bucket, tightly push the lid onto the bucket so that an airtight seal is formed. This may be somewhat difficult, and may require some leverage. An air tight seal is necessary for proper fermentation.Fermentation is an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) process.

, If you haven’t already, push the airlock into the lid if using a plastic bucket. If using a carboy, now is the time to push the airlock through a drilled rubber stopper and fit the stopper snugly in the mouth of the carboy. Add clean water or vodka to the inside of the airlock so that carbon dioxide can be released from the fermenting solution while air is kept out. The drop in available oxygen will cause the yeast to stop multiplying and start producing ethanol and carbon dioxide., Keep the ambient temperature 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C). This temperature will promote optimum performance from the yeast. It should take about two to ten days for the yeast to produce alcohol. The time required will vary depending on the type of yeast used, and on how much sugar was added. It will take longer to completely ferment more sucrose., The airlock will bubble a lot during active fermentation. The bubbling will slow as fermentation slows, and stop completely when all or most of the sucrose has been fermented. If you are unsure, leave the batch for another day or two. Once the fermentation is over, it is time to purify the alcohol.

"
"
Clarify the fermented alcoholic liquid.,
Siphon or pour off the alcoholic liquid.,
Drink responsibly.",How to Make Alcohol from Common Table Sugar3," After fermentation is complete, use a fining agent such as isinglass to remove suspended yeast and other material that may be present. Try to find isinglass that doesn't contain sulphites, as some people are allergic to sulphites. After adding the finings, reseal the fermenter with the lid or stopper and the airlock and allow the liquid to clarify for two or three days.Use 0.5 to 1.0 gram of isinglass per 5 gallons (19 L) of batch.

, Siphon or carefully pour off the liquid into a glass carboy or other airtight container such as a cornelius keg. Leave the unwanted sediment behind in the fermentation vessel. You can also pour the liquid through a pad or membrane filter, such as a wine filter, to further clarify the liquid and remove residual yeast. Bottle the alcohol to preserve it.Don't store the alcoholic liquid in a carboy for more than a month as it can become oxidized over time.
Filter through a carbon filter if desired. Use a food-grade carbon filter to remove unwanted volatiles to further purify the alcohol. If flavors were added before this point, don't use the carbon filter because it will most likely strip out the flavors.

, Add your alcohol directly to jungle juice or add liqueur flavorings. You can also age the alcohol in sealed bottles to improve the flavor, especially if making liqueurs. New bottles can be found at home brewing shops.


Reuse liquor bottles, wine bottles, and beer bottles, or use mason jars.

Add a bacterial starter of 6 to 8 ounces/180-235ml of active fresh cultured buttermilk to a clean quart jar.,
Fill the rest of the jar with fresh milk.

,
Screw the lid on securely.,
Let it sit out in a warm part of the room until thickened, which should take about 24 hours.,
Check to make sure the thickened buttermilk coats the glass.",How to Make Cultured Buttermilk1," Use 6 ounces/180ml if you are certain of the freshness of the starter. When in doubt, use a full cup of buttermilk as starter.;
,, Shake thoroughly to mix. Label it with the date.

, If you find it takes longer than 36 hours, the starter was no longer active (the bacteria had died). The buttermilk may or may not be tasty if it takes longer than 36 hours but it can still be used for baking.

, This happens because the bacteria have fermented the milk, and the lactic acid is causing the milk proteins to thicken. Refrigerate immediately

Gather the ingredients.,
Soak the almonds in water overnight.,
Blend the almonds in 4 cups of fresh spring or filtered water.,
Sweeten to taste if desired.,
Strain.,
Store.,
Use.",How to Make Almond Milk1," You'll need:


1.5 cups or 220 grams of raw almonds (unsalted, uncooked)
4 cups or 940 milliliters of filtered or spring water, plus water for soaking
1 vanilla bean; scoop out the seeds; alternatively, use 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence or extract;
, Do this for at least 8 hours, up to about 12 hours. The soaking softens them well for use, but is optional. Drain the water from the almonds.

, Add the vanilla extract and continue blending until well mixed.


You may find 4 cups a little too watery; if this concerns you, try 3 to 3.5 cups and add more if needed.

, If you want to sweeten the almond milk, add rice syrup, honey or other reasonably healthy sweetener, to taste.

, This is very important or you will be drinking almond pulp as well as the milk. Using something like a very fine strainer or sieve, or several layers of cheesecloth (muslin), pour the almond milk through the filter into a large bowl underneath. The filter will retain the almond pulp and the liquid will go through.


Squeeze the remaining pulp to remove the last of the liquid. It is easier if done using a cloth; otherwise, use your very clean hands.
The almond meal left over can be dried and used to add more fiber to your diet.

, Almond milk can be kept in the refrigerator for 4-7 days, covered. It will usually need shaking before serving, to remix the liquid.

, Almond milk can be used with a range of foods where you would use dairy milk, such as for cooking, for cereals, for drinking, etc. Those who love almond milk often find drinking it is best.

, Choose the unbruised and best fruit for this purpose. Try the fruit so you can ensure it is sweet and delicious.









Purchase one quart (1 liter) of berries for strawberry tequila.
Buy three large jalapeños for jalapeño tequila.
Use half a ripe pineapple for pineapple tequila.
Get ten limes or lemons if you want to infuse citrus rinds.
Use three mangoes or stone fruit for mango tequila or peach tequila.

, Purchase a small to medium bottle of 100 percent agave tequila so that it is smooth and lacks a lot of additives. Blanco, reposado and anejo tequila all work well with infusions.









Blanco tequila will work best if you are planning to use it in a cocktail, like a margarita.
Try anejo if you want an infused sipping tequila. The aged taste may require a more precise pairing of flavors.

, If you want to do several smaller infusions, you can try eight to 16 oz. (0.25 to 0.5 l) canning jars and split your bottle of tequila between two or three containers. Run the jars through the dishwasher to sterilize them.

You could try do this with a simple test in a clinic. Do not drink milk if you feel sick after it. Don't do something if you feel it's not right for you.
, Milk at room temperature will smell considerably worse than ice-cold milk straight from the fridge.

, If you're drinking full-fat milk, you might find semi-skimmed or even skimmed far more suitable. Many people can drink one, but find another to have a stronger or different taste. You could even try soy milk, coconut milk or some other variant, depending on the use.

, Can you make it taste less like milk by adding something delicious such as milkshake powder, a syrup, a juice, or even mashed up or blended fruit? Use whatever delicious food item you can find in the pantry or on the buffet table to make it taste better!

, Juice, or even mashed up or blended fruit? Use whatever delicious food item you can find in the pantry or on the buffet table to make it taste better!


If you have milkshake powder, mix in about half a teaspoon more than advised on the packet, to disguise the taste as much as possible.
Your favorite chocolate melted into milk can be really delicious and it may not even taste like you're having milk at all. Of course, this is not such a healthy breakfast option!
For those who don't like chocolate, try strawberry syrup. The benefit is red milk and a good taste!

, Try pinching your nose when you drink it; this may help to lessen the taste impact.


Try to get it to go straight down your throat, and don't let it linger in your mouth. It will taste a thousand times worse if you leave it to swill around your mouth.
Or, be really cheeky and promise to consume your milk if it's ""inside"" a cake or a cookie (the ultimate ""masking"")!

, For example, dunk it in bread or cookies and let them soak up the milk.

, Pour as little as possible onto your cereal and use the smallest glass possible for drinking from. Taking the least amount possible will reduce the unpleasantness.


Only consume about a teaspoon of liquid at a time. That way, the taste will not be too offensive, and it will be confined to a smaller area of your mouth.

, If you drink it quickly, then eat something you do enjoy, this will help to get rid of the taste. For example, drink the glass of milk, then eat the cookies or apple straight after.

, If you are being forced to consume milk on the grounds that it's good for your growing bones or calcium intake, find a substitute and have a clear-headed discussion with your parents, spouse, doctor, nutritionist, etc., about the benefits of changing to non-dairy milk or substitute drinks. Many soy, rice, and oat milk substitutes for example come fortified with calcium and other necessary daily nutrients.

You can accomplish this task by using either a potato peeler or a sharp knife with a smooth blade.;
, The bottom and top stem are hard, inedible parts that you should not attempt to turn into juice.

, The pieces can be up to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in height, width, and depth. Smaller pieces will also work, but you should avoid using pieces that are much bigger than that.

, You should leave a couple of inches in between the top cucumber pieces and the rim of the machine. Do not fill the food processor to the top.

, Run the machine for approximately two minutes. The mixture should be pulpy, but it does not need to be smooth.

, The strainer should be small enough to fit inside the mouth of the bowl, but if possible, you should use a strainer with a wide enough rim to rest on top of the brim of the bowl. By resting the strainer on top of the bowl, you free up both hands.

, Bring the water and sugar to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Once it boils, the sugar should break down into the water, making it a little thicker.

, Turn the heat down to medium-low or medium and simmer the mixture for approximately 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Heating the cucumbers together with the water and sugar combines the flavors more thoroughly than mixing them cold.

, Allow it to cool slightly, at least until it stops bubbling and steaming.

, Blend it on a high speed until it resembles a puree with very few noticeable chunks of cucumber remaining. Blending releases more of the juice trapped inside the cucumber.

, The cheesecloth should be large enough to drape over the sides of the bowl.

Place enough chopped wheatgrass into the mortar to fill the bottom.,
Grind the blades.,
Add a little water.,
Empty the contents of the mortar into a clean muslin cloth.,
Press on the cloth to drain the wheatgrass juice out into a clean glass.,
Return the wheatgrass clump to the mortar.,
After your initial batch of wheatgrass turns white, add fresh chopped wheatgrass to the mortar and begin the grinding process again.",How to Juice Wheatgrass2," Do not fill the mortar more than 1/4 full. If it's too full, then you won't be able to fully grind it.;
, Use the pestle to thoroughly grind the blades until they begin to stick together and smear along the bottom of the mortar. Apply the pestle using a stirring motion, and press with enough force to crush the grass. This will take a few minutes, and more than a bit of effort, so be prepared.

, Equal parts water should be sufficient for this method. Mash the water into the crushed wheatgrass using the same forceful stirring motion as described above. Continue mixing until a fine paste forms. The water will help you sufficiently grind down the blades of grass.

, Twist the top of the cloth to prevent the paste from escaping, but do not tie it. This will allow you to extract the juice from the wheatgrass.

, Apply pressure to the cloth directly above the clump of wheatgrass paste, squeezing in a downward motion. A bright green liquid should drip out. Continue squeezing until no further liquid drains.

, Repeat the grinding process until the blades turn white, adding a little extra water each time to create a paste of the same consistency.

, Continue until your full 1/2 cup (113 grams) has been used. This process does take a while, (at least 10-15 minutes for 1/2 a cup), but it'll be worth it. It's much better than paying $300-$400 for a fancy wheatgrass juicer.

Put 1/2 cup (113 grams) of chopped wheatgrass into a blender with 2 to 3 cups (500 to 750 milliliters) of filtered water.,
Blend the wheatgrass and water together using the highest speed.,
Place a mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl.,
Line the strainer with cheesecloth.,
Pour the wheatgrass from your blender through the cheesecloth and strainer.,
Using a rubber spatula, press down on the wheatgrass pulp to squeeze out additional juice.,
Squeeze juice from a lemon half into the bowl of wheatgrass juice.,
Transfer the wheatgrass from the container into glasses to enjoy.",How to Juice Wheatgrass3," If you prefer a stronger, more concentrated taste, stick with only 2 cups (500 milliliters) of filtered water. If you are unaccustomed to the taste of wheatgrass, however, or if you find it overpowering, dilute the juice more by using 3 cups (750 milliliters) of water instead. If you like, you can substitute the water with fresh-squeezed orange juice or coconut juice instead. This can give the wheatgrass shot you'll be preparing a bit more flavor.

, Blending for about 60 seconds should suffice. You should be left with an emerald green juice with chunks of pulp floating at the surface.


Note that the grass may get tangled around the blades of the blender if the blades of grass are too long. This will not be an issue in most cases, and you can simply clean the blades of your blender after you finish getting the juice out. Pay attention to possible signs of trouble, though, like a slowing blade or the sounds of a struggling motor. If you suspect that the wheatgrass is clogging your blender, you may need to fish out the wayward wheatgrass before you continue blending.

, The strainer should have fine gaps, and it should be no larger than the mouth of the bowl you place it over.

, The cheesecloth should be large enough to hang over the sides of your strainer.

, Most of the liquid should flow through without much effort on your part.

, This juice should also flow through the cheesecloth and into the container. Continue pressing down on the wheatgrass until no more juice comes out.

, The lemon is only optional, but it enhances the flavor of the wheatgrass while preserving the juice a little longer. Mix with a spatula or spoon to combine. This can be especially useful if you stick to water instead of using juice for your blended mix.

, Serve it chilled or with ice. Wheatgrass can be best enjoyed in shot form.

Feed the wheatgrass into the juicer.,
Pour the juice from the juicer into a glass and enjoy.",How to Juice Wheatgrass4," Prepare as much chopped wheatgrass as you want to use. You'll need to feed it into your juicer.

, Every juicer is different, so you'll have to set it up according to the instructions in your manual. Manual wheatgrass juicers can look a bit like meat grinders, and tend to include a handle that you grind, along with a pestle-type implement to push the grass down. Manual wheatgrass juicers can sometimes only be really used for wheatgrass, so if you splurge on a juicer, you may want to get an electric juicer so you can use it for juicing other vegetables as well. Electric juicers blend the grass more easily, but they require a bit more cleanup.If you get an electric juicer, make sure you get a masticating one. A centrifugal juicer will not juice wheatgrass at all.

, Now, just feed the wheatgrass into the juicer. For most juicers, you'll have to fill them a little bit at a time, so you don't cram the juicer and make it difficult to juice the wheatgrass. The juicer will then have a place for the juice to be collected, as well as a place for the pulp to go.

, You should be all done juicing your wheatgrass. Though a juicer for wheatgrass or a juicer in general can get a bit pricy, if you're really committed to juicing wheatgrass regularly, it can make a real difference in your life. After you pour it into a glass and enjoy a portion of delicious wheatgrass juice, all you have to do is clean up your juicer and you're all done.

Obtain good quality bar chocolate.,
Prepare the chocolate.,
Melt the chocolate.,
Add flavourings.,
Increase the heat to medium.,
Served in small cups or large mugs.",How to Make Hot Chocolate1," Companies such as Scharffen Berger, Green & Black's, Perugina, Ghirardelli, and Guittard all make excellent chocolate bars. For white chocolate lovers, Perugina is an excellent choice.









You can also find flavoured solid chocolates, which can be delicious.
If you start with chocolate at the sweetness you prefer, you do not need to add additional sugar. You can also start with unsweetened chocolate, and add sugar to taste.;
, Using a sharp knife (serrated knives work well for this task), chop the chocolate into chunks. The finer the chop, the quicker the chocolate will melt.









The basic recipe calls for about 1-1/2 ounces (50g, or 3 tbsp) chocolate per 8-ounce cup. Adjust this up or down depending on how rich you like your hot chocolate. You can add more chocolate per cup, or less milk per cup—the choice is yours, depending on how much you love your hot chocolate!
It is actually not necessary to chop the chocolate. A small piece can be melted in the milk. A nice tool to use to mix it with is a wooden spoon with loose wooden rings, as is often used in Mexico.

, In a 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the chocolate with 1 cup (250ml) milk, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is fully melted.









Don't leave the stove unattended because milk and chocolate can burn easily.
An alternative to direct heat is to use a double boiler. Place a small pot of water on high heat and put a metal bowl on top. Add the chocolate and stir until fully melted. Add cream at 1:1 to the chocolate and stir, effectively making a ganache. The ganache will be added to your mug of hot milk when finished.
Add any additional flavorings to the ganache while stirring in the cream.
Using the double boil method should make it more difficult to burn your chocolatey goodness, but be careful with the bowl as it will get hot!

, Salt, liqueurs, spices, and other flavourings can be added now. To increase their flavour presence in the hot chocolate, they will need the opportunity to steep for a longer period of time. However, if you want a subtler, less pronounced flavour, hold off for now.








, Add the remainder of the milk, whisking continuously. If you notice black flecks floating on the surface, don't worry: these flecks are bits of unmelted chocolate, and will disappear as your delicious beverage heats up.









Sometimes, whisking vigorously is necessary to dissolve unmelted chocolate completely.
If the mixture becomes too hot, or you feel that it might burn, remove pot from the heat and continue to stir, allowing the temperature to reduce. Put the pot back on the heat once the mixture has cooled.
Do not allow the mixture to boil!

,









Garnished with whatever you wish, such as mint leaves, cinnamon sticks, or whipped cream, it's going to be delicious! You can also add a kick to your cocoa with a shot of whiskey, rum, brandy, or peppermint schnapps.

Go for organic. Organic juice concentrate will include less chemicals and/or added ingredients for the healthiest option.





;
, Only use unflavored gelatin so it won’t interfere with the juice flavor.


Look for molds that will create smaller shapes, similar to the pre-packaged fruit snacks.






Consider buying molds for different holidays. For added fun, investigate molds that come in shapes like skulls or pumpkins for Halloween, or snowmen for winter holidays.







, Combine 1/3 cup of fruit juice concentrate with 2-3 (25 ounce/740ml) envelopes of unflavored gelatin.


Pour juice in the saucepan first, then sprinkle the gelatin over the juice. Allow the juice and gelatin to sit for a few minutes to combine.






Turn your stove to medium heat and place the pan over the burner. Stir mixture until the gelatin is fully dissolved.







, Transferring the juice to an easy-to-pour container will make it easier to pour into the molds.

, Make sure you fill the mold all the way to the top without allowing the juice to flow over.


Leave the molds on the counter for 20 minutes so they set. The molds should be ready to eat after approximately 20 minutes, however you can increase the readiness by placing your molds in the refrigerator.

",How to Make Flavored Hot Cocoa2," Your number one choice here has to be peppermint or mint, a flavor that tastes fresh and marries well with chocolate. Some minty flavoring suggestions include:

Add 1 tablespoon of mint chocolate chips to every cup of hot cocoa.
Crush a peppermint candy cane (or other mint candy). Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of crushed peppermint candy on top of the hot chocolate. It will sink and melt into the drink. Finish with a dollop of whipped cream.
Add 1 tablespoon of peppermint extract. Mix well and serve.

, If you truly love chocolate, you'll appreciate increasing the intensity of its flavor. This can be done easily to make your regular hot chocolate even better:


Melt 1 cup of white chocolate chips into 6 cups of hot whole milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract for a white hot chocolate.
Make hot chocolate fudge by adding a huge chunk of fudge or a brownie at the bottom of the cup, add hot chocolate and top with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings. You'll need to provide a long stemmed spoon to help eat up the mushy delight at the base. And be aware, that this isn't to everyone's taste.
Get a little nutty by combining 2 tablespoons of Nutella to 1 cup of hot chocolate. Allow the Nutella to melt and combine to create a nutty/chocolatey flavor.
Enhance the chocolate flavor of your hot cocoa by drizzling caramel sauce over the top of your cup.

, Infuse your hot cocoa with flavors of the season such as cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin spice (mixed spice).


Complement those gingerbread men cookies with a gingersnap hot chocolate. Add ¼ teaspoon of ground ginger, allspice and cinnamon to your hot chocolate, mix well and top with homemade whipped cream.
Design a dessert to remember with a flair for pumpkin. Add 1 tablespoon of canned pumpkin and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to regular hot chocolate recipe. Top with crushed graham crackers and whipped cream.
Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cinnamon into the hot chocolate and add a cinnamon stick to each cup for stirring. If you like cloves, add 2 whole cloves and 2-3 drops of almond essence for a Mexican twist (optional). Add grated dark chocolate for a topping.

, Chocolate goes well with various fruit flavors, such as banana, berries and orange.


Mix raspberry and chocolate by adding 1 tablespoon of good raspberry preserve to your hot cocoa. Top with whipped cream and a fresh raspberry. Or try making strawberry and raspberry hot chocolate.
Make orange hot chocolate. Add 1/2 teaspoon orange extract and a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla essence to the hot chocolate. Add grated dark chocolate as a topping and stir with a cinnamon stick.
Make banana hot chocolate. Add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar to the hot chocolate. Mash 1 banana. Place both the banana and the hot chocolate into a blender and combine quickly to make smooth. Drink immediately; this is a rich, heavily textured hot chocolate that is just perfect for very cold winter nights.

, There are basic flavor matches you can find by searching online, just as there are mismatches. For example, banana and chocolate are a marriage of great flavors, while adding paprika to that mix might just spoil things.


One easy way to guess what flavors will blend well with a hot chocolate is to think about which chocolate flavors you like from the range of bars of chocolate. In general, most of those flavors should transfer nicely to a hot chocolate taste too.

Remove the watermelon plug.,
Create space for the vodka bottle to fit inside the watermelon.,
Insert the vodka bottle neck into the watermelon.,
Let the watermelon absorb the vodka.,
Serve the vodka infused watermelon.",How to Infuse Vodka With Watermelon1,"

Twist off the cap to the vodka and place it on the lengthwise side of the watermelon (the oval shape of the watermelon should be horizontal). Position the vodka cap in the center of the watermelon. Use a serrated knife to “trace” around the edges of the vodka cap, creating a circle.

Stay as close to the actual cap size as possible, because you will eventually place your vodka bottle inside the hole that you’ve carved, and you want the fit to be snug so there are no leaks.;
,

Take the vodka cap off the watermelon, and use the knife to cut and follow the traced circle you just made. Place the knife point down on the edge of the circle and insert the knife about halfway. Cut out this piece as if you were carving a pumpkin.Continue cutting around the traced circle until the entire circle is carved around.

,

Use the knife to pry at the plug by inserting the knife at the cut edges, and bringing the knife down, underneath the plug, to create a 45-degree angle.

This will create a wedge that can pop the watermelon plug out of the carved hole.
Refrigerate the watermelon plug in a re-sealable plastic bag so that you can reinsert it later.
Save the vodka bottle cap to seal the vodka later.

,

Scoop out enough watermelon flesh with a spoon or melon scooper to create a hole deep enough that the vodka bottle neck can fit fully into the watermelon.

Be careful of watermelon juice and pulp splashing. This can make your workspace wet and sticky.

,

Stand the watermelon upright so it’s length is perpendicular to the surface space you are working on. Carefully tilt the watermelon on its side to meet the opened vodka bottle, and insert the bottle into the hole in the watermelon.The entire bottle neck should be able to fit in the watermelon hole.

If you have a friend nearby, they can hold the watermelon up and in the air a little bit and guide it to meet you, holding the opened vodka bottle.
Your vodka bottle will be at about a 90 degree angle to you, and parallel to your work space when you insert the bottle.

,

Rotate the watermelon until it is back on a resting position on your work space, with the vodka bottle now upright and centered. Leave the watermelon to absorb the vodka for at least 12 hours.The vodka should absorb about half, to the whole bottle of vodka.

,

Remove the bottle of vodka once the watermelon has absorbed all the alcohol. Insert the watermelon plug back into the hole and place in the refrigerator (with the vodka hole facing upward), if you are not planning on cutting and serving the water immediately. If you are planning on using the watermelon immediately, cut up the watermelon, and serve.

You can cut the watermelon into wedges, or peel it and cut it into cubes.

"
If it's a bar you frequent regularly, be a smart customer and go when it's not busy a few times so that you can get to know the bar staff.,
Watch for gaps in the crowd movement.,
Be a polite crowd mover.,
Make it obvious to the bar staff that you actually want to be served.,
Avoid chatting up someone while waiting at the bar.,
Make eye contact the moment the bar staff finishes with another customer.,
Be organized.,
Be polite.,
Send a friend.,
Find another, less crowded bar.",How to Get a Drink at a Crowded Bar," Once that connection has been established, they're much more likely to both recognize you and treat you like a friend by honing in on you through the crowd. A regular, known customer is always going to garner more favor by the sheer reality that we're biased toward the people we're familiar with and like. Of course, if you're known for being a drunken boor, they're not going to be won over by you because knowing you means knowing your drunken escapades. So keep it real and stay a nice patron at all times.;
, There will be moments even on a crowded night that the way to the bar is clear. Like traffic, the surge comes and goes and just happens to increase more at certain times because we tend to attract people through the power of suggestion - by being there all at once, surely none of us are missing out on whatever he's having and she's getting. If you swan up whenever you get the whim, expect the crowd to be as it is. However, if you watch the crowd's movement with a keener eye, you'll know the perfect moment to jump up and grab that next drink before the bar crowd regroups and conceals the clear pathway again.


Of course, this relies on being reasonably alert, which is not something you can always ensure around alcohol. Presumably though, if you're not alert enough to notice when there's a gap to the bar you can slip into, you're too drunk to care about crowds anyway.

, When you do have to contend with the bar crowd, keep it well mannered. Don't push, prod or stab anyone with a cocktail stick. If you do, it'll happen back and you've only got yourself to blame.

, Many people hang around the bar because they can. Or because they're chatting up a member of the bar staff, they're unsteady and too afraid to let go of the bar or they've seen people sitting at bars in the movies and think that leaving the bar will mean they don't look cool. Not to mention the people who won't leave the bar because... it's crowded. So, once you're at the bar:


Place your hand on the bar itself, your empty hand.
Make sure your cash is visible. If the staff see a ""quick drink"", they'll sell it. However, waving notes around is likely to see you drop down the queue.

Look eager and seek to make eye contact very determinedly.
Avoid looking petulant, angry or woeful. All of those facial poses put you to the end of the queue. After all, when you finally explode in a fit of self-righteous pique, it's a free form of entertainment for the rest of the crowd.

, The bar staff won't serve someone whose focus is clearly elsewhere and you're unlikely to notice they're signaling even if they do gesture that they wish to serve you. The process is - obtain drink, then chat. Besides which, by buying two drinks, you can open the chat with even greater ease.

, He or she will be searching for the next person to serve and if your eyes meet first, then you're it. If not, keep aiming your sights until you connect.



Be patient. Bar staff know when you're not and they're not averse to leaving you to stew just a bit longer by way of a lesson, especially if you've yelled out something like ""Hey you Blondie, I was next"". Smile sweetly and realize that you're not the only one waiting and that soon enough, it'll be your turn. Saying ""whenever you're ready"" is tantamount to saying ""hurry up"". When they're ready, they'll come and see you.

, It's not very helpful to finally squeeze your way through the crowd to stand there dumbstruck about the drink choices when you've had all that time waiting to make a choice. Use that time to work it out or if your buddies gave you a list a mile long of orders, have it written down on a list – or your hand. And is your cash ready? Avoid pulling the ""Oh, I thought you took credit"" stunt when you know it's a cash-only event too! And be aware that credit card payments are slower and hold up bar staff; they're more inclined to grab your easy cash (and tips).

, Once you have the attention of the bar staff, be a nice person. Smile, ask them how their night is going and make your order clear and succinct. And tip fairly and as big as you can, or buy them a drink too. The bar staff won't forget a good tipper and will be sure to remember you the next time you make your way through the thronging crowd to the bar.


Remember your manners. Please, thank you and ""you're very kind"" go a truly long way. Bar staff are people too.

, This dastardly but very sound ploy can keep you well away from the crowded bar, leaving you free to enjoy the booming music and continuing your shouting conversation with your remaining friends. And in turn, send each of those friends to the crowded bar until you're the last one left, by which time it is to be hoped that the bar crowd has thinned somewhat.


Each time a buddy goes to the bar, make sure he or she is loaded with orders for everyone. Even if someone ordering for the whole table needs someone else to carry or remember the drinks, once they have the bar staff's attention, they can just keep on ordering and signaling to one other to turn up and fetch the drink. You could even use a phone text signal - if the place is noisy, have the phone call receiver set their phone to vibration.

, You don't have to endure the impossible. If there is a less crowded bar out there, it needs your cash and still provides the same drinks. Maybe it's not as cool but your presence there will improve that factor and if you drag along your friends, you can make a fun night out of being at the less-crowded bar and making it your own special place.

Do an honest appraisal of their attitude.",How to Find a Traveling Partner," Do you trust them? Would you leave your wallet out around them and feel fine that it would be there in the morning? Do they do what they say they are going to, or will they brush you off if they find something better to do? You really don't want to get stuck some place waiting for your travel partner who may never show, especially if you're in an unfamiliar land.;
, You ideally want to find a partner that travels in the same way that you do, and one you will get along with. Have a talk about when you would like to go and things that you would like to see. Draw up a sight-seeing list and see if they agree on the places to go.

, You also want to find out what their budget depth and availability is for the trip ahead of time. You may have grand plans of hitting all the museums as well as eating out at all the local spots, but if your travel partner can't afford to, your plans will need to be altered. Better to know this ahead of time, so you can plan a mutually agreed upon budget. Of course there is nothing wrong with just hopping on a bus when you are there and seeing what you want to see without your travel partner, but make sure you tell them first!

, There is nothing worse than traveling around with a wet blanket. Unfortunately you just can't ask a person if they have a good attitude, as most everyone will tell you that they do! This is one element that you will just have to get to know your travel partner to find out what type of attitude they really have.


You can tell a lot about a person's attitude by the words they use and how they describe a situation. Ask them about the worst trip they've ever been on and pay attention to how they describe it to you. Are they laughing about it now, or still upset? Does their worst-trip sound like an adventure to you? If so, you may be a mismatch. Having a good attitude is critical for having a good time.
A quick and easy way to tell if you are on the same page is to look around at different vacation rentals (holiday homes) together. See if you place a similar value on amenities different vacation rentals offer. This is such a quick way to gain insight into how that person really likes to travel. For some people ""roughing it"" means no dishwasher; and for others it means sleeping out in the middle of the forest in nothing more than a sleeping bag!

Cut the watermelon.,
Soak the watermelon in vodka.,
Strain the vodka.",How to Infuse Vodka With Watermelon2,"

Slice a watermelon in half. One half is going to be used to infuse the vodka, the other half can be used for something else, or normal snacking. Slice the half of watermelon in half, creating two quarters, and then slice the quarter pieces of watermelon, separating between the flesh and the rind. Continue to cut the watermelon into about 1 inch chunks.

Don’t worry about removing the seeds, they will be strained out later.

,

Place the cut up watermelon chunks into an airtight jar. Fill the jar with vodka, and completely cover the cubes. Seal the container and place it in a cool, dark place to steep for at least 6 days.,

Remove the container from its storage place, and open the jar. Place a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar, and secure it with a rubber band. Slowly tip the jar over, and strain the infused vodka into clean bottles or jars.

The vodka should look pink.
Throw out the watermelon chunks, or if you’re feeling really daring, wrap the pieces of watermelon in plastic wrap, refrigerate, and eat later.

,

Pour the vodka into the jar, covering the candy, and fill until it is close to the top, but still sealable. The vodka will start breaking down the candy instantly. Let the vodka sit for about 8 to 12 hours.You might want to shake the jars to try and dissolve the candy faster, but this doesn’t really dissolve the candy faster.

,

Put your jar in the refrigerator or freezer, and let it chill until you are ready to serve it.

At first, the flavor of the vodka will taste just like the watermelon candy you used, and then the vodka taste will come through.
These can be served as shooters, or used for flavored martinis."

Some packable healthy choices include:


Hard-boiled eggs
Apples or bananas
Dried fruit and nut mixes
Turkey sandwiches
Protein bars;
, You can put perishable items in either a cooler or an insulated lunch box or bag with frozen gel packs to keep the food chilled. Another option is to put an electric cooler in your car., When served a meal on an airplane, only eat it if you need it. It can be challenging to not eat food placed right in front of you, but try to avoid eating airplane meals if, for instance, you already ate dinner two hours ago., You can save yourself both the expense and temptation of going out to eat by filling your hotel’s fridge with food that you prepped and brought from home. Take trips to the local grocery store and re-stock once you run out or if you weren’t able to bring food from home."

Make healthy substitutions.,
Ask that unhealthy items be withheld.,
Have a healthier dessert option.",How to Eat Healthy when Traveling2," Most menus have a wide variety of options. If something you want to eat seems unhealthy, consider asking for something slightly different than what’s described to satisfy your tastebuds but also stay healthy.


Sub the fries for veggies. Go for food that’s baked, steamed, grilled, or roasted. These are much healthier ways of cooking than frying.Swap pasta for rice. Most store-bought pasta is processed and contains excess sugar. Also, make sure that your meal contains larger portions of meat and/or veggies than rice., If you can’t think of a substitution to make for the unhealthy parts of your order, have the server put them on the side or leave them out completely.


Get your burger without the bun. Asking for lettuce leaves in place of your bun will really save on calories and sugar. Additionally, ask for any condiments on the side and use them sparingly.Mayonnaise is especially fattening.
Modify your salad. Salads can go from being healthy to unhealthy with just a few ingredients. Ask the server to hold croutons or cheese if either come in the salad. Stay away from creamy dressings like ranch and caesar because they are high in saturated fat., If you resist ordering dessert, you’ll save yourself a lot of unnecessary sugar ingestion, but if you really want dessert, there are healthier choices you can make.


Instead of ice cream, that’s high in saturated fat and sugar, go for sorbet or low-fat frozen yogurt.
Top a slice of angel food cake with fruit to get less calories and more fiber.
Consider going for a post-meal cappuccino instead of a dessert. A flavored coffee of your choice will typically have far less calories than cake, brownies, or cookies."
"
Drink more water.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Eat more protein.,
Treat yourself from time to time.",How to Eat Healthy when Traveling3," Sometimes thirst can be disguised as hunger. Before you eat something, drink a glass of water and then determine if you’re still hungry. Keep a water bottle nearby as often as possible to get into the habit of hydrating more.Drinking more water has many other health benefits, including:


Preventing and treating headaches
Minimizing junk food cravings
Flushing your body of toxins
Preventing heat exhaustion

, Beer, wine, and liquor dehydrate you and contain many unneeded calories. Simply drinking in moderation instead of drinking excessively can make a big difference., Cutting down on calories at every meal is a healthier choice that also keeps your energy up. Eating big portions sends the message to your brain that less food will be eaten in the near future. Because of this, those extra calories get stored as fat., Leaner meats especially, such as seafood and chicken, are typically better for you than beef and pork.These foods provide you with lasting fullness, energy, and strength.


You can also get protein from foods that are not meat. Nuts, seeds, and beans are other good sources of protein.Choose a protein-rich dish without a lot of sugar and carbohydrates. Eating the proper amount of protein enhances concentration, and keeps you energetic, lean and strong. Sugar and carbohydrates can make you feel sluggish and contribute to weight gain when eaten too frequently., It’s usually a lot easier to stick to a healthy dietary intake when you give yourself a little break once in awhile. Let yourself have that cheeseburger or that hearty breakfast you’ve been craving, but only in careful moderation. Make sure that on the days you decide to indulge in a high-calorie meal or dessert that you make especially healthy food choices for the rest of the day.

Decide how much your business can afford to spend on employee holiday gifts, and then do the math to determine how much that translates to per employee.,
Personalize gifts by buying unique items for each person.,
Choose one gift that you think all employees would enjoy, such as a fruit and cheese basket, and buy one for each person.,
Gift cards to local businesses can make good employee gifts at the holidays, as long as you choose the right business.,
Consider giving your employees the gift of paid time if you can't hand out large holiday bonuses.,
Pick up the tab for lunch, a late afternoon pizza, or morning donuts and coffee more often during the holiday season.",How to Choose a Holiday Gift for Your Employees," If appropriate, you may want to divide employees into various tiers and determine gift spending limits based those tiers.;
, Only consider doing this is you have a small number of employees whom you know well.


Listen when employees talk during the year. If you hear someone mention needing or wanting something, make a note of it. Make sure they haven't already gotten it for themselves before holiday time, and if not buy it for their holiday gift.
Solicit letters to Santa from your employees and then choose an item off of each person's list as their gift. You can also hang the Santa letters in the break room as part of your holiday decorating.

Give everyone a chance at a gift of money by tucking lottery tickets into holiday cards.

, Unless you know there is a certain restaurant in town that each of your employees loves, a gift card to a local department store, office supply store or grocery store is more likely to provide something everyone can use.

, For many people there are two things they can never have enough of around the holidays: time and money.


Hang a calendar that shows the periods during the holiday season when you expect business to be slow. Let each employee write her name on the day or days she is taking off as her holiday gift from you.
Give extra time off as the opportunity arises. If business is slow and you have more employees on than you need, send some of them home with pay. Keep track of who you send home and how early, so everyone gets equal time.

, Holidays are stressful times for everyone; show your employees you appreciate them as part of your holiday gift.

You can use pen and paper or make a list on your computer. Write down every magazine subscription you have.Next to each magazine, write down how much is due each month for the subscription. If some of your magazines have yearly fees, write down the yearly fee instead.
Next, write down the date when each bill is due.
This may take awhile, as you'll have to look up information for each subscription. Make sure to carve out a chunk of your day to make a detailed list.;
, Re-order your list by due date. Place the subscription fees that are due earlier in the month towards the top of the list, and the ones due later in the month towards the bottom. This will give you a sense of when everything is due, and give you a heads up about which payments are due sooner., Try to pick days around when you get paid. For example, say you get paid the first and the fifteenth of each month. You could pay half the subscriptions on the 2nd, and the other half on the 16th. If you mark these dates in your calendar at the beginning of each month, you'll be less likely to forget a payment.Remember to consult your list. Always pay subscription fees due earlier in the month sooner than those due later in the month. You don't want to end up with a late fee.

, You can use your phone or computer to set up an alert system for yourself. This can be particularly helpful if you're forgetful by nature. You can talk to your bank about an online bill pay reminder. You can also set an alarm on your phone's calendar for when certain bills are due. If you have a lot of subscriptions to track, this can really help you stay on top of things., You can call customer service or check online for automated bill options. If you subscribe to multiple magazines, the easiest way to manage subscriptions is to have payments automatically deducted from a checking account. If you can do automatic payments, this will help you make sure you never miss a bill.You may want to mark on your calendar when monthly payments are due even when paying automatically. This will help you keep track of how much money is in your bank account at any given time.
However, be careful to keep track of automated payments. Make sure you're not overpaying, or paying for a subscription you already cancelled. You should also always make sure you have enough money in your account when dealing with automatic payments.

, While tracking bills, you should make sure you're receiving all the magazines you subscribe to. If you notice you missed an issue, you should contact the magazine's customer service immediately to report the issue.


You may be able to report a missing magazine online, if you have an online account where you manage things like renewals and bills.If you don't have an online account, you can also call customer service to request your magazine be reissued.

, If you are moving, call the magazine's customer service and notify them of your upcoming move. Do this at least a month in advance of your relocation so that the magazine can be routed to your new address.


An address change can sometimes be done online if you have an online account with the magazine.However, you may also need to call customer service if you don't manage subscriptions online.

, A budget can help you decide which subscriptions to keep and which subscriptions to cut. As you work on cutting back on expenses, make a budget to guide your decisions.Write down how much money you bring in each month. Then, make a list of all your necessary expenses such as rent, food, and other bills.
Subtract your totally monthly expenses from your total monthly income. This will give you your disposable income for the month. Think about how much of this money you want to spend on magazine subscriptions.

, Be honest with yourself. Are you really getting your money's worth for all of your subscriptions? Comb through your list of magazine subscriptions and identify any magazines you don't really read anymore. You should cut any unnecessary subscriptions. This will save you money, and make managing subscriptions easier.How often do you really read some of your subscriptions? You may feel like you should read something like Time Magazine or Newsweek, but maybe you're just not using those resources anymore. You may be turning the internet for your news instead.
If you can't remember the last time you read a magazine cover to cover, call customer service and cancel your subscription. You'll save yourself some money and have less to keep track of in regards to monthly bills.

, How much of a given magazine's content could you find online? If you subscribe to an online version of a magazine, is that subscription cheaper than a print one? When looking for ways to cut costs, see if you can find cheap alternatives to print magazines.Many magazines and newspapers post the bulk of their content online. At least some of it is available to view for free. If you don't read a magazine terribly extensively, making use of free online content may be enough for you.
You can also look into subscribing to a magazine's digital content. Some magazines may offer cheaper subscriptions if you're not getting a print magazine.

, Even if you read all your magazines, think about whether this is really how you want to spend your money. How much pleasure do you get out of your magazines? Are they necessary to work or school? If you're not truly making the most of your subscriptions, consider cutting back. This will make managing bills less of a headache and free up some income., If you're using Newsstand on an Apple device, like an iPhone, you can check your subscriptions easily. If you're unsure how many subscriptions you have, simply click ""Settings"" on your iPhone or iPad.From there, click ""iTunes and App Store"" and then tap your Apple ID near the top of the page. Then, click ""View Apple ID"" on the pop up menu that will appear. If necessary, enter your password.
Look for the heading ""Subscriptions."" Click ""manage"" under this heading. You should see a list of subscriptions there.

, If there's a subscription in Newsstand you no longer use, canceling is easy. Once you've pulled up a list of your subscriptions, click on the subscription you want to cancel. From there, you will be taken to a screen where you have the option to cancel or otherwise modify the subscription. If you're not interested in continuing the subscription, you can easily cancel on this screen., In Newsstand, you have the option of automatically renewing a subscription. If you want to keep a subscription longterm, you can switch automated renewals to ""on"" after accessing the magazine in questions via the settings on your Apple device. If you don't want a subscription to renew automatically, you can switch automatic renewals off."

Find rechargeable batteries that are compatible to the device you have.,
Adjust your budget.,
Choose between nickel and lithium batteries.,
Compare battery life.,
Buy a charger when you buy your batteries.,
Consider the environmental impact of your battery choice.,
Check out consumer reviews when considering batteries and battery chargers.,
Look for safety features.,
Buy NiMH rechargeable batteries anywhere you would normally buy batteries.",How to Buy Rechargeable Batteries," The type of batteries discussed here will be either AA size or those that fall under the category of lithium-ion.


Familiar sizes, such as AA, AAA, C and D can be found at almost any store imaginable. Concerning cost, rechargeable batteries are a wonderful investment. Rechargeable AA or AAA batteries are known as Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH).Generally, C and D size are not available in this form.;
, You will pay more for rechargeable batteries than you do for disposable batteries but they will pay for themselves quite quickly.

, Most rechargeable batteries are made from nickel cadmium (NiCd) or lithium cadmium (LiCd).


Watch for the memory effect with your NiCd batteries. The battery life decreases when you recharge the battery before it is fully depleted. So, if you buy a nickel rechargeable battery, make sure you use up all the battery life before you charge it. The aforementioned NiMH battery (especially the new ones) have no memory and can be charged anytime. These are what you'll generally see in most stores ... when rechargeable batteries are sold.
Choose a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery if you want to be able to charge it at any time. These types of batteries do not have a memory effect, and they hold their charge for months at a time regardless of when you charge them.

, When you buy a rechargeable battery, the milliamp hour rating (mAh) is what to look for as far as knowing the amount of energy a battery will hold. The higher the rating, the longer it will power a device before needing to be charged again.


Consider the device you are using the battery for. A high energy item, such as a digital camera, or an LED flashlight will use up the battery quicker than a remote control will.

, A battery charger is necessary to recharge your batteries over and over again.


Look for a charger that is reliable, and utilizes a CC/CV (constant current, constant voltage) algorithm. Some chargers will accept many different battery sizes, and be able to charge both NiMH and lithium batteries at the same time. Most chargers can be used through a wall plug, USB port and even a car charging port.

, All rechargeable batteries are better than single use batteries for the earth. NiMH batteries are even greener than cadmium batteries.

, But don't be fooled by extremely inexpensive lithium batteries! Even if some consumers rate them well, they are cheaply made and can be dangerous sometimes!

, Buying ""protected"" batteries is your safest bet. Make sure you buy products that are safe and not the subject of government or industry recalls.

, Department stores such as Target, Sears and Walmart, hardware and electronic stores such as Home Depot, Lowes and Radio Shack will all sell them. Only online retailers will sell rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.


Buy online from major sites such as Amazon, eBay and Overstock or on sites that specialize in rechargeable batteries and chargers. Just be aware that Amazon and eBay are also where you could be fooled into buying extremely cheap batteries that will NOT last, and be potentially unsafe.

Don't browse when you're not ready to shop.",How to Buy Makeup on a Budget," Sometimes expensive makeup brands really are of superior quality, but often they are marked up for no reason at all. Remember that just because the packaging looks fancier, does not necessarily mean that the product is superior, so give bargain brands a chance.Sometimes you can find bargain versions of high-end products. The name and packaging might be different, but the product is almost the same, so don't be fooled! You can search online to find lists of makeup dupes that have been found out by savvy shoppers.Be sure to look at the bottom shelves when shopping, as stores tend to put the priciest items at eye-level. You may just discover an affordable brand you didn't know about by paying a little extra attention.;
, It's always a good idea to do research on a new beauty product before you invest, especially if it's on the pricey side. It's easy to find out all about a product by doing a simple internet search.


Read reviews online before you buy a new product for the first time. This will help you decide if it's worth it to splurge on a more expensive, higher quality product, or if the bargain brand is just as good.Ask your friends for advice. They might have discovered a great, affordable product that is just what you've been looking for.
If there are testers available, always use them. You don't want to go home with a lipstick if you're not happy with the shade. This will have been a complete waste of money.

, You don't necessarily need a new product for every beauty need. There are lots of products available that are either advertised as multi-purpose, or can easily be used for more than one purpose.Lots of products can be used on both your lips and your cheeks, especially stains and cream products.
Instead of buying a contouring kit, consider whether you have a bronzer or eye shadow that might work just as well.

, If you've been thinking about splurging on a new product, but you're not sure that it will be worth it, consider asking the store or the manufacturer for a sample. This won't always work, but some companies will give out samples in the hopes that you will become a loyal customer, so give it a try.If you end up loving the product, you will at least know that buying it again will be worth the splurge. There's nothing worse than spending a ton on a product that you don't end up using.

, You don't necessarily need to buy every beauty product at the store where you first see it. Once you've decided what you want, try searching online to see if you can find a better price somewhere else. There's no use in spending more for the exact same product!Comparison shopping is especially useful when you can try the product out at a store, but then purchase it for a lower price online., If you tend to shop at the same store for beauty products, reap the rewards! Lots of stores have rewards programs that will give you credits (or even free products) once you have spent a certain amount.If you belong to one of these programs, make sure the cashier always scans your card so you get the points you've earned.
Consider saving up points to buy a pricey item that you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.

, Most stores have sales at some point, so always check to see which store has a sale on the products you want. You could even try asking the associates if they know when the next sale will be.If you pay close enough attention, you might start to notice that the sales at your favorite stores happen on a regular schedule. If you can master the schedule, you can stock up on all of your favorite items when they are on sale so you never have to pay full price.
Buying items that have been available for a few seasons instead of the latest craze can help you save a lot, as these items are more likely to be on sale.

, A quick online search can help you find lots of great coupons that can help you get a better deal on cosmetics. Stores and manufacturers both put out coupons, and these can even be combined sometimes, which means even greater savings for you.Don't forget to look through the store's weekly circulars to see what deals they are offering.
If you sign up for email notifications from your favorite stores and beauty brands, you will have access to even more coupons.Some high-end makeup stores will give you credits for new products if you recycle your empty containers, so be sure to look into this before you throw them away.If you can't find a coupon, search online for discounted gift cards to your favorite beauty store. People often sell unwanted gift cards for less than the face value just to get rid of them., It can be easy to forget about unused products that may be lurking at the bottom of your makeup bag, so be sure to go through them all before you go out shopping for new makeup. This can help prevent you from buying duplicates of products you already have, so you have more money to spend on new items.


Doing inventory will be easier if you stay organized. Try to keep all of your makeup in one place and organize it by type so you will be able to see what you have quickly. You may want to buy a large makeup case with many compartments to hold your different products. You can also store your makeup in a drawer and use drawer dividers to keep everything tidy., Having a good idea of exactly how much you're willing to spend on a product before you go to the store can help you avoid impulse buys. A budget also forces you to think about which purchases are high-priority and which are low-priority.If you have a hard time sticking to your budget, try setting aside a small amount of money specifically for makeup. When you have enough, go shopping and pay in cash. If you don't have enough cash saved to cover the items in your cart, you'll have no choice but to put something back.
If you really can't trust yourself to stick to your budget, leave your cards at home and bring only as much money as you want to spend to the store with you.

, Having a list of the items that you need will help keep you on track and prevent you from wandering the aisles aimlessly. When you get to the store, go straight for the items on your list.If you're tempted to buy something that's not on the list, take a moment to consider how that will affect your financial goals. If you realize that you may not be able to afford to go out to dinner with your friends if you spend all of your money on makeup, you may think twice about it.

, Decide how often you will go shopping for makeup and avoid going to makeup stores or wandering in the makeup aisle at drug stores between shopping sprees. This will only leave you tempted to buy things you can't afford.


Try to think of new makeup as a reward, and remember that if you spend money on smaller items between your shopping sprees, you will have less to spend on the expensive items you have been craving.

Decide how long you need to use the container.,
Evaluate whether a 20 foot (6.1 m) container or a 40 foot (12.2 m) container length will suit your needs.,

Research the various conditions and options that are available on the used shipping container market.,
Search for used shipping containers online.,
Call a local shipping company to inquire about used shipping containers.,
Search online for dedicated shipping container sale sites.,

Consider hiring an inspector from the Institute of International Container Lessors to inspect your container.,
Inspect the container yourself, instead of hiring an inspector.,
Purchase your used shipping container when you have evaluated all of your options.",How to Buy a Used Shipping Container," If you plan to use it for storage for a few months, you may want to consider renting a container. With this option, you will not be required to dispose of it or sell it when you are finished.;
, The size of the container will depend upon the space you have set aside for its use and the capacity that is needed. A 40 foot (12.2 m) container will be more expensive than a 20 foot (6.1 m) container, so measure before starting to shop.


Common heights include 8.5 feet (259.1 cm) and 9.5 feet (289.6 cm). They are usually 8 feet (2.4 m) wide. Extra wide containers are also available and they can run up to 48 feet (14.6 m) in length.

, There may be restrictions on this type of structure, so ensure you are allowed to house a shipping container on the premises. Some cities and counties have local ordinances restricting the use of shipping containers in all but a few areas.


In order for a container space to be adequate, you will need adequate delivery space. This is usually double the length of the container plus 10 feet (3.0 m).
The location must also be level in order to use the shipping container safely.

, Anything that is described as ""used,"" can be well-worn or relatively new. Follow these guidelines to buy the correct condition for your needs:


Look for ""one-trip"" containers if you are looking for a nearly new look and condition. These containers are usually made in Asia and used once for cargo shipping before being sold. They are often listed as ""new"" or ""like new"" but they will have a few scratches from their initial trip.
Look for ""corten steel"" if you want to use containers in inclement weather or near the ocean. This relatively new material is also used in construction projects and it can stand up to more weather without rusting.
Look for a ""factory paint"" label if you want it to be freshly painted, instead of refurbished. Refurbished containers can have problems with paint peeling from rust. Factory paint implies that it has only been painted once, when it was made.
A designation as ""no shipping label"" means that you will not find a large company logo on the container. It is likely painted a single color, without many other markings.
A ""cargo worthy"" container indicates that the unit has been inspected by a cargo surveyor. It has been deemed worthy of ocean cargo transport.
Shipping containers that are categorized as ""as-is"" are the most worn and economical option. It is likely that they have been retired by shipping companies, they have some leaks or damage, they are partially rusted and they have 1 or more shipping labels painted onto them. There is a large supply of as-is shipping containers across the globe, so you are likely to find a good price.
Modified shipping containers are also available at various prices. Many of these containers have been repainted. Other options include roll up doors, heat units, air conditioning units, skylights, security bars, partitions, vents, fans, framing and insulation. Keep in mind that the addition of new doors or windows will compromise the seal and security of the original model.
Other well used containers are classified as ""wind-water-tight"". Wind and watertight conveys that the seller believes it to be a well sealed container, but it has not been inspected by a surveyor.

, In general, you can find as-is containers starting at around $1,500 and like-new or modified containers that cost between $5,000 and $8,000. The following are good places to compare prices:


Search on eBay for used shipping containers. Many companies and individuals choose to sell their containers by auction. You may be afforded a better price if the starting bid is within your budget.

, If you want to save on transportation costs, then calling 3 to 10 storage or shipping companies in your area may prove to be the most economical options. This may also afford you the chance to inspect the container before purchasing.

, Call or email for a quote about the size and condition you desire.

, Since there are many options available, having an organized way to vet your choices will result in a lower price.

, If you require a sealable, secure container for long-term use, then you can ensure you are getting a good product by hiring an IICL inspector. Search online for an inspector near the sale location.

, You should ensure that the doors close completely and the body is free of dents. Also, avoid containers that contain rust near the seals or bad odors, as these are likely to remain.

, Depending upon the company, you may be required to use a credit card or cashier's check. Arrange for convenient transport to your location.

Then fill in the list with all the items you need for each room. Separate the list into Essentials (e.g. set of knives, frying pan) and Extras (e.g. china tea set). If it helps, take a walk around your parents' house or a friend's house and list the things they have in each room that you think you will need.;
, This is hugely important in order to avoid overspending. Think about how much money you can spend to furnish your house, and then allocate portions for each room or type of object. Allow the largest portion of your budget, around 50%, to major appliances or ""white goods"" (refrigerator, washing machine, etc.) and large furniture (bed, sofa). Devote at least half of the rest of your budget to other, smaller essentials (microwave, vacuum cleaner), and allow the last section for smaller things like cushions, rugs, etc.


When making a budget, realize that while buying cheap furniture may save you money now, it won't necessarily help in the long run, as these items will be less durable and you will have to replace them. Decide whether you can afford to make a significant investment in your long-term future.

, Especially for larger items and appliances like a washing machine or a refrigerator, there are a lot of options out there with a huge range of price and functionality. Do plenty of research to figure out what your options are and what best suits your needs. Look online for specs, comparisons, and reviews, or talk to a salesman to discuss what would best fit your own unique needs. Carefully consider all the available options before deciding what to buy, and then shop around for deals on that make or model before purchasing it.

, Think about ordering bigger things online and have them delivered to your new home. This allows you a wider range of options than any one store could provide, and you may be able to find better deals so that you can buy these items at lower prices or with free shipping.

, Look for each item at several different stores to get an idea of price ranges. You can always compare prices and models and then order your favorites online, if you can find a better deal. Or, head to a cheaper store near you that sells all sorts of things. Large department stores sell almost all the cheap essentials for your home, from washing up bowls, floor mops and clothes hangers to bin liners, cleaning products and picture frames. This is a good way of acquiring the initial items - you can always replace them with more luxurious or high-quality items at a later date. The key thing is to ensure you have everything you need at first within your budget.

, Large kitchen essentials include a refrigerator, freezer, and washing machine, while a dishwasher and clothes dryer are optional. Smaller essentials include a toaster and microwave, plates and mugs, cutlery, pots and pans, knives and other cooking utensils, and a dish drainer. Extras can include tea towels, baking trays, a can opener and other utensils, an electric mixer, wine glasses and vases, blenders or juicers, etc.

, Essentials include a dining table and at least four chairs. Other items can include tablecloths and place mats, hot pads, centerpieces or candles, and other decorations.

, You'll need a sofa, coffee table, and at least one armchair. Items like a TV, DVD player, and video gaming equipment may or may not be essential, while side tables, curtains, cushions, coasters, floor lamps, and other decorations will make the space more comfortable.

, You'll need a bed and mattress, bedside tables, a chest of drawers or wardrobe, and sheets and blankets. You may also want clothes hangers, and extra set of bedding, cushions, rugs, a mirror, chairs, and other decorations.

, This will depend on what's already installed, so make sure you'll have a functioning shower unit, toilet, and sink before you proceed. Then you'll need a shower curtain, bath mat, and mirror, and you'll also likely want towel racks, hooks for the door, shelves or drawers, and toiletry accessories like a soap dish and toothbrush holder.

, This will depend on your individual preferences and needs, but consider items like a shoe rack and welcome mat, armchairs, bookshelves, storage shelves, a dog bed, and any other decorative items that will make your house feel more comfortable.

If you only need one or two pieces of furniture, it won't feel as costly to choose a slightly higher-quality item. But if you're furnishing a whole house or apartment, it can feel overwhelming to think about the potential costs. Before you even look at any furniture, you'll want to set a realistic budget for yourself. Know what you're able to spend, and ensure that you have enough money to complete the purchase you'd like to make., Furniture shopping may seem overwhelming, but the first thing you'll need to decide is whether you want to buy something that will not cost a lot (and may not last long), or something that costs more money, but will hold up longer over time.Price is not always necessarily an indication of quality, but generally speaking, brand new furniture that is very low-cost is less likely to hold up over time.If the furniture has exposed wood, look for solid wood, or at least sturdy plywood. If the piece is made of plywood, make sure it has at least nine layers to ensure it will hold up over time.Particleboard, pressed wood, and fiberboard are less sturdy and durable.For furniture with removable cushions, try unzipping the cushion covers to check the insides. The foam should be wrapped in some protective and cushioning material, such as dacron, cotton, or down., Once you've chosen a model and you've set a reasonable price range (which you can afford), it's time to shop around. You can look at prices online or visit a number of stores, and keep track of how much each store charges.Discounts can be deceiving. Get a sense of the real price for a given piece of furniture, and be aware of how much each store is marking up from the factory price of that furniture., Once you've researched the various furniture models and compared prices across multiple stores, you should have a sense of which retailer offers the best deal. Smaller local stores are often more capable of negotiating prices than a bigger chain store might be because the owner is typically working on the sales floor., Many furniture stores tuck sale and clearance items in the back of the store. They're set up in such a way that most shoppers will find something they like before they ever see the sale items. If you know that the furniture you're looking for is on sale, skip the rest of the sales floor and look for the discount section., Used furniture is typically available at a fraction of what that furniture cost when it was new. It's disadvantageous for people trying to sell used furniture, but incredibly advantageous for buyers. Check second-hand stores, or search online sales websites like Craigslist to find high quality, used furniture near you., Some retailers charge exorbitant fees for assembly or delivery. If you live in a multi-story building and don't have an elevator, you may have to pay even more to get your furniture delivered. You should plan on negotiating these fees before you agree to purchase the furniture, as fees like these can sometimes increase your final cost by hundreds of dollars., If you have sufficient funds and it's feasible for you to do, bring cash in-hand to the store with you. This is advantageous for a number of reasons. For one, you know you'll be able to stay within your budget. If you're paying with a credit/debit card or check, it's easy to justify spending a little more on an item than if you're sticking to what you physically brought in your wallet. But another big advantage of cash transactions is that you're free to bargain on the price. Retailers are less likely to be willing to negotiate with someone who's going to pay with a credit card or financing option, because they already know you're flexible on what you spend.Don't expect a salesperson to take your lower offer right away. Bargaining can take a long time, and may involve a lot of back-and-forth. That's why it's important to know how much that piece of furniture is marked up, and where you could ""threaten"" to get it for a better price.If the store is not willing to negotiate, write down the barcode number or the brand and model name. You may be able to bargain for it at another store, or find it online for much cheaper.If you aren't comfortable carrying cash, opt for a check or debit card. This way you know you won't be spending money that you don't have.

, If you have bad credit, you may not have a credit card. Even if you do, it's not the best option, but it's usually better than the financing offers that many retailers offer. If you do use a credit card, be sure to pay off the bill on time to avoid interest charges., Financing plans should be considered a sort of loan of desperation.These offers may be tempting, and if you believe you can pay off the balance before the interest rates kick in it may be worth it. However, financing plans are usually not very advantageous to the buyer, and often times the retailer anticipates the possibility that the buyer has no other options.Some stores offer zero percent financing, but the fine print of that offer is that you must enroll in a store credit card to get that rate. When you apply for a credit card, the store issuing that card will almost always conduct a credit inquiry. Even inquiring about your credit through a card issuer or retailer can lower your credit score, and if you already have bad credit that could be very damaging to your credit."

""New"" or ""one-trip"" containers have typically been made in China and then shipped directly to the United States.If you want to convert your container into a home, this is the best option, as it will be weather resistant, and have the least damage.""Cargo-worthy"" containers have been used a bit more, but are still in good condition, and could be used at sea again. Typically these will be wind and water tight, and, structurally speaking, would still be able to handle being shipped overseas.""Wind and water tight"" containers are those that are still able to keep out the elements, but have not been officially inspected in order to be declared “cargo-worthy”.""As is"" containers are those that may or may not be able to stand up to the elements, and may or may not have structural damage.;
, Different containers are made of different materials. All containers that were used for overseas shipping are made of steel, and are much stronger than their aluminium counterparts.If you wish to live in the container, you will need to purchase a steel container, as these are much stronger and more durable (they were made for trips across the ocean, after all). However, if you only need it for a temporary storage solution, and aren’t worried about the weather, an aluminium container could suffice.

, Containers also come in various sizes. You may want a larger or smaller container depending on what you need it for.


Containers range in length from 20 feet (6 meters) up to 53 feet (16 meters).They range in height from 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 meters) up to 9 feet 6 inches (2.9 meters).Width ranges are between 8 feet (2.4 meters) and 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 meters)

, Some containers will come in a plain color, while some may have the logo of the company that used them for shipping goods. If you plan to repaint the container, it doesn’t matter much. However, if you don’t plan to repaint it, you should choose a container with a color and/or design you don’t mind looking at., Some containers, for example, might have been used to transport goods with a very strong odor, such as animal hides. In this case, you may end up with a shipping container that is contaminated by a strong, foul odor., Depending on your location, the cost and availability of used shipping containers can vary greatly. If you’re near a coast or major urban center, the cost could be more reasonable than if you’re in a rural area.


If you live in a more rural, in-land area, you could compare the cost of purchasing a container locally with the cost of purchasing a container from an area where they are cheaper plus the cost of transporting it to you.
If you live in an area where containers are in high demand, but not close to a big city or harbor, then a locally bought container could be extremely expensive. On the other hand, you might be able to find a container in the nearest port city to you (or big city), and have it shipped. In this instance the price of the container and the price of the shipping together could be significantly less expensive than purchasing a local container.

One big disadvantage here is that you probably won’t get the opportunity to inspect the container before buying.


Depending on where you live, you should expect to spend between $2,500 and $4,000 on a one-trip 20’ container. Prices will be higher for a larger container.If you are purchasing a brand new container, which will likely be shipped from Asia, you should expect to spend significantly more, especially when it comes to delivery costs.

, If you live very close to the dealer you are purchasing your container from, you may not have to pay anything at all for delivery. However, if you live farther away, you will need to pay for shipping costs. This will depend on what you are able to negotiate with the seller.


You could estimate that you will spend about $400 to ship a 20’ container approximately 300 miles, including unloading and surcharges.However, this is just one estimate. You should discuss the cost of delivery with the seller, as some sellers may have other offers.
For a container shipped internationally, you could expect to spend anywhere from $1,900 up to $23,000 for a new container that has never been used, depending upon the distance shipped, and how many containers you are shipping.You could also reduce the cost of shipping in this instance, by allowing the company to use the container to ship goods. Obviously it will no longer be brand new, but it will help reduce your costs., You can look in your local newspaper or at online classified ads. You may find someone selling one privately for a good deal.


You can search online for classified ads by typing “shipping container for sale” + the name of your town, city, or county.
Be sure to see the container in person before handing over any money to a private seller! Sometimes, classified ads are merely scams.

, Some shipping and leasing companies will sell directly to private buyers, while some large container companies don’t want to deal with buyers who only want to purchase one or a few containers.


Containers bought directly from shipping companies will often be more expensive.Searching the internet for “shipping containers for sale” is a good way to find companies selling to private consumers; however, you should research the company carefully. This website allows you to search for reputable sellers based on country, state, or province.
You can also search your local newspapers and classified ads for shipping container dealers.

, Throughout your search, you should make a list of the names, phone numbers, and websites of the dealers you think may be able to offer what you are looking for. This way, you will be able to compare offers, and get the best deal on the container you want.

, You can do this either by email or phone, and tell them specifically what you're looking for in order to find out of they can supply a container that meets your needs.


If you have found several potential dealers, you should consider contacting all of them to see who will give you the best deal. If there is one who will allow you to see the container, it might be wise to go with them simply because you will get a chance to inspect the quality.

, Ask the seller to give you a chance to examine the container. However, be aware that this may not always be possible as some sellers may have thousands upon thousands of containers in the depot.

, If the seller will allow you to, examine the container you will be purchasing carefully.


If you need the container to be wind and water tight, go inside the container and shut the door. It will be dark, so you should look for any places where light shines through. If you find a place, this means that it may not be able to protect you or your things from the elements.Make sure the doors close properly, and that there are no huge dents in the container.Containers tend to rust a bit, especially if they are not “new”, but you should look for areas where the container is rusted through., If you need to have your container shipped to you, it is recommended that you do your best to request delivery via a tilt bed roll off truck.Remember though, that unloading, especially if you are having the delivery person place it in a specific way, will cost extra. The price may be included, but it may not be, and it can vary greatly. Make sure you negotiate this cost with the seller.
Containers weigh, depending on size, approximately 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilos), so you definitely can’t manage it alone!If you want to have your shipping container placed in an area that doesn't have much cleared space, then you may have to hire someone with a crane to lift the container into the desired position.

, In countries such as the US, most dealers have many more containers than they need, so it is in their interest for you to purchase one. This gives you the power to negotiate the price with the dealer! If they won’t budge on the price, try asking for free delivery.Although you should negotiate the price, avoid taking advantage of the seller. He or she will know that you are, as they know the going rate. They will be less likely to work with you if they feel you are trying to take unfair advantage over them.

Take your age into consideration.,
Learn some self control.,
Every time you get your allowance, divide it into separate ""banks"".,
Learn Time management.,
Treat yourself along with paying the bills.,
Come up with extra ways to earn money.,
Don't make impulse purchases.",How to Save Up for Shopping," This article really depends on your age. If you are older and have a job, you will be able to save up larger sums of money. If you are younger, you can still save up without worrying about the bills.;
, Saving up for anything requires patience and self control. If you're younger, this can be easy.

, One for petty cash, and a larger one for your shopping day. If you are really smart, you'll save the whole thing.

, (This goes for those with jobs, and those depending on allowance money.) Set a date for your much-needed shopping day ahead of time so when it comes, you'll have more cash to spend.

, For those of you with a job and maybe even paying bills, you can still treat yourself! Plan ahead by deducting your bills and groceries and setting aside cash from the amount left.

, Nothing left after the bills are paid? Go old school! Spend some time on a really nice-looking stand. (E.g. lemonade, yard sale, hot chocolate...) You can lure customers in with multiple products and a well-kept stand. Make a nice bouquet and take time to paint it well with eye-popping colors. (This goes for those of you still with allowances!!)

, Not only is this great for saving, but great for your annual budget. Look at the product. Walk away and think about it while you browse the rest of the store. Come back to the item, slowly, stand in front of it and take a moment. Close your eyes if you have to and pay attention to your feelings. If you have a nervous, clammy feeling, don't get it. It's an impulse buy! If no feeling, it's your choice. Remember, just because you have money and your at a store doesn't mean you have to buy something!

Track your spending.,
Base your budget on monthly expenses.,
Plan for fixed and variable expenses.,
Plan for emergencies.,
Create room for savings in your budget.,
Make adjustments as you go.",How to Save up for a Shopping Spree1," It isn’t hard to keep track of how much you spend on large and recurring expenses like rent, but you may not realize how much money you spend each day on small things. Keep track of what you spend your money on in a spreadsheet or notebook so you can use that to gauge your future budget.Make sure to record what you buy, not just where. That way it will be easier to categorize your expenses later.
Include everything, even things you feel confident you will remember.;
, Once you have tracked your spending for long enough to determine your monthly expenditures, sort them into categories. With your expenses sorted you can determine the totals you spend on different things per month and identify places where you can reduce costs.Sort your expenditures into categories such as: housing, utilities, eating out, gas, entertainment, and food.
Some of those categories are required expenses (such as housing) but others may be unnecessary. Look at how much money you spend eating out, or going to the movies each month for instance.
Compare your monthly expenses to your monthly income and see if there’s any room for savings.

, Using your list of monthly expenses, you can establish a monthly budget moving forward. First plan for your fixed expenses (or bills that don’t change per month) such as your rent or mortgage. Then allot room in your budget for variable expenses that may shift each month, and finally for non-essentials.Fixed expenses include rent, cell phone bills, cable and internet, and monthly subscriptions for things like gym memberships.
Variable expenses include gas, groceries, and some utilities.
Non-essentials are things you don’t necessarily need. Non-essentials would include money you spend on music, movies, going out with friends, and so forth.

, Along with your regular expenses, you may want to allot some room in your budget for emergencies if you can afford it. Having some money set aside just in case your car breaks down or you lose your job can be a big relief in case of the worst. You may want to establish an emergency savings before saving up for your shopping spree Having enough money to cover your bills for a while if you lose your job, or enough to repair your car if it breaks down can pay off in spades the next time something bad happens.
A common rule of thumb is to have two months of your regular income in savings just in case.

, Once you have determined your expenses and established a budget, see where you can reduce costs to allow for savings for your shopping spree. Start by looking at reducing your non-essential expenses.


If you get coffee every day on your way to work or school, you may want to start having your coffee at home to reduce that expense.
Saving just two dollars a day can add sixty dollars a month to your shopping spree fund.

, You should take your budget seriously, but remember that it isn’t set it stone. You may find that you underestimated how much some things cost per month, or you may decide that you’d rather save a little less and spend a little more on entertainment.A budget it a “fluid document,” which means it can change as you need it to.
Try your best to stick to your budget and consider any changes to it seriously before putting them into practice.

Register your baby products.,
Search government websites for recalls.,
Search baby product specific websites for recalls.,
Research before buying second-hand baby products.,
Determine if your product is affected by a recall.,
Stop using the item.,
Report a safety problem caused by the product.,
Make the necessary repairs.,
Return the item for a replacement.,
Consider getting a refund.,
Inform other parents about the recall.",How to Deal with Baby Product Recalls," One of the simplest ways to stay informed about baby product recalls, is to register the baby products you buy or receive. You can either fill out a product information card that comes with the product and mail it in or fill out the information on the company's website.


Be sure to update your contact information if your address or phone number changes. This way, the company can get a hold of you in case of a recall.;
, You'll probably have some baby products that you couldn't register online. If you'd like to know if the items have been recalled, you'll need to do some research. You should check government websites every few months to stay informed about recent baby product recalls. A few government safety sites you can refer to include:


www.cpsc.gov: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
www.recalls.gov: A website made up of 6 government agencies
www.saferproducts.gov: The Publicly Available Consumer Product Safety Information Database

, If you'd like to know if a specific baby product has been recalled, you can also check parenting or baby care websites. These sites often have user-friendly search features to help you determine if the product is unsafe.For example, most sites will let you search by product category, time period, and the product name or model.

, You've probably seen a lot of used baby equipment being sold at garage sales or thrift stores. While you may see a good deal and be tempted to save some money, do your research about whether or not the product is safe before you buy it. Many thrift stores and garage sales will not accept returns, even if the product turns out to be unsafe.If you're planning on checking thrift stores for a specific type of baby product, it's a good idea to know which products to avoid. For example, if you're looking for a crib, avoid buying any over 10 years old or ones that have a drop-down crib rail since these have all been recalled.

, You may hear of a big baby product recall that's affecting millions of products. Before you throw yours out or return it, find out if your product is actually affected by the recall. Use one of the government or parenting websites and enter your specific product into their database. This will let you know whether or not you'll need to handle a product recall.


Sometimes you may have the same product that is being recalled, but models of a different year are being recalled. Be as specific as possible when entering your item information to get accurate recall information.

, Once you've determined that the product has been recalled, you should stop using it right away. To prevent these problems from happening to your child, you should immediately stop using the product. For example, if you've learned that your child's car seat has been recalled, remove the car seat from the car and put it away until you can return it or throw it away. You'll either need to use a different car seat or wait until you get a replacement from the company.You may be inconvenienced by the recall, but try to act quickly so you can get a refund or replacement as soon as possible.

, If you or your child has harmed by a baby product, go to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission website and file a report. You'll need to provide basic contact information, a description of the product, and describe the problems caused by the harmful product.If you or your child has been injured by a baby product, you should file a report regardless of whether or not the item has been recalled. If the CPSC receives enough reports, it may issue a recall.

, Sometimes a baby product is recalled because it needs a basic repair. If this is the case, contact the manufacturer for a repair kit. They'll send you the free kit along with instructions on how to fix your item.


For example, you may need to swap out a car seat buckle or install longer screws on a crib. These are usually simple repairs that will make the product safe.

, If the baby product can't be repaired or is dangerous, the manufacturer may tell you to return the item for a replacement. In this case, you can return it to the store you purchased the item from and get a replacement product.


If an exact replacement isn't available, the manufacturer may send you a newer model to replace the one you had.

, If you've decided that you don't want the replacement item or don't want to repair the product, you may be able to return it for a refund. Contact the manufacturer to discuss their refund policy regarding recalled products. The manufacturer may ask for you to send the recalled product back to them.


Call or email the manufacturer so you can set up a way to ship the item back for free.

, If you know other parents who have similar products to the one that was recalled, let them know about the recall so they can check their items. You should also ensure that a recalled product isn't sold or traded. For example, if you have a garage sale, avoid selling recalled baby products that could be repaired.


You should also avoid donating recalled items that couldn't be repaired. Many thrift stores have strict policies about what kinds of baby products they'll accept, so check before dropping your items off.

Review the tenant laws in your state or country.,
Review your lease.,
Use a professional letter format.,
Explain the problem and request assistance.,
Make a copy of the letter.,
Send the letter.",How to Write a Tenant Complaint Letter1," Many places have very specific requirements on how a landlord must be notified about repairs or other conditions that are making your apartment or home unlivable. Before drafting a complaint letter, you should review the landlord-tenant laws for your area.


You can review landlord tenant laws for your state at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-landlord-tenant-laws

For a guide to tenant rights in Spain visit: http://www.idealspain.com/pages/information/Tenants.htm
;
, Your lease is the legal contract between you and your landlord. While laws may establish a landlord’s legal duties, a landlord or property owner may have assumed additional responsibilities in the lease. Carefully review your lease for any provisions on repairs and make sure that you follow any requirements for notifying the landlord in the letter., When sending a request for repair letter, your letter should follow a business letter format. This conveys that you are serious about the request and puts the landlord on formal notice about the need for repairs.


Your letter should be typed. If you do not have access to a computer and printer, you can hand print your letter.
Your letter should be addressed to the person who is responsible for repairing your apartment. If both a live-in landlord and a property management company maintain the building, consider addressing the letter to the landlord and sending a copy to the property management company.
Type the addressee’s full name and mailing address at the top left of the page. If you rent from an individual, this should be his or her name and address; if you rent from a company, this would be the name and business address of the property manager.
Your letter should be dated, with the date placed above the address of the landlord or on the right side of the page as the first line of text.
As discussed below, your letter should explain the problem that you are having and request the landlord’s assistance in correcting the problem.
Provide your contact information, including phone number, address and email address so that the landlord can contact you to schedule any repairs.
Sign the letter and type or print your name below your signature.

, A written request for repairs allows you to more fully explain the problem for which you are requesting assistance. Often, tenants have already orally requested a repair and the letter is a second, more formal request, for the landlord’s assistance. When drafting the letter, you should include the following:


A clear and concise description of the problem should be included in the opening paragraph of the letter. Be as specific as you can in describing the problem. For example, instead of saying “I have a leak” say instead, “There is a slow leak in the plumbing under the kitchen sink.”
Provide the date on which the problem began. If you are unsure of the exact date, provide the approximate date or the month in which you first noticed the problem(s) or began having the issue.
If you previously requested that the landlord repair the problem, your letter should include the date(s) that you spoke to the landlord about the problem.
If you are requesting a minor repair, it may be helpful if you explain how the minor problem could become worse. For example, if you are asking for the tile grout to be replaced because some of it is missing, you could state that you are concerned that water is getting behind the tile and may cause a serious mold condition.
Highlighting how a problem could get worse or become dangerous may motivate a landlord to make minor repairs.
Explain any steps that you have taken to resolve the problem, including if you obtained an opinion or estimate from a professional. If your received an estimate, you should attach it to your letter.
In a new paragraph, you should request that the landlord fix or resolve the issues. You can request that the problem(s) be fixed by a certain date, and if necessary, describe how you would like the issue resolved. You can also offer your assistance in fixing the problem., You should make a copy of the letter for your records. If the landlord refuses to make the repairs, you may need the letter to present as evidence in small claims or housing court.

, While it may be easier to send the letter via email, if you have previously requested assistance and your landlord has failed to rectify the problem, you should send the letter by certified mail. You can also send the letter via email or facsimile but this should be in addition to a hardcopy letter being sent.


A hardcopy letter should be sent via certified mail. This will allow you to document that the letter was delivered to the landlord.
You may begin checking the United States Post Office (“USPS”) website for delivery confirmation approximately 2-3 days after mailing a letter by certified mail. You can find the USPS’s track and confirm utility on its website at https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input. Once you receive confirmation of delivery, print it, and staple it to your copy of the letter.
If you have corresponded with the addressee via e-mail in the past, you may choose to deliver your complaint letter as an attachment to an e-mail, in addition to hardcopy. When delivering a legal letter via e-mail, request a delivery receipt. Check your e-mail reader’s documentation for instructions on how to do this using your specific e-mail software.
Once you receive confirmation of e-mail delivery, print it and staple it to your hardcopy of the letter.
Sending a letter by fax is appropriate in most cases where the recipient commonly uses a fax for business purposes. If you rent from a company or individual that maintains office hours, you may choose to send your letter via fax to the business’s fax number.
Most fax machines print a delivery confirmation page, which you should staple to your copy of the letter.

Keep your headline short and to the point. Remember, this is just to draw in potential roommates.
For example, if you are looking for a roommate who attends a nearby college or university, you could use the headline, ""Roommate Wanted to Share Great Apartment Near Campus!""
If you have pets, you could write “Cat lover seeking cat lover to share great apartment and kitty cuddles.”

, One of the most important items potential roommates look for in an ad is the apartment or house location. This can help weed out potential roommates who may not like the location or cannot afford it.


Include basic information about the location such as if it is a house, an apartment building, and how many people live there.If you want to protect your privacy, only include the apartment building name, not your unit number.

Make sure to include features about the apartment such as furnished, clean, friendly community, carpeting, windows, washer and dryer, and air conditioning.

If you are looking for someone who could go out with you, you could write “located in an area close to restaurants, bars and nightlife.”

, Write a brief description of the current occupants of the house including you, other roommates, and pets. This can also help weed out people who may not have similar needs or wants as you.Include information about how you and any other occupants use the apartment or house, whether it is active or quiet, or if people work or stay at home all day.Make sure to include the sex and age range of everyone living in the apartment or house., It might seem like you are being picky to include the type of roommate you want, but the point of your ad is to attract someone with whom you can live. Listing specifics such as nonsmoker, male or female, and attributes is very important and can help you run avoid uncomfortable situations down the road.Depending on where you live, there may be discrimination laws about excluding certain people or groups as roommates.

This part of the ad should make the right person say “that’s the flat or house for me.”Make sure to include information about items such as cleaning expectations, behavior in common areas, cooking, smoking, parties, and guests.

, Towards the end of your ad, include financial information about renting with you. Be as specific as possible and make sure to include any additional fees such as utilities or cleaning costs.

Make sure that you comply with lease.,
Request a walkthrough.,
Document your vacated apartment.,
Review your state’s laws.,
Draft a letter requesting your deposit.",How to Write a Tenant Complaint Letter2," Most leases outline the reasons why a landlord can keep your security deposit. Before vacating an apartment, make sure that you satisfy all requirements under the lease so that the landlord cannot justifiably keep your deposit. Some justifications a landlord may use to keep your deposit include:


Failure to pay rent.
Failure to leave the apartment in a clean condition.
Failure to make minor repairs.
Failure to give appropriate notice of vacating the apartment.
Failure to return keys.
Failure to remove trash or all personal belongings., Before leaving your apartment, you can request that the landlord walkthrough the apartment with you and note any issues that need to be remedied before you leave. If you have significantly damaged the apartment, you may be required to repair the property. However, you are not responsible for normal wear and tear on the apartment that occurs from reasonable use of the space.


By requesting a walkthrough, you are putting the responsibility on the landlord to note any issues before you leave so he or she can not use them as a justification for failing to return your security deposit later., After you have cleaned the apartment and removed all of your belongings, you should photograph the condition in which you left the apartment. By having documentation, a landlord cannot justifiably claim that you left the apartment in a condition that violated the lease., Most states have laws that detail the timeframe a landlord has for returning your security deposit. You can review state laws at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/security-deposit-limits-deadlines-your-state-36186.html.


Make sure that you give your landlord your forwarding address so that he or she can return your deposit to you., If your landlord fails to return all or some of your deposit within the timeframe set forth by your state’s law, you should draft a letter requesting the return of your deposit. Your letter should include the following:


A detailed description of the condition that you left the apartment and why you are entitled to receive your deposit back.
If the landlord kept a portion of your deposit and you dispute his or her reasoning, you should explain why the landlord wasn’t justified in keeping any of your deposit. You can send a copy of the pictures of the apartment as evidence of the condition of the apartment when you vacated it.
Cite your state’s laws regarding the return of the security deposit and explain that the landlord is violating the law.
Explain that you will take the landlord to small claims court unless the matter is resolved.
Send the letter certified mail via the United States Postal Service."

Structural problems, such as damaged walls or roof.
Failing to provide working locks on windows and doors.
Failing to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.
Unsafe or unsanitary stairways.
Damaged electrical or plumbing services.
Failing to rectify rodent or pest infestations.
Failing to evict drug sellers living in the building., Your landlord may not be aware of the dangerous condition on the property and therefore you must send the landlord a letter notifying him or her of the condition. Your letter should include:


A detailed description of the hazard.
If you previously notified the landlord of the condition, state when you gave prior notice.
State that you have serious concerns for your personal safety.
Describe the potential and foreseeable harm that could occur, such as fire or burglary.
If you are concerned about a lack of security precautions such as workable locks or a gate over a window leading to a fire escape, you can note (if applicable) recent incidents of crime in your area.
Request that that the situation be rectified immediately.
Sign and date your letter.
Send your letter via certified mail and keep a copy for your records.You can view a sample notice letter at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-letter-alerting-landlord-dangerous-conditions.html.

, If your landlord fails to make the necessary repairs, you should take steps to minimize the potential harm. This can include:


Having the problem fixed and deducting the cost from your rent.

Breaking your lease.

Withholding rent.
You should review your state’s laws in order to act in accordance with any legal requirements. However, your first concern should be your personal safety.

Have a tenants’ meeting.,
Create a petition.,
Draft a letter to the landlord.",How to Write a Tenant Complaint Letter4," If there are general improvements that need to be made to a rental building to make it more habitable, consider holding a tenants’ meeting to discuss the matter. At the meeting you should discuss the need for large-scale repairs, such as replacing all of the windows or a continually out of service elevator, and vote on the most important repairs needed in the building. By having a consensus, the tenants are in a much stronger bargaining position than if one tenant requested improvements.

, Once the demands have been agreed upon, one tenant should draft a petition that outlines the requests for specific improvements and contains signature pages for tenants to add their names and apartment numbers.


The petition should be posted in a common area to maximize tenants reviewing and signing the document.
The petition can also be circulated at tenants’ meetings or other gatherings.
A person could also go door-to-door soliciting support from other tenants in the building.

, Once you have gathered a significant number of signatures, you should draft a letter to the landlord requesting the improvements. You should attach the petition and signatures of the tenants to the letter. In addition, the letter should include:


A polite request for the landlord to make the improvements and/or repairs.
A specific date by which the landlord should respond to the request.
An explanation of why the tenants believe the repairs are necessary.
If this is the first request for improvements, it may not be in the tenants’ best interest to threaten repercussions if the landlord fails to act. However, the letter should be firmly worded so that the landlord takes the request seriously.
The letter should be sent via certified mail and a copy should be maintained by the tenants association or by the person spearheading the petition.You can view a sample petition letter at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-group-petition-landlord-repairs-property-improvements.html.

How much advance notice you must give the tenant. Most states give tenants a chance to pay their rent and get caught up.
What the eviction notice must say. Usually, you must tell the tenant that he or she can stay in the apartment if back rent is paid.
How you must deliver the notice to the tenant. In most states, you can’t just slide it under the door. Instead, you will probably have to hand-deliver it or mail it to the tenant.;
, After reading your state law, you should draft your notice. This is called a “Pay Rent or Quit” Notice. Your state might tell you exactly what you have to put in the notice. Make sure to follow the requirements exactly.


Your state law might have different requirements depending on whether the tenant is a month-to-month tenant without a lease or a tenant with a lease.
In Maine, for example, a notice must include the following language: “If you pay the amount of rent due as of the date of this notice before this notice expires, then this notice as it applies to rent arrearage is void. After this notice expires, if you pay all rental arrears, all rent due as of the date of payment and any filing fees and service of process fees actually paid by the landlord before the writ of possession issues at the completion of the eviction process, then your tenancy will be reinstated.”, Your state law will also tell you how to deliver the notice. In many states you can mail the notice. However, some states will require that you personally deliver the notice to the tenant.If you don’t deliver the notice properly, then the tenant can raise this as a defense in an eviction lawsuit.
Make sure that you deliver the notice with enough advance notice. In most states, the tenant has three to five days to pay back rent.If your state requires that the tenant be given five days’ notice, don’t deliver it with only four days’ notice.

, Your state law probably requires that you accept the back rent if the tenant can scrape it together before the deadline in the notice. You shouldn’t try to avoid the tenant. Don’t refuse to open your door when the tenant comes knocking with the rent.


Realize that you can get rid of a problem tenant by not renewing their lease at the end of the lease term. However, as long as they come up with the rent before the deadline, then you are legally obligated to accept it.

, You might be tempted to change the locks on your tenant’s doors or cut off their utilities. State law prohibits you from engaging in any form of self-help. If you do, then the tenant could call the police on you and file a report.


Don’t change the locks or remove the tenant’s door.
Don’t cut off utilities.
Don’t use force or threaten to use force.
Don’t physically remove the tenant or the tenant’s property., You would probably benefit from meeting with an attorney to discuss the eviction process. An experienced landlord-tenant lawyer can look over your notice to see if it is sufficient. The lawyer can also answer any questions you have about the eviction process.


To find a landlord-tenant attorney, you can contact your state or local bar association, which should run a referral program.
Once you have a referral, call the lawyer and schedule a consultation. Most lawyers will offer half hour consultations for free or for a reduced price.

, You should be prepared to show the judge detailed financial records. You want to make sure that you don’t come across as a landlord who might have received a rent check but not have properly credited it to the tenant.


Go through your financial records and make sure that the tenant didn’t pay rent.
Print out spreadsheets which show that the tenant made payment in the past and when. You might need to go through your bank statements and find the dates.

, You should also go through all of your communications with the tenant. Look for emails or letters the tenant sent you. Also read your responses. Look to see if you gave the tenant permission to be late with the rent.


The tenant might also claim that she withheld rent because of a serious defect in the apartment, such as a broken toilet or lack of water pressure. Check to see if you received any kind of notice.
If the tenant did contact you about needing repairs, then he or she might have a valid claim for not paying rent. In some states, a tenant can withhold rent if you fail to make necessary repairs.Show your lawyer any communication you received from the tenant about necessary repairs. Depending on your state law, you might not be able to evict if you have refused to make repairs.

, Some large cities have housing courts where you can bring eviction lawsuits. In most other places, you can sue in small claims court. Small claims courts are designed so that you don’t need to have a lawyer represent you.Also, the process is more informal.


Check to see if your city or county has a housing court or a small claims court. If you are unsure, you can stop into the courthouse and ask.
If you have a lawyer and want to file in regular civil court, then you can choose to do so.

, You start the eviction lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. A complaint is a legal document that identifies you and the tenant. It also explains the facts that have led to the eviction.


Most housing and small claims courts have printed “fill in the blank” forms that you can use. Ask the court clerk.
Even many regular civil courts have printed forms as well. If no form is available, then ask the court clerk if there is a sample complaint you can use as a guide.
You might have to hire a lawyer if no sample is available.

, Type neatly with dark ink, or use a typewriter. Each form will ask for slightly different information, but each should generally ask for the following:your name and address
the tenant’s name and address
the amount of rent and when it was due
the date you gave the tenant the “Pay Rent or Quit” Notice
any amount of back rent you want to sue for

, Make several copies of the complaint and take all copies, along with the original, to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date.


You will have to pay a filing fee, which will vary depending on the court. Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of payment.

, You have to give the tenant notice of the eviction lawsuit. Unfortunately, you typically can’t just hand-deliver it to the tenant yourself. Instead, your court will have specific rules for delivering service. You should ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of service.


Typically, you will need someone to hand-deliver the notice to the tenant. You can often pay the sheriff to make personal service on the tenant, or you can hire a private process server.You can find process servers in the phone book or on the Internet. They typically charge $45-75 per service.
You might also be able to have anyone 18 or older who is not a part of the lawsuit hand-deliver the notice.In some courts, you can mail the complaint to the tenant.

, Whoever makes service on the tenant needs to complete a “proof of service” or equivalent form. The purpose of this form is to show the judge that service was made on the tenant. You can get the form from the court clerk to give to your server.


After service is made, the server completes the form and returns it to you. You must then file it with the court.Keep a copy of all court documents for your own records.

, The tenant might fight the eviction. If so, he or she will file an “answer” in the court. In the answer, the tenant admits or denies the allegations in your complaint. The tenant may also state a reason why the eviction is illegal.


For example, the tenant might claim that you have engaged in illegal discrimination on the basis of race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, religion, etc. If you are accused of discrimination, then you should meet with a lawyer. A discrimination charge is serious, and you need to begin building a defense as soon as possible.
The tenant might also claim that he or she withheld rental payments because something is wrong with the apartment. Often, your state law will not allow a tenant to withhold rent. Even if the law allows it, the tenant usually has to notify you and give you a chance to make the repairs.If the tenant never gave you notice, then this is usually a weak defense.

, On the day of your hearing, you should arrive early. Give yourself enough time to find parking at the courthouse and to go through any security. Bring copies of all documents that you filed in the lawsuit.


As the landlord bringing the unlawful detainer suit, you will present your evidence first. In small claims court or housing court, the presentation may be fairly informal. Tell the judge that the tenant hasn’t paid rent. You can also ask the judge if he or she would like to see your records or the “Pay Rent or Quit” Notice.
The judge might ask you some questions. Always wait for the judge to stop talking before answering. Be sure to call the judge “Your Honor.”
Listen to the tenant’s side of the story. You can’t interrupt. If the tenant says that he withheld rent because you didn’t perform repairs, then tell the judge that you never received notice that repairs were needed (if this is the truth).

, You will get a “warrant of eviction” if you win the lawsuit. It is a court order that the tenancy has been terminated and the tenant can be evicted. It may go by a different name in your court.


You can’t evict the tenant yourself. Instead, most states will require that you contact the sheriff. Take your warrant of eviction to the sheriff and possibly pay a fee. The sheriff will then notify the tenant of the eviction date and supervise the removal of the tenant.If the tenant disappears but leaves his or her property behind, then you need to read your state’s laws to find out what steps to take next. See Handle a Tenant's Abandoned Property for more information.

Set up a wallet.,
Evaluate your wallet options.,
Sell products or services for bitcoins.,
Mine for bitcoins.,
Buy bitcoins.",How to Send Bitcoins," Though the process of sending money with a software wallet may vary from one platform to another, the steps should follow the same basic procedure. It will generally be very similar to sending money through an online checking account.Open your software wallet and click on the ""Send"" tab, or use the ""Trade|Send Bitcoin"" option under your wallet's menu.
Type in the destination address for your intended recipient's wallet. You can type it by hand, copy and paste it from your system clipboard, or drag and drop the recipient's QR code.
Choose a label so that you can track your bitcoin transaction.
Type in the value you want transferred in the ""BTC"" box.
Review the details to ensure that you have entered the correct information.
Click ""Send"" to complete the transfer.
Once completed, the transfer is not reversible. It can take around one hour for the transaction to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network, but you and the recipient will instantly be able to see that the transaction was completed.;
, If you're using a paper wallet, you'll need to access the physical wallet and transfer them to your software wallet. Once your bitcoins are in your software wallet, you can then proceed with the transaction like you would for any other software wallet transaction.Scan the QR code on your paper wallet, or type the unique series of letters and numbers into your software wallet.
Check the balance on your paper wallet to ensure that you have sufficient funds.
Next, you'll need to either import your private key or sweep it.
Importing simply loads the bitcoins in the private key of your paper wallet into your software wallet. Your bitcoins will be accessible through both the paper and software wallets, much like a checkbook and a debit card, so it's important to protect your paper wallet if you import.
Sweeping does the same thing as importing, but it uses a new unique Bitcoin address to protect your bitcoins. When sweeping, no bitcoins remain in your paper wallet.Perform the bitcoin transaction as you would with a regular software wallet.

, Sending someone bitcoins using a hosted wallet is essentially the same as using a software wallet.Many hosted wallets depict their services as an online bank, but it's important to be careful when conducting transactions through hosted wallets, as these services generally lack the insurance/security of an actual online bank.If the website or service that hosts your wallet disappears, you can lose all of the bitcoins you had stored in that hosted wallet.

, A Bitcoin wallet works similar to the real wallet in your pocket: it allows you to spend and receive currency (in this case, that currency is bitcoins). In order to conduct transactions, you'll need your own Bitcoin wallet, which you can get for free online.A Bitcoin wallet can take the form of computer software, computer hardware, or a physical piece of paper.
Your Bitcoin wallet is where you will store, receive, and distribute bitcoins.
Each Bitcoin wallet is composed of unique private keys, which you use to spend or transfer bitcoins., In order to make bitcoin transactions, you'll need to choose and set up a Bitcoin wallet. There are three primary types of Bitcoin wallets:


Software wallets - this Bitcoin wallet is effectively a digital wallet. It is convenient because it stores bitcoins on your device, which simplifies the spending/receiving processes, but the downside is that software wallets are more susceptible to hackers.

Hosted wallets - these digital Bitcoin wallets are operated by a third party company. They offer the same advantages as a software wallet, but you'll need to be sure that you trust the particular third party company and their platform before using a hosted wallet.
Physical wallets - a physical wallet is essentially a physical paper ledger used to keep funds safe offline. You can easily receive bitcoins from others into your physical wallet, but you'll need to import your bitcoins into a software or hosted wallet online in order to spend them., There are three main types of Bitcoin wallets, but there are many variations on those primary categories. Which type of wallet you choose will depend on your needs and experience/proficiency with using bitcoins.


If you're new to Bitcoin, it may be best to use a software wallet that won't require huge downloads or commitments (called ""thin client software""). Try a wallet like Electrum or Multibit.
If you'd rather let someone else handle the process of securing bitcoins, you may want to try using a hosted wallet service. These wallets can be setup and accessed on any browser or a mobile app, but do your research to be sure you can trust the host.
If you plan on storing up bitcoins with no intentions of making frequent transactions, an offline storage wallet might be best for you. You can use a physical paper wallet or an offline software wallet such as Armory.
If you have some experience and proficiency in using the Bitcoin system, you may want to use something like Bitcoin-QT or Armory instead of a third party server. You'll be able to store the entirety of each block chain on your computer, but you'll need a lot of storage space (at least 16 gigabytes)., Every new bitcoin that comes into existence is the product of a previous transaction. The only way to get bitcoins when you don't have any is by receiving them in a transaction from someone else, buying them for cash, or by mining new bitcoins.For more information on receiving bitcoins, see how to receive bitcoin.
If you know someone who currently uses Bitcoin, you may request that that person sends you a predetermined number of bitcoins.
If you do not know anyone who uses Bitcoin, you may receive bitcoins by offering some type of transaction with other Bitcoin users, and you will be paid in bitcoins.
The other option is to ""mine"" for bitcoins.

, If you cannot get bitcoins from anyone else in the Bitcoin network, you can earn them by mining for them. Mining simply means that you solve a complex mathematical puzzle which helps verify other people's transaction histories, and in return you're awarded with free bitcoins. It's free to receive bitcoins, but you'll typically pay a fee for sending them in a transaction.However, mining is an expensive and very complicated way to get bitcoins at this time and not practical for most people.


For more information on mining, see how to mine bitcoins.

, If you do not know anyone on Bitcoin, do not have anything to sell, and do not want to mine for new bitcoins, you can buy bitcoins through the network.This can be done in one of three ways:


Buy bitcoins from a person - you can purchase bitcoins through person-to-person marketplaces and pay with cash (in person or deposit), bank transfers, money wires, PayPal, and other methods. The trick is finding someone trustworthy, so it may be worth using an escrow service (such as LocalBitcoins) to protect yourself against fraudulent offers.Buy bitcoins from an exchange/outlet - exchanges and outlets is essentially on online service that either facilitates transactions between users (exchange) or sells their own accrued bitcoins directly to customers (outlet). You'll need to create an account and have your identity verified before you can use an exchange or outlet.Buy bitcoins through an ATM - you can purchase bitcoins from a physical Bitcoin ATM using cash, though many bitcoins are one-directional and only allow you to either buy bitcoins or trade them for cash. Many government regulations dictate whether an ATM can be installed and where, so finding an ATM near you may be difficult."

Pay attention to the relevant deadlines.",How to Perform a 1031 Exchange," In order to conduct a 1031 exchange—and safely navigate the complexities of the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code—you should either (1) have a sophisticated understanding of the portions of the United States Code governing 1031 tax-deferred exchangesor (2) find a qualified professional to assist you. Because tax laws change and new tax regulations are issued periodically, your best bet for a successful 1031 exchange is to enlist the help of a professional.An attorney, tax specialist, or accountant will not only help you understand exactly what you need to do in order to conduct a valid 1031 exchange but can also ensure that you don't make any mistakes during the process.
A real estate agent will also be helpful—especially if they have been a part of a 1031 exchange before—and should know what language to insert in the relevant contracts to make the exchange go as smooth as possible.
As soon as you decide to conduct a 1031 exchange, be sure to tell any professionals you will be working with during the exchange (i.e., your attorney, your real estate agent, etc.) of your intent so they can properly assist you in conducting the transaction.;
, This property—commonly referred to as the ""relinquished property,"" because this is the property you will be giving up in exchange for another—is the property you will be exchanging for another in this transaction in order to defer capital-gains taxes.Your next step, then, is to find someone who is willing to purchase your property at the amount at which you wish to sell it.


Once you have found someone willing to purchase your relinquished property, you will enter into a Purchase & Sale Agreement with the buyer.

, To facilitate the 1031 exchange, you will want to insert special language referencing the 1031 exchange in the Purchase & Sale Agreement for your relinquished property.You can do this yourself, if you decide to draft the agreement on your own. If you have hired the services of an attorney to complete the transaction and draft the agreement, instruct him or her to include 1031 language.


This clause in the agreement should read something like: ""Buyer understands it is Seller's intention to use this transaction as part of a 1031 Exchange, and hereby agrees to cooperate with Seller to accomplish same.""
This is important because the Buyer will have to sign certain exchange documents in order for you to successfully complete your 1031 exchange., A key aspect of a 1031 exchange is that you are not simply selling one property and then using the proceeds from that sale to buy another. Rather, the selling of the relinquished property and buying of the replacement property is conducted as one transaction. To achieve this, you will generally use what is known as a ""Qualified Intermediary""—a third party that will handle the funds throughout the exchange—to conduct the transaction.Generally, you will use either a bankor a law firmas your Qualified Intermediary.

, Once you have identified a Qualified Intermediary you wish to use, you will enter into an Exchange Agreement with the Qualified Intermediary. This agreement will allow the intermediary to receive the funds from the sale of your relinquished property, hold those funds, and then eventually use them to purchase your replacement property.The reason for this is that, to receive the tax-deferment benefits of a 1031 exchange, you must not have direct control over the funds from the sale of your relinquished property, otherwise the IRS will treat this as a sale and subsequent purchase—not a 1031 exchange.This agreement should provide that you will be assigning seller's rights for the relinquished property and buyer's rights for the replacement property to your intermediary, so it can act on your behalf without you ever directly controlling the funds involved in the exchange.You must enter into this agreement with a Qualified Intermediary before the closing date for the sale of the relinquished property., This property—commonly referred to as the ""replacement property,"" because this is the property that will be replacing your relinquished property—is the property you will be acquiring with the proceeds from the sale of your relinquished property in order to defer capital-gains taxes. You must identify the replacement property/properties in writing, sign the document, and deliver it to your Qualified Intermediary within the 45-day timeframe.You may identify up to three potential replacement properties regardless of their value. If you wish to acquire more than three replacement properties, you may identify more than three potential replacement properties so long as the total fair market value of your identified properties does not exceed 200% of the sale price of your relinquished property.This replacement property/properties should have a fair market value greater than or equal to your relinquished property in order for the exchange to be completely tax-deferred.If the replacement property is real property, you must provide the street address and name of the property in your written identification.
You have 45 days from the sale of your relinquished property in which to select and identify replacement property.

, The next step is to have your intermediary enter into a sale agreement with the seller of your replacement property. Your intermediary will, according to your Exchange Agreement, use the funds it received from the sale of your relinquished property to buy the replacement property. The seller will deed the property to you, receive payment from the intermediary, and then you will receive your replacement property.This Purchase & Sale Agreement should include specific 1031 language, similar to the Purchase & Sale Agreement for your relinquished property.
You must complete the exchange and receive title to your replacement property within 180 days of the sale of your relinquished property or the due date of the income-tax return for the year in which such property was sold—whichever date is earlier., After you complete the exchange, in order to receive the tax-deferment benefit of the exchange, you must complete and file IRS Form 8824—Like-Kind Exchanges—in the tax year in which the exchange occurred.This form is available online via the IRS' website., A Section 1031 exchange is a product of federal law, which is why you must report such an exchange to the IRS. Certain states, such as California, also have state-reporting requirements for 1031 exchanges conducted in their territory.You will have to complete and submit an additional form in order for your 1031 exchange to comply with the laws of your state.


Tax law is quite complex, and the best way to find out if your state has a 1031 reporting requirement is to consult with an experienced tax attorney.
You can also try searching for this information online using the phrase ""<<your state>> 1031 reporting"" and looking over the results to see if any state websites provide forms for state-reporting purposes., In order for your 1031 exchange to be valid, the exchange must be between properties of the same type, or kind. Quality or level of improvement of the property is not a factor. Generally, all real property (i.e., land and/or buildings) is considered like-kind with all other real property.Some examples that satisfy this type of ""like-kind"" exchange requirement include:Unused land in exchange for rental property.
A single-family rental property in exchange for a multi-family rental property.
Retail space in exchange for a hotel.
A farm/ranch in exchange for a golf course.
Take note that real property located within the United States is never like-kind to real property located outside of the United States.If you are unsure as to whether the properties being exchanged are like-kind—or, for that matter, if you have questions about this or any of the following requirements, consider the benefits of paying a (relatively) small amount of money for the advice of a professional instead of finding out later that your exchange was invalid and that any associated gains are fully taxable.

, While the ""like-kind"" requirement is relatively loose when it comes to real property, the requirements for the exchange of personal property are much stricter.For example, cars and trucks—while both vehicles—are not considered like-kind as far as the IRS is concerned.


If you are contemplating a 1031 exchange that involves personal property, be sure to seek the advice of a qualified tax attorney or accountant regarding whether the property you are planning to exchange satisfies the like-kind requirement.

, For property to be exchanged via Section 1031, all properties involved in the exchange must be held either for (1) use in a trade or business or (2) investment.If the property is mainly used for personal reasons, like a primary residence or a vacation home, you cannot use it to complete a 1031 exchange.

, There are certain types of property that are specifically excluded from 1031 exchanges, and you should make sure that your intended exchange does not involve any of these types of properties. They are:Inventory or stock in trade (i.e., property held primarily for sale).
Stocks, bonds, or notes.
Other securities or debt.
Partnership interests.
Certificates of trust.

, There are two important time limits placed on a 1031 exchange that you must follow. If you do not strictly adhere to these deadlines, your 1031 exchange will be invalid. It is unlikely you will be able to receive an extension on either of these deadlines.Remember, you have 45 days from the date you close on the sale of your relinquished property to identify potential replacement property/properties and generally must complete the exchange within 180 days of that date.
These timeframes include business days, holidays, and weekends."

In Utah, for example, real estate agents must use the printed form provided by the state.However, if you are not a real estate agent, then you can revise the form.
Other groups, such as realtor’s associations, may have also created a form you can use. Look for those as well.;
, You want a real estate purchase agreement that is easy to read. Accordingly, you should set up your purchase agreement by opening a blank word processing document and setting the font to something readable.


Remember to use bold typeface throughout the document as well. For example, you can put section headings in bold. Doing so makes it easier for the reader to scan and find the information they are looking for.
You can also set up the contract as a template by inserting blank lines in the place of information that will change from contract to contract. In this way, you can use the contract more than once.

, At the top of the document, you should insert the title “Real Estate Purchase Contract” in bold. You can center the title between the left- and right-hand margins., You should also identify the parties at the very start of the contract. You also should put the address of the property. You may also need to include the legal description of property or else attach a copy of the legal description.


Sample language could read: “Michael Jones (‘Buyer’) offers and agrees to buy from Kelley Smith (‘Seller’), upon the conditions and terms set forth in this contract (‘Contract’), the property legally described as (‘Property’).”, Earnest money is the amount of money the buyer gives the seller to show that they are serious about going through with the sale.You should identify the amount and also state where the earnest money will be held as you wait for the final sale to go through.


Sample language could read: “Earnest money in the amount of $50,000 cash shall be deposited in the trust account of the selling broker on the first legal banking day after this offer is accepted.”, You want to explicitly state the purchase price and then state that the earnest money will be applied to the purchase price. For example, you could write:


“The total purchase price is $300,000. After earnest money is credited, the remaining balance will be paid by Buyer at closing.”, In addition to selling the property, you may also be selling items in the house or on the property. You should identify them individually. For example, you may include the following in the sale:washer
dryer
refrigerator
microwave oven
plumbing
heating and air conditioning fixtures
oven range and cook top
dishwasher
ceiling fans, light fixtures and bulbs
curtain rods, curtains, and blinds
storm doors and windows
fencing

, You should list the closing date, which is also the day that the buyer gets possession of the property. You can also include a clause that the seller should remove all personal property before the closing.


Sample language could read: “Closing date will be on or before May 20, 2016. Possession will be given to Buyer at that time. Seller agrees to keep the property in a comparable condition and agrees that Buyer shall have the right to inspect prior to closing. Seller shall remove all personal property not included in the purchase price before closing.”, Closing a real estate deal involves many fees and taxes which must be paid. These are the “closing costs.” Your real estate contract should identify what closing costs the seller will pay and which ones the buyer will pay. For example, you could divide them this way:The seller will pay the existing loan and liens related to the sale of the property. The seller also typically pays the title insurance policy, as well as the seller settlement fees and real estate commissions.
The buyer may pay transfer taxes, recording fees for the deed, any transfer fees, settlement fees, and all of the buyer’s loan-related expenses.

, The buyer and seller should also agree how to divide the property taxes. They can be prorated according to an agreed upon amount or on a percentage based on how long each party owned the property. Alternately, one party could agree to pay all of the taxes., A contingency is a condition that must be satisfied before the contract can become legally binding.If a contingency isn’t met, the buyer doesn’t need to go ahead with the purchase. There are many contingencies buyers might want in a contract, such as the following:appraisal
home inspection
financing, such as mortgage availability or successful selling of the buyer’s house

, This will protect the buyer in case the home is appraised a lower value than expected. You should also state whether the parties will renegotiate the price if the appraisal was low.


You could write, “This offer is contingent on the property appraising for at least the purchase price. If the appraisal is lower than the purchase price, then the parties may renegotiate the purchase price.”, An inspection offers protection to both sellers and buyers. The buyer can back out of the sale if the inspection finds unreported damage. Also, the seller can avoid a lawsuit by disclosing damage, which only an inspector might be able to find. You should certainly include a contingency regarding a home inspection. You also should state what options the parties have if problems are uncovered:The buyer can simply accept the existing condition and go ahead with the purchase.
The seller can correct the condition and have the inspector certify that the problem has been corrected.
The parties may negotiate a settlement, such as a reduction in the purchase price.
The buyer has the option of cancelling the contract if no agreement can be reached.

, This contingency protects the buyer so that they won’t have to go forward with the purchase if they can’t come up with the money. You can include different contingencies, depending on the circumstances:


A contingency that the buyer will obtain a loan and provide the seller a commitment letter from the lender.A contingency that the buyer must be able to sell their home: “This offer is contingent upon the sale and close of Buyer’s property located at 6231 Mullholland Drive, Any City, California, 12345 within the time period for closing the Seller’s property.”, The seller usually must warrant (promise) that certain things are true. The buyer can rely on these promises and, if the promise turns out to be false, cancel the contract. Warranties are also called “representations.” Sellers can include many warranties, such as the following:they will convey to buyer good and marketable title
they will purchase and provide a title insurance policy
the property is not violating zoning and other codes
there are no encroachments, easements, or setbacks on the property

, If one party fails to live up to its obligations under the real estate contract, the other party usually has options. You can spell out in the contract those options.


You could write, “If either party fails to perform its obligations under this Contract, the other party can do any of the following: (1) cancel the Contract, (2) sue in court for specific performance, (3) sue for compensatory and actual damages.”, Sometimes disputes are minor and neither party wants to cancel the contract or sue. You can agree in the real estate contract how you will resolve these disputes before or after closing. For example, you could agree to mediate disputes. In mediation, a neutral third party listens to the dispute and tries to help both sides reach a resolution.


A sample mediation clause would state: “All disputes relating to this Contract shall first be submitted to mediation. The parties will jointly select a mediator and share 50-50 the costs of mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, then the parties can seek other remedies as spelled out in this Contract.”, In the contract, you want the seller to agree that the closing company can deduct a percentage from the sale and give it to the real estate broker as their commission. You should identify the amount, which could be stated as a percentage of the purchase price. If more than one broker or real estate firm is to get a commission, then list information for each.


Sample language could read, “Seller authorizes the closing company to deduct from Seller and pay commissions as follows at closing: will receive 3% of the purchase price.”, The property might be damaged after the date the agreement is signed but before the closing date. Accordingly, you need to assign the risk of loss to either party. Generally, the seller will assume the risk of loss until the closing date.


You could write, “If any part of the property is damaged or destroyed by flood, earthquake, fire, vandalism, or act of God prior to closing, the risk of loss or damage will be borne by Seller. However, if the costs of repairing the loss exceeds 10% of the Purchase Price, then either Seller or Buyer may choose to cancel this Contract by providing written notice to the other Party. Earnest Money deposits shall be returned to Buyer.”, You should include a sentence stating what law will apply to the contract if there is a legal dispute. You should pick the law of the state where the property is located.


For example, you could write, “This contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio.”, You want to make sure that everyone understands that the written contract represents the entire agreement. Accordingly, you want to include a “merger” clause, which states that no prior agreements are valid.


For example, you could write, “This Contract contains all conditions, agreements, and covenants between the parties with respect to the subject matter. It supersedes prior agreements, understandings, and correspondence, whether in written or oral form. This Contract represents the complete statement of its terms and cannot be modified except by a written agreement signed by both parties. Any waiver must be in writing and cannot be inferred from conduct.”, The real estate contract should clearly state the deadline for the buyer to accept the offer. After that point, the offer will expire.


Sample language could read, “Offer Expiration Date and Time: February 3, 2016. If not Accepted by this date and time, this offer will expire. At any time before the other party communicates acceptance, Seller may withdraw the offer and communicate the withdrawal to the other party. Seller will then deliver a Notice of Withdrawal.”, There should be signature blocks for the seller and the buyer each. Make sure that there are lines for the following information:name
title
date
address
fax number or email address

, This article describes a real estate contract that is appropriate for a basic home sale. Your needs might vary. To check that you have included everything, you should schedule a meeting with a real estate lawyer who can review the contract and offer suggestions.


You can find a real estate lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral. Visit the American Bar Association to find your nearest bar association: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.
Call up ahead of time and ask the lawyer how much it will cost for a contract review.

First, make sure your home is in the best condition possible.,
Make a list of all improvements and upgrades you have done to the home over the past 3 to 5 years.,
If you have any animals inside or outside, make sure they will not be a nuisance to your appraiser.

,
Clear all items away from the exterior of the house.,
If you have a copy of any legal or building documents they may be helpful.",How to Prepare for a Home Appraisal," Although appraisers are not home inspectors, they will be looking at the quality and condition of your home. Fix as many of the small issues as possible before the appraiser arrived. Make your beds and clean up. Most appraisers take photos of all rooms.;
, Have this list ready for the appraiser when they arrive. This will save time and allow the appraiser to visually look and see what items will actually affect your home's value.

,, Not only will the appraiser be photographing the exterior (and most likely the interior as well) but they will also need to measure the exterior of the home.

, This includes plats or surveys, blueprints, homeowners declarations or condo covenants, recent home inspection or appraisal reports, etc.

Congrats!",How to Send Bitcoin from a Paper Wallet,"

As of December, 2016 the following apps support importing a private key from a paper wallet:

Blockchain.info
Airbitz
Mycelium
Breadwallet


For the sake of clarity, this article will use Blockchain.info, although the techniques will be similar on each app.;
, Follow the instructions provided on the screen of your app., This is a crucial step! Almost all bitcoin wallets will create a 6 -24 word phrase that you can use to backup and restore your wallet. The backup phrase is not the same as the password for your app. If you lose the backup phrase, you may lose your bitcoins forever! In addition, if someone else has access to that backup phrase they can steal all your bitcoins, so secure that phrase like it was a gold nugget.

Write it on paper with a pen. Do not take a screenshot of the phrase. Do not write or store the phrase on any computer or phone. Computer hackers can easily steal your bitcoins if they find your phrase.

, This differs on each app you are using. If you are using Blockchain.info, go to the home page of the app and press the menu icon in the upper left of the screen.

,, This is instructing the app that you want to import another address.

, The private key is the collection of around 60 random letters and numbers shown by the QR code. Some paper wallets designate the private key as the ""secret"" side of the wallet., This initiates the process of bringing your paper wallet into your app. If you stop here, your Blockchain app will have access to your paper wallet funds, but the funds will continue to remain on your paper wallet as well. This state isn't secure, so proceed to the next step., This will send 100% of the funds in your paper wallet to your app. This step will cost you a small amount of bitcoin to pay the bitcoin miners for doing the transaction for you.

, You now have all the contents of your paper wallet on your phone. From here, you can easily send any portion of your bitcoin to any bitcoin address in the world. If you want to send bitcoin to another location, tap send from your app and send the coin to any address you would like."
"
Start with a computer that you are reasonably confident is malware and virus free.,
Using private browser mode, go to a bitcoin paper wallet creation site.,
Once bitaddress.org loads, turn off the internet on your computer.,
Move your mouse around the screen wildly as instructed by the site.,

Keep going until you see that you've created two QR codes and large strings of apparently random numbers and characters as seen in the photo.,
Store your paper wallet somewhere secure.,

Follow the instructions in Part 1 above and then click ""Paper Wallet"".,

Click the checkmark next to ""BIP38 Encrypt"" and enter a passphrase.,
Click ""Generate"".,
Plug your computer directly into your printer and print your paper wallets.,
Erase all copies of your paper wallet from your computer and printer before you reconnect to the internet.,
Congratulations!,
Before putting any significant amount of money in your wallet, verify that you can successfully decrypt your wallet.,

Create an online wallet that supports BIP38 encryption.,

Go to ""Settings"" then ""Addresses"" then click ""Manage Addresses"".,

Press the QR code scanner to bring up the QR code reader on your webcam.,
Enter your passphrase.,
Send Bitcoin to one of your wallets.,
Verify your funds arrived in your wallet.,
That's it!,
Store the printout of your paper wallet with the private keys in a secure location.,
Recognize that bitcoin paper wallets are optimal for long term storage, but not frequent spending.",How to Store Bitcoin with a Paper Wallet,"  If in doubt, install a clean copy of the OS on a new partition of your computer or on a bootable USB. This isn't a mandatory step, but if you want to be truly secure it's a good idea.
, As of July 2016, the most popular, open source paper wallet creation site is bitaddress.org and these instructions will use that site. Verify that you are on the correct bitaddress.org site by checking the https certificates by clicking to the left of your browser URL as seen in the photo.


Advanced users can be even more secure by downloading a copy of BitAddress from GitHub, verifying the software using the PGP signature, and moving it to a fully offline computer via USB key. You can then run the BitAddress code offline by clicking the HTML file.

, You can do this by turning off your wifi router and or unplugging your ethernet cable. Killing the web connection reduces odds that your private keys will not be leaked over the internet without you knowing it. Bitadress.org was designed to run just fine without an internet connection.,  This random movement generates a random seed that BitAddress will use to generate your wallet., Congrats, you just created a basic, low security paper wallet!

On the left is a your Bitcoin address. In the example in the photo the address is ""15TfQt6RyNrqjJknd3b3CRkbwfXJ3i3BNC"".  Think of this as your email address.  It's OK to share it in public so people (or yourself) can send Bitcoin to the address.
On the right is your private key. In this example it's ""L4vfUiBm9XGeaXk8HWPkQfiTogQoZC6kzNnyPnqGEoBQaRXoAYkT"" Think of this as the password to your email address.  Never, ever share your private key with anyone or store it on a computer or the web.  Anyone who can access your private key can immediately and irretrievably empty your wallet.
If you are storing a small amount of Bitcoin and are OK with low security you can print out this wallet and stop now.  If you need higher security continue following the steps in Part 2 of this article.

, Treat it like gold or jewelry.  If someone finds it and takes it, they can easily empty your wallet. Store a backup copy of the wallet in another secure location.,

It's also possible to do this with the other options such as Bulk Wallet, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the Paper Wallet example.

, Create a long passphrase that you do not use anywhere else. Store that passphrase separately from your bitcoin wallet., Congrats you have now created 3 high security paper wallets with encrypted private keys!

Unlike in the example Part 1, the private key in this wallet is not stored in plain text. You will need to use your passphrase to open the wallet.  This additional layer of security makes your wallet much more secure.

,  By not using the network to print, you avoid the albeit low risk that your network is compromised and might read your private keys.

Print multiple copies of your paper wallet. This is a beauty of BIP38 paper wallets, you can have multiple backups, one in a bank safe deposit box, one in a home safe, one with your law firm, or whatever -- when BIP 38 protected all you have to be is trusting enough that the bank or whoever has it won't do a brute force attack.

,  Close the private window on your browser and verify that no copies were stored in the cache. Close your browser. Reboot your computer.  Only then can you turn your internet back on., You now have encrypted paper wallets that have never accessed the internet. Read Part 3 below to learn how to safely use these paper wallets.,  If you want you can send a very small amount of bitcoin to one wallet for testing you can do that, or you can practice with an empty wallet.  Either way works. The following steps will explain the procedure., This example will use Blockchain.info, which is open source, free and the most popular web wallet as of June 2016. Go to Blockchain.info and follow their steps to create a wallet.,  On the next screen click ""Import Address""., Put the private key QR code from your paper wallet in front of the webcam till you get the verification checkmark.  This can take a little futzing to make work.  It helps to have good lighting and to keep the QR code in focus., If all works out, you will be notified that you have successfully opened your private wallet.  Congrats! You've successfully decrypted your test wallet!

Now that you have exposed the private key of this paper wallet to the internet, do not use it to store funds. Put this wallet away and don't use it again.
Repeat the above steps with other paper wallets if you think you need practice decrypting.  Make sure you've figured this step out before placing real funds in the wallet.
Note that this process is the exact same process you will use to spend or move bitcoins from your paper wallet. The reason we are testing them now is to make sure you can successfully get your coins off your paper wallet when you are ready to do it.
Do not proceed to later steps until you are confident you can decrypt wallets with your passphrase.

, You do this by using your public bitcoin address.  So say you having your friend send you bitcoin, just email or text her your bitcoin address.  Or if you bought coins on a bitcoin exchange like Kraken, Circle or Coinbase, log in to your exchange account and send the bitcoin from there to your bitcoin address.

Do not reuse any of the wallets your opened during testing. Use a brand new one.

, You can do this using any of the blockchain watching services.  Blockchain.info is helpful here.  Just go to the Blockchain.info homepage and enter your bitcoin address (but not your private key) into the search field.  You should see exactly how much bitcoin your wallet holds., Your coins are now safely locked into your paper wallet.  As long as you don't ever enter your private key to just ""check"" on your wallet, your funds will stay totally safe.

As long as only you have the ability to access both your private key and passphrase remain your funds will stay safe for years. This security costs you absolutely nothing. No bank fees ever.

, Keep a backup in another location in case the first location is burned down or flooded. Store the BIP38 passphrase in a still separate location. It's okay to leave the passphrase in a computer or password manager program. Access to your BIP38 passphrase without your wallet's private keys can cause you no damage., If you want to spend or move your bitcoins it's important that you don't leave any funds in the paper wallet you spent with. If you do want to spend with your wallet, sweep all the funds into an online wallet like Blockchain.info and use all the funds there. Do not attempt to reuse a paper wallet."

Sign up for a CVS ExtraCare card.,
Know what Extra Care Bucks are.,
Earn them through purchasing items that are attached to an ECB deal.,
Roll your ECBs correctly to maximum savings and to use them efficiently.,
Remember that ECBs can be stacked and used with manufacturer coupons.,
Be careful on how you use your Extra Care Bucks.",How to Use Extra Care Bucks at CVS," You can either sign up on CVS's ExtraCare website to get an account and receive the card in the mail or ask a cashier in person and get a CVS card as soon as you're done filling the form out. You will need a physical card with you in order to receive the Extra Care Bucks.;
, Extra Care Bucks (abbreviated as ""ECB"") are basically extra cash towards your next purchases or transactions. Typically, ECBs expire within 30 days from when they are printed. There are three ways to achieving ECBs.


Search the CVS store ad or the store and look for items that are attached to an ECB deal. If you purchase that specific item, you will receive the value of ECBs, printed on your receipt of your transaction.
Receive $1 in ECBs for every two prescriptions you purchase through CVS. Be aware of the prescription exclusions and amount limitations.
Get awarded 2 percent back for all purchases at the end of every quarter. The quarters run in January, April, July, and October of every year. Your 2 percent will be printed out on your receipt. The quarterly accumulation excludes lottery tickets, postage stamps, gift cards, alcohol, tobacco, money orders, and special ordered health care items.

, It is the fastest and most savings method out of the three ways. Always read the fine print for any household limits. This is how to read an ECB sale deal:


Right Guard Sport or Total Defense 5 Deodorant - sale price 2 for $6.00 ($3.00 each)
Receive $2.00 ECBs when you purchase two.
Pay $6.00 out of pocket and receive $2.00 ECBs on your receipt. It's like spending $4.00 for 2 ($2.00 each) instead of the regular sale price because you can use the $2.00 ECBs on your next purchase.

, Remember that you can not use ECBs on the same items (an ECB from deodorant on another deodorant). Let's take the reward example from above with another ECB deal.


Eclipse Gum - sale price 3 for $3.00 ($1.00 each)
Receive $0.50 ECB when you purchase 3 gum packs.
Transaction total comes out to $3.00.
Use the $2.00 ECB from the deodorant receipt.
Pay $1.00 out of pocket and receive $0.50 on your receipt from the gum. It's like spending $0.50 on 3 gum packs instead of the original $3.00 sale price.

, This is an example of a transaction using a manufacturer coupon with ECBs:


Right Guard Sport or Total Defense 5 Deodorant - sale price 2 for $6.00 ($3.00 each)
Receive $2.00 ECBs when you purchase two.
Transaction total comes out to $6.00.
Use one ""Save $3.00 on any two Right Guard Total Defense 5 Deodorant"" coupon.
New transaction total comes out to $3.00.
Use a $2.00 ECB receipt from a cosmetics deal.
Pay $1.00 out of pocket and receive $2.00 ECBs on your receipt. This is a ""moneymaker"" because you are receiving more reward value back than what you spent.

, You will need to use the amount listed on the receipt at once and CVS does not refund back any ECB differences back. So if you have a $15.00 ECB receipt and use it towards a $13.99 purchase, you will not receive the $1.01 difference.

Buy really cheap.,
Show that you know your market.,
Add immediate value to a run-down property.,
Bet on the market.",How to Profit from a Falling House Market," You can still make a profit in a falling market by property developing – the secret is to use the media panic to negotiate a really good bargain. If you think what you are buying is a bargain, then don't be afraid to offer the asking price straight away. However, understand that most real estate agents are taught that you will have three offers, so if it's a normal market, be prepared to offer a little bit below the asking price to start with if you want to get it. Go up a reasonable amount and then be prepared to make a small increase for your third offer. That's when they'll think that you're at your limit.;
, If you want to make your offer more attractive, you need to give the appearance of being well organised. Look for lots of information and demonstrate that you have done so, including your solicitor's information, financial details included and also information about properties in the surrounding area, such as sales prices for similar properties. This lets the real estate agent know that you're serious.

, Once you've bought your bargain, there are some simple ways to add real value. Focusing on fixtures and fittings will add instant appeal to a run-down home. Improve the areas that really do make a difference in the eyes of buyers and attract them:


the kitchen - rip out the old kitchen and replace it; a lick of paint will not do - remember that women are the main purchasers of property and if you do not appeal to their likes, then you may lose a future sale;
the bathroom - make it white, shiny, with a power shower and brand new accessories; and
light fittings - this is the most cost effective way to spruce up a house is to replace the light fittings. Choose something that is very modern, and very trendy. It is the one thing that doesn't cost very much but it makes a massive difference to the whole look of the house.

, If you're worried that your house is falling in value, you can make a bit of money by betting on how much it will go down. You don't have to nip into you local betting agency to place this bet though; what you do need to do is to invest your money in an investment fund that pays out if the market drops below a certain level. This possibility is available in Britain; it may not be available in your country, so ask your financial adviser for advice.

Purchase custom mining hardware.,
Obtain a bitcoin wallet.,
Secure your wallet.,
Decide between joining a pool or going alone.,
Download a mining program.,
Run your miner.,
Keep an eye on temperatures.,
Check your profitability.",How to Mine Bitcoins," When Bitcoin first started, it was possible to mine using only your desktop's CPU and GPU. While this is still possible, the returns make running this method impractical. You will be spending far more on electricity than you will earn mining coins. Instead, custom hardware allows for much better processing for about the same power draw.


Custom hardware comes in the form of cards that are inserted into the computer much the same way that a graphics card would be.
Popular Bitcoin-mining hardware brands include Butterfly Labs, Bitcoin Ultra, CoinTerra, and more.
A dedicated Bitcoin mining machine can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands depending on the number of operations it can complete per second.;
, Bitcoins are stored in digital wallets that are encrypted to protect your money. These wallets can be either locally or online. While online services that host your wallet won't be able to access it, they are considered less secure as your money could potentially be lost if something catastrophic happens on their end.


Most established bitcoin users recommend using a local wallet for security reasons.
Local wallets typically require verifying the entire blockchain, which is the history of all bitcoin transactions. Hosting a blockchain is what helps keep Bitcoin running and secure. Syncing this blockchain for the first time can take a day or more.
Popular local wallets include BitcoinQT, Armory, and Multibit. Multibit does not require downloading the entire blockchain.
You can also get wallet apps for your mobile device. These do not require downloading the entire blockchain. Popular apps include: Blockchain and CoinJar.
If you lose your wallet, you lose your money!, Since there is no ""ownership"" when it comes to wallets, anyone who gains access to your wallet can use your coins as they please. To prevent this, enable two-factor authentication and store the wallet on a computer that doesn't have access to the internet, perhaps storing the wallet on your memory stick or SD card if you need to eject/dismount it later and have the wallet on the go.

, When it comes time to start mining coins, you have two main options: join in with an established pool or attempt to mine on your own. A pool allows you to share resources and split the rewards, which can lead to quicker returns. Mining alone can be difficult as getting new bitcoins is highly competitive, but you get to keep everything you mine.Without joining a pool, you may go a year or more without earning any bitcoins, since the coin is awarded to the pool that discovers it.Most pools charge a small fee (around 2%) of your earnings.
When joining a pool, you will need to create a ""worker"". This is a subaccount which is used to track your contributions to the pool. You can have multiple workers at once. Each pool will have instructions on creating workers.

, Mining programs are almost all open source and available for free. There are different mining programs available depending on the type of hardware you are running. Mining programs run in the command line, and may need a batch file in order to start correctly, especially if you are connecting to a pool.


The two most popular mining programs are CGminer and BFGminer. EasyMiner runs with a graphical interface as opposed to a command line.
See your pool's help section for specific details on connecting to the pool with your mining program.
If you are mining solo, be sure to connect your mining program to your personal wallet, so that anything you earn gets deposited automatically. If you are mining as part of a pool, you will connect your wallet to your user account with the pool. Coins will be transferred as they are earned.

, Once you have your miner configured, you can start your mining operation. Run the batch file you've created if necessary and watch the miner connect and start mining. You will most likely notice the rest of your computer slow to a crawl as the miner works.

, Mining programs push hardware to their limits, especially if the hardware was not designed for mining in the first place. Use a program such as SpeedFan to make sure that your temperatures don't go above safe limits. Graphics cards should usually never go above 80 °C (176 °F).

, After you've mined for a little bit, check your figures to make sure its worth it. How much did you make over the last few days? Compare that to how much money it cost you to keep your computer running at full speed during that time (most video cards take about 300-500 watts)."

Find deals in store.,
Look for coupons in magazines and newspapers.,
Find coupons online.,
Sign up for regular alerts.",How to Use Coupons1," Coupons can be found in a variety of different places, so keep an eye out for offers and give-aways which might include coupons. You might find them on the shelves, at the registers, or at the entrance. Look out for members of staff handing out coupons to customers as they enter or leave the store.


Always check your receipt when you leave the store.
Sometimes your receipt will act as a coupon and entitle you to a discount on your next shop.;
, Some of the best places to look for coupons are magazines and newspapers. Local newspapers in particular will often have coupons for your local stores. Weekend editions of newspapers can be the best bet, especially the larger Sunday edition.You can find coupons in a wide variety of magazines, but the coupons are likely to be related to the focus of the magazine.
For example, a magazine about homes and decoration is the best bet to find a coupon for a hardware or DIY store.
A magazine about health and fitness might have a coupon for sportswear.

, Online coupons, or ""eCoupons,"" are increasingly popular and well-established. There are large websites entirely dedicated to couponing, which you will be able to find easily through a search engine. There is a broad range, so try to tailor your search to the specific type of coupon you are looking for.Online coupons are not accepted everywhere, so check the details before you try to use them.
Your favourite grocery or superstore may have digital or printable coupons, so be sure to check store websites directly.
As well as printable coupons, you will sometimes find online codes which you can use when you make a purchase online.

, You can sign up for coupons to be regularly sent to you as part of a loyalty of reward card scheme run by many major retailers. Sign up for a rewards card with your local grocery or drugstore. In addition to discounted prices, you'll receive coupons at the checkout.Certain stores monitor the products you buy and send you personalized coupons in the mail based on your purchasing history.
You can often also register your email address with the stores you frequent. When offers become available, you'll be alerted.
Many big stores and large chains have apps that will give you possibilities for more coupons and special offers.

Visit Bitcoin's website, bitcoin.org, to download the application. This program will work on Mac, PC, and Linux servers. Once you install the software, the bitcoin client will attempt to establish a network and begin downloading the bitcoin block chain.


You'll need all the blocks in chain before you can send or receive any transactions., There are plenty of similar wallets that all have their own drawbacks and specific functions. Hive, for example, is only available for Macs and includes an app store that connects to other bitcoin services. Armory is a wallet that is designed specifically for enhanced security.Each have their own installation quirks.
Hive is specially designed for beginners.

, There are a few wallets that take up less space on your hard drive. These work at a faster speed because they don't download the entire block chain. Only a small part of the block chain is used at a time, making it faster. Some popular lightweight wallets are Multibit and Electrum.These wallets are less secure than the wallets that require the full chain blocks.

Rather, they give you a key to represent those bitcoins or two keys, actually. Think of them as a bank account number and a serial number. The bank account number, called an address or public key, changes each time you use it, and it tells others how to find you. The other one, the private key, is somewhat like a serial number on a dollar bill, unique to the bitcoins you hold, you have to keep private, as anyone who has that number can claim those bitcoins., Bitcoin wallets don't technically hold bitcoins, as bitcoins are not physical objects. What bitcoin wallets do is hold the information needed to access and use the bitcoins owned by the owner of the wallet. This information includes the private key that assigns ownership of the bitcoins in the wallet. In essence, the wallet safeguards the owner's access codes and prevents others from gaining access to it.Bitcoins wallets provide much-needed security in an online market where hackers can steal private keys to obtain bitcoins, owners can be defrauded into giving away bitcoins without receiving anything in return, and whole bitcoin exchanges are liable to collapse.

, A bitcoin wallet is a bit like other services that act as a mediator between your financial information and merchants, such as Apple Pay or PayPal, though they don't work quite the same. One difference is that bitcoins are totally digital, and more susceptible to security issues. Therefore, you want the most secure option you can to protect your bitcoins, keeping in mind that you will likely only be keeping part of your bitcoins in your wallet.You have four basic options for wallets: software wallets, web wallets, cold/paper wallets, and hardware wallets.See how to create an online bitcoin wallet for more information on the different types of wallets and how to create one.

, These two types of wallets are usually the most secure. A software wallet is one that keeps your keys secure on your desktop. A cold/paper wallet is anything that is not hooked up to the internet. The upside to a software wallet is that it is somewhat more secure than a web wallet, as your private key is stored offline rather than online.However, the downside is you can only access it from your computer.Some software wallets are mobile phone apps, so they can be more portable.
The upside of a cold wallet is it can't be hacked on the internet, since it's not connected. It can be a jump drive, a piece of paper, or your brain. For instance, if you use your brain, you simply memorize the key code, which is secure, but not so great if you forget the number, as you can't recover the bitcoins., A web wallet is accessed through the web, much like PayPal. A hardware wallet is actually a device, usually a thumb drive or something of similar size, that you can carry with you. Both of these wallets, then, are fairly portable.A hardware wallet only releases information when you tell it to and when it's in contact with a device to take the information.A web wallet is not quite as secure as a software wallet, but you can access it from anywhere., Within each type of wallet, you have choices about the one you pick. For instance, Bitcoin Armory is a type of software wallet, while Coinbase is a web-based wallet.Bitcoin's website has some recommendations for wallets to make your choice simpler if you don't know where to begin.Bitcoin's website has a checklist of items when it comes to choosing a wallet. For each wallet that it lists, it will show you whether you have control over your money, whether validation is centralized or decentralized, if the wallet shows its coding or not, if it offers a secure environment, and whether or not it provides basic privacy.For instance, some wallets offer shared control over your money, meaning the company has to verify the transaction, too. If validation is decentralized, that means that your transaction is validated through the wallet, not directly on the network.A wallet with a non-secure environment means it can be downloaded on computers that contain malware, which in turn means your bitcoins are less secure. However, you can protect your bitcoins by making a strong password or by moving part of your currency to a cold wallet.As far as privacy goes, a wallet can make it more difficult for someone to steal your bitcoins by rotating addresses for you. Privacy can also mean whether the wallet provides information to a third party or whether or not you can use Tor, which can help prevent attacks., Securing a bitcoin wallet can take some know-how, as some wallets are less user friendly than others. However, some bitcoin wallets do more of the work for you, such as the aptly named Bitcoin Wallet., If you use Bitcoin's website, you can download many wallets straight from their site. Otherwise, they have links to other sites you can find them. Usually, you will use the wallet's main site to download your wallet.When it comes to cold wallets, you can use a software wallet then disconnect it form the Internet with a jump drive.
To use a paper wallet, you still must use an interface to create an address to receive bitcoins. One you can use is Bit Address (look for the .org URL). When you want to receive bitcoins, you'll use something like this interface to generate your address., In your wallet, you should have a place for receiving bitcoins. It may be a tab or a different section altogether. Finding that section is the first step in receiving bitcoins.Each wallet is going to be a little different in how transactions are done, though the basic transaction should be the same. It's just with different interfaces, it's going to look a little bit different.

, When receiving bitcoins, you need to send your address to the person or company who's giving you bitcoins. Your wallet should generate addresses for you, and you just click on one for each transaction.Addresses are usually a string of 26 characters, including letters and numbers and beginning with a 1 or 3. However, it can also be a QR code that someone can scan.Bitcoin recommends that each address only be used one time. The reason is that every time you make a transaction, it is recorded or mined on the public ledger, which releases some information about you. Each time you make a transaction, the wallet should generate a new address for you to use., You may need to send the address manually, but more likely, the wallet will do this step for you. Make sure you do not send your private key, just one of the addresses generated by your wallet.If you need to send it manually, just copy the code and send it to the person through a message or email.
If you're using a QR code on your phone in person, the seller usually just scans the code with their phone., If you're using an exchange to get bitcoins, you will need to pay for them. An exchange is much like a stock exchange, where people buy and sell bitcoins. Many reputable trading sites will place the amount of bitcoins in escrow as soon as you submit the payment. The payment method can vary based on the trader's preference. Whether you pay with PayPal, a bank transfer, or cash face-to-face depends on what you and the trader agree to.If you create an exchange account, you can usually hook up a bank account to it., As transactions are sent, they are confirmed on the blockchain through mining. Every 10 minutes or so, the transaction will be confirmed again. Each confirmation makes the transaction more secure, as it acts as a verification by all the people on the network. Once it's been confirmed a certain number of times, it pretty much guarantees that those bitcoins can't be sent or sold again. In other words, confirmation guards against double spending.Double spending means that the same bitcoins are fraudulently spent more than once. This can result in merchants being unable to receive payment, as the bitcoins used for payment have already been spent.Some companies wait as long as 6 confirmations before confirming the order, especially on large transactions.How many confirmations you wait for depends on you and the type of transaction. If you're receiving bitcoins for a product and it costs a lot, you may want to wait for more confirmations. If you're just receiving bitcoins for a small transaction, you can probably wait for fewer confirmations.,Bitcoin recommends six confirmations for large transactions and at least one confirmation on a smaller transaction. How many confirmations you wait for can also depend on the security of the wallet you're using. For instance, one may be enough on a very secure wallet, while three would be better on a lighter weight wallet.Your wallet should have some way of tracking confirmations, though how it shows those confirmations depends on the wallet interface., Bitcoins are actually created by using Bitcoin software on computers to solve very difficult math problems. Think of it as your computer earning you money by doing the hard work, though in this case, it's actually minting the money, not just earning it. The catch is that it takes high-powered computers to solve the problems, so you either must have a specialized bitcoin machine or combine your computer with others to work together.Mining has become more complex and less lucrative as the number of bitcoins issues have grown. It is late in the game to begin mining.
Single-machine mining is not particularly lucrative. You'd need a dedicated high-powered computer, and it's likely the computer would cost more than what you'd get back.You can also buy a dedicated hardware miner, such as an AntMiner S7, a Avalon6, or a SP20 Jackson, though these will cost you a bit, too.Consider joining a pool, such as Slush Pool, where you can join with other miners to help generate bitcoins faster.In addition, you'll need a miner app, such as 50Miner for Windows, which does the actual mining for you. Both of these work with your graphics card.However, that doesn't mean there will be an ever-growing amount of bitcoins. In fact, bitcoins will be capped at 21,000,000, plus fewer and fewer bitcoins are given out over time, due to how the system is designed., Another option is to buy bitcoins with a recognized currency. To buy bitcoins, you use a market exchange. Some notable ones are Bitcoin.de in Germany, VirtEx in Canada, Bitcurex in Poland, CampBX in the United States, and BTC in China.Remember that these exchanges are not regulated as well as, say, the stock market. Therefore, make sure you trust the exchange before putting your money into it.The risks inherent to these exchanges are that the exchanges are liable to fail or that certain national government may move to regulate or ban bitcoins.

, If you want to accept bitcoins as currency, you can use an app or software to add it to your website. That means that instead of selling your product for dollars, you'd accept bitcoins in their place. You can add a widget to your website or simply use an invoice to request payment through bitcoin.Remember that bitcoins are worth much more than a dollar. Therefore, they are divided into decimals. You will likely only receive a small fraction of a bitcoin for most products.The value of bitcoins is volatile, so transactions need to checked each time against current market values.

, Some websites and games allow you to get small amounts of bitcoins for free just by using their website or playing a particular game. Others may have you read books or roll dice. Like any website that provides things for ""free,"" it can take a while to accumulate bitcoins on these types of sites.Faucets pay out a certain number of bitcoins at regulated intervals, though they are usually overrun with advertising to pay for those bitcoins."

Never put more money into BTC than you can afford to lose.",How to Invest in Bitcoin," Today, buying and selling BTC is easier for beginners than ever. As your first step, you'll want to sign up for something called a Bitcoin wallet. Like its name suggests, your wallet is a digital account that makes it fairly easy and convenient to buy, store, and sell your BTC — think of it like a universal Bitcoin checking account. Unlike a checking account, however, starting a Bitcoin wallet usually takes less than a minute, can be done online, and is quite easy.


Sites like Coinbase.com, Coinmkt.com, Blockchain.info and Hivewallet.com are are just a few examples of reputable, reliable and user-friendly sites for beginners to create their first wallet.;
, Once you have a wallet, it's time to fill it with BTC. Typically, to do this, you'll need to supply the financial details for a real-world bank account just like you would if you were setting up a PayPal account or signing up for another online payment service. Usually, you'll need at least your bank account number, the routing number for the account, and your full name as it appears on the account. You can almost always find these on your online banking account or on your paper checks.Note that you may also be asked to provide contact information, like a phone number.
To be clear, linking your bank account to your Bitcoin wallet is not any more of a risk to your personal security than it is to shop online. Virtually all reputable Bitcoin services make a point to advertise their high standards for security and encryption. While Bitcoin services have been targeted by hackers in the past, so too have many major online retailers., Once you've supplied your bank information and it's been verified by the Bitcoin service, it should be fairly easy to start purchasing BTC and adding it to your wallet. Usually, on your wallet page, there should be an option labeled ""Buy Bitcoin"" or something similar — clicking this should take you through a straightforward transaction process that uses money from your bank account to purchase BTC.


Note that the price of Bitcoin can (and does) change from day to day — sometimes significantly. Because Bitcoin is a relatively new form of currency, its market has yet to become stable. The current dollar-to-BTC exchange rate should be clearly listed when you buy it — as of October 2014, 1 BTC was equal to about $350., In recent years, an increasing number of businesses have begun to accept BTC as a valid form of payment. Though these businesses still represent a minority, some major names have already made the transition. Below is just a short list of online vendors that accept BTC:Amazon
Wordpress
Overstock.com
Bitcoin.travel
Victoria's Secret
Subway
Zappos
Whole Foods
If you're market-savvy (or lucky), you can conceivably generate value for yourself this way by buying BTC when its price is low, then purchasing goods when the value of BTC is high to get a favorable deal on the goods. You can then sell these goods to make a profit or simply keep them.

, Unfortunately, selling BTC isn't quite as easy as buying it. There is no easy way to ""cash out"" your Bitcoins and receive money in your bank account — instead, you'll have to find a buyer who's willing to pay for them with money (or good/services). In general, one of the easiest ways to do this is to sign up with an online Bitcoin marketplace. Once you find a buyer, you will complete the transaction through the website but will otherwise deal directly with him or her. To use this method, you'll usually have to register a seller account and verify your identity in a process separate from the one used to create your wallet.


In the US, CoinBase and LocalBitcoins are two websites that offer this sort of selling service. In the UK, BitBargain and Bittylicious are two reputable options.
In addition, some sites like Purse.io allow sellers to give BTC to buyers who then use their own money to purchase goods online and send them to the seller — in essence, this is a roundabout way of using BTC to buy from vendors that do not accept the currency., Another option for sellers is to use a Bitcoin exchange. These sites work by pairing sellers with prospective buyers. Once a seller is found, the website acts as a sort of intermediary or escrow service, holding the money until both parties are verified and the transaction is completed. Usually, there is a minor fee associated with this service. Selling with this method is not usually an instantaneous process. In some cases, users have even complained that exchange services can take an inordinate amount of time to complete transactions compared to other options.Reputable, well-known exchanges include Circle, Kraken, and Virtex.
In addition, some exchange sites like Bitcoinshop allow you to trade BTC for other digital currencies (like Dogecoin and Litecoin).

, If you're serious about investing in Bitcoin, you may want to devote a small portion of each paycheck towards buying the virtual currency — this is a great way to amass lots of BTC over time without any major one-time expenses. Many Bitcoin wallet sites (like, for instance, Coinbase) offer the option to set up regular withdrawals for the purpose of buying BTC. This generally works a little like regular withdrawals for a 401k — you specify a certain amount of money, and this money is withdrawn from your account at regular intervals and used to buy BTC automatically.

, If you'd like to keep your money in the local community, consider using a service that allows you sell to people near you. Rather than pairing you with anonymous online buyers from anywhere in the world, certain sites give you the option of searching for sellers in your local area. If you choose to meet with these sellers in person, observe all of the normal precautions you would for meeting someone you met online — meet in a public location in the daytime and, if possible, don't show up alone. See our article on the subject for more information.


Localbitcoins.com is one of the most prominent local bitcoin marketplaces online. The site allows you to search for buyers in over 6,000 cities and 200 countries, including the US., One option that's often advertised as being ""less risky"" than buying and selling BTC directly is to put money into an investment agency. The Bitcoin Investment Trust, for instance, allows users to buy and sell stock in the company just as they would for any other company. The Trust then uses the money to buy and sell BTC with the goal of making money for the investors. Because the company deals solely in buying and selling BTC, the company's share price is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. However, some users find this option preferable because the professional investors at the Trust are (presumably) experts and because it allows them to forgo the process of finding sellers and managing their Bitcoin accounts on their own., Ever wonder where Bitcoins come from? In fact, new Bitcoins are created through a complicated computing process called ""mining."" In very simplified terms, when mining BTC, your computer competes with other users' computers to solve complex problems. When your computer solves the problem first, you are awarded BTC. The supposed benefits of mining include the fact that you are essentially ""making"" BTC for yourself without using any of your real-world money. However, in practice, maintaining competitive status as a Bitcoin miner can involve substantial investments in specialized hardware.


The entire mining process is a complicated one that is beyond the scope of this article. For more information, see our Bitcoin mining article.
In addition, it's important to understand that because BTC are awarded in ""blocks"" of multiple BTC at once, it's usually in your best interest to join an established ""pool"" of miners, which will allow you to work together towards solving the block and share the rewards. Going it alone can make you very uncompetitive as a miner — you may go a year or more without making a single Bitcoin., At its core, the strategy for buying and selling BTC isn't much different than that for buying and selling stocks or commodities in the real world. Buying BTC when the dollar exchange rate is low and selling it when the exchange rate is high is a money-making proposition. Unfortunately, since the Bitcoin market is so volatile, it can be extremely difficult to predict when the Bitcoin price will rise or fall, so any BTC investment is inherently risky.


As an example of the Bitcoin market's volatility, in October 2013, the price for BTC was hovering around $120-$125 per BTC. Within a month and a half, the price had shot up almost tenfold to nearly $1,000 per BTC. A year later, the price was a third of its peak value at about $350 per BTC. It is unknown when the next price spike will occur (if ever).

, As mentioned above, it's impossible to predict which way the Bitcoin market will go with certainty. However, your best hope for making money off of a Bitcoin investment is probably to monitor trends in the marketplace frequently. Because the Bitcoin marketplace can fluctuate rapidly, money-making opportunities like spikes in the exchange rate can appear and disappear in a matter of days, so keep a close eye on the exchange rate for your best chance at success.


You may also want to become a member of Bitcoin discussion forums (like, for instance, the forums at Bitcointalk.org) so that you can communicate with other investors about market predictions. Keep in mind, however, that no investors, no matter their expertise, can predict the Bitcoin market with certainty.

, One possible way to gain some stability out of your Bitcoin wealth is to use it to buy more stable investments, like stocks or commodities. Certain sites will allow you to do this — for instance, Coinabul.com allows you to purchase gold with BTC. You might even want to sell your BTC and use the money to invest in the stock market or in bonds. While a conservative stock portfolio generally offers the best potential for stable, moderate growth, most financial experts agree that even relatively risky stocks generally have a lower capacity for fluctuation than the Bitcoin market., As with any sort of risky investment, it's best to think of the money you put into Bitcoin as money you're ""playing"" with — if you profit, that's great, but if you lose it, you won't be financially ruined. Don't put more money into Bitcoin than you can't reasonably survive without. BTC can vanish in the blink of an eye (and have done so in the past), so the consequences for gambling too much money on Bitcoin can be dire.Don't buy into the sunk cost fallacy — the idea that you're ""too deep"" into an investment to pull out.Missing a price spike and selling at a slight loss is better than waiting and selling at a large loss.

Defend your decision if necessary.",How to Break a Lease Due to Mold," Some leases provide easy and efficient ways to terminate your lease without having to demonstrate the existence of a serious mold problem. The most common example is when your lease is structured as a month-to-month tenancy. In most U.S. states, when your lease is month-to-month, you can get out at any time by providing 30 days notice. Therefore, if your lease is set up as a month-to-month tenancy, simply give your landlord the required notice and move out.;
, Most U.S. states will not allow you to waive the implied warranty of habitability, which requires landlords to maintain their properties in a livable condition. Therefore, in general, any provision in your lease stating you waive this warranty will be held unenforceable as it is against public policy.However, some states may still allow you to waive the implied warranty if it is explicitly stated in your lease. Therefore, if you live in a state where you can waive the implied warranty (check with your lawyer to find out the law in your state), and it is in your lease, you may not be able to use this law to terminate your lease.

, In general, your landlord must perform the necessary maintenance to keep your unit livable. In addition, your lease will set out what duties the landlord has for making smaller repairs. However, if you, as the tenant, fail to fulfill your own responsibilities, the landlord may not be required to fix conditions, even if they make your unit uninhabitable., You are required to take reasonable care of your rental unit, which means you should keep them clean and undamaged. Most leases will state that you need to keep the premises sanitary and that you need to dispose of trash and other unwanted items in a reasonable way. All of these things, if you fail to do them, may lead to a mold problem. If your actions are the cause of your mold problems, you may have a problem terminating your lease., Most, if not all, U.S. states have a state statute laying out an implied warranty of habitability that runs with every residential lease, regardless of whether it is explicitly mentioned in the lease or not. The implied warranty of habitability requires landlords to maintain their properties in a livable condition, which means the property must be fit for human occupation. Generally, state laws also require landlords to substantially comply with housing and building codes that materially affect your health and safety.To find your state's statute, do an internet search for ""implied warranty of habitability"". In addition, if you need help, you can go to your local law library and ask an employee for help.

, Most mold problems will fall within the statement in the law that requires landlords to substantially comply with codes that affect your health and safety. State statutes may provide explicit examples of what is considered uninhabitable, but no list is going to be exhaustive. In addition, courts applying the implied warranty of habitability have created boundaries regarding what it considers uninhabitable. Each state will have different boundaries and some states may be more tenant friendly or more landlord friendly. In addition, if you are the cause of the uninhabitable condition, you will not be able to use the implied warranty of habitability to your advantage.


In California, for example, their state statute lays out various conditions that, if present in your rental unit, might make it uninhabitable. While mold is not explicitly mentioned in the statute, it does mention that proper weatherproofing must be present. Because most mold arises in damp environments, the underlying problem of poor weatherproofing might make your unit uninhabitable. Also, California's state statute mentions that buildings must be clean and sanitary. Mold might be a condition that makes your building unclean and unsanitary. Lastly, experts in California have stated that the presence of mold would most likely make a unit uninhabitable and affect your health and safety., Once you know that mold is probably a condition that can affect habitability and health and safety, you will need to inspect your residence for the presence of mold. Apart from doing this so you can demonstrate the problem, you will also need to do this to assess the seriousness of the mold infestation. This is the case because, in order to use the implied warranty of habitability to break a lease, the mold must seriously affect your ability to live in the unit and it must be a substantial defect.


The implied warranty of habitability is not breached if the mold problem is minor and does not affect your ability to occupy the unit safely and healthily., One of the best ways to demonstrate a substantially deficient living condition that affects your health and safety is to go to the doctor and get an official diagnosis. As soon as you notice the moldy conditions and you feel as though it is affecting your health, visit the doctor. Let them know that you live with mold and ask them to make sure your health is okay. If it is not, ask for your medical records so you have evidence of the health concerns you face because of the mold.Mold can cause you to have nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, wheezing, or skin irritation. If you are allergic to mold, the reactions could be even more serious., Call your county health department and/or your local building inspector and ask them to conduct a review of your unit. Some states will respond to these requests while others will not. If your state will not review your unit, find a reputable private company that conducts similar reviews. Once the review is complete, make sure a report is created that documents the living conditions, including the mold infestation.You will use these reports down the road in case you have to prove the existence and severity of the problem to your landlord or to a court.

, Talk with other tenants in your building, past tenants, maintenance people, and mold professionals and get their statements. Current and past tenants may have similar problems, or may have had problems in the past. They might be able to tell you about their experience, their health problems, and how the landlord dealt with it. Environmental professionals will be able to give you a statement about the serious nature of the mold infestation and how that mold can affect the livability of your unit. Maintenance workers in your building may be able to tell you about their policies for fixing these issues, which might come into play if your landlord fails to adequately fix the mold problem.


When you take witness statements, make sure you get their full name, address, phone number, email address, and driver's license number. This information will help you reach out later if it becomes necessary., To ultimately prove the mold in your unit has made it unlivable and unhealthy, you need to take photos and videos to demonstrate the conditions. Before you take videos and pictures, clean your unit to make sure you present it in the best light possible. This might become key if your landlord claims you were a bad tenant and caused the uninhabitable condition.


Photograph the entire unit and do so from multiple angles. In addition, use rulers to indicate how large the mold is.
If it is safe to do so, take samples of the mold as well.To take a sample, put on a pair of rubber gloves and a mask to protect your mouth and hands. Using a piece of clear scotch tape, press the sticky side into the moldy area. Peel off the tape by pulling on the edges. Place the sample in a zip lock bag by sticking the piece of tape to the side of it. Do not fold the tape in half. Close the bag and label it., Once you have gathered evidence on the moldy conditions, consider hiring a lawyer. While a lawyer is not necessary to break your lease for a violation of the implied warranty of habitability, they will certainly not hurt. A qualified housing lawyer will help you review your evidence, draft notice letters, and comply with the law. The lawyer will also be able to help you understand whether your situation rises to the level of being able to break your lease.


Start the search process by asking family and friends if they know any lawyers. At this point, take any recommendation they have, even if the lawyer does not practice housing law. You can always call these lawyers and ask if they know lawyers who can handle your type of case.

, If you cannot get any good recommendations, visit your state bar's lawyer referral service website. If you do not have access to the internet, call your state bar association. After answering a few general questions about your legal issue, you will be put in contact with various qualified lawyers in your area.

, Once you have a list of two or three lawyers you think you will like, contact them and ask to sit down for an initial consultation. An initial consultation allows you to assess each lawyer, taking into consideration their knowledge and demeanor. It also gives the lawyer an opportunity to assess whether they want to represent you. Before you go to each consultation, make sure you gather any and all documentation you have regarding the mold problem. This will include your photos, videos, witness statements, professional reports, and medical records. This information will help the lawyer assess your case.


When you go to the meeting, make sure you talk about their professionalism and ability to represent you. Feel free to ask how long they have been practicing and how comfortable they are with lease terminations and the implied warranty of habitability.
Be sure to ask each lawyer about their fees and get an estimate of how much the overall representation would cost.

, As a part of each initial consultation, make sure you discuss your case in as much detail as possible. Ask the lawyer if they think you have a good case for a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. In addition, ask if there is other evidence that would be helpful to make your case. All of this information will help you determine how to proceed with your mold problem. While you will want to extract as much information as possible, the lawyer is unlikely to give you too much. In reality, the lawyer wants you to hire them before they really get into your case.

, After you conduct all the initial consultations, sit down and think about what you learned. If you think you got enough information to proceed with your lease termination, you might consider moving forward without hiring a lawyer. However, if you think a lawyer could help you, you should hire the lawyer that you felt most comfortable with.


In almost every scenario, a lawyer will be beneficial. If you proceed without one and you are found liable for improperly terminating your lease, you might end up having to pay damages.

, If you think you have a valid case where mold is making your rental unit uninhabitable, you must give your landlord notice of the failure to maintain your unit in a habitable condition. While some states do not provide a time limit for you to provide notice, other states (e.g., Colorado) require you to provide notice to your landlord within 30 days of when the uninhabitable condition arises.Your notice letter must be detailed and provide the following information:Your name, address, and contact information
The date you are drafting and sending the notice
A detailed description of the mold problem that has led to your unit being uninhabitable
A request that the mold condition be repaired within the time allowed by law
A statement letting the landlord know that they can enter your unit to fix the problem
Your signature

, Once you draft your notice, make copies. Keep them for your records in case you need them in the future., All notice letters should be sent to your landlord by certified mail, return receipt requested. This way, you have evidence that you sent the notice.In addition to mailing the notice letter, you also need to make sure you are meeting any notice requirements set out in your lease. For example, some landlords may require you to drop off notice at the landlord's office. To be safe, mail a copy to your landlord and drop one off.

, Each state will require you to allow a certain period of time for your landlord to fix the problem. The amount of time you have to allow will depend on the severity of the problem. For example, in Nevada, you have to allow your landlord 14 days to fix the problem. In Colorado, you must provide five days.In addition, a lot of states will limit your ability to terminate your lease, even if the problem is not resolved within the period allowed, so long as the landlord is making a good effort within that time to fix the problem.Your notice letter will tell the landlord how long they have to remedy the mold problem before you exercise your right to terminate the lease and vacate.

, If the mold problem persists past the allotted time and no effort is being made to fix it, or if the mold problem is not fixed adequately, you should start the lease termination procedures. Before notifying the landlord of your intentions, take more pictures and gather more evidence so you can prove that no real progress was made after you gave your landlord notice of the problem.

, Most states do not require you to provide notice to your landlord before you terminate your lease and vacate the property if you are doing so because of a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. For example, in Nevada and Connecticut, no notice is needed.With that said, providing notice is never a bad idea and will help you keep records of everything you did. This notice should also indicate the reason you are vacating and that you fully expect the landlord to return any prepaid rent and any security deposit.
If the law does not require you provide this notice, you should provide it when you give up possession of the property (i.e., when you turn over your keys).

, When you are ready to terminate your lease and vacate, move out of the property and return any keys. Do not keep anything that does not belong to you., When you relinquish possession of your property, make sure your landlord is aware that you expect any prepaid rent and security deposit to be returned to you. Be sure you provide your landlord with a forwarding address so they can send you the check. In most states, your landlord will have 30 days to account for everything and make payment to you.

, In some circumstances, your old landlord may come after you claiming you did not have the legal ability to terminate based on the implied warranty of habitability. If this happens, you should be in good shape because of all the records you kept and evidence you gathered. If you receive notice that your landlord is suing you, hire a lawyer or use the lawyer you hired before to represent you.

Know when to use your coupons.,
Know how to use your coupons.,
Determine the limits on the use of coupons.,
Stack your coupons.,
Stockpile coupons.",How to Use Coupons2," To really get the best deal you need to determine the best time to use your coupons. This could mean a particular time of year for seasonal goods, or when there is already a sale on. The benefits of using a coupon are compounded if you use them when something has already been discounted.


Wait for a sale, especially if you are buying an expensive one-off purchase.Follow sales cycles so you know when the prices of particular goods are likely to be reduced.If you are buying something seasonal, buying off-season can mean a cheaper price. For example, a warm woollen jumper will often be on sale in the Spring.

, Being familiar with the fine print can save you some hassle at the register, as well as allowing you to budget accordingly. Start by determining whether it is a ""manufacturer's"" or ""store"" coupon. Manufacturer's coupons come from the company or manufacturer of the specific product and are accepted in any store.


Store coupons are only accepted in the specifically listed store(s).
Ensure the barcode on the coupon is not ripped or damaged as this might prevent the cashier scanning it, and render it invalid.

, Often there will be clear limits and restrictions on how you use specific coupons. Check the detail and find out if you are limited to one coupon per specific item, or perhaps one coupon per transaction. If your coupon is not limited, you may be able to use a number of coupons in the same transaction to increase your discount.


If your coupon says ""Limit one coupon per specified item(s),"" you may only use one coupon when you buy the product.
If your coupon says ""Limit one coupon per transaction,"" you will only be able to use that specific coupon in the transaction.
Be sure to check the expiration date so you know at what point the coupon will become invalid.

, Though many coupons may say ""limit 1 per customer,"" this often only applies to the type of coupon. Sometimes you can use a manufacturer's coupon in addition to a store coupon to double your savings.Stacking coupons like this can really make a dent in the price of a product.


For example, if you buying a new TV you can use a coupon from the company that made the TV together with a coupon from the store you are buying it in.
You can also stack coupons for smaller everyday items such as groceries.
Be sure to check the eligibility criteria and fine print on the coupons before you try to use them.It's also a good idea to go online and read the coupon policy for the store you want to use them in., Just because you don't need something now, doesn't mean you won't need it later. Stockpiling coupons and keeping an organised collection will help you get the absolute most out of them. Get a binder and keep all you coupons together. You can organise them by type of product, or by store.


You could also organize them by expiry date so you have a clear picture of which coupons are due to expire soon.
If you want to increase your stockpile you could tell friends and neighbours that you are collecting coupons."

Understand web wallets.,
Pick a web based wallet.,
Use an anonymous wallet.",How to Create an Online Bitcoin Wallet2," Web-based wallets store your private keys online on a server controlled by an admin group. Some wallets conveniently link between your mobile and software wallets. You can access this wallet anywhere, making it a popular choice. The website is in charge of your keys and can take your bitcoins out of your control.


Many web wallets suffered from security breaches in the past. Be aware of the risks before investing.

, There are plenty of wallets that claim security for their customers. Some of the popular servers that have been active for a while now are: Coinbase, Circle, and Xapo.


Coinbase operates worldwide and offers exchange services between US and Europe.
Circle only lets US citizens to link their bank accounts to deposit money. Debit or credit cards are options for users in other countries.
Xapo is a very simple wallet that is easy to use and includes an extra security method called a cold-storage vault., The world of bitcoin often draws anonymous users for various reasons. Some of these types of wallets are less secure and don’t offer much in the means of insurance. Dark Wallet operates as a chrome extension and is the most popular anonymous wallet. These types of servers fluctuate in stability for your coins. At any moment the server could become vulnerable to becoming hacked.


Some of the features of anonymous wallets are appealing like the fast cash out module.

Understand hardware wallets.,
Purchase a hardware wallet.,
Encrypt your device.",How to Create an Online Bitcoin Wallet3," For those who are overly secure and protective of their finances, a hardware wallet could be for you. Hardware wallets are physical devices that hold private keys electronically and facilitate payments.These wallets can be carried on your person and don’t rely on you keeping funds in a third-party's storage.


These wallets are immune to viruses and types of Trojans that infect software wallets.

, There are many different hardware wallets that range in price range and quality. Take a look at some of the premier hardware wallets:


Pi Wallet uses cold storage and does not have wireless capabilities. It uses Armory’s client which makes it secure while not requiring you to set everything up by yourself. This is a safe and easy hardware device.
Trezor is similar to Pi, but uses a small screen to interact with. The private keys are generated by the device and can’t leave it, making it immune to malware.
USB wallets are pretty popular and more affordable devices. These devices protect your data and use similar micro-processor chips that credit cards use. These typically allow you to go between a variety of computers and your device will establish a secure connection., Most devices require an encryption code or password upon initializing. If your device doesn’t, you can always add an encryption to secure your wallet. Each hardware wallet has a different protocol for establishing a secure encryption.

Use a coupon in store.,
Shop strategically.,
Pay with an online discount code.",How to Use Coupons3," Search for the specific item in the store. For instance, some coupons will say, ""on any flavor or variety,"" while others will provide a specific list of items you can redeem the coupon with. Make sure that you give your coupons in the right order. Some coupons may render other coupons void, so make sure you've stacked them correctly.


If you have a coupon that has a required purchase amount, such as $5 off when you spend $50, give that one first. That way, any discounts you receive with additional coupons will not penalize you in reaching the necessary amount.Be sure to read the fine print. Some coupons may only be used after all coupons have been deducted.
If in doubt, ask your cashier for deals. He may have a value guide at the register or know of specific discounts on items you are about to purchase.

, To get the best value from your coupons, you need to avoid impulse buying and plan out what you will buy and when. If you avoid using coupons on full price items, are happy to switch brands according to what coupons you have, and don't just pick up anything that is on sale, you will set yourself up for the best savings.Know what you are going to buy before you go in store and try to stick to your plan.
If you have an opportunity to buy large quantities of non-perishable goods, make the most of it.

, If you are buying something online and have a discount code that you can apply to the purchase, be sure to have the code written down or saved somewhere accessible. Using the code is fairly straight-forward, but can vary from website to website. In most instances you will be prompted to enter any discount code you have when you fill in your payment details.


Pay close attention as the discount code box might be small or not immediately visible on screen.
Before you complete the purchase, be sure to check that the discount has been applied to the amount you are being charged."

Deal with noise and disorderly conduct by documenting and recording the incidents.,
Correct tenants who continuously violate rules with reminders of the lease.",How to Write a Warning Letter to a Tenant," It may have been a while since you last read your tenants lease, so this is the first place to begin. Be sure that the violation you are warning your tenant about is referenced in the lease itself. This way, you can reference the lease that was signed by the tenant when you write the letter., There are different sets of laws for different communities. You need to be absolutely sure that your warning letter will be in compliance with these laws. A letter that goes against such laws can get you into legal trouble. Start your search for relevant laws at the offices of your city or town government. The offices of the mayor, city attorney, or department of housing may be useful as well.If the warning pertains to a noise violation for example, you will want to look up local ordinances pertaining to a municipalities noise rules., Just as you have to check local ordinances to see if your claims are justified, you also need to see what protection the tenant may have. For example a tenant has a right to a habitable home, service animals and to be free from harassment.Check with your local government for any tenant rights that may affect your situation.

, An official looking letter will add to the weight of the letters contents. This will help to convey the seriousness of the situation to your tenant(s). If the tenants understand the seriousness of the situation, the are more likely to comply without offering further resistance.Include a company or personal letterhead. If you do not have a letter head create one that includes your name, address and contact information such as phone number and email.
Include the date in the top left corner.
Include the tenant's name and address below the date.

, Below the date and tenant's address, in bolded and underlined font state your reason for writing the letter. This should be kept short and clear.Some warning letters are written in order to get the tenant to do something, called a compliance letter. The other type of letter is a violation letter which warns tenants that they are in violation of the lease and run the risk of terminating the lease.


For example a compliance heading could read: 'Compliance with our non-smoking policy'
A violation letter could read: 'Notice to pay or quit'.

, It is important that your letter immediately references what terms of the lease your tenant is violating. Target your letter to the matters at hand as much as possible, making it clear as to why the tenant received the letter and what the tenant needs to do about the situation.


For example, you may write: 'Pursuant to a written lease dated November 2, 2015 you agreed to not smoke in common areas near your premises'

, In a warning letter you need to tell the tenant how he or she can resolve the problem after informing them of the violation. The solution may be paying money or stopping a specific action.For example, you may write: 'You are hereby required to stop smoking in the common areas near your premises'

, By establishing what will happen if a violation continues, you will lay the groundwork for any future corrective action you may have to make against the tenant.For example, write 'If you fail to correct this violation, the tenancy will be forfeited by December 1, 2015.'

, Concluding the letter with a simple 'Sincerely' followed by your signature will work in most cases. It is important that you follow up with the tenant several days after he or she has received the letter. You will want to be sure that the tenant understood the letter and plans to make the necessary changes to his or her behavior.

, Late payment, and even unpaid rent, are some of the most common issues that a landlord will have to deal with. Typically, a landlord should provide a 3 to 5 day window after the rent due date before rent is considered late. So if rent is expected on the first of each month, the tenant should be allowed until the third or fifth of the month to pay. As a landlord it is vital that you inform the tenant about when rent is due and they with be considered late in their payment.If your tenant is late paying their rent, you can send them a reminder letter or a demand for payment letter. These letters can be delivered in person, by mail or by email. Be sure to keep a copy of the letter.A reminder letter should be generally kind in tone, reminding the tenant that they are past due in their payment. It should include an exact list of what they owe and when. The letter should conclude sternly, notifying the tenant that legal action will be taken if rent is not paid by a specific date.
A demand for payment letter needs to be more threatening. It should spell out the rent that is owed, including any late fees. It also needs to inform the tenant that you will begin eviction proceedings if rent is not paid immediately. From here, you can contact an eviction lawyer to begin proceedings.
Remember it is illegal to lock a tenant out or shut off utilities. It is also illegal to threaten, humiliate or physically remove the tenant.

, Noise violations, loud parties and other disorderly conduct are a common complaint landlord have with their tenants. In some states, repeated disorderly conduct offenses can be grounds for eviction.The most important thing for a landlord to do is in these circumstances is to document the instances of disorderly conduct, noting both the time and the exact nature of the offense (loud noise, partying, etc).


You can begin addressing the situation by reminding the tenant in person or by letter of the lease agreement, which should mention something about violating laws or causing disturbances. Provide the tenant another copy of the lease with the letter, highlighting the rules they have violated.
If the situation continues, it is within your rights to threaten eviction in a formal letter. This letter should include the dates, times and specific incidents that took place.
If you receive a complaint from a tenant about another tenant's disorderly conduct, it is you legal responsibility to discuss the problem with the noisy tenant., While some rules set out may be trivial and violation may not endanger people or the property, others rules are meant to be taken seriously. It is the landlord's responsibility to outline the rules of the property in the lease. If any of these rules are violated, a letter should be sent immediately to the violating tenant. Again, highlight the rules that were violated and order the tenant to cease the activity or risk eviction.


Consider adding the following requirements or rules to your lease; a list of all tenants, limits to occupancy, terms of the tenancy (month to month or year to year), rent amount, deposits and fees, repairs, restrictions on illegal activity and pets.As a landlord you need to be proactive and be on the lookout for possible serious violations.

Attach the addendum to the original lease document.",How to Write an Addendum to a Lease," An addendum is an addition to an already agreed upon contract. The addendum can be used to add to, subtract from, or compliment the agreement that is already in place. The document will modify the terms of the original agreement and will legally control whatever its subject matter is about.Unlike an addendum, an amendment to a lease involves changing the original contract itself. While addenda and amendments are similar, they are not the same.

, Whether you are a landlord or tenant, you should always get legal advice before changing the terms of an existing lease. This is the case because an addendum will affect your legal rights. When you are looking for a lawyer, try to find a transactional lawyer comfortable drafting and executing lease agreements and addenda. In a lot of situations, a lawyer will only represent landlords or tenants, not both. Make sure you find the best fit for your needs.


Start your search by asking friends and family for lawyer recommendations. Lawyers rely on referrals, and it is a great way to find a trustworthy one.
If you cannot find a lawyer through referrals, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with multiple qualified lawyers in your area.

, In a lot of situations, the original lease will have a provision specifying when addenda are allowed, what they can cover, who can execute them, and how they need to be drafted. Review the original contract to make sure the addendum you want to draft is allowed.


For example, your lease might state that no addenda are allowed. In this case, you will have to perform under the original lease or negotiate a new one.
In some cases, addenda may only be allowed to cover certain things (e.g., pets) but not others (e.g., extra roommates)., An addendum is technically a legal contract on its own, and it therefore must meet all the requirements of a valid contract. Generally speaking, a valid contract is formed when both parties are competent and when you have an offer, acceptance, and consideration.


Parties are competent when they are over 18 years of age and free from any mental impairment (e.g., being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, having a mental disability).
The offer, acceptance, and consideration can be summed up to say that both parties need to mutually agree to do something, or refrain from doing something, and that the parties must exchange something of value. For example, if you sign an addendum to allow a pet in one of your units, you are giving the tenant that right in exchange for a pet deposit or increased rent. This is consideration., Try to avoid creating a lease addendum from scratch. Not only will it be time consuming, it will also lead to improper and dangerous language that could adversely affect your legal rights. Contracts are a form of technical writing and the language is complex and detailed for a reason. Therefore, look for addendum templates and examples. Use the language in those agreements to help guide you.


While using templates is incredibly helpful, you should not just copy and paste. Work with the examples and edit them to fit your needs.

, The addendum should look and sound like the original lease so it is apparent the two documents are connected. You can accomplish this by using the same font, font size, and margins.Additionally, use the same language that is in the original lease as much as possible to keep things consistent.

, The title of your addendum should reference and identify the original lease. This will again help connect the two documents. For example, you might title your addendum: ""Addendum to the Original Lease Contract Executed on November 6, 1989."", The first paragraph of your addendum should lay out the purpose of the document. This will let both parties know that the addendum is modifying an existing contract. For example, your opening paragraph might read: ""This Addendum modifies and supplements the attached lease agreement that was executed on November 6, 1989. This Addendum concerns the allowance of pets on the rented premises."", The next provision should clearly identify the parties to the addendum. In addition to including the parties' names, you can also include other identifying information (e.g., their relationships to one another, their titles, and the property involved).For example, you could identify the parties by stating: ""The Parties to the Original Lease Agreement as modified and supplemented by this Addendum are: Sam Smith (tenant of the property located at 123 Lincoln Boulevard) and Sally Jones (landlord of the property located at 123 Lincoln Boulevard). The Parties to the Original Lease Agreement are also the sole Parties to this Addendum."", The addendum needs to inform the parties of when the terms will become effective.Without this information, the addendum will be ambiguous and there could be a dispute about when the addendum becomes controlling. For example, if you are a tenant and the landlord is allowing an addendum to let you have a pet, if the addendum doesn't have an effective date, you will not know when you can bring your pet to your rental unit.


To include this information in your addendum, simply add the following sentence: ""This Addendum shall become effective as of December 18, 2016.""

, Your addendum should inform both parties of what document will control in the event of conflicts. Because your addendum is likely going to modify or contradict the original lease, this particular clause is incredibly important. It should indicate that whenever there is a conflict between the original lease and the addendum, the addendum will control and supersede the original lease.


For example, an appropriate provision might state: ""The parties agree that wherever there is any conflict between this Addendum and the Original Lease, the provisions of this Addendum will control and the Original Lease will be construed accordingly."", The body of your addendum will describe the amendments being made with as much detail as possible. Specify whether each item in the addendum is replacing, amending, or supplementing an item in the original lease. Also use this area to incorporate the original lease into the new addendum.For example, one paragraph may read: ""Paragraph 1 of the Original Lease shall be modified in the following manner. .""
Use strikethroughs and bolded fonts to make your point. However, be sure you define what the purpose of these things are. For example, you might say: ""Text in bold is language added to the item while text containing a strikethrough shall be deleted from the Original Lease.""

, The end of the addendum should include space for signatures. You should include lines where each party can sign, date, and print their name., Once the addendum has been drafted, send it to the other party. Let them review it for accuracy and completeness. Before the addendum is signed, both parties need to understand what they are agreeing to.If the other party has any questions or concerns about the addendum, negotiate an acceptable agreement and re-draft the addendum as necessary.

, To demonstrate both parties' assent to the addendum and its terms, you and the other party need to sign the agreement in order to execute it. Sign the agreement in the appropriate location in the signature block and date it.


However, in some leases, the original document might define who needs to sign the agreement. For example, maybe only the landlord needs to sign the addendum or vice versa., If required, or agreed to, you can get the signatures notarized, which will help prove that each party did in fact sign the agreement. A notary is a licensed professional who will witness each party sign the agreement. At the end, the notary will put their stamp of approval on the document saying they swear they saw each party sign it.

, Once the addendum has been executed, it should be attached to the original lease. You can make copies for your records as well.

Move out by the required date.",How to Write a Letter of Notice to Your Landlord," In order to provide adequate notice to terminate your lease agreement, you will need to know what type of tenancy you and the landlord have entered into. For residential rental agreements, the most common type of tenancy is a periodic tenancy. Periodic tenancies can come in many forms, but two of the most common forms include:



Month-to-month tenancies. A month-to-month tenancy is an arrangement in which the lease may be altered or terminated monthly upon proper notice.This type of lease offers a great deal of flexibility because of your ability to terminate the lease once every month.However, the landlord also holds a good level of flexibility and may be able to raise rent or change rental terms with the same minimal notice.Fixed term leases. Fixed term leases are rental agreements in which you agree to stay and pay rent for a fixed period of time, most often one year.In this situation, a renter who breaks their lease early may incur penalties for not staying for the agreed upon period., Your rental agreement may or may not include a termination clause. If it does, be sure to read and understand it because in most situations this will provide you with directions on how to terminate your lease.


If your rental agreement clearly sets forth the manner in which you should provide your landlord with notice, then follow those directions. For example, a lease agreement may state, ""Tenant shall provide landlord with at least 10 days notice prior to vacating the premises."" In this situation, you should provide your landlord with notice at least 10 days before you move out.
If your rental agreement is silent regarding termination, you should follow your state's laws. For example, in Oregon, a month-to-month tenancy can be terminated by giving the landlord written notice not less than 30 days prior to the date you plan to move out.If you have a fixed term lease of at least one year in Oregon, you can terminate the lease by providing not less than 30 days notice prior to the agreed upon end date of the fixed term, or not less than 30 days prior to the date you designate in your notice letter, whichever is later.As you can see, in Oregon, at least 30 days notice is required. If you are in a month-to-month tenancy, you can terminate your lease at any time so long as you provide 30 days notice. However, if you are in a fixed term lease, you will not be able to terminate until the fixed term is up (unless you are willing to incur some penalty).

, In addition to understanding how much notice you need to provide your landlord, you also need to understand how that notice needs to be delivered. If your rental agreement sets out the manner in which you must deliver the notice, then you must follow that language. If your lease agreement is silent, then you should follow your state's law.


For example, your rental agreement may state, ""Any notice must be provided in writing and delivered in person and through first class mail to the address provided in this Agreement."" Under this clause, you would be required to write your notice (i.e., not provide notice verbally) and deliver that written notice both in person to the landlord and through the mail.
If there is no delivery clause, your state statutes will set forth the manner in which delivery must take place. In Oregon, you can choose to deliver your written notice either in person to the landlord or through the mail to the landlord.If you provide notice through the mail, the minimum notice requirement (e.g., 30 days) will be extended by three days.Therefore, in Oregon, if you deliver your 30 day notice through the mail, you will actually have to provide the landlord 33 days notice in order to account for the delivery time.

, When you write your termination notice to your landlord, you need to address the letter properly. In order to do so, look at your lease agreement and find the landlord's official address. If it is not provided, call your landlord and ask how the letter needs to be addressed. If you cannot get a hold of your landlord, use the address you have for paying rent.


In most states, including California, a rental agreement is required to include an address where notices can be addressed to., Either before or after the landlord's address, you will include the date your notice is delivered. This ensures your landlord understands when your notice period will start.


For example, if you are required to provide 30 days notice in order to terminate your lease, and you date your notice August 1, 2013, which is when you personally delivered the notice to your landlord, you and your landlord will understand that the 30 day period starts on August 1, 2013.

, The first body paragraph of your notice letter should state the reason you are writing the letter. This gives the landlord an idea of how they need to respond, if they need to respond at all.


You can write something as simple as, ""I, John Smith, live at . I am writing to notify you of my intent to terminate the lease agreement between myself and you. I am providing the required 30 days notice, which will start from the day this letter is dated.""
In most states, you do not need to state any specific reason for your intent to terminate.It is sufficient to simply state that you are terminating your tenancy as required by law.

, In addition to the date of delivery, the body of your letter should also state the date in which you will vacate the premises.This date will need to be some time after the required notice period is up.


For example, if you are required to provide 30 days notice and you delivered it on August 1, 2013, the date you will vacate will have to be August 30, 2013 or after. While you can certainly move out before the 30 days are up, you will be responsible for the rental unit, including rent payments, until the 30 days are up and you have vacated.

, In another body paragraph, you should respectfully request that any refundable deposits (e.g., security deposit) be returned to you upon satisfactorily vacating the premises. In addition to requesting any deposits be returned to you, you should state all of the reasons you have complied with the lease agreement, and therefore why you deserve the deposits back.


For example, your security deposit is often returned to you so long as you vacate the premises on time and so long as you clean the premises as required before you vacate. If this is the case in your lease agreement, state that you plan on leaving on time and that you will clean the premises in a satisfactory manner.
Your request may look something like this: ""In addition to providing the required notice to vacate, I am also respectfully requesting that any and all refundable deposits be returned to me, in full, within the required period set forth under the law. Per our Agreement, I will clean the apartment, fix any damage, and will have the carpets professionally cleaned. In addition, I will vacate the premises on time and will return all keys to you as requested.""

, Before you end the letter, be sure to give the landlord your new address. This new address is where your refundable deposit will be sent, as well as any notifications you may need to receive after you vacate the premises.

, Once you have written the entire notice letter, you will want to sign it. This will make it official and help if there is some dispute between you and your landlord about the notice.

, Once you have written the notice letter, make a couple of copies for yourself. If your landlord doesn't receive the notice, or there is some dispute about the notice, you will want a copy you can look back on.

, After completing your termination notice letter, you will want to consider when to give it to your landlord. Remember, the notice period will not start until your notice is delivered to your landlord.


If you are in a month-to-month tenancy, you should deliver your notice letter along with your last month's rent. This will ensure that you provide the required 30 days notice and that you will have paid the last month's rent.
If you have a fixed term tenancy, you should deliver the notice 30 days (or however long your state's notice requirement is) before the term is up. For example, if you signed a lease that ends on August 31, 2013, you should deliver your notice August 1, 2013.
While you can give the landlord notice at any time during the rental period, if you give notice in the middle of the month you will be required to cover part of the next month's rent.For example, assume you have a month-to-month tenancy and you pay rent on the first of the month.You could give your notice on the tenth of the month but you would be required to pay rent through the tenth of the following month., After deciding when you want to deliver your notice, remember to look at your lease agreement or your state's laws and understand how you will have to deliver your notice. Make sure you follow the correct procedures to ensure your notice is valid.

, Once you have delivered your notice, be sure you vacate the property on or before the date you specified in your notice letter.

Put the agreement in writing.",How to Settle Landlord Tenant Disputes Out of Court1," Communicate your problems and concerns in writing, so you have a record of the dispute.In your letter, provide a brief run-down of the problems you've faced or the issues you've had.
If you've notified your landlord about these issues previously, note that in your letter as well.
For example, you might write: ""The pipe under the sink, which I told you about in August, is still leaking. Even though I notified you of this problem on August 15 and again on September 30, no one has come to repair the pipe. I am concerned about mold growing in the cabinet.""
You may send a paper letter or an email. However, if you've had problems with your landlord responding to you in the past, you may want to mail the letter using certified mail with return receipt requested so you have proof that your landlord received your letter.
If you're sending a hard copy, make a copy of it before you send it so you have it for your records.;
, Despite the general need to have communication in writing, the best way to negotiate is to sit down and talk one-on-one with your landlord.Ideally you should set up a neutral place to meet, such as a nearby coffee shop, rather than meeting in the landlord's office. This way you both have a minimum of distractions.
If you must meet your landlord in his or her office, try to schedule your meeting after business hours, when he or she is less likely to be called away.

, Before your meeting with your landlord, get together documents or other information that supports your position.For example, if there's something in your unit that you believe the landlord should repair, take pictures or a video that shows the problem. You can bring that to your landlord.
If you have a dispute about rent payment, bring your cancelled checks or a bank account statement that shows the payments you made.
If the landlord is doing something that violates state law, make a copy of the law and bring it with you to show the landlord. This tells him or her that you understand your rights under the law.
You also should study your lease carefully and make sure you understand your landlord's policies and aren't violating any of the lease provisions.

, Begin your meeting by giving your landlord the facts of your situation or the problems you have with your rental unit.Be courteous, and avoid insults or personal attacks against your landlord. Stick to the facts, showing your documents or evidence where appropriate.
Rather than simply complaining about your landlord's action, or inaction, emphasize that you want to solve the problem at hand.
Avoid making threats that you don't intend to act on. For example, if you don't plan to file a lawsuit, don't threaten your landlord with one. Threats put people on the defensive, and your landlord may be unwilling to continue negotiating with you.

, Really listening and attempting to understand the other side is the key to any healthy and productive negotiation.Give your landlord a chance to speak, and don't interrupt him or her or have an emotional outburst.
Indicate to your landlord that you respect his or her concerns and the reasons for acting – or not acting – the way he or she did.
Keep in mind that many disputes are the result of misunderstanding. As a businessperson, your landlord should be interested in resolving the problem once you both understand what the problem is.

, Provide your landlord with a brief description of your ideal outcome and how you'd like to see the situation resolved.Avoid being dramatic or going overboard. Maybe you would like to live in your apartment rent free, but that's unlikely to happen regardless of the problems you've had.
If you want to stay, emphasize that. You might even want to mention any positive experiences you've had living there.
Acknowledge your landlord's concerns or difficulties and address them as appropriate.

, If there's anything you can do to make it easier for your landlord to meet your demands, offer to meet him or her halfway.For example, if your problem is repairs that need to be made to your unit that have not yet been made, but you know how to do some of them yourself, you might offer to make the repairs yourself and deduct the cost from your rent.

, Come to the meeting prepared with paper and a pen to record any settlement that you and your landlord reach.Don't rely on your landlord to write the agreement down after the fact – he or she may not get it correct, or may change it to be more in his or her favor.
When you write it down, make sure both of you have signed it. After the meeting, you can make a copy to send to the landlord for his or her files.

Consider the following common landlord-tenant disputes:Your landlord won’t make necessary repairs. For example, your toilet might be backed up, or your apartment might lack sufficient heat. Landlords need to keep their apartments in a habitable condition.
Your landlord enters your apartment without permission. Typically, your landlord must give you written notice of when they will enter.
Your landlord has damaged your property. For example, your landlord might not have kept the roof in good repair. If it caves in and damages your property, you can sue.
Your landlord’s carelessness has injured you. The legal term for carelessness is “negligence.” For example, your landlord might have allowed the stairs to rot. If you break a leg climbing the stairs, you can sue for your injury.
Your landlord is retaliating against you for exercising a legal right. For example, they might not renew your lease because you tried to form a tenant's union or because you complained to the housing authorities about your landlord.
Your landlord isn’t following the lease. The lease is a binding contract, and your landlord made promises to do certain things. You can sue if your landlord fails to live up to their promises.
Your landlord has discriminated against you. It’s against the law to discriminate against someone because of their gender, race, color, religion, national origin, familial status, or disability.In some states or cities, it’s also illegal to discriminate because of sexual orientation.;
, You’re an important witness to any dispute. As soon as possible, write out your memories. Try to be as detailed as possible and sign the paper.


For example, if your landlord enters your apartment without permission, then note the dates and times.
If your landlord won’t make repairs, then write down the date you first noticed the problem.
Also summarize any oral conversations you’ve had with your landlord. Write down what they said and what you said.

, Visual evidence is helpful since it shows the judge what you are complaining about.For example, if a stairwell is missing a step, take pictures. If you have a vermin infestation, record mice running around.


You won’t be able to get visual evidence for everything, but it’s helpful if you have it.

, When you sue, you need to present evidence to the judge. Preserve documents that might be useful. Consider saving the following:


all communications with your landlord
copy of your lease
any receipts if you had to replace damaged items
medical reports and medical bills, if you were injured
police reports

, Explain what you want them to do to resolve the dispute. In some states, you need to send your landlord a letter and give them a chance to correct the problem before the court will let you sue. Send your letter certified mail, return receipt requested, so that you have proof it was received.


There are sample letters online. Remember to maintain a professional tone, no matter how angry you may be. Nevertheless, be firm. You are not in the wrong—your landlord is.
Identify how the landlord has violated your rights. Provide dates and refer to any communications you have had. For example, if you sent your landlord an email about a leaky pipe, remind them of the date.
Tell the landlord what needs to be done and give them a deadline. For example, a landlord should make urgent repairs immediately.
If you want monetary compensation, tell the landlord how much. Provide any supporting documentation to back up your request for money.
Close the letter by reminding your landlord that you’ll sue if they don’t respond favorably to your request.

, Your landlord must follow many laws. If they break those laws, then it’s best to get the government on your side. Depending on your circumstances, you can call the following:


If your landlord won’t make repairs, then you can call the housing inspector. Call if the apartment’s current condition threatens your health or safety.For example, you wouldn’t call if your landlord is refusing to paint your walls, but you would if there isn’t sufficient heat or hot water. Find the number in the phone book.
If your landlord has discriminated against you, report the violation to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) here: https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/housing_discrimination. Click on “Housing Discrimination Complaint.” HUD can investigate and bring a suit on your behalf., You can save time and money by resolving the dispute without going to court. Consider mediation. Some courthouses offer mediation programs, so stop in and check.


In mediation, you and your landlord meet with a third person (the mediator) to talk about your dispute. Mediators are skilled at getting each side to listen to the other and reaching a voluntary agreement.You might have to compromise, but many people walk away from mediation feeling satisfied.
Resolving the dispute is ideal if you want to continue to rent from the landlord.

, Everyone’s situation is different, and only a qualified lawyer can assess your situation and advise you about how to sue. You can find a lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes by contacting your local or state bar association.


Costs may be a concern. If so, check if there is legal aid nearby.Legal aid provides free or reduced-fee legal services to people with low incomes. Visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website: http://www.lsc.gov.
If you’re suing for discrimination, then you might be able to hire a private attorney. You can win attorneys’ fees if you are successful.Private attorneys might also represent you on “contingency,” meaning you only pay if they win the lawsuit., You can’t just bring a lawsuit anywhere. Instead, closely analyze your situation to find the correct courthouse to sue in. Consider the following:


If you want to sue for discrimination, then you can sue in either federal or state court.You can find your federal district at this website: http://www.uscourts.gov/court-locator.
All other lawsuits can be brought in state court. Sue in the district or county where your apartment is located.
Small claims court might also be an option for those suing in state court. In every state, small claims courts handle cases involving small dollar amounts. The maximum amount differs by state. You should consider suing in small claims court because the process is usually streamlined. You don’t need a lawyer., A “complaint” starts the lawsuit. In this document, you identify yourself and the landlord. You also describe the dispute in sufficient detail and ask the judge for some remedy, usually monetary compensation.A complaint is a formal document, so research how it is supposed to look and what should be included.


If you hire a lawyer, they can draft a complaint for you. Make sure to review it before the lawyer files it.
In small claims court, there is probably a “fill in the blank” form you can use. Also, some regular state courts have fillable forms, so check their website.
If there’s no form, find sample complaints in books at the library or online. Use a sample as a guide when drafting your own.

, Once you’ve signed the complaint, make a copy for your records and a copy for your landlord. You might also need to file several copies with the original. Take everything to the court clerk’s office and ask to file.


The clerk will stamp your copies with the filing date.
You’ll probably have to pay a filing fee. Call ahead of time to check the amount and acceptable methods of payment. If you’re low income, you might qualify for a fee waiver. Ask the clerk for the form and fill it out.

, Your landlord gets a chance to respond, so you need to give them a copy of your complaint. You may also need to serve another document called a “summons,” which you can fill out at the clerk’s office.Generally, you can give your landlord notice in the following ways:


Have someone hand deliver the documents. For example, you can have someone 18 or older give them the papers, provided this person isn’t part of the case. Alternately, you can hire your county sheriff or a local process server to make delivery. However, you can’t hand deliver the papers yourself.
Mail the papers. In small claims court, in particular, you can use first class mail to send papers to your landlord.
Use other methods. Check your court’s rules.

, Whoever serves your landlord usually must complete a form, called a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service.” They will return this form to you. Make a copy for your records and file the original with the court.

, Your landlord gets to respond by filing an “answer.” You’ll receive a copy, so read it closely. Identify your landlord’s defense. For example, your landlord might disagree with your factual assertions. If you claim they entered your apartment twice without permission, they might deny the charge.


Your landlord might also turn around and countersue you. This is called a “counterclaim.”For example, if you haven’t been paying your rent, then your landlord can sue you for what you owe.

, The fact-finding stage of a lawsuit is called “discovery.” Discovery is usually simplified in small claims court. For example, you might turn over key documents, such as a copy of your lease, but not be entitled to anything else.


However, in regular civil court, discovery can be fairly long. You might have to answer questions under oath in a deposition. You may also depose your landlord or other witnesses. You’ll probably also have to answer written questions, called “interrogatories” and “requests for admission.”You can also ask your landlord for information that might be helpful. What you ask for will depend on the circumstances of your case. For example, if you are suing for racial discrimination, you might ask your landlord how many African-American tenants they have rented to over the past ten years.
If you feel overwhelmed by the discover process, reach out to a lawyer. Many lawyers can provide “unbundled legal services,” meaning you can hire them to handle discrete tasks. You retain control of the case, but the lawyer coaches you, drafts a legal document, or handles a deposition. Unbundled legal services are a good way to keep legal costs low.

, Without witnesses, it’s a “he said, she said” situation. Accordingly, find other people who can go to court to testify on your behalf. Tell them the court date and make sure they can attend.


For example, if your apartment lacks heat, a friend who has been in your apartment can back up your story.If your witnesses won’t attend voluntarily, serve them with a subpoena. You should apply for a subpoena with the court before your hearing date.

, Landlord-tenant disputes are handled differently, depending on the court. In some courts, you’ll have a full-fledged trial. In others, you’ll have a hearing, which is less formal. To know what you’re getting into, go to the courthouse and observe a hearing. Bring a notepad to take notes.

, You don’t need to wear a suit to court, but you should look neat and clean. Remember that the judge is judging you from the first moment you step into the courtroom. If possible, wear dress pants and a dress shirt. Women may also wear a conservative dress.


Leave shorts, tank tops, T-shirts, and crop tops at home.
Only wear jeans if you don’t have any other long pants.

, As the person suing, you go first. Speak clearly and slowly so the judge can hear you. Avoid talking to the landlord. Instead, direct all remarks to the judge.


You can use notes, but you shouldn’t read a written script. Use your own words and explain the situation as if you were talking to your boss.
If you have witnesses, tell the judge who they are and what they will be testifying about. You can ask them questions, and your landlord can cross-examine them. If the judge has questions, they might ask them as well., Your landlord goes second. It is important that you stay calm and not interrupt them.Avoid eye rolling or comments while your landlord is speaking. Remember that you will have a chance to respond to anything your landlord says.


Your landlord might call witnesses. You’ll also have a chance to ask them questions.
When your landlord says something you disagree with, write a note so that you remember to raise it with the judge.
As best as you can, ignore personal attacks. Your landlord might say you’re loud or that your children don’t behave. Unless these issues are related to the lawsuit, ignore them.

, After each side presents their case, the judge will rule for one of you. Generally, the judge should rule from the bench unless the case was very complicated, in which case you might get a written decision later.


If you lose, consider whether to appeal. Talk to a lawyer if you don’t have one. Appeals are time-consuming and costly.If you choose to appeal, you must file a Notice of Appeal quickly, usually within 30 days, though the precise amount of time will depend on the court.
Your landlord can also appeal if they lose.

You must be able to prove that the damage was caused by your landlord's negligence – in other words, that your landlord had a duty to prevent the very thing that caused your property to be damaged, and he or she failed to meet that duty.
Typically you'll be entitled to the amount of money it would cost to repair the damage to the property, which in some cases can be fairly straightforward.
For example, if the glass on your phone was cracked due to your landlord's negligence, and it costs $75 to replace the glass, your landlord would only be liable for $75.
However, if your property is damaged beyond repair, you will have to find the value at the time it was damaged – you aren't entitled to the money to replace it with a new item.
For example, if your roof caves in due to your landlord's negligence and destroys your laptop, your landlord doesn't have to buy you a new laptop – unless you had literally just taken your laptop out of the box when the incident happened.
Keep in mind that landlords typically aren't liable for damage to your personal property as a result of most things that occur inside your rental unit. If someone breaks into your apartment, or if a leaky pipe ruins your electronics, that's not your landlord's responsibility. This is why it's a good idea to buy a renter's insurance policy to cover your personal belongings.;
, Particularly if you are suing in small claims courts, you typically will have to provide proof to the court that you previously asked your landlord to pay for your property damage and he or she refused.Your tone should be firm, but professional. Stick to the facts, and avoid hurling insults or accusations against your landlord. Simply explain the damage and why you believe your landlord is liable.
Provide an estimated amount you believe your landlord owes you for your property damage. If this amount is negotiable, feel free to say so, but avoid giving your landlord the bottom-line minimum amount you'd be willing to accept.
Set a deadline by which you expect to hear back – a week to ten days probably is an appropriate amount of time for your landlord to respond.
Let your landlord know that if the two of you are unable to resolve the situation, you will be filing a claim in small claims court.
Typically landlords have their own liability policies, so if your landlord submits the claim to his or her insurance company and the company agrees to pay, that should be the end of it for you.

, Small claims courts typically have fill-in-the-blank forms for you to use to file a claim.Typically you'll be suing in the small claims court in the county where you live. You can find the appropriate forms by searching on the internet to see if the court has a website.
Courts in more urban areas typically make the forms available for you to download online, and some even allow you to file your complaint electronically. However, if you live in a more rural area, you may need to make a trip to the courthouse to pick up the forms.
Additionally, some jurisdictions require you to fill out the forms in the clerk's office and sign them in front of the clerk. You can find out by making a quick phone call or trip down to the clerk's office.

, The court forms require information about you and your landlord, as well as details about how your property was damaged, why your landlord should pay for it, and the total amount of your monetary claim.Make sure you have your landlord's name and address correct on your forms. If you don't, you may have difficulty having the complaint delivered correctly, which could result in the dismissal of your lawsuit.
Describe what happened that caused the damage to your property using as many factual details as possible, including dates, times, location, and context.
Provide a specific amount of money you claim your landlord owes you for the damage.
Make copies of your paperwork when you've finished it. You'll need at least two copies: one to have served on your landlord and one for your own records.

, Before you make a trip down to the courthouse, call the clerk and make sure you have all the documents you'll need to file your claim.You also may want to find out how much your filing fee will be and what forms of payment are accepted.
Some larger courts may have this information on their websites, but even that is no replacement for calling yourself to at least verify the information you've found. Details on a website may be inaccurate, especially if it hasn't been updated recently.
Additionally, some courts allow you to file your complaint by mailing it to the clerk's office along with the required fee using certified mail. If the clerk offers this option, you can determine if it's more convenient for you than taking a trip down to the courthouse.

, You must file your paperwork in person at the clerk's office to initiate your lawsuit.The clerk will stamp your documents ""filed"" and write the date on them. Then he or she will give the copies back to you.
The clerk may ask you questions about your claim, then he or she typically will schedule your hearing.
The date, time, and location of your hearing will be on your court documents, but you may want to write it on your calendar or elsewhere and commit it to memory so you don't miss your hearing or show up on the wrong day.

, The court requires you to pay a filing fee when you file a complaint, typically a hundred dollars or less for a small claims case.Filing fees for a small claims case are significantly lower than those for civil cases in other courts. Despite this, if you still have difficulty paying the fees, most courts allow you to apply for a waiver.
On your waiver application, you must provide details about your income and assets. Each court has a threshold amount for waivers, and filing fees will be waived for you if your income and assets fall below that threshold.
Typically, you'll be eligible for a waiver automatically if you receive public benefits.

, The judge will not hear your case unless your landlord has received proper legal notice of the lawsuit against him or her and given adequate opportunity to respond.Technically anyone over the age of 18 who isn't involved in the case can deliver the lawsuit paperwork to your landlord. However, the legal requirements for proper service are exacting, so paying a professional probably is worth the peace of mind that service has been completed properly.
The clerk will have information on how to get the papers served by a sheriff's deputy or private process serving company, either of which will charge a small fee.
When service is completed, they will fill out a proof of service document and file it with the court. If you get somebody else to complete service for you, you're responsible for making sure proof of service is filed with the court.

, The landlord's summons will include a deadline by which he or she must respond or risk losing the case by default.The procedure varies greatly among courts. Some small claims courts have an initial appearance which both parties must make, and the hearing is scheduled at that time. In others, the date on the summons is the date of the hearing.
If your court requires the defendant, or party being sued, to file a written answer, you'll see information about that on the papers you have to have served.
Your landlord's response may include various defenses or a counterclaim against you. If your landlord has filed a counterclaim, read the papers carefully so you understand whether you need to file any written answer.

, In small claims court, you may be allowed a simplified written discovery process through which you and your landlord can exchange information relevant to the dispute.In a regular civil court, discovery can be a long and complicated process. Many small claims courts don't permit any amount of discovery at all, and all the information you have to use at trial is whatever is contained in the complaint and the answer.
If discovery is permitted, it typically consists of each party sending the other one document, in which questions are asked or documents are requested. As a general rule, if you're suing your landlord for property damage there probably aren't any questions you would need to ask before the hearing.

, Before your hearing, take a moment to outline your argument and order any documents or photographs you want to present as evidence so you'll be prepared when you go before the judge.Write out what you plan to say when you present your case to the judge, and practice this speech several times, in front of the mirror or with friends and family as an audience.
You may want to take pictures of your damaged property, or bring the actual property to court as evidence (if it's not too large to carry into the courtroom).
If anyone observed the damage or the incident that led to it, you can bring them to court with you as witnesses to testify on your behalf. Once in court, you will ask them questions through which they will describe what happened and what they saw.
If you have people you want to bring with you as witnesses, you may want to practice asking them questions before the hearing so you both have an idea of how the process will go.
You might want to visit the court one day before your hearing, just to observe the judge and court procedures so you have a good idea what to expect.

, You want to arrive at the courthouse at least a half hour before the time your hearing is scheduled so you have time to go through security and find the right courtroom.You don't have to wear a suit or professional clothing, but make sure you dress neatly. Avoid wearing a shirt with a large logo, image or statement.
The court probably has a dress code document that you can use as a guideline when you're deciding what to wear.
The judge likely will be hearing several cases in one day, so take a seat in the gallery of the courtroom and wait until your name is called. When the judge or court officer calls your case, stand and move to the front of the courtroom.

, Since you are the plaintiff in the case, you typically have the first opportunity to tell the judge your side of the story.Using your notes, tell the judge what happened and why you believe your landlord should pay you for your property damage.
Speak in a loud, clear voice, and address the judge directly – don't talk to your landlord.
If the judge asks you a question, stop speaking and answer the judge's question immediately. Then you can go on with your presentation.
If you have any witnesses, introduce them by saying you'd like to call the person to the stand, using their legal first and last name. Your witness will be sworn in and then you can begin asking questions. The judge also may have questions for your witness.
Once you've finished your questions, your landlord will have the opportunity to ask questions as well.
If your landlord doesn't show for the hearing, you have the opportunity to win your case by default. However, you typically still must prove that you are entitled to the amount of money you claim.

, After you've finished presenting your case, your landlord will have the opportunity to explain why he or she should not be held liable for the damage to your property.Avoid shouting out or doing anything else to interrupt your landlord or distract from his or her presentation. Be aware of your body language and facial expressions. If you have any problems with anything your landlord says, you'll have the opportunity to say something to the judge about it later.
If your landlord wants to call witnesses, it will proceed under the same rules as your witnesses. After the landlord has finished his or her questions, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions as well.
Pay attention to your landlord's questions and take notes if there's something you want to bring up or ask the witness about when it's your turn.

, After both sides have had the opportunity to speak and present evidence, the judge will decide whether your landlord is liable for your property damage, and if so, how much he or she must pay you.Once you've both finished presenting your cases, the judge may have questions for either or both of you. The judge also may ask if you have any final remarks or a closing statement you want to make.
In most small claims cases, the judge will make his or her ruling from the bench. You'll also get a written order, but you may have to wait a week or two for the order to become final.
If the judge rules in your favor, you must receive the written order before you can take steps to enforce the judgment. The court won't enforce the judgment for you. When you pick up your order, ask the clerk what you need to do to enforce it if your landlord doesn't pay you.
If the judge rules against you, he or she typically will give you a summary of what you need to do if you want to appeal the ruling.

Recognize retaliation if it happens.",How to Respond to a Retaliatory Landlord," As soon as the landlord begins any retaliatory action, you need to collect evidence of it. You may be able to resolve your dispute with the landlord without going to court, but in case the matter does go to court, you will need evidence.Keep copies of any letters or notices that the landlord sends you that you believe show the retaliatory action.
Take photos of any negative living conditions that are the source of the problem.
Get written statements from other tenants, if possible, that describe what the landlord has done wrong.;
, If you are lucky, you may be able to point out the error and get your landlord to stop. But in case your landlord doesn't, you will want proof of your communications in writing. Send your landlord a letter that contains the following points:Detail the relevant act that your landlord committed and notify him or her that you believe it was retaliatory.
List any relevant laws or statutes that prohibit such behavior.
Notify the landlord that you expect the act to be reversed. For example, if the landlord issued an eviction notice, ask to have it rescinded in writing.
Notify the landlord that you will enforce your rights in the legal system if the situation is not corrected.

, In many areas, particularly larger cities, there are fair housing agencies or legal aid offices that will help tenants protect their rights against unethical landlords.Check your telephone book or do an Internet search for such agencies in your area, and contact them to seek advice and help.

, Depending on the severity of the offense, you may need to reach out to the local police, building inspector, or a city attorney’s office to report the landlord’s actions. You may only be able to file a report, or you may be able to have someone come out to your house to investigate the problem. Getting these officials involved may be enough to convince your landlord to stop whatever action he is taking.


If any of these officials respond or create any written reports, keep copies of everything.
Keep a written record of the time and date you made each contact. You may need this information for a lawsuit down the road.

, Many landlord and tenant problems can be resolved without an attorney, but if your problem looks like it's getting bad enough to go to court, you may want to seek out the advice of an attorney. To find a qualified lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few questions, you will be put in contact with a number of qualified attorneys in your area.


Be sure you ask about fees before you hire an attorney. Once you hire the attorney, make sure the fee agreement is memorialized in writing.

, If you cannot afford a full service attorney or law office, consider law school clinics and legal aid offices. Law schools throughout the country offer their students practical learning experiences by allowing them to represent low income individuals in housing disputes. Contact law schools in your area and ask about student housing clinics. If your local law school does not offer a housing clinic, find legal aid organizations that take on housing disputes. If you qualify, legal aid will offer you free legal representation so you can respond to retaliatory landlords appropriately.

, If, for example, the landlord’s level of retaliation is extreme so that he changed the locks on your apartment or something like that, then you need immediate action. Legally, this immediate help is called a Temporary Restraining Order. Go to the housing court (if your area has one) or the trial court. Once there, go to the Clerk's Office and ask about filing a complaint for a TRO.
When you talk with the court clerk, ask for the form to file for a TRO. You will have to write out the facts of what happened and provide any evidence that you have right away.
A judge will often hear your side of the matter immediately and issue a temporary order to allow you into the apartment.
You will be required to deliver a copy of that order to the landlord and perhaps contact the police to accompany you to enforce it.
The court will schedule a second hearing, usually within a few days. You will be required to provide your landlord with notice of this hearing date. At that second hearing, the court will hear from both you and the landlord. You will need to have any evidence or witnesses available at that second hearing.

, Some cities have a dedicated Housing Court just for resolving landlord and tenant issues. In other areas, you will need to file a complaint in the lowest level trial court. Look up the court system in your local telephone book or online, call the court clerk, and explain that you are a tenant with a housing issue. The clerk will usually be able to tell you exactly where you need to file. In many cases, there will be a simple fill-in form that serves as a complaint.

[

Be sure to ask about a filing fee and be prepared to pay it.

, You may choose to do this on your own or hire an attorney to help. Many landlord and tenant issues can be resolved without an attorney, but you are allowed to have legal representation if you wish. If the issue is complicated and involves a large amount of evidence and witnesses, it may be a good idea to get an attorney.Collect your evidence and organize it in a way that you can present it logically to the judge or hearing officer who will hear your case.
Make use of discovery information. Depending on the court where you file your complaint, you may have the opportunity to submit “discovery” requests. This is a procedure for you to get information from the landlord before the trial, in order to understand how he plans to present his case.

, For many landlord and tenant disputes, don’t expect this to be a full-blown trial like you see in the movies. More likely, you and the landlord will meet less formally in a conference room with a hearing officer (who may or may not be a judge) and present the two sides of your dispute. The hearing officer will listen and then issue a decision.

, While each state has its own laws, there is a list of basic rights that apply to all renters that cover the search for a place to live as well as your rights while living there. These rights include:The right against discrimination. A landlord may not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, age, family status (including not allowing children or pregnancy), physical or mental disability.
The right to use a service animal, if you need one. A landlord cannot refuse to rent to you based on a “no pets” rule if you have a trained service animal.
The right to certain information disclosure. If a landlord refuses to rent to you for some reason other than information on your official credit report, he must tell you his reasons. Some examples might include information from prior landlords or other tenants. (Note that the law does not say that the landlord has to rent to you; but he at least has to explain to you the reason, and it may not be one of the protected discriminatory issues listed above.)
The right to a “habitable” home. This means that the house or apartment you are renting must meet certain basic living conditions. There must be running water. There cannot be holes in the floors. The heat must work. It cannot be infested with rodents, insects or other pests. Every house or apartment doesn’t have to be a mansion, but it does have to meet basic standards.
The right to privacy. Your landlord may not enter your apartment without your permission, unless there is a real emergency. If he needs to make repairs or provide some other service, he is expected to give you reasonable advance notice.

, Every state has its own laws prohibiting retaliation. Some have broader definitions than others, but in general, most states apply the same basic expectations. The following distinctions are fairly universal:terminating a tenancy -- If a landlord notifies you that he doesn't want to renew your lease at the end of the month, this could be seen as retaliation. If you have recently taken some act to exercise your rights as a tenant, then his act is illegal. But if his mother-in-law needs to move in, it could just be a change in his circumstances, which would be allowable.
filing an eviction lawsuit - If your landlord suddenly files a notice of eviction or a complaint against you to have you evicted, soon after some action that you have taken to exercise your rights as a tenant, then this is likely to be considered as retaliation. On the other hand, not all evictions are retaliatory. If you have created some reason to be evicted (unacceptable noise levels, nonpayment of rent, etc.), then the landlord's action may be perfectly acceptable.
increasing the rent - If you made a complaint about pests in the apartment, and then the next month the landlord raises your rent, this is likely to be viewed as unlawful retaliation. But if you have been in the apartment for two years with no rent increase, it might be just fine.
Whatever the situation, recognize that it depends on the specific facts of your case. If your landlord's action comes right after some legal action of yours, then it will appear to be more like retaliation and the court will likely rule that way. But if the landlord can explain a valid reason for his action, then the court may rule in his favor.

, If your problem gets really bad, you may eventually need to hire an attorney. But before you get to that point, there are many resources available, both online and in print, that you can read to learn more. Check your library or local bookstore for books on renters’ rights. To get started, you can check out these links for more information:


”Tenant Rights” from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, contains links to each of the 50 states, with specific information about tenants’ rights in each state.”Renting a House or Apartment” at Nolo.com, gives useful practical information about things you should expect as a renter.”Tenant Rights” at Findlaw.com, contains links to numerous articles on specific topics about basic rights, security deposits, retaliation, and more., Understanding your rights is only the first half of the problem. Retaliation comes when you complain about your rights, and the landlord then takes some action against you.


For example, if your apartment has a bug problem, you have the right to point it out to your landlord and expect him to bring in an exterminator. If he does that, then the problem is solved. This would turn into illegal retaliation if the landlord then raised your next month’s rent because you cost him money.
As another example, suppose you complained to a Fair Housing Board because you felt discriminated against in looking at apartments, so the landlord took you in. So far, so good. But if suddenly decides not to include certain utilities in the rent that had been advertised, that would be retaliation.
Finally, suppose you rent an apartment that has badly peeling paint, because the landlord says he is planning to fix it. After six months, and no sign of a new paint job, you withhold your rent money and pay for the painting yourself. Then your landlord gives you an eviction notice for failure to pay rent. This would require some explanation in court, but the timing of things looks like the landlord’s retaliation is illegal.

"
Contact the landlord in a respectful manner.,
Prepare a rental resume.,
Dress professionally for the rental inspection.,
Be on time for the rental inspection.,
Be upfront about any pets or past rental issues.,
Communicate your strong interest in the rental property.,
Be clear about why you would be a good tenant.",How to Win Over a Prospective Landlord," When you make first contact with the landlord, you should call or email them and provide your full name, your contact information, and your interest in the property. Be brief and to the point in your phone message or your email. You can also provide a brief description of yourself, like “responsible graduate student looking for a long term rental property” or “young professional with a strong rental history”. The rental market can be highly competitive, so try to contact the landlord as soon as you see the property for rent online or in the Classifieds section of the newspaper.If you were referred to the rental property by a friend who lives in the building, and they are in good standing with the landlord, you can also mention them as a referral in your phone message or email.;
, Compile all of the necessary documentation for your application so you can simply hand it to the prospective landlord during the rental inspection. This will speed up the application process and make it easier for the landlord to determine if you would be a good fit for the rental property. Your rental resume should include:Details of your rental history: This should include your current address and past addresses, as well as contact information for past landlords and the dates you resided at each location. If you cannot locate detailed information for all of your rental history, focus on the last two places you rented or lived in.
Details of your employment history: This should include contact information for your current employer and your past employer, including their names, addresses, and phone numbers. You should also include your salary history and the dates of your employment. This will show the landlord that you have a steady income and can afford to pay rent every month.
At least two references: You should prepare at least two references, one professional reference like your current boss or former landlord, as well as one personal reference, like a family friend or former next door neighbor. Look for individuals who can boost your application and give you a good recommendation.
Your credit history and credit score: If possible, you should try to get a copy of your credit history and your current credit score from your bank. This will show your landlord you have a history of good credit and can pay bills on time. If you have a poor credit score, you should prepare a reason or explanation for your poor credit score and be able to provide current employment information that will show you can pay rent on time every month.

, Make the best first impression when you meet the prospective landlord by dressing professionally and looking presentable. This doesn’t necessarily mean a suit and tie but you should put some care into your appearance. Avoid sweats, slippers, or uncombed hair. A clean shirt, jeans, and a clean appearance will show you put effort into looking presentable for the landlord.If your potential roommate is coming with you on the rental inspection, ensure they are also dressed professionally and are presentable for the first meeting with the landlord.

, Try to be a bit early and wait outside of the rental property for the landlord with a big smile. This will make a good first impression and the landlord will likely remember that you made the effort to be on time., Do not try to hide your cat or dog from the landlord, as failing to tell the landlord about pets after the fact could be a breach of your lease. If you have a pet, check if the rental listing says “pets allowed” or “small pets only”. You can then suggest a pet interview during the rental inspection, where the landlord has an opportunity to meet your pet and assess your pet’s behavior and demeanor. This will allow the landlord to get a sense of the pet and prevent them from just moving on to another tenant who has no pets.Similarly, if you have had rental issues with past landlords, be upfront about the reasons for these issues. The prospective landlord will likely contact at least one past landlord on your rental resume, so prepare them by being honest about why you and your landlord had a dispute. This will give you the opportunity to be proactive about past issues and provide your side of the story.

, During the rental inspection, you should be clear about your desire to rent the property so the landlord understands you are a serious contender. Show your enthusiasm for the space by commenting on how nice a certain room is or how you have been searching for a place in this specific area or location. Complement the property and comment on how well it is kept. The landlord will pick up on your comments and you will give off a clear impression that you are serious about your interest.During the rental inspection, you should also make an effort to be charming and engaging. Ask the landlord about the history of the building or the past renters and engage in light conversation. Show that you are interested in what the landlord has to say and be friendly towards them. This will make a memorable impression on the landlord and they may be swayed to consider you as a potential tenant.

, Put your best foot forward by highlighting the reasons why you would be a good tenant, such as your steady income, your stellar rental history, or your high credit score. Focus on the elements of your rental resume that show you are good with money and reliable in terms of meeting deadlines or due dates.Most landlords want a tenant who will treat the property with respect and care, and who will pay rent on time. Highlight your ability to do both things by mentioning past experiences that show you will be a responsible and trustworthy tenant.

In detail, describe the issue in your apartment and why you need the repairs.
If you previously left messages for your landlord or discussed the problem, set forth all of the times that you previously notified the landlord of the problem
If this is continuing problem that the landlord only partially fixed, detail all of the previous repairs and request a more permanent solution to the situation.
If there is a potential for injury or the needed repairs make it difficult or impossible to properly reside in your apartment (no hot water, toilet doesn’t work, etc.) explain the situation in detail in the letter.Make sure that you keep a copy of your letter and consider sending the letter by certified mail so that you have proof of delivery.
You can find a sample request for repair letter at: http://www.communityactionatwork.org/tenant-support/for-tenants/forms/repair.html.;
, If your landlord fails to make the necessary repairs, you should review your state’s landlord tenant laws so that you have a clear understanding of the landlord’s responsibilities and the circumstances under which you can withhold rent, reduce rent, or have the problem repaired and deduct the cost from your rent. You can find a list of state-by-state laws regarding rent withholding and landlord/tenant rights and obligations here: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tenant-rights-withhold-rent-state. Generally, you are reviewing your state’s laws for the following:


The reasons that legally allow you to withhold your rent, such as structural repairs or repairs to the electricity or plumbing.Whether you are required to give the landlord a certain type of notice and how long they have to make the repair before you can withhold rent.
Whether you are required to place the withheld rent in a separate bank account or deposit it with the local housing authority., In order to determine whether the landlord is required to make repairs to your apartment, you must inspect your property and detail all of the necessary repairs. Once you outline the repairs needed, you need to divide the list into repairs that must be made legally and small repairs that you would like the landlord to make but that he is not legally obligated to repair. You can only withhold rent for repairs that are legally required. When making your list, consider the following:


Your landlord is required to make all repairs to ensure that your home is habitable. These repairs include, structural repairs (the ceiling has a big hole in it), repairs to leaking roofs, provide hot and cold water, ensure that the plumbing, heating and electrical systems are working and safe. The landlord must also hire an exterminator to get rid of bug or rodent infestations unless you caused the infestation.
Landlords may also be required to provide and maintain smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and window guards. Failure to do so may make the home unsafe and uninhabitable under the laws of your state.
Landlords are not required to fix dripping faucets or running toilets, small cosmetic problems such as a small hole in the carpet or scrapes on the floor, unless these repairs are required under your lease.

, Your lease is the legal contract that you entered into with the landlord that outlines both parties’ rights and obligations, in addition to those that may be legally required. Review your lease to determine what, if any, obligations your landlord has to make minor repairs and any specific responsibilities for repairs that you may have assumed under the lease as a tenant..

, If your landlord continues to fail to make necessary and legally required repairs, you must decide what steps that you want to take next. A review of your state should have indicated for you whether you are able and under what circumstance that you can either withhold rent completely until repairs are made or if you can pay someone to make the repairs and deduct the cost of the repairs from the next month’s rent. When choosing between the two options, if both are allowed by your state, review the following practical considerations:


Can you safely remain in your home while you await legally required repairs? If you answer yes, then choosing to withhold rent may be an option.
If you cannot safely or practically (i.e. no running water) remain in the home, determine whether you can afford to make the necessary repairs. It may be helpful to have a professional come out and evaluate the problem and give you an estimate on the work. You can use the estimate to determine whether you can afford to pay for the repair and include the estimate in your next letter to your landlord.
If you can afford to make the repair, it may be easiest to have the repair done and then deduct it from your next month’s rent, provided that you are entitled to repair and deduct under state law.
If you cannot afford to make the repair or safely remain in the property, you should contact a local tenant’s rights association or your local housing court to discuss your options.
If you choose to withhold rent, be sure that you review your state law’s to determine if you need to deposit the rent with a specific housing agency. If you are not legally required to do so, it may be in your best interest to open a separate account and keep all withheld rent payments in this account. If you need to go to court, you can demonstrate that you had the ability to pay and that you were diligent in maintaining your rent.

, Before taking the next steps against your landlord, it may be helpful to speak with a tenant’s advocacy organization. These organizations will be intimately familiar with your legal options, may have information about your landlord’s failure to maintain other properties, and may be able to give you advice on how best to proceed. You should explain the situation in depth and discuss how you plan to proceed against your landlord. The organization may even be willing to review your draft letter to your landlord or provide you with sample letters or how-to guides on how to proceed against your landlord.


You can usually locate these organizations online by searching for your city or state’s name and “tenant advocacy group” or tenant’s rights.

, Whether you have decided to withhold rent completely or pay for the repairs and deduct the cost from your next month’s rent, you must notify your landlord in writing and give them a brief opportunity to correct the problem. When drafting your letter, consider the following::


Set forth in detail the repairs that you are requesting.
Describe your previous requests to have the landlord fix the problem. Include all of the dates you contacted the landlord, if possible, and attach your previous letter requesting the repairs.
Reference your state’s laws that require the landlord to make the repairs and allows you to either withhold rent or repair and deduct the cost of repairs from your rent.
Set forth a date by which the legally required repairs must be made.
Describe the action you intend to take if the landlord fails to uphold his responsibilities (withhold or repair and deduct).
Include a copy of the estimate for repair, if applicable.
Send the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested.Be sure that your letter conforms to all of the requirements set forth in your state laws and that you are legally justified in demanding repair.
You can view sample letter to withhold rent here: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-letter-landlord-you-intend-withhold-the-rent.html

You can view sample letters to repair and deduct at: http://kyjustice.org/node/688 and http://www.palawhelp.org/resource/deduct-repair-tenants-right-to-a-safe-and-dec?ref=2FZB4


, If, after your last notice, the landlord fails to make the repairs, you should take the action you stated (withhold rent or repair and deduct) and contact your local housing authority.The local housing agency can come to your home, document the need for repair, and even fine your landlord for violations of the housing code. This documentation may be useful if you have to proceed to court against your landlord.


You can find your local housing authority by conducting an internet search for the name of your town and “housing authority.”
Review the website for how to report a landlord and request an inspection or call the housing authority and ask how best to proceed.

, It if appears that you will need to go to court to force your landlord to make repairs to your property, you want to gather as much evidence as possible to make your case. This evidence may include:


Your lease and any lease renewals.
Cancelled rent checks, electronic transfers or money order receipts.
All correspondence between you and your landlord about the repairs.
Any reports from the housing agency about the necessary repairs.
Any estimates you received about the cost of repair.
Witness statements from people who saw your apartment and can speak about the required repairs.
Witness statements from people who provided you with assistance because your home was not habitable (such as people who you had to stay with or use their shower because of the lack of repair).
A list of problems with dates and the landlords failure to make timely repairs.
Photographs of the damage or the condition of your apartment., If your landlord refuses to repair the property even after you withheld rent (if you chose to repair and deduct you have already been reimbursed for the work), you may have to file a court action to force the landlord to make the repairs.


Contact your local housing court and ask where you need to file your action. Many housing courts have streamlined procedures to resolve landlord tenant disputes and can even provide you with a packet of documents that you need to file in order to start your legal action against the court.
If there is no streamlined procedure for housing disputes, you may have to file a lawsuit against your landlord. Be sure to follow all local rules and regulations required for filing a lawsuit.

, After you present your evidence in court, the judge will either enter a ruling or you may choose to separately meet with the landlord to try and resolve your dispute before the ruling is entered—this is called mediation.


Regardless of how you choose to proceed, you should argue that you should not be required to pay the landlord all of the withheld rent since your standard of living and hardship were so great during the time the landlord refused to make legally required repairs.

Write to your landlord requesting mediation.,
Choose a mediation service.,
Gather documents and information.,
Attend your mediation appointment.,
Proceed with mediation.,
Get a written agreement.",How to Settle Landlord Tenant Disputes Out of Court2," If you are unable to resolve your dispute through face-to-face negotiation, a neutral third party mediator may be able to help you come to a mutually agreeable settlement.Mediation can't go forward unless both parties agree. The process is entirely voluntary, and if the two of you don't reach a compromise, the mediator won't force you to agree to anything.
Mediation also has the benefit of being confidential, which your landlord might prefer to a public lawsuit that could do damage to his or her reputation.

, Unless your lease agreement specifies a particular mediator to be used in any disputes, you and your landlord will have to agree on which service to use.Free or low-cost community mediation programs that handle landlord-tenant disputes are available in many areas, particularly larger cities and college towns.
You typically can find mediators by calling the clerk's office of your county courthouse. Some courts also have links to mediation services on their websites.

, You want to bring any documents or evidence that support your position with you to mediation.If you have photos or videos of your unit or problems you've encountered, you should bring those along with you – both for your landlord and so the mediator can better understand the issue.
You also want to bring along copies you have of any letters you sent to your landlord or notice you provided of an issue that wasn't resolved.

, You and your landlord will meet your mediator, who will introduce him- or herself and explain a little about the mediation procedure and what to expect.Typically the mediation session begins with each side making an opening statement regarding the dispute.
The mediator will encourage you to discuss any issue that you consider important. At the beginning of the mediation session, everything is on the table – even if you aren't able to work out a resolution to all issues.

, Although procedures vary among mediation services, generally you and your landlord will be separated after opening statements to meet with the mediator privately.The mediator typically will keep you and your landlord talking even if it seems as though you're not going to reach a solution. Keep in mind that mediators are trained to help two parties understand and work through their problems.
You may discover that some other issue is really at the root of the problem, and resolving that is the key to working things out.

, If you and your landlord come to a compromise that settles your dispute, either in whole or in part, make sure that agreement is memorialized in a written contract signed by both you and your landlord.Keep in mind that the mediator doesn't have any authority to bind you and your landlord to the agreement. However, if you both sign a written agreement it is legally binding to the same extent any other contract would be.
Read over the written contract before you sign it and make sure it says what you understand the agreement to be.

Check with your state's consumer protection agency.,
Find out what other resources are available.",How to Settle Landlord Tenant Disputes Out of Court3," If your dispute concerns conditions of your rental unit that may violate state or local regulations, your local housing board can assist you in resolving the problem.The housing code typically falls under city or county jurisdiction. You can do an online search for ""housing code enforcement"" followed by the name of your city or county to find the department that you should contact.
You typically can file a complaint or request an inspection of your unit. The board will review your request and send you notice of the scheduled inspection date.
When making your complaint, you typically must provide your name and contact information, as well as the name and contact information for your landlord.

, Your state's attorney general's office has a consumer protection division, although these offices typically play a limited role in landlord-tenant disputes.Consumer protection divisions typically get involved in cases where your landlord is operating unfairly or deceptively.
However, depending on your state, the office may be able to assist you in asserting your rights under state law.

, Many areas, especially large cities, have tenant associations that can assist you in settling a dispute with your landlord out of court.To find a tenants' rights group in your area, you can start by searching on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's website. A list of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies in each state is available at http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm.
The federal agency also has a list of tenants' rights groups in each state at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/rental_assistance/tenantrights. Just click on your state for links to groups and other agencies.
County bar associations also may have resources for resolving landlord-tenant disputes.
In some situations you need the government to step in and assist you with the situation, rather than trying to resolve it yourself.
For example, if your landlord is discriminating against you for an illegal reason such as race or sex, you should file a fair housing complaint rather than attempting to negotiate with him or her.

If you have an oral agreement to a month-by-month tenancy, then you might receive only an oral notice. However, if you have a written lease, then your landlord should send you a written notification.


Landlords increase rent for a variety of reasons. For example, the city might have increased property taxes, or the building might be so old that it needs extensive repairs.
Also, there are more people looking to rent an apartment than own a house. Mortgage lending standards have tightened over the past few years, and you people in particular need to rent because they can’t buy a home.When there are more renters than apartments on the market, the rent will increase.;
, Although most states allow landlords to raise the rent any amount they choose, state law typically regulates how and when the landlord can raise the rent. For example, if you have a written lease, then the landlord cannot raise the rent until the lease term ends. However, if you rent on a month-to-month basis, then your landlord can typically raise the rent by giving you 30 days’ notice.Your city may also have “rent control.” This means that the city limits how much your rent can increase in a year. For example, in San Francisco, most landlords can only raise rent 1.9% from March 2015 to February 2016 and only 1.6% from March 2016 to February 2017.There are usually limited exceptions, but they must be approved by the city’s Rent Board.

, You might be better off simply accepting the rent increase and not objecting. For example, you might want to accept the increase in the following situations:


The landlord has grounds for evicting you. For example, you might have been regularly late with rent or have broken some other term of your lease. In this situation, the rent increase might be your only way to stay in the apartment.You can afford the increase. It costs money to move. In particular, you will have to pay a security deposit on a second apartment, often before you get the security deposit from your current apartment returned. You might also have to pay for movers and to have your credit report pulled.

, You should call your landlord and ask why the rent has increased. Write down the landlord’s answer. You might also want to send an email or letter summarizing your conversation.


If your landlord is violating the law, then gently remind him of the fact. For example, you could say, “I know my apartment is covered by the rent control law. Isn’t the maximum increase this year 1.6 percent?”
If the landlord didn’t provide proper notice of the increase, then say, “I thought you had to give me the notice 60 days before the start of the new lease? I only received it last week.”
Always hold onto your communications with your landlord.If you need to sue your landlord at a later date, then you can submit the written communications as evidence.

, You may feel angry, especially if you can’t afford the increase in rent. However, there is no reason to damage your relationship with your landlord. Your landlord might not be happy having to increase the rent. Instead, he might feel like he has no choice. If the city cranks up property taxes to cover its debts, then those costs get passed onto tenants.


By remaining professional, you can assure that you will get a good reference for the next apartment that you rent. Landlords frequently call your prior landlords to ask what kind of a tenant you were. You don’t want to burn any bridges on your way out of your current living situation.

, Your landlord might be willing to negotiate a rent increase, especially if he or she did not give proper notice. You should explain how much you can pay and why.


For example, you could say, “I really like it here but I think a $15 increase is fairer than a $30 increase.”
You can also tell the landlord why the rent increase is too high. “My daughter is getting braces, which I wasn’t expecting would be so expensive. I’d really hate to move, but I don’t think I can pay $50 more a month. Maybe $20?”
Also make sure to highlight any strengths you have as a tenant.For example, you might never have been late with the rent. You should highlight that fact.

, Either the tenant or landlord can propose mediation. In mediation, both parties meet with a mediator, who is a neutral third party. The mediator listens to your dispute and then helps guide both parties to a solution that each can accept.


If you liked your tenant, then you should consider mediation. The expense and time necessary to find new tenants might make holding onto your current tenant worthwhile.
Similarly, tenants should consider mediation if they want to avoid moving. You should also consider mediation if you have found your landlord decent and helpful.If you think the landlord is a bully, then you might just need to move.
You shouldn’t mediate if the landlord is trying to push through an illegal rent increase. If you live in a city with rent control, then check to see if the proposed rent increase violates the law. If it does, then you should report the illegal rent increase to the appropriate Rent Board.
You also shouldn’t agree to mediation unless you are prepared to give something up. Mediation is a form of negotiation. The mediator is not a judge and will not decide who is “right” and who is “wrong,” so you won’t win at mediation.Instead, you will try to come to an agreement with the other side about the rent increase. Typically, this means trying to meet the other person halfway.

, Many people offer mediation services, though there is no one central place to look to find a mediator. Instead, you should look in the following places:your telephone book under “mediation” or “dispute resolution”
your courthouse, which might have a list of mediators
your town or county manager’s office
your state or local bar association
online listings at the American Arbitration Association or another website

, You might meet at the mediator’s office or at another neutral location. The mediator should begin by laying out the ground rules and then asking each side to make an opening statement.


No record is made of the mediation proceedings.You should feel comfortable expressing yourself.

, During mediation, the other party might start venting and bring up a list of grievances having little to do with the rent increase. As hard as it is to listen, you need to bite your tongue and let the person vent.For one thing, mediation is more successful if each side feels that its concerns have been heard. If you immediately object to what the other person is saying, then the other person might shut down and not want to negotiate anymore.
Also, the other person might need to just blow off some steam. After doing so, he or she might be in a better mood to meet you half way.

, Before telling the mediator your own opinion, you should briefly summarize what the other side just said. Be sure to summarize accurately.If you twist and turn someone’s words, then you should expect them to get angry.


Let the mediator know how you see the dispute. Give your reasons for why you are asking for a rent increase or why you can’t afford it.
Avoid personal attacks. For example, you shouldn’t call the landlord a greedy slum lord, and you shouldn’t call a tenant lazy or cheap.

, As you discuss your disagreement with the mediator, you might find out that a compromise is available. For example, your landlord might agree to reduce the amount of the rent increase if you promise to not be late on rent payments. You could also agree that if you are late on one payment, then your rent will immediately be increased.


The mediator is skilled at helping people find creative solutions to their disagreements. The key is to keep an open mind. If you need some time to think about a proposal, then ask for a few days to consider.
Once your reach an agreement, you can draft a new rental agreement. If you are the tenant, then make sure to read it thoroughly before signing.

, If your city has rent control, then there should be a Rent Board or other agency which hears disputes. You can find the agency in the following ways:


Search the Internet. Type “rent control board” and your city into your favorite web browser.
Look in the phone book.
Call your city manager’s office. Ask for the name and contact information of the Rent Board or equivalent agency.

, You start the complaint process by filing a petition with the Rent Board. The Board should have a printed form that you can fill out.Call and ask.


The Rent Board might have posted the petition online. You can visit their website and check.

, Each petition will ask for different information. However, you can generally expect to be asked the following:your address
your move-in date
your current monthly rent
your rent history (date of increase and dollar amount)
the name and contact information for the owner, resident manager, and/or management company

, You should make several copies of the completed petition and then take them to the Rent Board in order to file. You will file the original. You may have to send a copy to your landlord; otherwise, the Rent Board will notify the landlord. Keep a copy of the petition for your own records.


Include any supporting information or documentation with your petition. For example, you might want to include the following:copies of all available leases
rent increase notices
rent receipts
proof of payment, such as cancelled checks



, An ALJ or other government official will probably hear the dispute about the rent increase. Depending on the rules of your Rent Board, you may have to try and mediate the dispute first. If mediation is unsuccessful, then you and your landlord appear before an ALJ and present your case.You can testify or have witnesses testify. In a rent dispute case, the issues should be straightforward: whether the landlord can legally increase the rent the amount proposed. In this situation, you probably won’t have any witnesses.
Your landlord will have to justify the rent increase based upon the law. If the landlord cannot justify the increase, then you should win the dispute. The landlord will then have to increase the rent a lesser amount or no amount at all.

, After hearing the evidence, the ALJ will decide the case in your favor or in the landlord’s favor. You may have to wait a while, depending on the Rent Board.


Typically, Rent Boards have an appeals process. You should reach the rules for your Rent Board to see if you have the right to appeal the ALJ’s decision.
You generally will have only a limited amount of time in which to file an appeal.If you lose the hearing, you should immediately ask how much time you have to appeal.

Document the problem.,
Talk to your landlord.,
Follow up with a letter.,
Wait for a response.,
Negotiate.,
Call the local building inspector.,
Write down any resolution.,
Take additional action, if necessary.",How to Resolve Landlord Disputes1," Whatever issue you are having should be fully documented. The documentation will be useful in case you can’t negotiate a resolution and need to sue. Consider the following:


If you have a problem with the unit, take pictures or video of the problem. You can photograph mold, leaky pipes, mice infestation, etc.
Write down information. For example, if you don’t have enough heat, write down the date and the temperature inside.
If you are having trouble paying your rent, then document your expenses and your income. You’ll want this information to show your landlord.;
, Many disputes can be solved between landlords and tenants. Many landlords are willing to work out a solution to the problem you are having.Call up your landlord or stop by.


Document what each of you said and the date of the conversation.
Remember to be as friendly as possible. There’s no reason to assume your landlord won’t agree to help you out.

, If your landlord won’t solve the issue, you need to follow up in writing. Send either a letter or an email. Mail letters certified mail, return receipt requested. The purpose is to document in writing that you have spoken to your landlord. Include the following information:The issue. For example, you can write: “Per out telephone conversation January 22, 2017, I am reporting that my radiator has not been working properly.”
How the issue has affected you. For example, “As you can imagine, this has been most distressful. I have expected my apartment to be habitable in the winter. Instead, I am cold all day and night.”
The duration of the problem. “I first noticed the heat went out on January 21, 2017, so it has not been working for nearly two weeks.”
Any steps you have taken to correct the problem. “I bought an electric space heater to heat my apartment as much as possible. The heater cost $39.99. I’ll also have to pay for the added electricity.”
What you want the landlord to do. For example, “Please fix the radiator as soon as possible.”

, Hopefully, your landlord will respond promptly. If not, you should wait a decent amount of time. The amount of time you wait should depend on the seriousness of the issue.You shouldn’t wait more than a day for serious issues like a lack of running water, heat, or any other unsafe condition., To resolve the dispute, you may need to give something up to get something in return. For example, if you want extra time to pay rent, you should be prepared to pay a penalty or a little extra in interest.


However, you don’t need to negotiate if your lease or the law requires your landlord to do something. For example, you don’t need to pay extra to have your apartment properly heated. That’s the law.

, If your landlord ignores you, you may need to call your department of health or your local building inspector.Look in the phone book for the number. They can send someone out to investigate if your apartment is not habitable.


Only call if there is something wrong with your apartment that makes it unlivable. For example, insufficient heat or running water, or dangerous conditions, warrant a call to the building inspector.
Don’t call because your landlord won’t lower your rent or refuses to let you paint the walls. These disputes have nothing to do with the health or safety of the unit.
Try to get a copy of the inspector’s report. This will be helpful in case you go to court.
The city may fine your landlord for not fixing dangerous conditions in your apartment. Hopefully, that will spur your landlord to fix the problem.

, If you reach an agreement with your landlord, get the agreement in writing.You’ll want proof that you both agreed to a resolution. For example, if your landlord allows you to sublease your apartment, then you’ll want that in writing.


If you can’t get your landlord to sign something, at least have them email you that they agree.

, If your landlord continues to ignore you, then you may be forced to take action. Each state has different rules for what you can do. You may need to consult with a landlord-tenant lawyer or legal aid clinic to fully understand your options. For example, you may be able to do the following:Repair and deduct. In some states, you can pay to have a problem fixed and then deduct the amount of repairs from your next month’s rent. You probably have to send your landlord a letter explaining that you intend to repair and deduct.

Withhold rent. In some states, you can refuse to pay rent until the problem is fixed. You should tell your landlord why you are withholding rent. You may have to pay the rent to the local court.
Move out of the apartment. Depending on how serious the problem is, you might be able to break your lease if the apartment is uninhabitable. For example, no heat in winter makes an apartment uninhabitable.

Get a money order, if necessary.",How to Negotiate a Partial Rent Payment," You don’t want your check to bounce. If your rent is $750 a month but you only have $450 in your checking account, then don’t offer to pay $500 as a partial payment. Your check will bounce and your landlord will get angry. Also, your landlord can charge you a fee if your check bounces.Go through every source of money that you have: checking account, savings account, cash, savings bonds, etc. Add up how much money you have.
Also figure out when you will get enough money to pay the rent in full. For example, the parent of your child might be late on child support. If so, you should try to figure out when you will get the full amount. Contact the other parent if you need to.
Alternately, your boss might be late with payroll. Ask when you will get your check.;
, You shouldn’t wait. As soon as possible, send a note or an email asking if you can make a partial payment, following up with the remainder at a later date.You can begin your letter by saying, “I’m writing to ask if I can make a partial payment on my rent for this month. I unfortunately do not have the full amount at the present moment. Instead, I can pay $300.”
Don’t offer the maximum amount that you can afford in the letter. Instead, leave room to go up if the landlord wants to negotiate.

, You should also tell the landlord the date on which you will have the rest of the rent payment.“I will have the rest of the rent payment on the 15th of the month.”

, If you have a good reason for not having the full amount of rent, you might want to explain the reason to your landlord.However, make sure that you have a legitimate reason for being late.


Don’t say you’ve been irresponsible and have to pay your maxed-out credit cards instead. If you give this as your reason for being late with rent, then a landlord will assume you will have difficulty paying rent in future months.
However, you might be short of funds for a legitimate reason. For example, you might have started a new job, which is holding your first pay check for a month. In this situation, you will not be late in the future. Explain the situation to your landlord.

, You will have better luck getting the landlord to agree to a partial payment if you promise not to be late again.Also give reasons why the landlord should believe you.


You could state, for example, “I promise that I won’t be late again. After this month, I will start being paid on a regular schedule, so I will always have the full amount on the day rent is due.”

, You can assume your landlord knows how to contact you. But for ease of reference, close your letter by telling your landlord how to reach you.


For example, you could close your letter by saying, “I hope this offer is acceptable to you. If so, please let me know at 555-5555 as soon as possible. If not, we can discuss the rent payment at the same phone number.”

, Your landlord will either accept partial payment or will reject your offer. If the landlord rejects it, then you will need to negotiate.


Your landlord should be willing to accept partial payment if you have been a good tenant and if your reason for being late is plausible.
Although your landlord can move to evict you, it will take too much time as a practical matter. Your state law might require that the landlord give you a couple of weeks to get caught up on your rent. Also, if the landlord brings a suit to evict you, you will have a couple weeks to respond. By that time, you probably will have the rest of the money due for rent.

, Often, people avoid negotiation because of their fears. They fear rejection or looking pushy or angering the landlord. You need to try to overcome your fears in order to negotiate effectively.Ask yourself why you are worried that you might look pushy. Remember that no one will know that you are negotiating other than your landlord.
You also shouldn’t fear rejection. At worst, your landlord will reject the partial payment. However, if he does this, then he will need to move to evict you, advertise for a new tenant, and perform background checks on new applicants. That’s a lot of work, especially if the landlord is guaranteed to get the full payment in a few weeks.

, If the landlord insists on full payment, then increase the amount you are willing to pay. For example, if you initially offered $300 in your letter, you could offer $400.


Say, “I can offer you $400 right now. It’ll be hard to buy groceries, but I can get the money to you today.”
Also remind your landlord that you will have the rest of the money soon. “Like I said in my letter, I’m getting paid on the fifteenth, so I can get you the rest of the money then.”

, Your landlord might tack on late charges or interest to any late payment.Often, these charges and fees are spelled out in your lease. Take out the lease and read it.


You should ask if you can get the late fees waived. Your landlord might not agree, but it is worth asking. You don’t want to pay more than you have to.

, See if you can get a loan from your parents or other family members. Try to get an interest-free loan. Explain your situation and tell them that you need cash fast to cover your rent payment.


Don’t borrow from pay day lenders or other private lenders, which usually charge high interest rates. By taking out these kinds of loans, you are more likely to get further and further into debt., If you need to come up with money, you can try to sell possessions. For example, you could pawn valuables such as jewelry or electronic equipment.


You might also want to sell items on eBay, though it could take a week or so to complete the sale and get your money.
You could also advertise online. You can list items for sale on Craigslist, for example. Name your price and ask for cash payment. By getting cash payment, you won’t have to worry about the buyer’s check bouncing.

, You might only have cash on you and not have enough time to get to the bank. In this situation, you can just go to your nearest Post Office and get a money order."

Find a mediator.,
Participate in mediation in good faith.,
Caucus with the mediator.,
Write an agreement.",How to Resolve Landlord Disputes2," In mediation, a third party listens to you and your landlord explain the dispute. This person doesn’t act as a judge. Instead, they try to help you both reach a resolution you can live with.Mediation is voluntary, so you can walk away at any time.


Mediation can help you preserve your relationship with your landlord. This is critical if you intend to keep renting from them.
You will typically split the cost of a mediator. Depending on the dispute, they typically charge a couple hundred dollars an hour, which is probably cheaper than going to court.

, You can ask another tenant if they can recommend a mediator. If not, then look for a mediator in the following places:


Telephone book. Look in the Yellow Pages under “mediation” or “dispute resolution.”
Local community centers. Some communities have dispute resolution centers.
Your city government’s office. They might have a landlord-tenant mediation program, which is often free to use. Alternately, the office could point you in the right direction to find a mediator.Courthouse. Some courthouses have mediation programs or lists of mediators you can call. Stop in and check.

, You should only participate in mediation if you are willing to compromise. You aren’t likely to get everything you want in mediation. Participate only if you are committed to finding common ground.


Mediation typically begins with each side laying out how they see the dispute. Be honest. Mediation won’t work unless you say what you want.
Watch your language. Although you want to be honest, you shouldn’t be offensive. You might think your landlord is a slumlord, but you should be open to what they say.
Try repeating what your landlord says to you. For example, you can say, “I definitely hear what you’re saying. You are worried I’ve been late with the rent for the past three months.” By acknowledging someone else’s worries, you can calm them down.
Maintain your cool. Sometimes people vent in mediation. Try to stay calm by taking deep breaths.

, As mediation progresses, the mediator might decide to caucus with each person. This consists of meeting alone with you in your own room. The mediator shuttles between the rooms, telling you what the other side is thinking.Caucusing can be effective if you reach an impasse or if you are close to a resolution but can’t reach agreement on the final few details.

, You should document any agreement you reach with your landlord. For example, if you agree to a new lease, then you should write it out. Your mediator can help you write an agreement.


Both you and your landlord should sign. Keep a copy for your records.

For example, your paycheck might be delayed because you have started a new job and your company doesn’t pay until three weeks have passed. In this situation, you can be certain of the date on which you will have the money.
By contrast, if you simply have no money, then there is little point negotiating a delayed payment. Effective negotiation will require that you give the landlord a date for making the payment.
If you don’t have the money, then consider other options.;
, As soon as you realize you can’t make rent, you should write a note or email to your landlord. Ask if you can pay at a later date.Open the letter by stating why you are writing: “I’m writing to see if I can delay my rent payment. It is due the first of March.”
If you can make a partial payment upfront, then include that information in the letter. Offering even a partial payment signals your good faith attempt to pay your rent.

, Also give the date when you can make payment.If you cannot make payment when it is due, then your landlord will want to know when you can pay.


“The earliest I can make payment is the 15th.”

, Your landlord will also want to know why you are late with the payment. Accordingly, you should give a reason in your note or email.Be careful about the reason you give. The landlord will want to see that the reason is a one-time event and not likely to recur. For example, if you don’t have any money because you started a new job, then the landlord might give you a break.
However if you don’t have the money because you lost your job, then the landlord might suspect that you won’t find another job and therefore will never pay rent again.

, Your landlord also wants a reason to believe that you won’t continually ask for extensions on your rent payment. For this reason, you should make a promise never to ask for another extension.For example, you can write, “I promise not to ask for an extension again. Once I get my first check, I will be able to pay rent on the first of the month, as agreed to in our lease.”

, Your letter or email is the opening move in the negotiations. Politely ask the landlord to contact you with a decision about whether you can delay your rent payment.


For example, you can write, “I hope you will agree to the two-week delay. Please contact me as soon as possible at . If you don’t agree, then we can discuss other options.”

, Your landlord will either agree to let you delay payment or demand that you make payment immediately. You should be prepared to negotiate for a delay if the landlord rejects your request.


If you have been a good tenant, who is rarely late with rent, then your landlord should be willing to accept a delayed payment—especially if you have a believable reason for being late.
Also realize that it is unlikely that your landlord will move to evict you. Technically, he can. However, as a practical matter, an eviction proceeding will take too much time. For example, the landlord will have to file a lawsuit in court, and you will have some amount of time (usually several weeks) to respond to the lawsuit. By that point, you probably will have your rent money.

, Sometimes people are afraid to negotiate. Unfortunately, this is often true of women. People fear negotiation for different reasons. For example, they might fear coming across as pushy. Or they are afraid of angering their landlord.You shouldn’t let these fears get in the way of negotiating for a delayed rent payment. In particular, although asking for the delay might anger your landlord, missing the payment will anger him as well. You really have no choice but to explain your situation and try to get an extension.
Furthermore, look at the negotiation as an opportunity to work on your negotiating skills. People can benefit from negotiating in a variety of contexts: negotiating for a higher salary or a lower purchase price for a car. Consider this negotiation with your landlord as a learning experience.

, Your landlord may call you and demand full payment on time. You need to be prepared to make a counter-offer. Try to give the landlord a reason to accept the late payment.


For example, you could say, “I’m sorry, but like I said in my letter I don’t have the money right now. But if you’ll let me pay on the fifteenth, then I’ll pay an extra $50.”

, Your lease probably allows the landlord to add late fees or to charge interest for each day the rent is late.However, you should try to get these waived.


On the one hand, you don’t want to press your luck. If you are having a hard enough time getting the landlord to accept the delayed payment, then you might want to remain silent on late fees.
On the other hand, if your landlord readily agrees to the delay, then gently ask if you can get the fees waived as well.

, Instead of asking for a delay, you might want to get a loan from a friend or family member. Ask for an interest-free loan. Your family and friends might understand your financial difficulties and be happy to help.


Whatever you do, you should never borrow from “pay day” lenders. These outfits often charge outrageous interest rates, more than 200% in some cases. If you take out one of these loans, then you will probably fall even deeper into debt.Instead of going to a pay day lender, check with your bank or credit union. They might make short-term loans for a reasonable interest rate.

, You also can pay your rent using a credit card. There are many websites out there which will send a check to your landlord. All you have to do is log onto the website and give your landlord’s address. Then you pay with your credit card.


Some companies which provide this service are RadPad and RentShare. They take a small processing fee in exchange for their service.RadPad, for example, charges 3.49% for most credit cards, though payment with debit cards has no fee.Admittedly, you will have to pay interest on a credit card purchase (unless you pay the amount off in full). However, credit card interest rates are still preferable to those of pay day lenders.

, You might have no choice but to sell possessions to raise money for your rent. In that case, go through your apartment and find objects that look valuable. Typically, you can sell jewelry and electronic equipment the easiest.


Next, find a place to sell the goods. You can always sell items on eBay. However, you might have to wait a while to get payment, so this might not be the best option.
Instead, look in your phone book or search online for the nearest pawnshop. At the pawnshop, you get a loan for the value of the items you deposit. You will get a ticket in return. When you have enough money to pay back the loan, you can return to the pawnshop and get your stuff back. If you never return, then the pawnshop keeps the items.You might also advertise on Craigslist. State that everything is for sale “as is” and for cash only. Don’t accept checks as they might bounce.

, If you don’t have enough time to deposit cash into your checking account, then go to your nearest Post Office branch and get a money order. You can make out the money order to your landlord and drop it off.

End the attorney-client relationship.",How to Get Legal Help for a Landlord Tenant Dispute," You should create a list of lawyers you can research and potentially meet with for a consultation. To build the list, gather referrals from a variety of sources:


Other tenants or landlords. If you know someone who was recently involved in a landlord-tenant dispute, then you should ask them if they would recommend their lawyer.
Bar association. Most state or local bar associations have lawyer referral programs. You can contact the association and explain your situation to the lawyer or paralegal on the other end of the line. This person will then connect you with a lawyer who can handle your legal issue.Other attorneys. Other lawyers are a good source of referrals. If you used a lawyer to represent you in a criminal matter or to write a will, then reconnect. Ask the lawyer to recommend a landlord-tenant attorney who can help you.
Online directories. Many websites have attorney directories. For example, FindLaw runs a directory, which you search by city or state.You can search for lawyers who handle landlord-tenant disputes.;
, You can get a good sense of the lawyer’s experience and capabilities by looking at his or her website. Before calling to schedule a consultation, you should look at the website. Pay attention to the following:



Experience. Does the lawyer have experience with landlord-tenant disputes? Is the lawyer’s entire practice devoted to this issue? If you don’t see any landlord-tenant experience listed, then you might want to cross the lawyer off your list.

Expertise. If the lawyer has written articles about landlord-tenant law, then there should be links on the website. A lawyer who regularly publishes about landlord-tenant issues probably keeps up with changes in the law.

Awards. Look to see if the lawyer has received any recognition from the legal community.

Grammar and spelling. Any lawyer who publishes a website full of grammatical and spelling errors probably is careless in his representation of clients as well. You should cross off your list any attorney with a sloppy website.

, Most lawyers should offer a 15-30 minute consultation.Call and schedule one. Unless you have a lot of time to spend meeting with lawyers, you might only want to schedule consultations with three or four lawyers.


Ask if you will be charged for the consultation. Many attorneys now offer free consultations, while others charge a reduced fee ($50 or so).
You might want to consider paying a small fee for the initial consultation. A lawyer might be willing to share more legal strategy during the consultation if you are paying. You could then use this information in case you decide to represent yourself further down the road.

, To have an effective consultation, the lawyer will need to know the substance of the dispute. Accordingly, you should write down a few sentences explaining the dispute. Then you should gather relevant documents and take them to the consultation. Think about bringing the following:


Any notices. For example, in an eviction dispute, the landlord should serve the tenant with a Notice to Quit or a Notice to Cure.The lawyer will want to see these documents.
Documentary evidence. If the tenant destroyed property, then photograph it. On the other hand, if the landlord does not heat the building properly, bring whatever proof you have, such as photographs of your thermostat.
A copy of the lease, if you have one.
Rent receipts or other evidence of payment history.Any court documents already filed. For example, the landlord’s or tenant’s petition or notice of petition., You will have time to ask a few questions during the consultation. Prepare your questions ahead of time. You might want to ask about the following:Fees. How much does the lawyer charge? How is the fee calculated? Does the lawyer also bill for work performed by support staff?

Experience. Has the lawyer represented landlords or tenants in your kind of dispute? How did the case turn out? What percentage of the lawyer’s case load consists of landlord-tenant disputes?

Communication policy. How often does the lawyer communicate with his or her clients? Does the lawyer prefer email or telephone? How typically involved are clients in their lawsuits?

Outcome. What are the different possible outcomes for this dispute? What does the lawyer think would be an ideal outcome.

, After meeting with the lawyers, review your notes. Decide which lawyer you liked the best. If you didn’t like any, then you will have to get more referrals and schedule more consultations.


You should only hire a lawyer if you felt comfortable talking to him or her during the consultation. You will want to feel comfortable asking questions and working closely with your lawyer.Also make sure that the lawyer’s fee is reasonable. You don’t have to hire the cheapest lawyer, but you shouldn’t feel like the lawyer is charging more than you can afford.If every lawyer you had a consultation with was too expensive, then get more referrals or look for low cost legal help.

, If you don’t have much money, you should still try to find legal help. Legal aid organizations provide free legal help to people with low incomes.You can find a legal aid clinic near you by searching the Internet.


You can also find a legal aid organization by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. Click on “Find Legal Help” and enter your address. A list of nearby legal aid organizations should pull up.
Lawhelp.org also contains helpful information on landlord-tenant disputes. It has links to legal aid offices in each state., Law schools often run legal clinics. In the clinic, students provide free legal services under the supervision of a clinical staff member. If you cannot afford a lawyer, then the clinic might be able to represent you in a landlord-tenant dispute.


Call your nearest law school and ask if there is a clinic. If there is one, ask who you can speak to about your legal problem and ask if you need to set up an appointment.

, Many courts have self-help centers where staff can answer basic questions and tell you how to fill out forms.To check if a self-help center is available, visit or call your courthouse and ask.


Some states now have self-help “centers” entirely online. The state of Michigan, for example, runs a website which provides legal information and links to court forms., For example, you can hire a lawyer to draft a court document or to represent you at trial. You would then be responsible for handling the rest of the dispute on your own. This is called “limited scope representation” or “unbundled” legal services.Limited scope representation is a good way to keep legal fees down. You can have the lawyer handle the parts of the case you don’t understand and don't have time to learn.
If you are interested, then make sure that you ask the lawyer during your consultation whether he or she offers this service.

, Before hiring a lawyer, you should do some background research on his or her disciplinary history. Each state has a disciplinary board which gathers complaints about lawyers. If the complaint has merit, the board disciplines the attorney.To find the lawyer’s disciplinary history, you should find your state’s website. Type “attorney discipline” and “your state” into a search engine.
At the website, you can then look up attorneys by name. If the lawyer has been disciplined, a notation should be made on the lawyer’s record.

, You can also avoid a bad lawyer by reading reviews on the Internet. Many websites such as Avvo and FindLaw now allow clients to review attorneys.Often, you can find these reviews by typing the lawyer’s name into your web browser.


Pay attention to patterns in the reviews. One negative review might not tell you much about the lawyer. However, if you see the same complaint repeated across several reviews, then you might want to credit it.

, Avoid any lawyer who does the following:


Promises a result. A lawyer is ethically prohibited from promising a client a result.Instead, the lawyer can rely on his or her experience to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your case.
Has a messy office. When a lawyer has papers stacked up all over the place, then you can safely assume the lawyer is disorganized and maybe careless. Also, any lawyer with client files out in the open is not safekeeping client secrets.
Employs rude staff. You can judge a lawyer by the quality of staff he or she employs. If the staff is unhelpful or rude, then you can assume the attorney does not value his or her clients very highly. Also, the lawyer might be out of the office too much to properly supervise employees.

, If you choose the wrong lawyer, then a time might come when you need to end the relationship. You generally have a right to end the relationship whenever you want and for whatever reason.


You should first try to resolve the issue with the attorney. Ask why he or she made a certain decision and explain why you disagree with it. This gives the lawyer a chance to explain the decision or to correct it.See Know when to Fire Your Lawyer for tips on when to end the relationship with your lawyer.

Continue with the lawsuit.",How to Get Your Landlord to Fix a Mold Problem," Mold can grow in a variety of places. However, it usually grows in water-soaked areas, such as ceiling tiles and wall paneling. Molds come in different colors—black, white, gray, or green—and can be shiny or hard to see.Once you find the mold, take color photographs.You will want these photographs in case there is a court dispute.


Remember to note the date and time you took the pictures.
Some cameras or smart phones will stamp the date on the picture automatically. Make sure it is the correct date.;
, It matters what causes the mold. For example, if you have caused the mold because of your behavior, then the landlord might not be legally required to fix it.Look around to see if you can find the cause.


Mold can be caused by leaking roofs, windows, or pipes. Your landlord should have fixed any leaks when notified.
You might have caused the mold by maintaining high humidity or not keeping the apartment clean.
It’s okay if you can’t identify the cause. Your landlord will need to clean the mold regardless.

, Document how long you have been aware of the mold, as well as how long the underlying cause has existed. Your own observations can be useful evidence in case you go to court.


Also write down how the mold has made you feel. Are you tired? Stuffy? Having trouble breathing?

, The mold might be causing medical problems, such as asthma or difficulty breathing. If so, you should visit a doctor and hold onto your medical records. These records will show that the mold has hurt your health. You may need to show them to your landlord.You can also ask the doctor to write a letter identifying the likely cause for your health problems.Make sure to tell your doctor about the mold.

, In the U.S., there is no federal law regulating mold in apartments. However, depending on where you live, there may be city or state laws.You should research whether there is a law that applies.


Search for state laws online. Type “your state” and “mold law” into your favorite search engine. You may also contact your state’s Department of Health. Only a few states have laws against mold—Texas, Maryland, New Jersey, California, and Indiana.
To find local ordinances, contact your city or county housing authority. For example, New York City’s Department of Health has created guidelines on air quality indoors.

, Call them up and tell them the problem. Because your state might not have mold laws, you should identify the cause of the mold, such as a leaking pipe.Ask your landlord to fix the problem.


If your state or local government has mold laws, then also request that the mold be cleaned.
If the landlord doesn’t respond, then follow up with a written letter, restating your request.Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested and hold onto the receipt.Staple the receipt to your copy of the letter. It is important to keep copies of all communications in case you need to go to court.

, You can find them by looking in your phone book for the number to call.Report the problem and also tell them when you contacted your landlord.


Remember that if your state doesn’t have a mold law, you should instead complain about the underlying cause (e.g., a leaky roof).
The department may send you a complaint form to fill out. Alternately, they could send a sanitation inspector out to document the problem.

, Your city should have detailed housing codes your landlord must follow to make your apartment habitable. You should report any code violation to them. You can find the number in your phone book.Only mention mold if your local law actually has a law regarding mold. If not, then simply mention the underlying problem that is causing the mold, such as the leaky roof.
For example, you could say, “Hi. I want to report a roof that leaks at my apartment building. My address is….I wrote my landlord two weeks ago but nothing has happened. Can you send someone out to investigate?”
You may have to call several times. It may be difficult to get someone to come out and look at the problem. Stay persistent.
The housing authority can fine your landlord, which should create an incentive for them to fix the mold problem. However, your landlord could refuse to pay the fine.

, Your options will depend on where you live. However, you generally will be able to take any of the following actions:Sue your landlord. You can bring a lawsuit to force your landlord to clean the mold and fix the underlying problem. Alternately, you could ask the court to give you money to compensate for the injuries you have suffered.

Withhold your rent. Depending on where you live, you may be able to stop paying rent, which will create an incentive for your landlord to finally fix the problem. You may have to provide a letter to your landlord explaining why you are withholding rent.
Fix the problem and deduct the cost from your rent. If you hire someone to clean up the mold, you can deduct the amount from any rent payment. For example, it might cost $500 to clean up the mold. If your rent is $750, you can pay only $250.

Move out. Depending on the severity of the mold, you might be able to break your lease and leave. Your landlord might sue you, but you can use the mold as justification for leaving by claiming you have been “constructively evicted.”

, Lawsuits are complicated, and you will benefit from hiring a lawyer. If you don’t have much money, then you might be able to find legal aid or other low-cost legal help. Find a lawyer in the following places:


Your city or state’s bar association might have a referral program. Find the nearest bar association here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx. Ask for someone who specializes in landlord-tenant law.
Low-income people can find legal aid at the Legal Services Corporation’s website: http://www.lsc.gov. Type in your address. You generally will qualify for legal aid if your income is 125% of the federal poverty level.
Self-help legal centers. Some courts have self-help centers or staff on hand who can answer questions about suing a landlord. Ask the court clerk.

, Typically, you will sue your landlord in the county where the apartment building is located or in the county where the landlord resides. You can find this court by looking in the phone book for your county.


Some cities might have specialized Housing Courts. New York City does.Look at your county court’s website to see if there is a specialized housing court.

, A complaint describes the dispute between you and your landlord. Check with your court to see if there are printed, “fill in the blank” complaint forms you can use. Also check the court’s website for a form.


If there isn’t a form, you can have your lawyer draft a complaint for you. The complaint should identify you and the landlord and go into detail about the problem.
You also have to ask the court for something if you win. For example, you might sue for money compensation. Or you could request that the judge order your landlord to clean the mold.

, Make a copy for your records and a few additional copies. Take your original and the copies to the court clerk. Ask to file. The clerk should stamp the filing date on your copies.


You probably must pay a filing fee. Call ahead of time to check the amount of the fee and acceptable methods of payment.
Ask for a fee waiver if you are low income., Your landlord has a right to respond to your lawsuit, so they need notice that you are suing them. Generally, you can provide this notice by sending a copy of your complaint to them. Depending on your court, you may need to send other documents, such as a “summons.” Ask the clerk for everything.


Acceptable methods of service will depend on the court. Usually, you can have someone 18 or older hand deliver the paperwork on your landlord, so long as they are not a party to the lawsuit. You cannot make service yourself.Alternately, you could pay the local sheriff or a private process server a small fee to make hand delivery.
In some courts, you may also be able to send the paperwork using first-class mail.

, Your landlord will send you a copy of any response they file. Often, a landlord will claim they don’t have a legal duty to clean the mold, or they might claim you never notified them of the problem. You should read the response carefully.


Your landlord might also suggest mediation to resolve the dispute. In mediation, a neutral third party (the mediator) listens to each side describe the dispute. They then try to guide each side toward a compromise they both can live with., The substance of your lawsuit will depend on where you live. If you live in an area with mold laws, then you can sue on the grounds that the present condition of your apartment violates the law. The court might order your landlord to clean up the mold.


If your location does not have a mold law, you will argue that the apartment isn’t “habitable” and ask for compensation for your injuries (including medical injuries). If you win, the court might award you a sum of money, which you can use to clean the mold.
Evidence will be key. By the time you file your lawsuit, you should have the mold problem well documented with pictures, medical records, government inspection reports, and copies of your communications with your landlord.

Read your lease.,
Make a list of any unreasonable living conditions.,
Take pictures of areas that require repairs.,
Put the request for repairs in writing.,
Take further action if necessary.",How to Get Your Landlord to Pay for Apartment Renovations1," Make sure that you understand all responsibilities of the landlord and those of the tenant (you). In particular, read thoroughly any sections concerning repairs, maintenance, or damages. If your apartment is in need of repairs in order to bring it up to acceptable living conditions, laws generally state that it is your landlord’s responsibility to take care of those repairs. Typically, leases require landlords to ensure that properties remain livable, which means things like:


Meeting building codes
Keeping the building clean and free from damage
Keeping the building safe from intruders (all windows and doors function properly, for example)
Ensuring protection from the weather (no leaks, drafts, etc.);
, According to typical housing laws, landlords are required to ensure that the condition of their rental properties meet basic standards.For instance, if you have leaks, mold, broken windows, or other substandard conditions in your apartment, your landlord should take care of the repairs in a reasonable amount of time, and at no cost to you.


Remember that most landlords are willing to pay for necessary repairs if you inform them that they need to be done.The rental properties are investments for landlords, and they want to ensure that the properties stay in good condition and continue to provide returns.
Generally, there are special laws regarding renovations necessary to remove hazardous materials such as lead and asbestos.Your landlord should disclose if any of these materials are present, and you can ask about renovations to remove them.

, Before asking for necessary renovations, take pictures of any damaged or substandard areas of your apartment. Make at least two sets of these pictures, and mail one set to your landlord, if necessary. This will provide proof of the necessary renovations, should you need it.

, Type, save, and print a list of necessary renovations, so that there will be a record of the request. If you have to mail the request to your landlord, use certified mail so that you can verify receipt.


Make sure to include copies of the pictures you took when giving your landlord a copy of your request.
Keep a record of all additional communication with your landlord as well., When asking your landlord to take care of necessary renovations, keep communication polite and professional. More than likely, your landlord will respond in kind. However, if your landlord does not respond to your request, refuses to make necessary repairs, or makes unreasonable delays in doing so, you can take further action. Depending upon the area in which you live, you may be able to:File a complaint with a local official, such as a housing, fire, energy, or health inspector.
Ask a court to hold your rent in escrow, and to order the landlord to make the repairs.
Sue the landlord under any applicable laws.
Consult an attorney for legal advice if you think you need to take legal action against your landlord.
Even if your landlord delays in making the necessary repairs, you should still pay your rent on time and following any housing rules, because if you do not, you may violate your lease.

Identify the law your landlord broke.,
Obtain legal help.,
Find the correct court.,
Draft a complaint.,
File the complaint.,
Read your landlord’s response.,
Prepare for court.,
Attend your court hearing.",How to Resolve Landlord Disputes3," You can’t sue for every dispute. For example, if you want to paint your walls red, you can’t sue since you don’t have a right to paint your walls. You can only sue if the law allows you. Identify what law your landlord broke:



Your lease. Your landlord must abide by the terms of the lease. For example, if the lease says you can sublease your unit, the landlord cannot deny you the right to sublease.

Your local law. Most city and county governments set health and safety standards. If your landlord hasn’t complied, you can sue.

State law. You can find a summary of your state’s tenant rights by visiting the Housing and Urban Development website here: https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/rental_assistance/tenantrights. Click on your state.

Federal law. Most antidiscrimination law is federal. You can sue if discriminated against on the basis of religion, gender, race, color, familial status, or handicap., You will benefit from a lawyer’s assistance. You can hire the lawyer to represent you, or you can only meet for a consultation where a lawyer will answer your questions. Money might be tight, but you can look for low-cost legal help:


Contact your state or local bar association. Ask for a referral to a lawyer.
Find legal aid if you are low income. Legal aid provides free or reduced-fee legal services to people with low incomes. Visit http://www.lsc.gov and enter your address. Legal aid is typically available for people with incomes less than 125% of the federal poverty level.Contact your nearest HUD office. Ask if they have information about any tenants’ association in your area.

, You can sue in different courts, depending on the substance of your dispute with the landlord. For example, consider the following:



Housing court. Some cities have special courts for landlord-tenant disputes. These courts are set up so you don’t need a lawyer—though you can have one if it is helpful.

Small claims court. If you are suing for a small dollar amount, you can typically sue in small claims. These courts are designed for people without lawyers, and procedures are simplified. However, you might not be able to get everything you want from a small claims court. For example, you typically can sue only for money. You can’t sue to force your landlord to do something.Regular civil court. You can bring lawsuits in the regular civil court for the county where you live. In most states, each county has a court. Check your phone book. You can sue for money or for an “injunction,” which is a court order to do something (or to stop doing something).

Federal court. If you’re suing for a violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, then you should sue in federal court. You can find the correct federal court by using the federal court locator here: http://www.uscourts.gov/court-locator. Enter your zip code.

, You begin a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. In this document, you describe the dispute with your landlord. You also explain the legal violation and what compensation you want from the judge.


Your court may have a printed, fill-in-the-blank complaint form.Often, housing courts and small claims courts have these forms posted on their websites. If not, you can stop into the court clerk’s office to check.
Not every court will have these forms, so you may need to consult with a lawyer or hire the lawyer to represent you. The lawyer can draft the complaint.

, Make a copy of the complaint for your records. Also make several other copies. You’ll need to send your landlord a copy and possibly provide the court with a few extras as well. Take all copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask to file.


You’ll probably have to pay a filing fee.Ask the court clerk for a fee waiver form if you can’t afford it.
Remember to serve a copy of the complaint on your landlord. Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods. Generally, you can have an adult who is not a party to the lawsuit hand deliver a copy. You might also be able to mail it using first-class mail.

, Your landlord has a right to respond to your complaint. They can provide their own background information on the dispute. They can also raise defenses. You will receive a copy of the response. Alternately, your landlord might simply show up on your hearing date and give an oral response.


Often, your landlord will argue they didn’t break the lease or the law. This is why you need evidence.
Sometimes they might claim you created the problem. For example, if you have mold, then they may blame you for not ventilating the apartment.

, Gather your supporting documentation—letters, emails, photos, safety inspection reports.Put them in order. If you hired a lawyer, talk about what will happen in court. Sometimes, you might have a full-blown trial. This is generally true of discrimination lawsuits.


In other situations, you might only have a hearing.
If you need to testify, you should prepare with your attorney. They can ask you sample questions to get you comfortable with the process.

, Show up at court with enough time to find parking and go through any security. Try not to be nervous. Remember the following tips so that you can have a successful hearing:



Dress professionally. People are judging you based on how you appear. Wear clean, neat clothes. Remember that conservative, dark colors are best.
Testify confidently. Sit up straight and testify in a loud, clear voice. Answer questions affirmatively, without saying, “I think…” or “I’m guessing…” In fact, you should never guess. If you don’t know the answer to something, say “I don’t know.”
Act respectful to everyone. Call the judge, “Your Honor.” Never interrupt your landlord when they are speaking.Discuss with a lawyer your next steps if you win or lose. You might be able to bring an appeal if you lose. Should you win, you’ll need to talk about collecting on your court judgment.

Before you do this, you will want to gather all the information you will use to make the complaint. This information should include:Your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address.
The same information (or as much as you can obtain) for your landlord/building manager.
A detailed description of your complaint, including the exact nature of the problem, any pictures you have taken to showcase the problem, the steps you have taken to correct it, and all relevant dates (e.g., the date you noticed the problem, the dates you contacted your landlord, etc.).A copy of your lease, any applicable bills (such as repair invoices), and copies of all communication between you and your landlord.;
, Your next step should be to file an official complaint with your local government. Depending on where you live, this could either be with the government of the town in which you live, or in the county of which that town is a part.


Start by conducting an internet search for ""city/county of <<your city/county>> landlord complaint,"" or a similar search phrase. Near the top of the list, look for government websites (i.e., those that end in .gov) to find the appropriate page for your city/county.
Certain cities/counties allow for complaints to be submitted online.Others provide a telephone number that you can use to submit your complaint., When submitting your complaint to your local government, you will most likely be using a form. On that form, you will provide the information you gathered regarding names, dates, and addresses. There will also be a space to provide a detailed description of your complaint.When filling out the portion of the form where you detail your complaint, try to keep the following in mind:


Use a positive, non-accusatory tone whenever possible. Your local government will be acting as an impartial fact-finder during its investigation. You don't want to start off on the wrong foot by demanding a resolution or insulting your landlord. Stick to the facts and try not to editorialize.
Explain the issues you are having as clearly and succinctly as possible. Many forms have a word limit, or limited space in which to write. When detailing your problem, be sure to include all relevant information that illustrates the problem you are having, but don't go into unrelated issues.
When in doubt, keep your complaint short, simple, and to the point. Be sure to explain how your landlord could fix the problem., After you file your complaint with your city/county, you will be assigned a number that the city/county will use to identify and track your case. This number may be referred to in several ways—e.g., a case number, complaint number, tracking number, etc.—but serves the same function, which is to provide you a way to follow-up on your case as it is investigated.Make sure to write down this number and keep it in your records so you can reference it later.

, The exact process by which your city/county conducts its investigation and attempts to resolve your issue will vary based on the city/county. Generally, however, you should expect some or all of the following actions:The city/county may attempt to contact your landlord/building manager and work out a solution with him or her.
The city/county may send a housing inspector to your property to gather information and verify the problem detailed in your complaint.
The city/county may contact you after some time has lapsed since your initial complaint to see if your issue has been resolved. If it has not—or has only been partially corrected—be sure to let the person who contacted you know.
The city/county may refer your case to other government agencies who can assist you.

, Be sure that, during this process, you keep any and all records and correspondence between you and your landlord, between you and your local government, and any other documents or forms you receive pertaining to your dispute. If the city/county does not resolve your issue in a satisfactory manner, you may have to take additional steps to correct the problem.


Making sure all of this documentation is safely in your records will make your case stronger in the future.

, If you have already tried resolving your issue with your landlord directly, have submitted a complaint to your local government, and your issue is still unresolved, your next step should be to submit your complaint to a state governmental agency. Depending on your state, this will either be the Attorney General's Officeor your state's department of consumer affairs/consumer protection.Conduct an internet search for ""<<your state>> landlord complaint"" to find the relevant state agency that can help you with your problem. Near the top of the list, look for government websites (i.e., those that end in .gov) to find the appropriate page for your state's agency tasked with resolving landlord–tenant problems.
Not all state agencies can act directly to solve your issue, but they will, at least, provide helpful resources you can use to resolve your problem., When submitting your complaint to your state government, you will most likely be using a form. On that form, you will provide the information you gathered regarding names, dates, and addresses. There will also be a space to provide a detailed description of your complaint.When filling out the portion of the form where you detail your complaint, try to keep the following in mind:


Use a positive, non-accusatory tone whenever possible. Your state government will be acting as an impartial fact-finder during its investigation. You don't want to start off on the wrong foot by demanding a resolution or insulting your landlord. Stick to the facts and try not to editorialize.
Explain the issues you are having as clearly and succinctly as possible. Many forms have a word limit, or limited space in which to write. When detailing your problem, be sure to include all relevant information that illustrates the problem you are having, but don't go into unrelated issues.
When in doubt, keep your complaint short, simple, and to the point. Be sure to explain how your landlord could fix the problem., Certain state agencies allow for online submission of complaints, some provide a telephone number you can use to make your complaint, and still others require you to complete and mail in a form. Like with your local government, you will need to provide certain information to the agency, such as:Your name and contact information.
The name and contact information of the individual your complaint is against.
Identifying information for the housing involved.
A description (including relevant dates) of the problem.
The steps you have taken to resolve the dispute.
What would need to happen in order for you to feel that your complaint is resolved.

, The exact process by which the state agency conducts its investigation and attempts to resolve your issue will vary based on the state. Generally, however, you should expect some or all of the following actions:The agency may send you a letter confirming your complaint submission.
The agency may conduct an investigation.
The agency may refer you and your landlord to mediation, so your dispute can be settled informally.
The agency may attempt to contact your landlord/building manager and work out a solution with him or her.
The agency may contact you after some time has lapsed since your initial complaint to see if your issue has been resolved. If it has not—or has only been partially corrected—be sure to let the person who contacted you know.

, Be sure that, during this process, you keep any and all records and correspondence between you and your landlord, between you and any state agency, and any other documents or forms you receive pertaining to your dispute. You may need this information later if your complaint stays unresolved.

, If your landlord or building manager refuses to make a vital repair or correct some ongoing issue with your rental property, you can consider withholding some or all of your rent in order to encourage the landlord to resolve your issue.Be wary, however, that each state's landlord–tenant laws are different, and that you generally must meet certain requirements (such as informing your landlord, making sure you did not cause any of the damage, that the defect makes your property not safe, etc.) based on that law in order to legally withhold rent.


To determine if this is a possibility for you, try conducting an internet search for ""<<your state>> landlord tenant law."" There are also legal databases online that provide an overview of each state's landlord–tenant law.If you are unsure as to whether or not you can legally withhold rent in your particular situation, contact an experienced attorney and ask for his or her advice. This is the best way to ensure you are complying with your legal obligations.

, Another option you may have is to make the repairs yourself (or have them done by hiring a professional), and then deduct the cost of those repairs from your rent.As with the previous option, you should be sure that your state's laws provide for this.


Again, your best option is to contact a local attorney and ask him or her for advice on this matter.

, If the problem continues to go unresolved, you can consider terminating your lease and moving out.If your lease will expire shortly, wait until it does and move out. If not, you should consider the benefits of terminating your lease early against the benefits of relocating to a place that does not have the problem you are currently experiencing.


Be sure to read the terms of your lease carefully before you make a decision like this. Often, lease agreements will contain terms that describe what will happen in the event the lease is terminated early (e.g., the renter having to pay a penalty or surrender a security deposit).
If the language in the contract is complicated or you are having difficulty understanding it, try contacting an attorney who might be able to help. An experienced attorney will be able to give you the best advice regarding your options, especially if you tell him or her the exact nature of the problem forcing you to consider breaking your lease.

, Another option you might have—depending on the nature of your issue with your landlord—is to take him or her to court.Again, your state's laws will determine what legal rights and remedies to which you have access. Before attempting this action, it is best to talk with an experienced lawyer who will understand the particular facts of your situation and can recommend the best course of action for you.

Offer to enter into a long lease.,
Make sure you and your landlord understand how the renovations will be paid for.,

Get the final agreement in writing.",How to Get Your Landlord to Pay for Apartment Renovations2," You can establish good relations with your landlord by paying your rent on time, following any housing rules, and keeping your apartment in good condition. These good relations can help you convince your landlord to agree to renovations.Remind your landlord that you’ve been a good tenant when asking about renovations.

, Make sure you understand what kinds of renovations are allowed by your lease agreement. In most cases, landlords are not required by the terms of a lease to make cosmetic (non-necessary) renovations. If you want these done, you will have to negotiate. Cosmetic renovations include things like:


Painting walls simply to change the color (and not because of damage or age)
Replacing functioning lighting fixtures with new ones
Removing or adding walls to change the apartment layout
Replacing non-damaged countertops for stylistic reasons

, If you know before moving in or signing a new lease that you would like renovations done, try to have your landlord agree to these before you sign the lease. Have the renovation requests be written into the lease or as an addendum to it.


Make sure that the lease includes all the information, including when the renovations will be completed, and how they will be paid for (“XYZ renovations will be completed at the landlord’s expense by …”)., Many landlords might be convinced to do reasonable renovations. Perhaps you can’t expect them to approve a complete kitchen makeover, but you might get them to agree to new cabinets or a fresh coat of paint.Try to convince your landlord that the upgrades would make the apartment attractive not only to you, but to future renters.For instance, a landlord might not want to replace carpeted floors with hardwood, because a future tenant might not like them. You might be more successful asking for a new or better stove, however, because this is a standard feature that could benefit from an upgrade.
Remember that landlords may simply not agree to certain renovations., You can offer to find a suitable contractor to do the renovations, and to get an estimate of the renovation costs from the contractor. Your landlord might appreciate not having to take the time to do this research, and therefore be more willing to agree to the renovations., In some cases, landlords may be able to get a tax benefit from renovating their properties. Likewise, renovations might help the value of their properties rise. Remind your landlord of these incentives, as they might help convince your landlord to agree to the renovations., If you are capable of doing some renovations yourself, offer to do so. Your landlord might be convinced if you offer to pay for the materials and provide the labor.Even if you plan to pay for the renovations yourself, however, you should always ask your landlord before making any major renovations, including painting walls, replacing appliances, etc. If you do not have permission from your landlord to make these changes you might be violating your lease.

, Asking your landlord to pay for renovations might take some negotiating. You can give them something in return if you offer to sign a longer lease.By committing to staying in the apartment longer, you let your landlord know that the renovations will be worth it.

, Whether you are doing the renovations yourself, or hiring a contractor, you and your landlord need to agree on how the work will be paid for.If you are doing the renovations yourself, know whether or not the landlord will pay you for the cost of materials. If they will pay for them, specify when and how.
If a contractor is hired to do the renovations, know if the landlord will pay the contractor directly, or if will you pay and then be reimbursed by your landlord. It will be easiest on you if your landlord can pay the contractor directly.

, In some cases, a landlord will agree to cosmetic renovations, but only if the apartment’s rent goes up.This ensures that the apartment continues to be profitable. If you are happy with your apartment, and really want to have specific renovations done, then you may need to accept a reasonable increase in rent.


In many cases, you can negotiate rent increases with your landlord.

, Make sure that there is a written version of the final agreement concerning the renovations.This written agreement should include information such as:


Exactly what renovations will be completed
When the renovations will begin, and when they are expected to end
Who will pay for the renovations, and how

"
"
Ask your landlord.,
Look for flyers.,
Attend a meeting.,
Talk to the officers.,
Decide how you want to get involved.",How to Join a Tenant Association1," Although it sounds counter-intuitive, your landlord or an employee at the management office should be able to tell you if there is a tenant association in the complex or building.Landlords aren't necessarily happy for their tenants to form an association, but they aren't legally allowed to interfere with the association's operations.
Some management companies even have representatives attend the association meetings to address problems that might come up.;
, The tenant association may post advertisements for the next gathering on a community bulletin board or in common areas.In some cities and states tenant associations have the explicit right to post notices about meetings and issues of interest to the tenants, as well as distribute flyers directly door-to-door.

, Tenant association meetings typically are open – all you have to do is show up.


Even if you ultimately decide not to take an active part in your tenant association, it can be a good way to meet your neighbors and discuss common issues.Pay attention to how the meeting is organized and how the residents interact with one another.
Listen to the issues raised in the meeting and consider whether these are problems you've encountered yourself, or whether you have any additional problems you'd like addressed.

, At the end of the meeting, approach the people in charge of the association and ask them what the process is to join.


If the association is relatively unorganized, there may be nothing more formal necessary to join than simply showing up at meetings.
However, some associations may have a more formal structure that requires you to fill out a written form and provide contact information, or even pay dues to join the association.

, If you have particular skills or interests that would be of use to the association, you might want to volunteer to help.


For example, if you have legal experience, you may want to volunteer to make a short presentation on landlord-tenant law and tenants' rights in your state.
If you speak Spanish and your complex has a large Spanish-speaking population, you might volunteer to translate association flyers and literature into Spanish, or provide a written summary of meetings in Spanish, so those who have trouble understanding English can participate as well.
Don't underestimate the value of any connections you have in the community as well. You could be a tremendous asset to the association if you have close friends or associates who are lawyers, or who work in city or county government.

"
"
Talk to your neighbors.,
Hold an initial meeting.,
Set ground rules.,
Choose your association's structure.,
Elect officers.",How to Join a Tenant Association2," If you're interested in forming a tenant association, find out if you can get at least a small group of fellow residents on board for an initial meeting.Typically if you're thinking about forming a tenant association, it's because you are having problems with the landlord or management and believe you are not alone.
If you and the other residents banded together, you might find power in numbers. You could be more effective at getting the problems solved and making your community a better place to live.
Don't be afraid to go door-to-door and get your fellow residents talking about any problems they've had with the landlord. Gauge their interest in joining or helping form a tenant association with you.

, You are allowed to hold a tenant's association meeting anywhere in your complex or building that is designated as a common area.Contact the most enthusiastic or interested neighbors you encountered and find out when the best times would be for them to have a meeting. Try to schedule your initial meeting when the most people can show up.
Paying attention to the traffic in and out of your building or complex can also give you a good idea of when most people are at home and potentially would be available to come to a meeting.

, If you want to accomplish anything as a group, you must establish at least enough rules to ensure the meeting is organized and follows a basic schedule.Start your first meeting by introducing yourself and any other residents who are forming the association with you. Then list the general issues you will be discussing during the meeting.
Consider bringing along an egg timer or similar device to measure and limit the amount of time each person has to speak. This allows you to ensure the meeting ends at a reasonable hour but gives people who want to contribute a chance to speak their minds.

, You may prefer to designate particular individuals to be in charge of the association and keep order at meetings.What kind of structure you choose is up to you and your fellow residents. You may not want any formal structure at all, apart from a few officers.
In a large building or a complex with many buildings, you may want to have captains in charge of each individual building or floor, so groups of residents have one person to speak for their particular interests.
You might choose a looser structure with only a president and vice-president, or elect a group of 5-10 people as a steering committee to rotate responsibilities at each meeting.
Some tenant associations are organized as direct democracies, with all members voting on every action undertaken by the association. This might be a good fit for smaller associations but could seriously bog down larger groups.

, If you've decided to use a formal organizational model, you'll need to take a vote among resident members of the association to choose who will be in charge and for how long.At least, at first, those of you who had the idea to form the association will more than likely be chosen as officers. But if there is a resident who has experience running a business or association, or someone with legal experience, you may want to talk them into taking a leading role.
There typically is no need for a tenant association to collect money or have a bank account, but if you want to require the payment of dues to pay for community events or other expenses, such as refreshments at meetings, you can open a joint bank account in the names of several officers.
Keep in mind that if you decide to go on a rent strike or otherwise withhold rent as a group, an association account may come in handy. Association members can use it to deposit the money they would normally pay for rent."
"
Maximize the tenant association's benefits.,
Give people time to vent.,
Prioritize problems.,
Form committees.,
Follow through on demands.",How to Join a Tenant Association3," A tenant association is designed to give tenants more leverage when negotiating with landlords, ensuring you get the best possible home in exchange for your rent.As tenants, you have the right to a safe and habitable home. Other rights may vary depending on the state where you live, but at a minimum your landlord must make any major repairs that deal with water and plumbing systems or the structural integrity of the building.
Generally, the tenant association has more power than an individual tenant because of the amount of the combined rents. A landlord can more easily ignore a single tenant complaining about something such as a leaky faucet than a group that represents a majority of tenants.
Consider the situation from the landlord's perspective: He may shrug his shoulders about a single tenant's complaint, figuring he can deal with losing just one unit's rent. However, a group of tenants threatening to withhold rent that represents half or more of his monthly income is a different matter altogether.
Tenant associations also enable you to create a tighter sense of community with your neighbors. Social events sponsored by the tenant association can help build relationships.
You might also consider creating an online forum or social media page so tenants can offer services, such as babysitting or dog-walking, and help each other.

, Depending on the condition of your building or complex and how negligent your landlord has been, you may have some angry residents in attendance.Be sure to allow everyone a chance to talk. Allowing people to let off steam may be essential to maintaining a general sense of order.
Allow anyone to speak who wants to do so, but don't pressure anyone to come forward.
You may want someone to take notes so you can get a feel for the general concerns that are presented. Making a list of categories such as ""maintenance concerns"" and ""rent increases"" and making a tally mark under the category each time it's mentioned can help you prioritize later on.

, After getting a feel for the residents' concerns, you should all come together to decide which problems should be addressed first.Put problems that affect the most residents at the top of your list, followed by problems that fewer people have to deal with but that have a severe impact on their quality of life.
You also should consider dealing with a few smaller problems that seem easier to handle – and easier to get landlord agreement on – first. If the tenant association is able to chalk up some early victories, no matter how small, it will strengthen the association's unity and encourage other residents to join.

, Depending on the size of your association, you may want to designate specific groups of people to consistently keep on top of issues in a particular area.Try to choose residents to lead committees who have experience in the issues likely to come up in that category. They typically will have the familiarity necessary to prioritize individual complaints.
For example, if you have a committee in charge of maintenance requests, you may want people leading that committee who have experience in maintenance or construction.
Especially in the early stages of forming your association, don't neglect recruiting and welcoming new members. You also may want to form a social committee to arrange community events such as cook-outs or pot-luck dinners to build connections between residents.

, Coming together as a group may give you a more powerful voice as tenants, but if your landlord still won't cooperate you have to be willing to take action.In many states, you have the right to withhold rent if there are significant health or safety issues that affect all or most tenants.
You also may want to call your state or local building inspectors to come out and look at the property.
If your landlord is ignoring the tenant association's demands and you are considering taking action, make sure you check your state law and follow the correct procedures. Typically you can find this information out by talking to someone who works at your state or local housing agency, but you might also want to consult an experienced landlord-tenant law attorney.

The purpose of this is to record the condition of the property when you moved in so you have a clear reference point when you are leaving. Do a walk-through making note of any damage or items needing to be cleaned or replaced. Take photographs of each room as well as any damaged areas discovered.If possible, do the walk-through with your landlord and have her sign off on your notes. If she is not available bring along a friend so there is another witness to the condition of the property.Being clear and unequivocal at this stage can make the resolution of any issues with your deposit when you leave much easier.
Sometimes your landlord might give you an inventory of items, such as furniture and furnishings. Be sure to look through this and check it matches to what is actually in the house.

, Once you are living in the property it's important that you keep it well maintained, clean and generally looked after. Often a landlord keeps all, or a portion, of a tenant’s deposit simply to cover cleaning expenses after the tenant moves out. In order to avoid extraordinary cleaning expenses being deducted from your deposit, keep the property clean. It's much better to clean it regularly rather than attempting one enormous clean before you move out. Be sure to pay regular attention to:


Ovens. Cleaning your oven on a regular basis will help keep it free from greasy build-up on the walls and burnt crumbs and spills on the bottom. Ovens should be cleaned at least twice a year by following the manufacturer’s directions for using the self-cleaning cycle. If your oven does not have a self-cleaning cycle, clean it manually by following the directions on a can of oven cleaner.
Flooring. Regular cleaning helps prevent stains and keeps your floors from becoming dingy in appearance. Carpeting should be vacuumed, and other floors swept and mopped, once a week.
Windows. Wash windowsills and window frames with soap and hot water every two to three months, clean windowpanes with glass cleaner at least once a month, and take down window treatments for cleaning at least twice a year.
Paint and wall coverings. Walls should be wiped down with soap and water at least twice a year to prevent fading and yellowing. You may need to wipe down your walls more frequently if you smoke or have young children. A fresh coat of washable paint can make this task a much easier one!
Bathroom fixtures. Scrub the tub and sink, as well as the toilet bowl, once a week to help cut down on lime and soap scum build up and keep bathroom fixtures from staining.

, As well as keeping the property clean, you need to make sure that you deal with repairs speedily and efficiently in order to keep the property clean and sanitary.Don't let anything build-up or it could cause you a problem when you try to get your deposit back. While normal wear and tear is expected, the legal definition of ‘normal wear and tear’ is fuzzy. In order to limit the risks of problems as much as possible, you should make every effort to leave the property in the exact same condition as you found it.


Most residential leases require a tenant to make all minor repairs and report all major ones to the landlord in a timely manner. Check your lease to see which repairs are your responsibility and which are your landlord's. Take care of those that are yours right away, and report all others to your landlord immediately.
Clogs and minor leaks should be repaired and properly cleaned up right away. Water damage and mold growth due to lack of basic plumbing maintenance can wind up being the responsibility of the tenant. It varies by state, so look up your local laws. Generally, if the cause of the mold is structural it is the landlords responsibility, but be sure to inform them of the mold.Cleaning air filters and ductwork. Furnaces and air conditioning units should be maintained according the manufacturer’s instructions. If you are unsure how to maintain your unit, check the manufacturer’s website or ask your landlord for information and recommendations.

, When you decide to move out of a property it is important that you give your landlord the required notice as set out in your rental agreement. This will often be 30 days of notice, but will vary. Be sure you know this and are clear with your landlord. If you don't give them enough notice you may have to pay rent for the time after you move out, which may be taken out of your deposit.Always make a copy of your notice letter and send it by registered mail. After you have sent it, speak to your landlord personally to ensure that there is no problem.
It's important to keep copies of these documents as you will need them as evidence if there is a dispute., The property should be left thoroughly cleaned. Before you move out wash the windows, windowsills, baseboards, walls, switch plates, and ceilings. Ceiling fans and light fixtures should be cleaned and light bulbs replaced. Floors should be swept, mopped, and vacuumed, and a carpet cleaner used on any carpeting. You should also be sure to clean all appliances inside and out.


Keep in mind the condition of the property when you moved in. You should be leaving it as you found it. Leaving a beautifully cleaned property will make the best impression on your landlord when they come to inspect it.
It's a good idea to contact your landlord first to confirm her expectations for the cleaning in order to avoid under or over cleaning., When you have completed the final clean and moved out all your things, you need to go through the house and repeat the thorough audit that you carried out when you moved in. Using that initial record as your guide, go through systematically documenting the condition of the property and it's furnishings. You should get plenty of evidence of the condition of the property.


Take lots of photographs and be sure that your photographs are clear and large enough to show the details. You may want to consider using a digital or film camera instead of your cell phone, if your phone does not take high quality pictures.Do a walk-through of the property with a video camera rolling. Keep in mind that whoever actually shoots the video may need to be available if you sue your landlord and need to use the video in court, so you may wish to act as the camera-man yourself.
Complete a move-out checklist as a written record of the condition of the property when you left and make copies.

, Once you have completed your check you should speak to the landlord who will need to inspect the property for damage before signing off on your deposit. It's a good idea to try and be present when your landlord does this and bring a copy of your documentation with you.In some states there are laws which require the landlord to notify you when they will conduct the inspection and offer you the chance to be there, but this is not the case for every state so be sure to check your local regulations., Be polite and simply inform the landlord that you have vacated the property and would appreciate the return of your deposit once she has had a chance to complete any checks and paperwork. When mailing the letter, include copies of the move-in and move-out photographs of the property as well as your completed move-in and move-out checklists.


Make sure you keep extra copies of all your records of the condition of the property. You will need them if there is a dispute with the landlord.

, If time has passed and you have not received the deposit or any confirmation from the landlord that it is due to you, go ahead and check to see if they are in breach of regulations. Laws regarding a landlord’s return of deposit to a former tenant vary from state to state, but typically you should hear from them within a few weeks of moving out.Check your state’s code to determine how long your landlord has to return your deposit. You can locate your state’s code a couple of different ways:


Find your State’s website. Many states websites may be found by typing the state’s postal code plus “.gov” into your browser’s address bar, for example, Indiana’s website is located at in.gov and Arizona’s at az.gov. Try it! Most state’s websites will contain the official state code or a link to the code on another reputable website.
Run a Search. Run a search at your favorite search engine for “YOUR STATE state code”. For example, to find California’s state code, you would search “California state code” or to find North Dakota’s code, you would search “North Dakota state code”.
You can also use an online database to access information on your state's laws., If your landlord’s time for returning your deposit has passed, try appealing to them more informally first, but if you don't receive anything you will need to write a demand letter.This letter will give the landlord a certain number of days to return to your deposit or provide an explanation for not doing so. When writing a demand letter be sure to give a clear deadline. Demand letters generally give a party 10 days to comply. Be sure to be specific about when the 10 days begins, for example, ""within 10 days from the date of this letter"".


State what will happen if the deadline passes without the return of your deposit. Giving someone a deadline by which to do something means little without a clear explanation of what will happen if the deadline passes.
Be specific about what you will do if your deposit is not returned, for example, “if I do not receive my deposit within 10 days of the date of this letter, I will be forced to take legal action to recover it.”
Mail it by certified mail. Certified mail provides you with legal proof that the landlord received your letter. Keep the return receipt with your copy of the letter.There are website that can help you construct an appropriate demand letter., If despite all your efforts you have still not received any notification about your deposit from your landlord, you may wish to consider taking further action to get the money back. Before you go down this road be sure you have complete copies of all the pertinent records. You'll need all the documentation relating to your tenancy and your deposit.


Be sure you have the receipt and bank records to show that you paid the deposit when you moved in.
Gather together your bank statements to prove that you always paid the rent and are not in arrears to your landlord.
Compile all your records of the condition of the property before you moved in and when you moved out. This should include all the photographs and inventory checklists you have. Be as thorough as possible., Once you have all the evidence, contact your landlord one more time before you go ahead a file a small claim. Write a ""letter before action"" to your landlord to inform them that you intend to take them to court if they do not deal with your deposit. Going to court should be a last resort, but making it clear to your landlord that you are prepared to go that far can help speed up the return of your deposit.


The letter should very clearly state the amount of your deposit and when and how you paid it. Include copies of receipts to evidence this.
If you are disputing deductions your landlord wants to make to your deposit, you should clearly set out why you object to these.
Set a clear deadline for a response. There is no fixed amount of time you should give them, but 14 days is reasonable., If your landlord does not return your deposit or an itemized list of costed deductions, then you can take them to the small claims court. You will be able to ask for your deposit plus court filing fees and interest. If you are successful you could recover monetary damages equalling to two or three times the security deposit as well as the costs of bringing the claim in court costs and attorney bills (if applicable).For information on filing a small claim in your area, visit your County Court’s website. You can locate your County Court’s website by using the State Court Website Directory

Filing a claim should always be a last resort, so be sure to exhaust all the other avenues first. But if you have a legitimate grievance you are entitled to receive your deposit.
A small claim can costs as little as $50 to file, and will typically be dealt with quickly by a Judge.
You probably won't need a lawyer and having clear documentation and records of the condition of the property is the key to winning. Lots of clear photos, copies of your deposit payment and letters to the landlord are essential."

However, if you choose to buy a building, then look close to home.You might not know enough about a neighborhood to properly assess whether it is a good idea to invest in the area.


By living near your property, you may also be able to personally manage it. If not, you’ll need to hire someone else.If you want to buy in an unfamiliar neighborhood, perform thorough research. Speak to real estate agents in the area and other landlords.
Ask about crime, the quality of schools, and the quality of government services.;
, Experts suggest you start with a single-residence home or small multiple-dwelling unit.Starting small will help you get your feet wet. If you find out that being a landlord isn’t right for you, then you haven’t invested too much.

, To qualify for a rental loan, you need a 20% down payment as a minimum. If you’ve never purchased a rental property before, you also will need sufficient current income to cover the loan payment for the rental unit.Talk to a lender about the terms for a loan. Generally, there are two types. With a non-recourse loan, the building itself secures the loan. However, non-recourse loans are usually only available when the building is worth at least $2.5 million.With a recourse loan, you are personally liable. This means your lender can come for your personal assets if you default.
Loans can be of varying lengths—5, 10, 30 years.Furthermore, the loan might have a fixed or variable interest rate.

, You can use a real estate agent to find properties to purchase. Make sure to visit in person. As you walk through the building, note its current condition. If the building is in bad shape, you’ll have to pay for repairs.


Ask the owner their reason for selling. If they are losing money, then you will probably want to avoid buying in the neighborhood.
Also ask for the “rent-roll” if you are considering buying a current apartment building. A rent-roll includes a complete list of units with the names of the tenants and the terms of each lease (including monthly rent)., You’ll need insurance specific to landlords. It will generally cost more than a homeowner’s policy because of the added risk of your tenants. If you need help finding an appropriate policy, contact an insurance agent or broker in your area. At a minimum, your policy should cover the following:personal injuries occurring on your property
losses from fire, storms, vandalism, and theft

, In some countries, you might need a license to run an apartment building. In the U.K., for example, you might need a license if your building is three stories and has five or more people living in it.You should talk with a lawyer to understand any licensing requirements.

, Landlords must abide by a variety of rules—local, state, and federal. Unless you have a lot of time to read up on housing law, you should hire an experienced lawyer.This person can answer your questions and draft documents for you to use. Obtain a referral by contacting your local or state bar association.Set up a consultation and talk about your obligations as a landlord. For example, you will need to follow local laws on having a “habitable” apartment, which usually means providing sufficient heat, hot water, sanitation, and other essentials.
Also talk about how the law limits your ability to evict people. Discuss what steps you must take if you want to get someone out of your building.

, Unless you’re good with numbers, you’ll probably need an accountant to help you understand your finances and pay your taxes.You must keep accurate records of your income and expenses, including proof of all expenses.Ask other landlords if they would recommend their accountant and call to schedule a meeting.
You can also obtain a referral by contacting your state’s accounting society., A property manager will help deal with tenant complaints, schedule repairs, and collect rent payments for you. In exchange, you pay a percentage of the rent to them. Generally, property management companies charge 7-10% of the rental income.Ask other landlords if they would recommend their property management company. Alternately, you can search online for companies and read online reviews.
You might not need a company if you have only one property or if you don’t work another job. However, landlords with multiple properties and/or jobs often find it helpful to hire someone.

, If something went wrong in an apartment, could you fix it? A good test is whether you can fix leaky faucets or electrical problems in your own home. If not, you’ll probably need help.


Look in the phone book and try to find people who will be willing to work on your building.

, Rent depends on location. You want to charge a fair rent, based on the unit and where it is located. It’s cheaper to rent in rural New York state than it is in Manhattan, so research what other landlords in your area charge for comparable properties. Check online or ask people.Your rent also needs to cover the costs of the property. You’ll have to pay back any loan you obtained to buy the building. You should also set aside 10% to cover regular maintenance and any downtime when the unit is empty.If you hire a property management company, you’ll need to pay them as well.

, You can get the word out using several different methods. Choose which of the following works best for you and remember to advertise early:Tell people you know that you are renting. They might know people looking for a place.
Put up flyers at your library, grocery store, university, or community center. Remember to include your location and helpful details about the unit, such as the size, amenities (e.g., washer/dryer, yard, parking), and limitations (no pets).
Place ads in newspaper classifieds.
Post online using Craigslist or another website.
Create your own website. This method is a lot of work. However, if you have multiple properties, you can upload pictures of each available unit on the website.
Hire a real estate professional to show the property.

, You should have applicants complete a standard application. Your lawyer can help draft one, or you can find a sample online. At a minimum, the application should ask for the following:applicant’s name and contact information
Social Security Number (if you want to check credit history)
amount of time the applicant has been at their current address
current employment and income
contact information for current and past landlords
personal references
written authorization to check references and verify income

, Don’t deny someone solely for their credits core. For example, new graduates might not have built up any credit.However, you can screen out people who are constantly delinquent on their bills.


Get written authorization to perform the credit check. To protect yourself, put this authorization on a separate sheet of paper so that it stands out.
Should you deny someone rent because of information in their credit history, you must notify them of that fact. To protect yourself, put the notification in writing. Federal law in the U.S. gives the applicant a chance to contact the credit reporting agency and address any errors in their report.

, You requested references for a reason, so be sure to call and talk to them. Make sure to ask questions like the following:Did the person pay their rent on time? How often were they late?
Did the person observe other rental policies in the lease?
How considerate was the person of their neighbors? Did they make a lot of noise?
In what condition did they leave the apartment? Was there more damage than normal wear and tear?
Did they provide proper notice before leaving?

, It’s against the law to discriminate against potential tenants on the basis of certain characteristics. You should know this information before you meet with your first potential tenant. For example, federal law prevents discrimination based on the following:race
color
national origin
gender
religion
disability or handicap
familial status, such as the number of children

, Your lawyer can help you develop a standard lease. If you don’t want to hire a lawyer, then you can find sample leases online. However, read through any sample lease carefully and add anything you think is missing.For example, you might not want animals in your apartment buildings. If not, you can include a provision stating that the tenant agrees not to keep pets. Alternately, you could allow only some pets (such as cats) while excluding others.
Set up your lease like a template with blank lines for information that will change from tenant to tenant. This will allow you to use the same lease more than once.
However, you should always be careful to update your lease if circumstances change.

, Being a landlord is a job, even if it is only part-time. Accordingly, you should treat it like a regular job. Begin by setting your hours. For example, you might be available to talk with tenants from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. If someone calls after those hours, you can let the call go to voicemail.Buy a filing cabinet and files so that you can keep a file on each tenant. You’ll want to keep a copy of each signed lease, proof of monthly rent payment, etc.
Also create a filing system so that you can find important documents quickly.
Sign up for a Google Voice number, which is forwarded to your mobile phone. Use this number as your landlord number.

For this reason, you need to prepare a formal business letter that you can mail to your landlord.You can find a blank template for a business letter on whatever word processing application you use.
There also are sample form letters available on the internet that can help you formulate and focus the substance of your letter. Look on legal forms websites as well as websites for tenants' rights organizations in your state.
If you're using a form letter created by an organization in another state, be careful about copying statements verbatim that refer to the law or something being illegal. Since landlord-tenant law fluctuates, this may not be true in your state.;
, Your letter must include factual specifics. While it's not necessary to quote or cite your state's landlord-tenant law, it won't hurt to include this information if you know it and it supports your argument.Many tenants' rights organizations have breakdowns of state law in plain language. However, make sure you're looking at information from an organization located in your state – don't rely on information from an organization located elsewhere.
Begin your letter by recounting specific facts, including the date you moved out of your apartment and how long you lived there. You also want to include any letters or statements you received from your landlord, and the dates on those letters.
Describe the general condition in which you left your apartment and any steps you took to clean or repair the unit before you left. For example, if you paid to have the apartment professionally cleaned, state this along with the date of the cleaning and the name of the service you used.

, Once you've broken down the charges in your letter exactly as the landlord did, explain what you will and will not pay. Keep in mind that you're probably not going to get very far by refusing to pay anything at all and demanding your entire deposit back.State clearly that you have no intention of paying the amount your landlord has charged you. For example, you might write ""I will not pay the $1,500 you charged me in damages because these charges are unfair for the reasons described above. I am, however, willing to pay $200 for the damages to the bedroom carpet caused by my dog.""
If your landlord has charged you excessive amounts for damages to your apartment after you moved out, take an honest and objective look at the state of your apartment and determine the amount that would be reasonable to pay.
In all states, landlords are not allowed to charge you for damages that constitute ""normal wear and tear"" to the premises. The longer you lived there, the more wear and tear there will be.
For example, if you lived in an apartment for five years, it is unfair for the landlord to charge you to repaint the apartment. Five years is beyond the useful life for paint.
You also should keep in mind that small damages, such as thumbtack holes in the wall where you hung up pictures on the walls, typically are considered normal wear and tear and not something for which your landlord should charge you to repair.

, Provide your landlord with a reasonable period of time to evaluate the facts and claims in your letter and adjust the charges before you escalate the situation. Let your landlord know what will happen if your demands aren't met by that date.Five to ten business days from the date the landlord receives your letter typically is considered a reasonable period of time.
However, you may want to shorten this period if your landlord intends to charge you late fees, or has stated that the amount you owe is due immediately.
State specifically what you'll do if the landlord doesn't meet your demands by the deadline, but avoid making threats you don't have any intention of keeping.
If you haven't yet decided what you want to do if the landlord refuses, you can simply say ""If I don't hear from you by the close of business within three days of receipt of this letter, I'll be forced to examine further options.""

, If you have any documents or photos that back up your claims, you should attach those to your letter before sending it to your landlord. Make sure you're sending copies of the originals, keeping the originals themselves for your own records.For example, if you took pictures of your apartment before you moved out, you may want to print and attach copies of these pictures.
Photos are even more valuable evidence if you also took pictures when you moved in that you can set up as a side-by-side comparison with the move-out pictures. Include date stamps on the images you include.
If you referenced any state landlord-tenant law in your letter, include a copy of the law itself or a print-out of the web page you used that had a summary of that law. Don't assume your landlord will know what the law says.
Receipts or invoices may be appropriate supporting evidence if, for example, you paid an independent company to professionally clean your apartment and your landlord is attempting to charge you for professional cleaning.
Receipts or cancelled checks also can be helpful if your landlord is charging you for rent you already paid, or other bills for which you've already made payment.

, Even if it would be a fairly simple matter to simply hand the letter to your landlord, remember that you are creating a chain of evidence for later use if your landlord refuses to reduce or eliminate the unfair charges.The best way to do this is to mail your letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested. Ask for it at your local post office.
Before you mail your letter, make sure you have at least one copy of it for your records, along with any documents you attached.
Your landlord must sign for the letter when it is received. A green card is then returned to you showing your landlord's signature and the date the letter was received.
Count out your deadline from the date of receipt and mark it on your calendar. Save the green card if you later need to prove that you sent a demand letter to your landlord and they didn't reply or refused to work with you.

, Most areas, particularly cities, have community mediation centers that provide relatively low-cost mediation services for common disputes such as landlord-tenant issues.To find a community mediation center, check the website of your state or local bar association and look for a mediation services link. The clerk's office of your county court may have similar information.
Some tenants' rights organizations also have information for mediating landlord-tenant disputes, or provide mediation services themselves.
Many of these centers are sponsored by the bar association or state government to provide low-cost means for people to settle their disputes without going to court.
Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process that focuses on meaningful negotiation towards a mutually acceptable settlement of a dispute in a non-adversarial setting.

, Since mediation is a voluntary means of resolving your dispute, your landlord must agree to submit the dispute to mediation. The mediation center may have a form that you can complete and send to your landlord to let them know you want to attempt to resolve the dispute using mediation.Some mediation centers may contact your landlord for you to set up the appointment. Typically you give a range of dates and times that would work for you, and then the center contacts your landlord with those options.
Once your landlord responds and agrees to use mediation, an appointment will be set for your session.
The center may have additional forms for you to read and sign that explain a little bit more about the mediation process and the ground rules for the session.

, Before your mediation session, outline your arguments and think about what you're willing to accept as a compromise to end the dispute. While mediation is far less formal than a courtroom trial, you typically are allowed to bring any evidence or witnesses you have to support your claims.If you have witnesses, you typically can bring them along with you to your mediation session. You also might want to bring a friend or family member along for moral support.
If someone else signed your lease, such as a spouse, partner, or roommate, you probably should alert them to the mediation session and have them plan to be there.
You are allowed to have an attorney at mediation, but an attorney isn't necessary. Even if your landlord will be appearing with an attorney, the mediator will make sure everyone is fairly represented and has an equal opportunity to negotiate and have their voice heard.
In advance, think about what you want out of mediation and set your own negotiating range. You can think of this in terms of two values: the ideal minimum amount you want to pay (which may well be zero) and the most you're willing to pay.

, The mediation session typically will be held at the center itself, and begin with everyone meeting in the same room. The mediator will introduce him- or herself and explain the basic procedures and rules governing the session.The mediator typically then gives each side the opportunity to state their case and explain what they want out of mediation. This is basically a summary of your arguments and why you believe your landlord's charges are unfair.
After your opening statements, the mediator typically will move you and your landlord to separate rooms, where he or she will have a private conversation regarding the dispute and your arguments against the charges.
Everything you say to the mediator will be held in confidence, and generally will not be repeated – even to your landlord – unless the mediator first asks your permission. In this environment, you can fill free to be open and honest with the mediator.

, The mediator typically facilitates negotiations while you and your landlord remain in separate rooms. This makes the process less confrontational and intimidating than if you attempted to negotiate face to face.The mediator will try to get to the root of the dispute. For example, it may have been that your landlord charged you excessive damages because a neighbor had made several complaints about you.
At any point during negotiations, you can bring up any witnesses or evidence you have that supports your arguments.
For example, if your landlord refuses to budge on carpet replacement charges because she asserts you damaged the carpet, you might show photos you took when you moved in and when you moved out that show the carpet to be in similar condition.
If the mediator feels that you've found some common ground and are close to reaching a mutually agreeable settlement, you and your landlord may return to the single room where the session first started.
On the other hand, if you aren't able to reach a compromise, the mediator will declare an impasse.
Typically at this point you'll get a statement from the mediator that explains what, if anything, you and your landlord were able to agree on, and where negotiations got stuck.

, Mediation proceedings are voluntary, which means there's no requirement that you come to any agreement at all. However, if you do settle the dispute, the terms of that settlement become legally binding once put into writing and signed by both parties.Typically the mediator will write up a settlement agreement for you. Read it carefully before you sign it to make sure it reflects the same terms to which you thought you were agreeing.
Once you and your landlord have signed the settlement agreement, it becomes a legally binding contract that you can enforce in court if the landlord doesn't live up to their side of the bargain.

, Typically the charges you dispute will be low enough to fall below your state's small-claims threshold. The court where you file your claim will most likely be the one in the county where your rental unit is located.Keep in mind that a court's jurisdiction is determined by where the dispute took place or the location of the person or business you're suing.
This means if you've since moved to a different state or county, you may need to return to your old county of residence to file a lawsuit against your former landlord.
You can only sue for monetary damages in small claims court, and there's a maximum amount – although it varies greatly among states. In some states it may be as high as $10,000, but in most it's around $5,000.
You may have to pay the amount your landlord claims you owe before you file your lawsuit. Then you can file a claim arguing the charges were unfair and demand repayment.
Some states, however, may allow you to file your claim before you've paid the amount demanded by your landlord.
Small claims courts have simple procedures and are designed so that you can represent yourself rather than having to hire an attorney. In fact, some states don't even allow attorneys to practice in small claims courts.

, Each small claims court has its own fill-in-the-blank forms that you can use to start the court process. Some courts may make these forms available online, or you can get paper forms to use by visiting the clerk's office.The form will require basic identification information about yourself and your landlord.
You also must provide a detailed factual description of the dispute and what you want the court to do.
You need to include as many facts as possible, including the date you moved into your rental unit and the date you moved out.
You also may need to attach a copy of your lease to your claim form, if your tenancy was covered by a written lease.
Some states require you to demonstrate to the small claims court that you made some effort to resolve the dispute before filing your claim. If you sent a demand letter to your landlord, a copy of that letter along with your card showing the letter was received is sufficient.
If you attempted mediation and were unable to reach a resolution, you might want to include a copy of any statement from the mediator as well.

, Once you've filled out your claim forms completely, give them to the small claims court clerk to initiate your lawsuit. In addition to your original forms, you'll need to take at least two copies – one for your landlord and one for your own records.Keep in mind that while the clerk can make copies of the claim forms for you, they'll typically charge you a small fee for that service.
You also must pay a filing fee to initiate your small claims suit – typically around $100 or less. If you are unable to afford the filing fees, ask the clerk for a fee waiver affidavit.
On the affidavit, you'll have to provide information about your income and assets. If those fall below the court's threshold, or if you receive public benefits, you may not have to pay court costs for your claim.

, After you've filed your claim, your landlord must have legal notice that they've been sued. Each court has a specific process that you must follow, known as ""service,"" that allows you to prove that your landlord had notice of your claim.Technically, you can complete service by having anyone over the age of 18 who isn't involved in your claim hand-deliver the claim forms to your landlord.
That person then must complete a proof of service form for you to file with the court clerk. These are standard forms that typically are available in the clerk's office.
There are two other ways to have documents served. You can pay a small fee to a sheriff's deputy or a private process server to hand-deliver the documents to your landlord, or you can mail them using certified mail.
If you use certified mail, save the green card you get back when the documents are received and use it to complete the proof of service form.

, The more solid evidence you have to back up your claim that your landlord's charges are unfair, the more likely the judge will be to rule in your favor. Bring originals of anything you want to submit to the court as evidence.If you have photos as part of your evidence, be prepared to authenticate them if you want them admitted into evidence. If you took the photos yourself, you can do this by your own testimony.
You also will need to bring your copy of your claim forms and any other documents, such as your lease or your demand letter, that you attached to your claim when you filed it.
Since you typically will be expected to make an opening statement to the judge about your claim, you may want to prepare a short written statement or outline that describes the dispute and how you want the judge to rule.

, On the date scheduled, the judge will hear from both you and your landlord regarding the charges you're disputing. Try to arrive at the courthouse at least 30 minutes early so you have time to go through courthouse security and find the correct courtroom.Depending on the court, you may have an initial hearing to determine whether your landlord intends to fight your claim. The judge typically won't evaluate your claim at this hearing.
However, if your court does have an initial hearing and your landlord fails to appear, you may be entitled to receive a default judgement.
You will have to prove to the judge that you are entitled to the specific amount of money you've demanded in your claim, so bring any receipts or other information that justifies that amount.

, At the main hearing, the judge will call on you to tell your story and show the court why you are entitled to the amount of money you claim. Typically you can introduce evidence such as documents or photos as well as call witnesses.If you do call witnesses, you will ask them questions to draw out their testimony regarding the dispute. The judge also may ask them questions. Your landlord will get a chance to ask them questions too, through a process known as ""cross examination.""
Keep your evidence and your statements focused on the facts regarding the dispute. For example, if your landlord has over-charged you for damages, you might present photos documenting the condition of your apartment when you moved out, or receipts that show you paid a professional cleaner to come in and clean the apartment.
When you speak in court, speak directly to the judge – not to your landlord. While you may be angry, avoid insulting or shouting at your landlord in court.
If the judge interrupts you and asks a question, stop and listen. Respond to the judge before you continue. Don't be afraid to ask the judge for clarification if he or she says something you don't understand.
Once you've introduced all of your evidence, your landlord will have the opportunity to present his or her defense under the same procedures you followed to tell your side of the story. Avoid interrupting your landlord, even if you disagree with something they say.

, The judge may make a ruling from the bench immediately after hearing from you and your landlord. However, you may have to wait a day or two before you can get the written order in your case.The judge typically will let you know what you should do following the ruling. In some states, the person who bought the claim isn't allowed to appeal the judge's decision if it isn't in their favor – only the defendant is.
If the judge rules in your favor, you will receive information – either from the judge or from the court clerk – regarding what you must do to enforce the judgement. Keep in mind that even if you win, the court won't collect any money for you.
When you get your copy of the written decision, make a couple of copies of it so you have it for your records.

This discussion will establish a relationship and provide you with a lot of worthwhile information you can use to make a judgement about the character and professionalism of the landlord. Ask yourself a number of questions after this initial discussion:


Did the landlord answer the phone on your first call? Was it difficult to get in touch with him or her? If it was difficult to get in touch with the landlord, it may bode poorly for the future.
Was the landlord open to meeting you at a convenient time for you? If the landlord is completely swamped and overcommitted, they’ll probably carry this problem into their responsibilities with tenants.
Did the landlord communicate well and were they happy to talk to you? If the landlord communicates poorly, this may be a problem for the future. If they seemed annoyed to talk to you, they may treat their tenants the same way.;
, After making initial contact, you’ll want to set up a meeting to meet the landlord and to view the property. You can gather a lot of information from this initial meeting. Consider the following questions:


Was the landlord on time? If the landlord was late, it may suggest how they will behave in the future when dealing with you as a tenant.
Was the landlord pleasant and motivated? If the landlord seemed grumpy or bothered, they may not be the best landlord in the world. If they did not seem motivated about showing the property, they probably won’t be motivated to take care of your needs as tenant.
Did the landlord communicate effectively? Now that you are meeting in person, the landlord will have the ability to communicate their position as a landlord. They should be able to give you an idea about their policies. If the landlord does not really say much, this could be a problem. Proceed with caution., The most effective way to assess a landlord is find out his or her business practices and policies. During your meeting or afterward, make sure to inquire about a number of important things related to money you will pay and how long the lease will be in effect.


Ask about important issues like lengths of lease.
Find out about deposit requirements.
Ask about rent schedules.
Be wary if the landlord cannot answer your questions, or if they flip-flop on rent or deposit amounts., Maintenance responsibilities are one of the most important things you’ll need to find out about in order to effectively evaluate a landlord. As a result, you need to ask a series of explicit questions about maintenance.


Ask about your responsibility (as tenant) in maintaining the property.
Ask about their responsibility (as landlord) in maintaining the property.
Find out what safeguards are put in place by the prospective landlord to protect you and the property in case of emergencies like plumbing leaks, wiring malfunctions or power outages. Determine whether they handle these issues themselves or contract with a maintenance company to deal with emergencies., In a lot of bigger cities, landlords (i.e., the property owner) will delegate their tasks to companies whose responsibility it is to manage a large number of properties at once. Property management companies make a living by collecting rent, lining up repairs, and negotiating rental agreements on behalf of the landlord. In fact, in a lot of instances, if you work with a property management company, you will never see the actual property owner. Talk with current tenants about the property management company and look at online reviews to get an idea of what you might prefer., If a property is managed by a large company, you will need to assess the benefits and pitfalls of such a situation. One difference between landlords and property management companies is the availability of services. When you are dealing with an individual landlord, they may not be available if you lock yourself out of your house on a Saturday morning at 3 a.m.. On the other hand, property management companies will usually have round-the-clock services and numbers you can call 24/7 in order to get these types of issues resolved. However, landlords who only have a couple properties may live close by and may be quick to respond to these issues.


Another difference is the quality of service. On one hand, property management companies may contract with professional maintenance people to handle repairs. This may lead to maintenance requests being fixed sooner and in a more professional manner than if the individual landlord was making the repairs themselves. On the other hand, individual landlords may spend more time fixing things right because they own the property and they want it to remain in the best shape possible. Property management companies, however, may have an incentive to make cheap and fast repairs to save money and time.
Also, property management companies tend to be more formal and rule-oriented than individual landlords. For example, property management companies may not be willing to negotiate about the presence of pets or the payment of carpet cleaning fees. On the other hand, individual landlords may be willing to work with you on certain issues., The overall condition of the property may be able to tell you a lot more about the business practices of the landlord than anything they might tell you. As a result, you should scrutinize the condition of the property.


Pay attention to detail. Try to notice the little things.
Get an idea of the cleanliness of the property. If the property is dirty and looks like it has not been cleaned in months, that means the landlord probably does not take care of a lot of little things.
Notice the general condition of major appliances and systems. Take a look at the HVAC system, for example. If it does not look like it has been serviced (a new air filter) or if it looks extremely dated, this may not bode well.
Look for wood rot, broken windows, or signs of roof leaks. If the property has any of these problems, that may be a sign that the landlord does not take care of basic maintenance issues.
Take note of whether grounds are mowed, shrubs cut, and dead tree limbs have been removed.

, Talking to other tenants may be one of the best ways to get worthwhile information about the quality of the landlord. Tenants will be able to tell you, from experience, how the landlord behaves in a professional relationship.


If you’re looking at a property in an apartment or townhome community, casually approach someone in the parking lot and say “Hi, do you live here? I’m considering renting here, too.” Then ask the person whether they like the property and the landlord.
Ask questions about whether maintenance is taken care of promptly.
Ask about any problems with the landlord. This should include: whether they can easily be reached by phone, how well they function in emergency situations and how personable they are.
Listen to the little things they say and how they say it. Some people might not want to explicitly criticize the landlord for fear of reprisal. Others might have a personal grudge. Use your best judgement when interpreting what other tenants say., One important thing to do is to find out how long the landlord has actually owned the property you are interested in renting. This can give you a lot of important information you can use to evaluate the landlord.


If the property has been recently purchased and the landlord has not taken care of obvious problems with the property, chances are they won’t fix them in the future.
If the property has been recently purchased, and it is an apartment or townhome community, chances are management has also changed. You’ll need to take this into account when evaluating information you’ve gotten from prior or current residents.
If the landlord has owned the property for a long period of time, you might have a lot more information to go on. In this case, talk to neighbors or people nearby to see how the property has been maintained or neglected over the years., When evaluating a perspective landlord, you should do a little digging to find out the size of the landlord’s rental business. While some landlords just own a single rental property, others may own dozens or even hundreds of properties. This is very important in evaluating the type of person (or entity) you’ll be dealing with if you choose to rent the property.


Do an internet search for the person’s name, the business’s name, or the address of the property you want to rent. Go from there to determine if the rental property is part of a much larger organization.
If the landlord has a website, go to that website and dig around a little bit. Chances are that they will list other properties they own and rent.
Ask the landlord how big their operation is and what other properties they own and/or manage., Depending on the sort of property you are renting, there might be online reviews about your landlord. Online reviews can be an extremely important tool in learning about the character of your potential landlord. Having this information will be indispensable in choosing the right landlord.


Do an internet search for reviews of the landlord and/or business. You may be able to find reviews by current or past tenants.
If you find reviews on a particular website, search around and look for more. Make sure you get a full and well-rounded view of your landlord and the perspective of their current or past tenants.
Ask the landlord if they have personal testimonies or reviews from past tenants. While they may be cherry-picking these testimonies, you might be able to gain valuable information from the reviews., By doing a search of court records, you’ll be able to find out if your landlord has been in any legal conflicts with past or current tenants. Lawsuits – whether successful or unsuccessful – can give you a lot of information to help evaluate a landlord’s professionalism and character.


Conduct a search of your county's public court records for the name of the landlord you're evaluating. This will allow you to evaluate a prospective landlord by reviewing any claims filed against him by previous tenants or contract holders.
Review complaints or actions taken so you know how closely the landlord follows laws governing property agreement and tenant rights.
In addition to court records, run a search on academic search databases like LexisNexis and local and national newspapers. You might find something that can help you better evaluate the landlord., Perhaps the most important part of truly understanding your relationship with your current or potential landlord is forming a good understanding of your agreement. The only way to do this is to read your lease in detail so you know every specific of your arrangement (or potential arrangement).


Get a copy of the lease.
Read it with aid of a pencil and highlighter. Highlight sections you might not understand.
Use a different color to highlight important sections, like the day of the month on which rent is due.
Reread your lease.
Consult a lawyer if you have questions about the lease., When evaluating a potential landlord, you’ll want to find out their notification policy. Notification is the amount of time a landlord must let you know before they enter the property when you are renting it. Often times, notification is a major point of contention between landlords and tenants. As a result, make sure it is clear before you sign a lease.


Find out how much notice the landlord gives tenants before entering the property for routine maintenance and upkeep and how they deliver this notice.
Laws in most states require landlords to provide tenants with written notice 24 hours before entering an apartment, but many private landlords hold different practices about notifying tenants., Like landlords, tenants are protected by a wide array of local, state, and federal laws. Because of this, you should be acquainted with your rights under the law before you sign and lease. This is important, because knowing the law will enable you to make a better decision when evaluating a prospective landlord.


Review the laws governing landlord-tenant relationships and contracts before you sign any paperwork with the landlord.
Use this information to judge the landlord's fairness and practices regarding lease negotiations, property upkeep and communication.
Make sure that the landlord’s lease lives up to and abides by laws that protect you. If their lease does not, you should be wary of renting the property.

Pay attention to the following:Your landlord hasn’t been performing regular maintenance. If the lawn isn’t mowed and the building is allowed to fall into disrepair, then there may be a problem.
Your landlord hasn’t made requested repairs. If your request for repairs is being ignored, then your landlord might be having financial difficulties.
Notification of foreclosure has been posted on bulletin boards in common areas. Check regularly.;
, In some states, the law requires that the bank provide you notice before the foreclosure sale. For example, in Washington, you must receive 120 days notice.If you receive this notice, take it seriously.


Your landlord might catch up on past-due payments, which could take the property out of foreclosure. However, you should double-check with the bank.
The bank might not tell you much information. In that situation, you should perform a public records search.

, Visit your county land records office. This might be called the Recorder of Deeds or Recorder’s Office.Tell the clerk you are checking to see if a property is in foreclosure. This is public information.


You may be able to look up this information on a computer at the Recorder of Deeds office. Ask for help if you don't know how.

, The foreclosure process begins with a lawsuit. Accordingly, you can find out if your landlord is in foreclosure by check court documents, which are public. Visit the courthouse in your county. You can check on the status of the case by pulling the case file.Look up cases according to the names of the parties. Figure out your landlord’s name—it might be a corporation.
Generally, there should be a computer you can use at the courthouse to find cases. Write out the case number and give the slip to the clerk, who can pull the file.

, There should be a website you can use. If not, stop into the office. You may need the building’s Property Identification Number in order to check.Alternately, you might be able to look up information using only the address and the landlord's name.

, In some states, you can request notice be sent to you of any foreclosure hearing. In this way, you’ll know exactly when your landlord goes into foreclosure. The method for requesting this information will differ by state.


For example, in North Carolina, you can take a copy of your lease to the Recorder of Deeds office and record it. By recording it, you become entitled to notice of any foreclosure hearing.In California, you can file a Request for Copy of Notice of Default. You’ll need a form, which is available here: http://www.foreclosureforum.com/forms/request_notice.pdf. You must file this notarized form with your County Recorders office for a fee.Search online or talk to a lawyer about the process in your state.

, Each state is different. In some states, the new owner can evict you from the apartment. However, in other states, you can’t be evicted if you recorded your lease before the mortgage.You should research your law online.


Also check in with a lawyer. Money might be tight, but legal aid offices can provide you with legal advice about your rights and responsibilities if the building is sold in a foreclosure sale. You can find legal aid by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at http://www.lsc.gov.
Also contact the National Low Income Housing Coalition.They have information about the foreclosure process.
If you are Section 8, then contact your nearest Housing and Urban Development (HUD) office., If you were given notice by a court, you need to answer the court. The purpose of the answer is to confirm that you are renting the property. Go to your county court clerk’s office.You’ll need to file an answer. This document should contain your name and address, and also state you are living in the property and paying rent. You’ll probably also need to attach a copy of your lease.
The court might have a form you can fill out as your answer. Check the website or ask the court clerk.

, Generally, you must continue to pay your landlord rent during the foreclosure process.Until the building is sold, your landlord is the owner, so make checks out to them. Foreclosure actions can take six months or so to complete.Decide whether you want to pay rent to the new owner once the building has been sold. You don’t have a legal contract (lease) with them. Instead, you can wait to receive your notice to vacate, which means they plan to evict you.
If you are Section 8, notify HUD that the ownership has changed.

, Your state law should tell the landlord what they must do with your deposit. Generally, they may need to refund it to you or transfer it to the new owner.Contact the current landlord and ask about the deposit money.


Keep hounding them. A landlord in foreclosure probably has a lot of problems and is very stressed. Their instinct might be to ignore your concerns. However, this is your money and you need to know what is happening with it.
You may need to sue your landlord if they don’t refund the money or transfer it to the new owner. Talk with a lawyer.

, Your state law will tell the new landlord how they can evict you. Typically, they’ll need to give you notice to vacate. This should be written notice sent to you. It should tell you how much time you have to leave, e.g., 60 days.If you don’t move out by the deadline, then your landlord will have to begin eviction proceedings. They’ll have to go into court to start the proceedings.
Your landlord shouldn’t use self-help to remove you. For example, a landlord can’t cut off your utilities, change your locks, throw your stuff on the sidewalk, or threaten you. If they do, call the police.

, If you receive a notice to vacate, you can offer to move immediately for money. This is called “cash for keys.” Basically, you give up your right to stay in the apartment for cash payment.


If you play your cards right, you could get the new owner to give you enough for a security deposit on a new apartment.Get any agreement in writing and have it signed and dated by both you and the new landlord., The new owner might want to keep you as a tenant. If so, you can continue with the lease or sign a new lease with the landlord. Depending on where you live, your new landlord might have created a month-to-month tenancy by accepting your rent check.

, Depending on where you live, you might be able to sue your old landlord for violating the terms of your lease. Talk with a lawyer about whether this is a good option. You might be able to get compensation for the following:moving expenses
loss of security deposit
cost of new security deposit
difference in rent (if your new place costs more)
any other expenses incurred in finding a new home

A landlord is also much less likely to discriminate against you when you have someone else with you.Never rent without seeing the apartment. Ideally, you should walk through with the landlord. This will give you a chance to observe the landlord in person.;
, You can tell a lot about the landlord by studying the apartment. If the apartment is dirty or in bad repair, then these may be signs the landlord is not responsible.Pay attention to how tidy the rest of the apartment building is. Has the lawn been mowed? Is junk mail piled up around the mailboxes? Is the hallway clean and in good repair?
Ask whether the apartment will be cleaned before you move in. A responsible landlord should volunteer that information by saying, “Sorry it’s in a bad state. The tenant just moved out. We’ll have it cleaned and repaired before you arrive.”

, A landlord should be willing to give you the names of a few current or former tenants. Ask for them. If the landlord hesitates, then this might be a sign that they are hiding something.


If the landlord won’t give references, then make it a point to chat with people who live in the building., If you go to the landlord’s office to review paperwork, note whether the office is tidy or disorganized. A landlord who can’t find forms or has misplaced the keys probably isn’t organized.


If a landlord cancels a showing several times, then there undoubtedly is a problem.The landlord is disorganized and should be avoided.

, Professionalism is key in a landlord.Someone who looks slovenly probably isn’t too concerned with making a good impression, and this attitude could spill over into other areas of the landlord-tenant relationship.


If you meet with the building janitor to see the apartment, this person probably will be wearing a uniform. However, note how well-groomed and tidy they appear.
Pay attention to how your landlord behaves. Look at body language and listen to how he or she speaks. You want someone who is intelligent and courteous. Avoid anyone who comes across as rude or unintelligent.If the landlord appears frazzled, they should apologize and explain. For example, they might work a job and have rushed to meet you.

, You should ask the landlord plenty of questions about their management style. Pay attention to the answers, but also note the confidence. If a landlord hesitates when answering, they probably don’t do what they say they do. Ask the following questions:How long has the landlord owned the property?
Does the landlord manage the property themselves? Or have they hired a property management company? What’s their name?
Who is responsible for repairs—the tenant or the landlord?
How long did the prior tenant live in the apartment?
Does the landlord spray for pests and rodents?
How should you request maintenance? How long does it take for the landlord to respond?
What kind of security does the building have?

, Type the landlord’s name and location into Google and see what pulls up.If the landlord uses a property management company, also research them. Larger landlords might have reviews on Yelp or at the Better Business Bureau.


Almost any landlord can get a negative review. After all, some tenants are a nightmare to rent to. However, you should pay attention to the number of negative reviews. If you see a lot of negative reviews, there could be a problem.
Also look for patterns to the complaints. If multiple people all complain that a landlord held onto their deposit, then there is probably a problem.

, You want to see how many times your landlord has sued someone or been sued by a tenant. A landlord who has sued a lot probably is not a responsible landlord, and one who has been sued often could break the law regularly. Your local court might have a website where you can look up court records. Alternately, you might need to go to the courthouse to find this information.Visit the court in the county where the landlord is located. There should be a computer you can use to look up lawsuits. Search using the landlord’s name.
Also check federal court lawsuits. Tenants will sue for housing discrimination in federal court. You can use the PACER website to find these cases.
If you find lawsuits, analyze the suit. Read the “complaint” to find out the substance of the dispute. It’s not unusual for a large landlord in a city to have to go to court to evict people. However, if you see a lot of lawsuits, you could be dealing with a bad landlord.

, Every landlord must abide by your local building code. This code covers things like when the landlord must provide heat, what temperature hot water must be, etc. You want to check to see if your landlord has violated the code.The purpose of the code is to provide tenants with healthy living conditions, so a landlord who violates the code should be avoided.


Contact your county or city housing authority. Give the address and ask whether there have been any code violations.
If the landlord owns more than one property, ask about code violations for all of them.

, Businesses must be properly licensed by your state and/or local government. You should contact your appropriate state or local government agency. It might be the Department of Real Estate or another agency.


Also check whether complaints have been filed. Some agencies collect complaints and investigate them., The landlord should have given you a list of current or former tenants to talk to. Make sure to call them and ask questions, such as the following:How happy are they living in the apartment building?
What do they think of the landlord?
Have they ever needed repairs? How quickly were repairs completed?
Would they recommend living in the apartment building?
What’s one thing they wish they could change about the landlord?

, A lease should lay out your responsibilities as well as your landlord’s duties.You should request a written lease and read it carefully. Don’t sign until you agree with everything in the lease.Avoid an oral agreement. Although an oral agreement is valid for a lease of one year or less, you have no evidence of what the landlord agreed to. If the landlord won’t give you a written lease, then you should avoid them.
You might not understand the lease, so always ask questions. If you need help, then find a landlord-tenant attorney who can review the document with you.

, Generally, a landlord may use your security deposit only to make repairs. They cannot keep the deposit for normal “wear and tear” or to correct problems that existed when you moved in. For these reasons, you should document what the apartment looks like before you move your stuff in.Take pictures of the empty rooms. Use the digital camera on your phone. If you find something wrong, take a close-up picture.
Notify your landlord of any problems that need to be fixed. Your landlord might give you a form to fill out on which you record any problems. If not, write up a list yourself and include photographs.

, The ideal landlord will promptly fix any problem that arises. However, some landlords might be lax. Always remember to document any request for repairs in writing, using either a letter or email.


If you make an oral request, then follow up with a letter confirming the discussion.Mail any letter certified mail, return receipt requested so that you have proof of the date it was received.

, The easiest way to maintain a peaceful relationship with your landlord is to follow your obligations under the lease. This means paying your rent on time, keeping the place clean, and not damaging the unit.Contact your landlord immediately if you are short on money. You won’t gain anything by hiding from your landlord and hoping the problem will disappear.
Talk frankly with your landlord about when you will have the money for rent. If you’re falling into debt, make a budget.
If you lose your job and can no longer pay the rent, talk to your landlord about ending the lease early.

, Eviction laws will differ depending on your nation or state, so you should read up on your rights. Look for a tenant’s rights website for your city. In the U.S., a landlord generally can only evict you after getting a court order. This means your landlord must give you written notice that they are terminating the lease and then sue you in court. You will have a chance to respond.


Your landlord typically cannot use self-help, such as changing the locks, throwing your belongings on the sidewalk, ordering you to leave, or cutting off your utilities.A landlord-tenant attorney is a great help when you have a legal dispute with a landlord. If money is tight, then seek low-cost legal help, such as legal aid.

The notice also typically gives you a certain amount of time to fix (“cure”) the problem. If you don’t fix the problem by the deadline, then the landlord will terminate your lease.Read the notice to find out what term of the lease you are alleged to have violated. For example, leases often require that you not have pets, not use grills outside or on the stairwell, and use common areas reasonably.
If you failed to pay rent, then you should receive a “Pay or Quit” notice. You must pay all of the owed rent before the deadline.;
, The landlord might have wrongly accused you of violating the lease. For example, if you live in an apartment building, then someone else in the building might have committed the lease violation.


Get letters or emails from your neighbors. For example, your landlord might accuse you of having a pet. You can get neighbors to write that it isn’t you with the pet.
Take pictures. If you are accused of damaging your apartment, then take pictures or video to document the lack of damage. These pictures will be useful if you are later sued and have to defend yourself in court.

, You should gather your proof that you haven’t violated the lease and write a letter to your landlord disputing the allegations. You can include your proof and ask the landlord to call you with questions.


Set the letter up like a professional business letter. Keep your tone formal but friendly.
You could write, “Dear Mr. Smith. I received your Notice to Cure or Quit yesterday. According to the notice, you believe that I have violated our lease agreement because I am keeping a pet. I do not have a pet. Instead, the new tenants in the apartment beside me have a dog. I have included an email from Mrs. Tyler, who lives upstairs, testifying that my neighbors have the dog, not me. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you further.”
It is better to mail the letter than use email.Send the letter certified mail, return receipt requested so that you will know when your landlord receives it.

, Negotiation works best when you can talk in person, so that you can gauge how someone is responding to what you say. You can often resolve a dispute quickly in person.


The key to discussing the alleged violation is to keep your cool. You shouldn’t mimic your landlord’s behavior.Instead, listen closely to what he or she says.
Firmly point out that you haven’t violated the lease. For example, you could say, “I didn’t trash the common area last Friday because I was staying with a friend that evening. I can give you her phone number, if you want to confirm that.”

, If you have been a good tenant, always on-time with the rent, then the landlord might not want to lose you. In this situation, your landlord might be willing to mediate the dispute so that you can come to a resolution that works for both of you.


In mediation, the mediator listens to both sides and helps guide you toward solutions you can agree on. Mediation is a good way to maintain the landlord-tenant relationship, so you should consider mediation if you definitely don’t want to move.
You can find mediators through your courthouse or by contacting your local/state bar association. Ask for a referral., You might have no choice but to fix the problem. If you really did violate the lease and don’t want to move out, then your best option might be to cure before the deadline stated on your notice.


Let your landlord know as soon as possible that you have fixed the violation and that you intend to stay in your apartment.

, If you don’t voluntarily leave, then your landlord cannot throw you out. Instead, he or she must file an “unlawful detainer” action, which is a lawsuit in court. You will receive a copy of the complaint filed, along with a “summons.”The summons should tell you the deadline for responding to the lawsuit. Make careful note of this date.

, It is illegal for your landlord to try and evict you him or herself. Instead, they must file a lawsuit and get a court order to evict you. If your landlord tries to evict you, then you should document the action your landlord took. For example, your landlord cannot:Change the locks.
Throw you or your belongings onto the sidewalk.
Threaten to physically remove you or your belongings.
Order you to leave.
Cut off the utilities to your apartment.

, You will respond to the lawsuit by filing an “answer” with the court. In the answer, you respond to each allegation made by your landlord and raise defenses. Your court should have printed, “fill in the blank” forms you can use.Stop into court and ask.


Alternately, many local legal aid organizations might provide printed answer forms., There are several defenses you could raise depending on the circumstances. Make sure you have evidence supporting a defense before raising it. Common defenses include:Insufficient notice. Some states require that the notice contain certain language or give you a certain amount of time to cure. If your landlord didn’t follow the law, then you can raise this as a defense.
Self-help. If your landlord tried to evict you using self-help, then you should raise that as a defense.
Retaliatory eviction. You can’t be evicted because you complained to your local or state government about the conditions of your apartment building. For example, if you complain that insufficient heat is provided, then your landlord can’t turn around and try to evict you.
Housing discrimination. It is illegal under federal and state law to discriminate against you on the basis of certain protected characteristics—race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, and familial status., Make sure to give your landlord a copy of your answer ahead of the court hearing date. You should arrange to have it served before you file your answer.Generally, you can hire someone to deliver the answer to your landlord, or you could ask someone 18 or older, who is not involved in the lawsuit, to deliver your answer for you.
In some courts, you can also mail your answer. Read your court’s rules of procedure to find acceptable methods of service.

, Once you have completed your answer, you should make several copies. Keep one copy and take the other copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask to file the original.


You shouldn’t have to pay a fee to file your response, although this might vary by court.

, The petition might have stated the hearing date, or you might receive the date in the mail. Make a note on your calendar to show up for your hearing. You can’t skip the hearing.If you miss it, then the court might enter judgment against you.

, At the hearing, you need to explain to the judge why you shouldn’t be evicted. Make sure to identify witnesses who have helpful information, as well as any helpful documents.For example, you should look for the following:


If the notice was insufficient, then bring a copy of the notice. The judge will want to see it.
If the landlord used self-help, then get a copy of the police report (if you called the police) as well as statements from witnesses who saw your landlord remove your things. You can also testify on your behalf.
If you think your landlord is retaliating against you, then you should get a copy of your complaint to the health and safety department you complained to, as well as any report issued.
If your landlord illegally discriminated against you, then get witnesses who observed your landlord’s biased behavior.

, You want to make a good impression on the judge. For this reason, you should look your best. If you show up to court in messy clothes, then you signal to the judge that you are not a diligent, trustworthy person.


Men should wear business casual clothes, at a minimum. This means dress pants, a button-up dress shirt, and a tie. Also wear dress shoes (not sneakers) and dark-colored socks.
Women can wear dress slacks or skirts, along with a nice sweater or blouse. Women can also wear conservative dresses. It is most important that clothing not be too revealing or tight.
Under no circumstances should men or women wear shorts, blue jeans, flip flops, hats, or T-shirts.If you don’t have a lot of money, then go to a thrift store and find clothes in good condition.

, At the hearing, your landlord will present their side of the story first.You should listen quietly as he or she presents evidence to the judge. Be sure to take notes. Write down anything your landlord or a witness says that you want to respond to.


Don’t raise your hand and ask the judge to speak. You will have a turn to speak. Stand quietly and listen.
Try not to show emotion. Don’t shake your head, grimace, or make noises, no matter how inaccurate the testimony is.

, You will be able to go second. Be sure to explain in more detail the reasons you stated in your answer for why you shouldn’t be evicted.Offer to show the judge supporting documents. If a witness has helpful testimony, tell the judge your witness is with you to testify.


The judge could ask you questions. Always answer honestly and say “I don’t know” if you don’t know something.

, After hearing the evidence, the judge should issue a decision. If you lose, then you have a limited amount of time to move out of your apartment.


However, you might be able to appeal.You can bring an appeal to a higher court and ask that the judgment against you be set aside because the judge made a serious error.
Before filing your Notice of Appeal, you should talk with a lawyer about whether an appeal is worthwhile. It might be in your interest simply to move out.

Request a reasonable grace period.,
Offer to make concessions.,
Read your lease carefully.,
Draft an addendum.,
Have your landlord sign the addendum.,
Include a copy of the addendum with your lease.",How to Get a Grace Period on Your Rent," You should be able to discuss the issue with your landlord at a time when he or she is not rushed and there is a minimum of distractions.


You have the most bargaining power if you haven't yet signed your lease. Your landlord knows you can go rent somewhere else if his or her terms don't work for you.For this reason, you should do your best to make sure any issues you have with the due date for your rent are addressed before you sign the lease and move in.
After you've signed the lease, it's still possible to negotiate with your landlord, but you're coming from a less advantageous position. Your landlord knows he or she can charge late fees or evict you if you don't pay your rent on time.;
, Your landlord typically will be more inclined to agree to a grace period if you have a legitimate, understandable reason you need it.For example, if your rent is due on the first, but you don't get paid until the third, your landlord may be willing to take the rent on the fourth after your paycheck has been deposited.
You typically stand a better chance of getting your landlord to agree to a grace period if you have a legitimate, factual reason for needing it. Not being able to budget your money is not a legitimate, factual reason.
Emphasize that a grace period is necessary for you to sign on as a tenant or stay as an existing tenant.

, Keep the original due date in mind when you calculate a grace period, and make sure it doesn't stretch more than a week.


A standard grace period is four or five days from the original due date. If you need longer than that, you might consider asking for the due date to be changed.
Most states do have a requirement that if the due date (typically the first) falls on a weekend or holiday, rent is due on the next business day.However, most grace periods are inclusive of holidays.
In other words, if your rent is due on the first of the month, but you have a grace period until the fifth of the month, it doesn't matter on what day the fifth falls, or if there is a holiday during that time.
In practical terms, if the fifth falls on a Sunday and your apartment complex's rental office isn't open on Sundays, your rent is due by Saturday, the fourth – not Monday, the sixth – if you want to avoid late fees.
If the grace period you request is reasonable, it shouldn't place an undue burden on your landlord.Emphasize that a few days shouldn't make any difference to your landlord, but the flexibility of a grace period is important to you.

, Your landlord may be more willing to provide you a grace period if you meet him or her halfway in some other area.


For example, you may offer to pay a larger deposit in exchange for a grace period on payment of rent each month. A security deposit is designed to protect your landlord against any monetary damages you might cause, so a larger deposit may entice him or her to allow you a reasonable grace period.If your landlord has the means to do so, you might also consider setting up automatic payments that debit your checking account with your rent on a specific date each month.
Keep in mind that any concessions you make also should be included in writing, either on the lease itself or in an addendum., Your lease has provisions regarding the payment of rent, due dates, and late fees.


If you haven't signed your lease yet, you typically can simply add a grace period to the provision addressing the payment of rent, initial and date it. If your landlord initials the change and signs the lease after that addition has been made, it will be considered part of your lease and legally binding.If there is no grace period mentioned and you've already signed your lease, you typically must draft an addendum to your lease describing the grace period.
It is possible to simply cross out language in your signed lease, or add additional language creating a grace period. This will still be legally valid provided both you and your landlord initial it and write the date after your initials.However, for the sake of clarity and neatness you may want to write the provision about the grace period out separately in an addendum for you and your landlord to sign.

, If your landlord has granted you a grace period, you must make sure it is reflected in writing – don't simply take his or her word for it.Keep in mind that legally a written contract can only be changed in writing. As a written contract, any additional concessions made to your lease also must be embodied in writing.
Your landlord may want to draft the addendum instead of allowing you to do it. If that's the case, make sure you read it carefully before you sign it to ensure it says what you believe and understand the agreement to be.
If you're drafting the addendum yourself, you may want to search for samples online. No specific formalities are required; however, make sure the addendum is dated and references your original lease.For example, you can open the addendum by writing ""This agreement between landlord and tenant, dated February 5, 2016, adds to and amends the lease dated August 1, 2015."" Then write the agreement arrived at by you and your landlord regarding the grace period.

, No addendum to your lease is legally binding unless signed by both you and your landlord.Print two copies of your addendum, so both you and your landlord have original copies with original signatures., Once signed, the addendum becomes legally binding as a part of your original lease agreement.


Keep in mind that since the lease came before the addendum, you will have difficulty proving the addendum exists unless you have a copy of it with your lease.

Do this by obtaining the references of prior landlords, having excellent credit, and by paying your rent and utility bills on time. In addition, try to be a congenial and friendly person., When appealing to your landlord to accept your cat, you need to be as polite as possible. Approach your landlord knowing that it is their decision. Make sure to say please and to avoid anything that sounds like a threat. In addition, do not articulate anger or anything of the sort.


Address your landlord appropriately. If they go by “Mrs.” or “Mr.” you should use those titles. If you usually call them by their first name, do so., If your landlord seems a little open to letting your cat stay with you, you might want to suggest that they meet your cat. Then, set up a time and place for them to do so. They might wind up liking the cat and agreeing with your position., Perhaps the biggest reason that a lot of landlords ban cats (and other pets) is the potential damage that they could cause to the property. As a result, you’ll need to convince your landlord that your cat won’t damage the home.


Offer to trim your cat’s nails.
Let them know your cat will have plenty of scratching posts and other objects to keep them busy.
Tell them your cat has no history of property damage., Your veterinary records will show that your cat is up to date on its shots. In addition, they will show that you are a responsible pet owner who attends to the needs of your cat.


Show that your cat has been spayed or neutered – something that could reduce chance of aggressive or destructive behavior.
Discuss flea control with your landlord. By showing them that you will take measures to control fleas, you’ll demonstrate you’re a responsible cat owner (and tenant)., If you think your landlord still needs more persuading after you’ve approached them, you should offer to pay an extra deposit. This deposit will cover any damage your cat may make to the property.


Pet deposits might be refundable or nonrefundable.
A new deposit could range from $200 to even a full month’s rent.
Its best to assure your landlord that there won’t be any damage – and that you simply want to assure them of this by providing an extra deposit.
Make sure you and your landlord sign a formal agreement that grants you permission to have a cat if you provide a pet deposit. This could be in the form of a new lease or an addendum., If an extra deposit isn’t enough incentive for your landlord, you can offer to pay extra rent specifically for your pet. Extra money a month, possibly in addition to another deposit, might just be enough to convince your landlord.


Pet rent can range from $10 to $20 extra a month. It may also represent a percentage of the total rent. Work with your landlord to determine an appropriate pet rent.
Have your landlord draft a new lease or an addendum that acknowledges your agreement., If other incentives have failed, you can offer to sign a longer lease. Suggest that you will either renew your current lease for a year or add on another year in addition to whatever remains on your current agreement. In the end, this is probably the best way for your landlord to make money and save time associated with finding a new tenant., If your landlord refuses to accept your cat, you may be able to have your cat certified as an emotional support animal. An emotional support animal is an animal that provides therapy to people with psychological disabilities. Under United States law, landlords are required to allow tenants to have emotional support animals.


To have your cat classified as an emotional support animal, you’ll have to have your doctor, psychiatrist, or a mental health professional certify that the pet is necessary to your mental health., Read your lease very carefully to see if there is a legal way you can have your cat live with you. If your lease doesn't prohibit pets (or cats), you may have the legal right to keep your cat with you.Remember, even if your lease says you can have a cat (or does not forbid you from having one) you still need to maintain a positive relationship with your landlord. Continue to work to convince them.

, After you’ve signed a lease that forbids a pet cat and appealed to your landlord to accept the cat, your only recourse will be a lawyer. Your lawyer might be able to find a legal way to require your landlord to accept your cat. If not, they may be able to help you mediate with the landlord so you can both come to a compromise about your cat and your living situation.


Contact a lawyer in your community or a tenant advocacy group near you.
Know the law of your city, state or country. Depending on where you live, tenants may have more rights than they know."

Decide on a type of wallet.,
Keep your wallet secure.,
Understand prices are volatile and payment is irreversible.",How to Get Bitcoins1," In order to obtain bitcoins, you need to set up a bitcoin wallet where they can be stored online or on your desktop. There are several options for your bitcoin wallet.


A ""wallet"" is what your account to store bitcoins is referred to as. It's more or less an online bank account where bitcoins are stored. There are various types of wallets that provide different levels of security.There are three main types of bitcoin wallets: a software wallet, stored on your hard drive, an online wallet, or an offline mobile wallet you download on a smartphone that uses a number of keys to protect your account.Storing bitcoins locally on your computer can protect you against hackers, but you also may lose your bitcoins is your computer crashes. Back up your wallet frequently if you go this route.Mobile wallets are convenient as you can pay with bitcoins on the go, and can sometimes just tap your phone near a register as payment. However, they tend to take up a great deal of space on your phone and you can only store so many bitcoins at a time.
An online wallet is highly convenient in that your bitcoins can be accessed from anywhere and you can use your bitcoins for a variety of online purchases. However, online wallets are susceptible to hackers. Also, the organization you go through to set up your wallet will have access to your account and there have been cases of bitcoins getting stolen by private organizations. For example, the bitcoin exchange Mt Gox was discovered to have been manipulating prices and committing fraud, stealing large numbers of exchange users' bitcoins.Make sure you choose a reputable provider if you set up a bitcoin account online.;
, Regardless of the wallet type you choose, you need to keep your bitcoin wallet secure. There are a variety of safety precautions you can take to keep your wallet from getting compromised.


As previously stated, be very careful with online services. Security breaches are common and online services generally do not provide security. Choose your online services carefully and require many different types of authentication to access your wallet.Do not keep too many bitcoins in any one wallet at once. Part of the reason bitcoin wallets are referred to as wallets is because it's important to think of your bitcoins as cash. Just as you wouldn't go shopping with thousands of dollars in your wallet, it is probably unwise to store large amounts of bitcoins in your wallet. Keep some bitcoins on your mobile, online, or desktop wallet but store other amounts in a more secure environment.Always back up your wallet if it's on your desktop. If you back up your wallet online, encrypt any back ups to prevent hackers.Always use a strong password and write your password down somewhere safe so you will not forget it. A strong password should be at least 16 characters long with a variety of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Avoid using words easily linked back to you in your password, such as names of friends, family members, or pets., Bitcoin is still a relatively new technology, so prices are volatile.Once you purchase bitcoins, you cannot return them.


The average price of a bitcoin can increase and decrease unpredictably. For example, in one week in November, 2015 Bitcoin went from $318 on a Monday to $492 on a Wednesday, falling back under $400 by Thursday.Do not put too much money into bitcoin, as it's seen as a high-risk asset. Only buy enough bitcoins to make convenient online purchases.Any transactions you make with bitcoins are irreversible. You should only do business via bitcoins with organizations you trust. If you make a bad transaction or do not receive a product for your payment, you cannot get your bitcoins back."

Ask to contact information the prior tenant.,
Speak to other tenants in the same building or complex.,
Talk to neighbors in the area.",How to Check a Landlord Reference1," As you are considering an apartment, ask the landlord if you can speak with the current tenant. If the tenant has already moved out, ask the landlord for a forwarding address or telephone number. It is helpful if you can ask the tenant about the apartment as well as some things about the landlord.Asking the prior tenant of the exact apartment you are considering will let you ask about the following topics:


the condition of the apartment
any problems with plumbing, heat or other utilities
the landlord’s responsiveness to any problems
noise or traffic problems;
, If you are renting a stand-alone house, this will not apply. But if you are considering an apartment in a large complex or apartment building, you should try to speak with other random tenants. Go to the building/complex toward the end of the day, and you should be able to meet people on their way home from work. Ask about their satisfaction in the building and their happiness with the landlord. Ask how long they have lived in the same place. (Tenants who stay for more than the first year’s lease are a good sign.), Go beyond the immediate apartment building and talk with people who live in the same area. Walk down the block at various times of the day, or over the weekend. Get a feel for the kind of activity that goes on. Talk to neighbors about the landlord. Ask them about the kind of people who live in the apartments there (whether they are friendly, busy, quiet, noisy, etc.). Try to find out about the stability of the neighborhood, which is an indication of the level of satisfaction with the landlord."

, If you don't feel technically competent, it's perfectly acceptable to ignore the next few steps and just leave your bitcoin in the account where you bought them. In fact, most bitcoin holders do just that. But the beauty of bitcoin is that it's money that no third party needs to control for you.

Try to get receipts for your rent, also. In some states, a landlord must provide a receipt if the rent is paid in cash.You should always try to get a receipt as it will serve as proof of a timely payment.;
, Rather than wait for your landlord to contact you about late rent, you should be proactive. Call your landlord and admit that you can’t make your rent payment. Ask if you can get an extension for a few days.


Also be willing to make at least partial payment on time.This can show the landlord that you are asking for an extension in good faith.
Before asking for an extension, you should know whether or not you will be able to come up with the money. Your landlord will want to know why you don’t have the rent money when it is due. You need to give him or her a reason to believe you will come into money soon.
For example, if your child support payment is late, then you can tell your landlord when you expect to receive it.

, If you find that you are consistently late on rent, then you should try to adjust your budget so that you have money to pay your rent. You can begin setting a budget by going through your monthly expenses and seeing what you can cut. Right off the top, you should be able to cut entertainment expenses (like Netflix, movies, music) and restaurant/bar expenses.


If you purchase a morning coffee, you can save a few dollars a day by making your own coffee at home.
If you don’t know where your money is going, track everything you spend for one week. Carry around a notebook and enter every purchase, no matter how small. At the end of the week, look and see what you are spending money on.
For other tips on creating a budget, see Create a Household Budget.

, When you fail to pay rent, your landlord can start eviction proceedings by giving you a Notice to Quit.If you have a lease, then you can cure the non-payment before the deadline specified in the Notice to Quit.If you do not have a lease, then the cure date will be specified in your state’s statute.

, If you manage to cure the deficiency, then you can stay in the apartment. You should try to cure as soon as possible. If you can borrow money from friends or family, then do so. However, be careful about taking out payday loans to cover your rent. These loans have high interest rates. You don’t need to go deeper into debt.


Your landlord might refuse your attempt to cure by not accepting your owed rent payments. You should try to have a witness go along with you and watch you attempt to give the landlord money. If you do not have a witness, then mail the rent certified mail, return receipt requested., If you receive a summons and a complaint for eviction, then your landlord has moved to evict you. You can still cure the non-payment of rent. However, now you will need to pay any rent owed, any applicable interest, and the costs your landlord incurred by filing the eviction case., Your landlord can also evict you for violating a term of your lease. For example, if the lease states you cannot have pets, then you can be evicted for sneaking a pet into your apartment.


Read your Notice to Cure and see what the violation is. Then take out your copy of the lease and see if the landlord’s interpretation of the lease provision is the correct one.

, You should cure the violation by the deadline in the Notice to Cure. The Notice to Cure should tell you exactly what you have been doing that the landlord believes is a violation of your lease.


If you think you won’t be able to meet the deadline, then talk to your landlord. Explain your situation. For example, you may be trying to get a new home for the pet. Let the landlord know when you will be able to have the pet move out.
You have a strong incentive to cure the violation. If the landlord ultimately evicts you, then he or she could still charge you for rent.In other words, you will have to pay rent until the lease expires—although you won’t be allowed to live in the apartment.

, Your landlord might be getting complaints about you from neighbors. In fact, unless the landlord lives in your building, he or she probably is only aware of what you are doing because of complaints from other tenants. If you make too much noise at night, then other tenants may be complaining about you.


You should try to resolve differences with any neighbors. For example, your neighbor could work odd hours and be sleeping in the middle of the day when you do your dance exercises. Try to come to some sort of agreement so that you can live peaceably beside each other.
For more information, see Be a Good Neighbour.

, The exact requirements for eviction prevention programs (EPP) will vary by state. Generally, however, these programs were created to help low or moderate income renters who were suddenly facing a hardship or circumstance outside their control. The program helps participants avoid an eviction by paying one or more month’s rent.Typically, the program requires that you be in imminent danger of eviction. For example, you should have received an eviction notice.
Also, no more than 60% of your income can be spent on your housing costs. If you spend more, the program will probably think that your situation is not sustainable. Although EPPs provide short-term relief, they are not designed to subsidize your rent month after month.

, You should check to see if there is an eviction prevention program in your state or county. They can be funded by federal or state dollars. Most federal programs are administered by local organizations. Call the Salvation Army to ask if there is a program in your area.States also administer their own EPP programs. Type your state and “eviction assistance” into a search engine. You can also contact your state’s Department of Public Welfare.

, You cannot participate in these programs unless the landlord agrees to participate as well.You should talk to your landlord and explain your situation. If you have been a good tenant who always pays rent on time, then gently remind the landlord of that fact.


Your landlord also might not know about the tragedy that has struck you. He or she might be very sympathetic if you explain what has happened and how you are coping.

, You should have proof of how much money you bring in each month. Collect proof of income, such as pay stubs or direct deposit slips. Also bring a photo ID and a Notice to Quit or other notice.You will also need proof of the emergency that is beyond your control. If someone in your family has suffered a medical emergency, for example, then retain copies of hospital and doctor bills.

, You should call the agency and ask whether or not you need to set up an appointment or whether walk-ins are welcome. You shouldn’t wait to ask for assistance. These programs can run out of money quickly.

, Before suggesting mediation to your landlord, you need to think about what you want.If you can’t afford the current rent, then you will need to figure out what you can afford. You should only agree to something that is realistic for you.


Your landlord might be trying to evict you because you make too much noise or because you violated another provision in the lease (like no grilling on the stairwell). You can promise to change your behavior if given a chance to remain in the apartment.
If you have been habitually late with rent, then you need to give the landlord a reason why you won’t be late any more. For example, you may get an alimony or child support check in the middle of the month. If so, ask the landlord if you can change the due date for the rent to the middle of the month.

, In mediation, a third party acts as a neutral mediator. He or she is not a judge and does not make decisions. Instead, the mediator listens to each side of the story and tries to guide each side to agree to a mutually-acceptable solution.Mediation is also voluntary. If you and the landlord cannot come to an agreement, then either one of you can walk away.Remember that the landlord has some incentive to settle with you as well. Even if the landlord wins the legal case, he or she will still have to spend time and money going to court.By settling, your landlord can avoid the cost and unnecessary hassle of a court hearing.

, Check with your local courthouse if they offer a mediation program. Many do. You might also need to contact your city manager’s office or local bar association and ask if they have mediation programs.


Mediation can either be free or cost a fee. The fee can be quite small.For example, mediation is $25 a party in Dane County, Wisconsin., You can prepare for mediation by understanding the facts in your case. You will be more effective in mediation if you try to see things from your landlord’s perspective. You won’t win anything in mediation by slanting the facts, so look at your situation objectively.


Be realistic. Did you really violate the lease? Are you constantly late with rent? If you have failed to follow through on promises before, then you should understand why your landlord doesn’t trust you.
Consider whether the landlord’s feelings were hurt. People sometimes don’t behave rationally when their emotions are bruised.
Determine what conditions you are willing to accept.Can you live with not playing the drums after 9:00 pm? Are you prepared to give your pet up?

, You shouldn’t lie to the mediator. The mediator is there to find a workable solution, not to assign blame. You should write down what you would agree to before going to mediation so that if you are nervous you will remember what you want to say.


Remember not to make personal attacks.Your landlord might shut down and no longer be willing to negotiate.
Also be open to the landlord’s suggestions.You are unlikely to get everything that you want in negotiations, so listen carefully and try to be flexible.

, Your settlement agreement (or stipulation) should lay out the terms of your agreement. Your mediator should help you write it. Once it is finished, each party should sign.If a lawsuit has already been started, then you also need to file the agreement with the court.Make sure that it is actually filed. If the landlord wants to file, go with him or stop into the court clerk’s office and ask if it has been filed.
Be sure to take a copy of the settlement agreement home with you also. You will want proof of the agreement for your own records.

, If you have questions about how to avoid an eviction, then you should think about meeting with an experienced landlord-tenant lawyer. Often, lawyers will offer an initial consultation for free or for a reduced fee.If you can’t afford a lawyer, then look into legal aid organizations in your area. Legal aid organizations provide free legal services to those in financial need. You can find a legal aid organization near you by looking in the phone book or by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lcs.gov.

, Your landlord has to follow specific rules in order to evict you. If he or she didn’t, then you can contest the eviction. You should take the Notice to Quit and your copy of the complaint and summons to your initial consultation with a lawyer. Look for the following:



The Notice to Quit is not in the proper form. Some state laws are quite specific about what the Notice to Quit has to say. For example, a landlord in Maine must explicitly tell you in the Notice to Quit that you can avoid the eviction if you pay rent before the notice expires.You should find what your state requires.

The Notice to Quit was not served properly. State laws can also be specific about how much advance notice you must be given and how the Notice to Quit must be served on you. For example, in Michigan, a Notice to Quit must be delivered personally on either you or to a member of your family (or else an employee). Landlords in Michigan can also mail it to you first class. They cannot, however, slip it under the door.The landlord engaged in self-help. Most states prohibit a landlord from trying to physically remove tenants, lock them out, cut off utilities, or remove the tenants’ property. If your landlord did any of these, then get a witness and take pictures.

Refusal to accept your attempt to cure. If you tried to pay rent but the landlord refused, then you should gather your evidence.

, You can get your case dismissed if the landlord did not follow proper format when giving you the Notice to Quit. Ask your court clerk if there is a form Motion to Dismiss that you can fill out. If not, then check with local legal aid organizations, which sometimes have forms printed.After completing the form, you must file it with the court. Make two copies: one for your records and one for the landlord. Have the clerk date stamp all copies.
You will probably have to pay a filing fee. When you pick up your “fill in the blank” Motion to Dismiss form, ask the court clerk how much it costs to file. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form.
You can serve the Motion to Dismiss on the landlord. Ask the court clerk for what are acceptable methods of service. Often, you can mail the form.

, The landlord can always refile a lawsuit. For example, if the landlord’s Notice to Quit was insufficient, he can serve you with a properly drafted Notice to Quit and try to evict you all over again.

, If you can’t get the case dismissed, then you will need to have a hearing. At the hearing, you can present documents to the judge and ask any witnesses to appear on your behalf.

Your lease may include a clause that sets forth the requirements for new or additional tenants. If you see such a clause, make sure your prospective roommate meets those requirements. If your lease doesn't have that clause, you can get a good idea of what your landlord requires in new tenants by thinking back to what was required of you when you applied to rent your unit.There probably is an occupancy limit for your unit. If it's not included in your lease, you should make sure you ask your landlord before you make any commitment to your potential roommate.;
, You should find a time when both you and your prospective roommate can talk to your landlord about your possibilities.


Make sure to set up a meeting with your landlord before your prospective roommate moves in, otherwise your landlord may consider you in violation of your lease.If you're not on close terms with your landlord, you might consider writing him or her a letter explaining what you want to meet about. Briefly explain that you want to add a roommate to your lease and provide a little background information about your prospect., Your landlord likely will want to complete the same process with your prospective roommate as he or she did with you.


Most landlords have a screening process that includes a credit and income check and may require a background report.You may want to talk to your potential roommate before the two of you go to see the landlord and find out this information for yourself. If your potential roommate's background, income, and credit history compare favorably to your own, he or she most likely will be approved by your landlord., If another adult will be moving into your unit, your landlord may want to increase the monthly rent or require an additional deposit.


You may want to find out if your landlord is willing to accept separate checks for the rent so all are not penalized if one person is late. Although most landlords are not willing to do this, it doesn't hurt to ask.If your landlord asks for an additional security deposit from your roommate, compare the amount to the amount you paid when you moved in. If they both are equal, this can make things much easier when you move out. However, if your roommate is being asked to pay more, you will have to take this into consideration when you and your roommate decide how to divide any refund after you move out.
Your landlord may ask for additional rent in part because you're signing a new lease, or because more people living in the apartment means there will be more wear and tear to the property.Even if your security deposit was already at the maximum allowed by your state's law, it may go up if your rent goes up, since the maximum typically is set as a multiple of the monthly rent., Depending on the floor plan of your unit, it might not be as simple as dividing the total amount evenly.


For example, if one of you has a larger bedroom than the other, you may want to portion out the rent so that the person with the larger bedroom pays more rent. You can do this easily by dividing the total rent by the total square footage of the apartment to get the rental cost per square foot, and then finding the difference between the square footage of the two bedrooms.
Your rent section should include the total monthly rent and the day on which it is due each month.If your landlord only accepts a single payment, you may want to structure the agreement so that, for example, your roommate pays you by the first, and you pay the landlord the total by the third.

, Take into consideration how each of you use the living space when dividing the monthly bills.Keep in mind that if the utilities are in your name, you are considered legally liable for the entire amount each month. You may want to make your roommate's portion of the bill due to you several days to a week before you have to pay the utility company.
If you have additional shared living expenses such as cable and internet, how you divide these may be based on how each of you uses these services. For example, if you have cable but you only have a TV in your room and your roommate doesn't own a TV, it may not make sense for your roommate to be paying half the cable bill since he or she obviously doesn't use it.

, You can avoid future disagreements by carefully delineating which spaces are shared and which are private.


Keep in mind that even mundane chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes can turn into significant battles if not dealt with properly.While it may seem like overkill to discuss these sorts of things before you've even moved in together, doing so can eliminate misunderstandings and confusion about responsibilities.
Creating a schedule for chores is one way to keep things fair.However, you should include a provision for special cases or events. For example, if your roommate has a dozen friends over for dinner while you're at work, it probably should be her responsibility to do the dishes afterward – even if it's technically ""your night"" according to the schedule.
Particularly if one or both of you is in school, you may want to designate specific hours each night or each week as ""quiet hours"" during which excessive noise or guests are prohibited.If either of you wants a period of time in which you're guaranteed to have the apartment yourself, these times should be scheduled and agreed upon in advance.

, To ensure privacy for both of you, come to an agreement on when and under what circumstances each of you can have guests.At a minimum, you probably want to require a certain amount of notice to the other roommate of an overnight guest. No one enjoys their roommate's latest paramour walking in on them standing in the kitchen eating ice cream in their underwear.
You may want to establish longer notice periods for friends or family members visiting for a longer period of time. Keep in mind the longer someone will be staying, the more of an imposition they potentially will be.
You also may want to set rules for how many days in a row, or how many days in a month-long period, any particular guest can stay over. This sort of thing may also be covered in your lease. For example, many leases have clauses stating anyone who stays for more than two weeks must be on the lease.

, While you may naturally begin the relationship believing everything will be wonderful, having a plan in writing for what to do if a violation occurs can eliminate a serious dispute if something happens.


Consider providing for mediation before either of you are allowed to sue the other. Mediation gives you more control over the outcome of the dispute and can help the two of you compromise and preserve your friendship.You typically can find mediator services through the clerk's office of your local courthouse. There also may be clinics at a nearby law school. Additionally, many universities have mediation services to assist students with roommate issues., In addition to division of any returned security deposits, you should plan who will be responsible for cleaning which parts of the unit.


Your agreement should spell out what happens if one roommate leaves early, and his or her responsibility for paying rent and finding an acceptable replacement roommate.Account for the amount of the total security deposit paid by each roommate, and how any amounts withheld by your landlord to cover damages will be distributed.For example, although it may make sense to divide costs for damages equally in shared living spaces such as the living room or the kitchen, each roommate should be individually responsible for any damages to his or her own bedroom.

, Because oral agreements can be forgotten over time and are too easily amended, your agreement should be put into writing and signed by all roommates.You don't have to use legalese or a complex contract structure – a simple outline is fine to create a roommate agreement, as long as its terms are understood.
Many universities and tenants' rights organizations have sample roommate agreements online that you can use to guide the formation and structure of your agreement, or you can draft your own.You might want to consider signing the agreement in front of a notary public for added formality. Notaries often can be found in banks or private package delivery companies such as UPS, and will notarize your agreement for a small fee.
Once the agreement is signed, make sure each of you has a copy of it. You also might consider providing a copy to your landlord.
Although most of the provisions of a roommate agreement likely won't be enforced in a court, a judge likely will enforce any provisions related to money or your mutual obligations under the lease., Make sure you understand any added provisions to your lease, as well as the responsibilities you and your roommate have.


Don't let the landlord intimidate you or pressure you into rushing through the agreement or reading it later. Your signature on the lease makes it legally enforceable against you, so you have the right to read it and understand it fully before you sign.
Since roommates are both equally liable for the entire rent, your landlord likely will make you both sign a new lease. This protects you by making it clear that you both have the same rights and responsibilities under the lease., Even if you think you understand something, it can be worthwhile to learn your landlord's interpretation of key clauses.


If your landlord's interpretation differs from your own, it can be helpful to repeat what you understand the landlord has said. If he or she agrees that you've heard correctly, you can be certain both you and your landlord are on the same page.
Try to make sure your roommate understands everything as well, especially the fact that both of you are individually liable for the entire amount of the rent., If your landlord has required additional deposits, you typically must pay this money before your roommate can move in.


If you and your agreement have made any specific arrangements regarding payment, make sure your landlord knows these arrangements and that you have payment ready on the day that it's due.
Regarding deposits, keep in mind that under the law the total deposit is owned jointly by both roommates, regardless of who paid what amount. If you don't intend to divide any refunded deposit amount equally, that agreement should be in writing as part of your roommate agreement, and you also should make it known to your landlord., The lease won't go into effect until it is signed by you, your new roommate, and your landlord.


Once everyone has signed the agreement, make sure both you and your new roommate have copies of the lease for your personal records.
You may want to keep your copy of the lease in a folder with your copy of the roommate agreement so you can refer to either of them if an issue arises.

Find an exchange.,
Accept bitcoins as payment.,
Spend your bitcoins online.",How to Get Bitcoins2," Bitcoin can generally be purchased three ways: in-person, at a store (ATM), or via an online exchange website. It's important to note that payment in cash (or sometimes debit) is usually required, and few Bitcoin providers accept credit card payment.


In Person: LocalBitcoins is a resource to find people in your area to trade bitcoins with. Trust and security can be a concern, which is why LocalBitcoins recommends you transact in a public place, and not necessarily with large amounts of cash.
Bitcoin ATM: There are about 400 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, as of 2016. Online search will help you locate one in your area, although they are usually confined to dense urban areas because of machine cost. An alternative is to locate a store selling Bitcoin via a ""virtual"" Bitcoin ATM, which simply runs on a tablet or at the cashier's checkout.
Online Exchange: You can fund an online trading account (generally via wire transfers or a third party banking service), which can also enable you to buy Bitcoin. This method generally requires additional identity verification in order to transact on the website.

, A number of businesses and services now accept bitcoins as payment. If you do any online services, you can also accept bitcoins as payment. Accepting payment in bitcoins can be beneficial if you're a small business or independent professional (like a dentist), because it does not cost money to accept bitcoins as payment.You can also avoid chargebacks, or consumer disputes with their credit card issuer that lose you money, because bitcoin transactions are irreversible.You can process payments yourself manually, but this may be difficult to do if you're not tech savvy. You can use a variety of merchant services to help with your bitcoin transactions if you're selling online using bitcoins. The bitcoin website can help you locate merchants willing to work with you based on your location, trade, and bank.You want to make sure people with bitcoin accounts can find you and spend their bitcoins on your site.

You can also download and display the bitcoin logo on your website to signal to users that you accept bitcoins as payment., Once you've obtained bitcoins, you can spend them online at retailers that accept bitcoins as payment. Paying with bitcoins is a fairly easy process and in some ways easier than entering credit card information.


Sites like Reddit, WordPress, and Mega often accept bitcoins as a form of payment.However, these companies usually accept bitcoins through a ""middleman"" such as BitPay or Coinbase, which converts bitcoins into another currency.Bitcoins are often accepted for transactions from other countries as it's easier than figuring out the exchange rate.
Make sure you only do business with people or businesses you trust, however, as bitcoins are frequently stolen during online transactions.

Do not mine for bitcoins.,
Know how to recover your bitcoin wallet.,
Be careful who you do business with.,
Avoid scams.",How to Get Bitcoins3," Bitcoin mining software is designed to perform a series of calculations to search for stray bitcoins online. While the practice is not illegal, it's probably a waste of time. Many users are currently mining bitcoins and there is a limited amount in circulation. You are unlikely to find many bitcoins, if any, via mining so it's probably best to save your time and save money on the software., If your bitcoin wallet gets compromised, make sure you know how to recover it. Having a strong password and a variety of information to authenticate your account can help.


Memorize or write down any data associated with your bitcoin, such as passwords, URLs, and answers to secret questions. This can all be used in the event of an emergency to restore your wallet and get your bitcoins back.It's a good idea to have a list of any information about your bitcoin account somewhere safe in your home. Consider investing in a safe or safety deposit box and keep your bitcoin information stored there., When buying online with bitcoin, you need to be careful about who you're conducting business with. Bitcoin is very prone to hacks and you do not want your information compromised.


If anyone claims they want to buy your bitcoins, be wary. If someone offers money for bitcoins without asking for any information about your, such as your name and bitcoin address, may be simply trying to steal your bitcoins. Do not send them any bitcoins unless you see money upfront.Only do business with people you know or businesses you trust. As bitcoin is so new, there are a lot of breaches in data and security and information is often stolen., Because Bitcoin is so new and not widely understood, it is a ripe ground for scammers. Here are some things to watch out for:


Ponzi schemes.Beware of anyone making promises that you can easily make incredibly high returns by getting in on the ""ground floor"" of a new phenomenon, especially if that person promises you little to no risk. You should also be on the lookout for any ""investment opportunity"" that does not have minimum investor qualifications, or that has complicated fee structures or strategies.Phishing. You may receive spam emails saying that you have been awarded Bitcoins.These emails will usually provide a login link and ask for your Bitcoin wallet credentials. Don't give these credentials to anyone! These emails are scams.
Exchange scams. Check to make sure that any company you do business with has been publicly audited. When you can, also do private background checks on the company. Search online in Bitcoin forums and other places to see if anyone is discussing possible scams at your prospective company. If you have trouble getting in touch with someone at the company or your questions go unanswered, don't do business with them."

Check websites for apartment ratings.,
Search the landlord’s name online.,
Research local area apartment databases.,
Check with the Better Business Bureau for any complaints leveled against the landlord or property management company.",How to Check a Landlord Reference2," Many websites online, which are designed to help you search for apartments and houses, will “rate” the units and the buildings. Check out the ratings for the apartment that you are considering. Read the details, and look at the kinds of issues that are rated. In particular, try to find out what tenants say about utilities, maintenance, property maintenance and management, and any other issues that are important to you.Be careful with the level of importance you put on any user ratings. If there have been only a relatively small number of responses or ratings, you have to consider that you may be hearing from only a couple disgruntled individuals. Percentages are more meaningful if there have been many responses.When reading reviews, look for facts rather than emotions. Try to differentiate between individuals who just had a personal conflict with the landlord and tenants who had genuine, supportable problems.

, Running a simple Google search or other Internet search for the landlord’s name may help you find out useful information. If there have been any public problems or scandals regarding the landlord or the property, those are likely to appear. Conversely, you may find positive reports, if the landlord or the apartment complex are involved in community service projects or similar endeavors., Depending on where you are in the country, you may find websites dedicated to information about local apartments and real estate issues. If such a tool exists in your area, use it to search for the property you are considering.


For example, in the Chicago area, prospective tenants might use the Cook County Property Info website at www.cookcountypropertyinfo.com.This site will let you search whether the landlord is current with tax payments, whether there have been or are any pending foreclosure actions, and other information from the County Assessor, Recorder, Board of Review and County Clerk.Prospective tenants in Wisconsin can use the TenantResourceCenter.com for similar information and landlord reviews., From the national website BBB.org, you can search for your local Better Business Bureau chapter. Then find out if there have been any complaints filed recently about the landlord or the apartment complex."

Check with the applicable state agency for any tenant complaints.,
Contact the Attorney General or Secretary of State consumer affairs office.",How to Check a Landlord Reference3," Visit your local police station and ask to speak with someone about the landlord. Try to find out if there are excessive police calls to the building or complex, or if there has been a history of problems with the landlord individually. While the police may not be able to divulge private information about an individual, the police log of calls for a specific address is usually public record., Visit the county court or registry of deeds for your prospective apartment. County real estate records are open to the public. You should be able to use the property address to verify the ownership of the property or find out if there is any pending legal action.Verifying ownership is important to make sure that you are not being caught is some kind of scam. It is rare, but scams occasionally arise in which people pretend to be landlords, collect a month’s rent and security deposit, and then disappear.

, Go to the court and check the list of cases filed in the past few months. This is often available online, and you can search by name for either plaintiff or defendant.If you find a high number of cases filed against your landlord as defendant, you should be concerned that so many people have problems with him or her.
If you find a high number of cases filed by the landlord as plaintiff, this should raise concern that the landlord is quick to move for eviction or take other legal action.

, Most states have a real estate board or other state or local office that will accept and investigate complaints against landlords. Find out what office covers this in your area and check on your landlord or apartment building.


For example, in New York, tenants may file complaints with the New York Tenant Harassment Prevention Task Force., As a catchall, the Attorney General’s office or Secretary of State usually accept complaints from residents of the state on a wide variety of consumer affairs. This would include problems between tenants and landlords. Check with these offices to find out if the complaints are a matter of public record, or if you can search by name for your prospective landlord.


The California Attorney General’s office has a website that accepts complaints from tenants.The Minnesota Attorney General has a website that contains information about tenants’ rights and accepts complaints about landlords."

, While there might be the same store in a different state or country, they may have a different rule on how they process coupons.


Always research on the store's coupon redeeming value. This is very important, as some stores double the value of coupons up to 99 cents or higher, while others triple the value. Certain stores have policies that they do not multiply the value. People whom reside in triple regional areas may get things for a small amount to free easier and more often than people that reside in places that don't have any multiplied value.

, Stacking is when a person applies a store coupon with a manufacturer coupon. Drug stores and super-centers, such as Walgreens and Target, have their own store coupons. If applicable with their coupon policy, these coupons can be used along with a valid manufacturer coupon. Many grocery stores may provide their own store coupons from special booklets (more commonly found during the holidays) or along with your receipt.

, These are the store's ""loss leaders"", or items that are below their normal store price. Holiday items, such as canned cranberry sauce, chocolate chips, potato chips, etc. will go at their lowest price.

, Either on an index card or on an envelope, make a list of the items you are planning to get and the coupons they match with. You can also do calculations on the side, which gives you an idea of what you're intending to pay for each.

Choose the pet you want to adopt.,

Submit appropriate documentation to your landlord.,
Update your renter's insurance.,
Follow the rules in the addendum.",How to Add a Pet to Your Lease," Although you shouldn't necessarily bring your new pet home before you talk to your landlord, you should have a good idea of the kind of pet you want.


Certain kinds of animals may be prohibited, either by your lease or by state law. Check your state law before you decide to adopt an exotic pet, particularly animals such as weasels, raccoons, or foxes that are typically classified as wildlife rather than as domesticated animals.Additionally, some landlords have breed or size restrictions that could limit your ability to adopt certain dogs or cats.If you're thinking about getting a dog, you might consider obedience training. Especially if you have a relatively small apartment or rental unit, this can provide both you and your landlord with confidence that the animal will be well-behaved.Keep in mind that it's not illegal for a landlord to discriminate against certain breeds or types of animals allowed. Additionally, just because other tenants have pets doesn't mean the landlord has to allow you to have one too.;
, While your landlord is generally prohibited by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) from refusing to allow a service animal, he or she can prohibit pets without restriction.If you require the assistance of a service animal due to a documented disability, your animal is not classified as a ""pet"" and must be allowed regardless of your landlord's pet policy.Service animals are those who are trained to provide assistance directly related to their owners' disabilities. A seeing-eye dog is a common example of service animals covered under the ADA.Even if you don't have a qualified disability under the ADA, the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) may require your landlord to allow your pet if you have a recognized condition such as depression and your health care provider has recommended the animal for emotional support and companionship.To fall under the FHA's requirements, you generally must have a documented and verifiable mental or psychiatric condition or disability. This typically means you should get a written letter from your psychiatrist or therapist detailing your need for emotional support and companionship from the animal., The lease you signed may have clauses regarding your landlord's process for adding a pet to your lease.


If your lease discusses pets, it may have restrictions regarding the types or numbers of pets you're allowed to have. Make sure the pet you plan to adopt fits within these restrictions.
Even if your lease clearly states that pets are not allowed, you may be able to make a case for a particular animal and get your landlord to agree to make an exception to the policy. However, keep in mind that you've already signed indicating your agreement to that restriction.Keep in mind that most leases will state that you cannot have a pet without the landlord's prior written permission. If you get a pet without first talking to your landlord, you could be evicted for violating your lease – even if most other tenants have pets themselves., Schedule a time when you can sit down and discuss your new pet with your landlord before you bring the animal home.It's important to talk to your landlord beforehand, since bringing an animal into your unit before you've signed a pet addendum probably will violate your current lease.Keep in mind that generally your current lease cannot be changed unless you do so in writing and it is signed by both you and your landlord.If your landlord is on the fence about whether to allow you to add a pet to your lease, you might consider inviting him or her to meet your new pet. Your landlord might be more willing to negotiate if he or she sees that the animal is clean and well-behaved.You also might consider offering to cover any damage your pet causes, or to pay for additional cleaning services when you move out.If your landlord doesn't allow pets, ask him or her why. If you know your landlord's concerns, you may be able to provide more specific accommodations., If your landlord requires you to pay an additional deposit or monthly pet rent, you have a right to know what types of damages that money is intended to cover.


Don't be afraid to negotiate the landlord's proposed payments. If you think they are exorbitant, you may be able to get them decreased.Learning the costs for which your landlord plans to use the money can help you negotiate lower rates. For example, if your landlord requires an additional pet deposit to cover potential costs of extermination, you may be able to get this amount reduced by agreeing to provide proof that your pet is regularly treated for common pests such as fleas.
Types of payments also may be negotiable. For example, your landlord may propose a non-refundable pet deposit, but you may be able to convince her to let you pay less, or to make the deposit refundable, provided you complete certain cleaning tasks such as steam-cleaning the carpet when you move out.

, Having a record of anything your landlord requires from you before you bring your new pet home protects both you and your landlord.


If you've negotiated anything with your landlord that differs from his or her standard pet policy, make sure you get that in writing as well. That way if the landlord later gives you a standard addendum to sign, you have something in writing to back up your claim that the two of you negotiated different terms.

, If your landlord agrees to let you have a pet, any requirements should be embodied in a written addendum to your lease.Don't let your landlord intimidate you or keep you from reading the addendum before you sign it. Once you both sign the addendum it will be legally enforceable, so you are perfectly within your rights to read it and understand it before you sign.If you see anything in the addendum that wasn't previously discussed, ask about it. It may be a mistake, but if so, it should be corrected before you sign the addendum. For example, you may have negotiated a lower pet deposit than the landlord normally charges, but he forgot to change the standard form to reflect that agreement before he gave it to you.
Make sure your new pet is correctly identified in the addendum by breed or type, species, age, gender, and size.If your original lease contains a ""no pets"" clause, make sure that clause is specifically referenced in the addendum. You also may want to have your landlord cross out and initial the clause in your original lease to indicate it is no longer effective.If you've signed a written lease and your landlord does not provide you with a written addendum to add your pet to your lease, the original lease has not been changed. In this situation, you may want to draft your own addendum and provide it to your landlord to sign.
To draft your own addendum, simply reference your original lease, for example by saying ""This addendum applies to the lease entered between Tenant and Landlord on ."" Then outline the agreement exactly as you and your landlord have discussed, including details about your pet and the amounts you will pay (if any) for the privilege of keeping your pet in your unit, as well as any responsibilities such as cleaning up after your pet that you agree to undertake under the addendum.For example, you might write ""Landlord agrees to allow Tenant to keep one dog, a Chihuahua named Spike, in her unit for the remainder of the lease. Tenant has paid an additional $200 refundable damage deposit and will pay $10 a month in pet rent. Tenant agrees to keep Spike on a leash when he is outside and to clean up his droppings appropriately."", Since your landlord's understanding of the addendum's provisions may differ from what you believe they say, getting your landlord's explanation ensures you're both on the same page.


If you and your landlord disagree on the meaning of a particular clause or passage, repeat his or her words back to make sure you understand. For example, you could say something like ""What I hear you saying is that this requires me to keep my pet in a crate or on a leash whenever it is outside the apartment."" This ensures you fully understand the landlord's requirements and your responsibilities under the addendum.

, Your landlord may require the payment of an additional security deposit, monthly pet fees in addition to your regular rent, or both.


If an additional security deposit is required, make sure the addendum specifies the damages this money is intended to cover and whether it is refundable., The written addendum must be signed and dated by both you and your landlord to be valid.After you and your landlord have signed the addendum, your landlord cannot change his or her mind later and decide pets are no longer allowed as long as your lease is still in effect.When you and your landlord have signed, make sure you get at least one copy of the addendum for your records.

, Even if your landlord doesn't strictly require it, you want to make sure the animal is in good health and isn't going to carry fleas or other pests into your home.


If you've adopted a dog or cat, have the animal spayed or neutered if this hasn't already been done. Even if the landlord doesn't require it, doing so will minimize potential damage to the property and demonstrate that you're a responsible pet owner.Get a letter from the vet stating that your pet has been treated for pests and is up-to-date on all vaccines., Your landlord may require proof of state-required vaccinations such as rabies before your animal is allowed on the property.


Some types of pets may require specific licenses or inoculation to comply with your state and local ordinances or health codes.Most states require dogs, cats, and some other animals to receive regular rabies vaccinations.Your landlord may require proof of those vaccinations for his or her records.
If you're required to provide your landlord with vaccination or license statements, give him or her a copy – keep the original for your own records. You also should ask for a written statement from your landlord acknowledging receipt of any required documentation regarding your pet.

, If your landlord requires renter's insurance, you may have to raise your liability coverage for certain types of pets.


For example, if there are concerns or reason to fear that the pet might injure someone, you may be required to include that animal on your liability insurance or carry additional insurance to protect the landlord in the event he or she is sued.If you don't already have renter's insurance, you may be required to purchase it if you want to add a pet to your lease., To avoid violating your lease, make sure you comply with any requirements set forth in the addendum.


Typically your landlord cannot change the rules while the lease contract remains in effect. If your landlord states that your pet is a nuisance, or attempts to charge additional fees or add requirements that weren't included in the addendum you signed, you may want to consult an attorney to help you protect your legal rights as a tenant.Many animal welfare organizations such as local branches of the SPCA or the Humane Society offer services for landlords and tenants, including free mediation services to help resolve disputes over pets.Avoid complaints while you live there by taking care of your pet and cleaning up after it. For example, if you take you dog outside, make sure you pick up the animal's droppings and place them in a dumpster or trash can rather than leaving them on the ground where a neighbor could step in them.
Remember that regardless of any specific rules contained in the addendum, your lease generally requires you to be a good tenant and respect your neighbors. Your pet is not allowed to disturb the health, safety, or quiet enjoyment of other tenants anymore than you are."

Bitcoin are not regulated or controlled by a central authority like the Federal Reserve and all Bitcoin transactions take place in an online marketplace, where users are anonymous and untraceable for the most part.Bitcoin allows you to exchange money instantly with anybody in the world, without needing to create a merchant account, or use a bank or financial institution
Transferring money does not require names meaning there is little risk of identity theft.;
, To understand Bitcoin, it is important to understand Bitcoin mining, which is the process by which Bitcoin are created. While mining is complex, the basic idea is that each time a Bitcoin transaction is made between two people, the transaction is logged digitally by computers in a transaction log that describes all the details of the transaction (like the time, and who owns how many Bitcoins).These transactions are then shared publicly into something known as a ""block chain"", which states every transaction, and who owns every bitcoin.
Bitcoin miners are individuals who own computers that constantly verify the block chain to ensure it is correct and up to date. They are the individuals that confirm transactions, and in exchange for doing so, they are paid in bitcoin, which increases the supply.
Since Bitcoin is not overseen by a central authority, mining ensures that the individual transferring the bitcoin has enough, that the agreed upon amount is transferred, and that the balance for each member of the transaction is correct afterwards, Recently, the federal agency responsible for combating money laundering announced new guidelines for virtual currencies. The updated guidelines will regulate Bitcoin exchanges, but will leave the rest of the Bitcoin economy alone, for now.


The Bitcoin network is resistant to government regulation, and it has gained a loyal following among people who engage in illegal activities like drug dealing and gambling due to the fact money can be exchanged anonymouslyFederal law enforcement may eventually conclude that Bitcoin is a money-laundering tool and may look for ways to shut it down. Shutting down Bitcoin completely would be a challenge, but intense federal regulation could push the system underground. This would then diminish the value of Bitcoins as legitimate currency.

, Bitcoins major advantages include low fees, protection from identity theft, protection from payment fraud, and immediate settlement.Low fees: Unlike using traditional finance systems, whereby the system itself (like PayPal or a bank) is compensated with a fee, Bitcoin bypasses this entire system. The Bitcoin network is maintained by the miners, who are compensated with new Bitcoin.

Protection from identity theft: Bitcoin usage does not require a name, or any other personal information, simply an ID for your digital wallet (the means used to send and receive Bitcoin). Unlike a credit card, where the merchant has full access to your ID and credit line, Bitcoin users operate totally anonymously.

Protection against payment fraud: Because Bitcoin are digital, they cannot be counterfeited, which protects against payment fraud. In addition, transactions cannot be reversed, like what occurs with a credit card charge back.

Immediate transfer and settlement. Traditionally when money is transferred, it involves significant delays, holds, or other hassles. The lack of a third party means that money can be transferred directly between people with ease, and it without complexities, delays , and fees associated with making purchases between parties that are using different currencies and providers.

, With traditional banking, if someone makes a fraudulent transaction on your credit card or your bank goes belly-up, there are laws in place to limit consumer losses. Unlike traditional banks, Bitcoin does not have a safety net in place if your Bitcoins are lost or stolen. There is no intermediary power to reimburse you for any lost or stolen Bitcoins.Keep in mind the Bitcoin network is not immune to hackers, and the average Bitcoin account is not completely secured against hacking or security breaches.One study found 18 of 40 businesses offering to exchange bitcoins into other currencies have gone out of business, with only six exchanges reimbursing their customers.
Price volatility is also a major downside. This means that the price of Bitcoin in dollars fluctuates wildly. For example, in 2013, 1 Bitcoin was worth about US$13. It then quickly moved to over US$1200, and is now approximately US$573 (as of 2016/08/28). This means if you are converting to Bitcoin, it is important to stay in it, as moving back to USD could result in a significant loss of funds. , One of Bitcoins popular uses is as an investment, and this deserves a special word of caution before proceeding. The main risk of investing in Bitcoin is it's extreme volatility. With prices moving rapidly up and down, the risk of loss is substantial.


In addition, because Bitcoin's value is determined by supply and demand, should Bitcoin end up being subject to government regulation in any form, it could reduce the amount of people who want to use Bitcoin, which could theoretically make the currency worthless., In order to buy Bitcoins, you first need to create a storage site for your Bitcoins, and this is the first step to purchasing Bitcoin. Currently, there are two ways you can store Bitcoins online:Store the keys to your Bitcoins in an online wallet. The wallet is a computer file that will store your money, similar to a real wallet. You can create a wallet by installing the Bitcoin client, which is software which powers the currency. However, if your computer is hacked by a virus or hackers or if you misplace the files, you may lose your Bitcoins. Always back up your wallet to an external hard drive to avoid losing your Bitcoins.
Store your Bitcoins via a third party. You can also create a wallet by using an online wallet via a third party site like Coinbase or blockchain.info, which will store your Bitcoins in the cloud. This is easier to set up, but you will be trusting a third party with your Bitcoins. These sites are two of the larger and more reliable third party sites, but there are no guarantees about the security of these sites.

, One of the most popular and cheapest options for keeping your Bitcoins safe is a paper wallet. The wallet is small, compact, and made of paper that has a code. One of the benefits of a paper wallet is the private keys to the wallet are not stored digitally. So it cannot be subject to cyber attacks or hardware failures.Several online sites offer paper Bitcoin wallet services. They can generate a Bitcoin address for you and create an image containing two QR codes. One is the public address you can use to receive Bitcoins and the other is a private key, which you can use to spend Bitcoins stored at that address.
The image is printed on a long piece of paper that you can then fold in half and carry with you.

, Hard-wire wallets are very limited in number and can be difficult to acquire. They are dedicated devices that can hold private keys electronically and facility payments. Hard-wire wallets are usually small and compact and some are shaped like USB sticks.The Trezor hard-wire wallet is ideal for Bitcoin miners who want to acquire large numbers of Bitcoins, but do not want to rely on third party sites.
The compact Ledger Bitcoin wallet acts as USB storage for your Bitcoins and uses smartcard security. It is one of the more affordable hardwire wallets on the market.

, Obtaining Bitcoin through an exchange is the easiest way to obtain Bitcoin. An exchange works like any other currency exchange: You simply register and convert whatever your currency is into Bitcoin. There are hundreds of available exchanges, and the best exchange option depends on where you are located, but the more well known exchange services include:


CoinBase: This popular wallet and exchange service will also trade US dollars and euros for Bitcoins. The company has web and mobile apps for more convenient Bitcoin buying and trading.
Circle: This exchange service offers users the ability to store, send, receive, and exchange Bitcoins. Currently, only US citizens are able to link their bank accounts to deposit funds.
Xapo: This wallet and Bitcoin debit card provider offers deposits in fiat currency that are then converted to Bitcoin in your account.
Some exchange services allow you to also trade Bitcoins. Other exchange services act as wallet services with limited buying and selling capabilities. Most exchanges and wallets will store amounts of digital or fiat currency for you, much like a regular bank account. Exchanges and wallets are a good option if you want to engage in regular trading and don’t need total anonymity. , When signing up for an exchange service, you will need to provide personal information to the service to create an account. Most countries legally require any individual or financial system using a Bitcoin exchange service to meet anti-money laundering requirements.Though you are required to provide proof of your identity, exchanges and wallets do not provide the same protection that banks do. You are not protected against hackers, or given reimbursement if the exchange goes out of business.

, Once you set up your account via an exchange service, you will need to link it to an existing bank account and arrange to move funds between it and your new Bitcoin account. This will usually be done via a wire transfer and entails a fee.Some exchanges allow you to make a deposit in person to their bank account. This will be done face to face, rather than through an ATM.
If you are required to link to a bank account to use the exchange service, it will likely only admit banks from the country where the exchange service is based. Some exchanges allow you to transfer money to overseas accounts, but the fees will be much higher and there may be a delay changing the Bitcoins back into local currency.

, You can arrange a meet up and negotiate prices for the Bitcoins. The site also has an added layer of protection for both parties., If you are not comfortable with one on one trades, use Meetup.com to look for a Bitcoin meetup group. You can all then decide to buy bitcoins as a group and learn from other members who have used sellers to buy Bitcoins before., Depending on the seller, you may pay a premium of around 5-10% over the exchange price for a face-to-face trade. You can check the current Bitcoin exchange rates online via http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/ before agreeing to the seller’s rate.You should also ask the seller if they prefer to be paid in cash or via an online payment service. Some seller may allow you to use a PayPal account to pay, though most seller prefer non-reversible cash as payment.
A reputable trader will always negotiate the price with you before you meet up. Many will not wait too long to meet up once the price is finalized, in case Bitcoin’s value takes a dramatic shift.

, Avoid meeting in private homes. You should take all the precautions, especially if you are carrying cash on you to pay the seller for the coins., When you meet the seller face-to-face, you will need to access your Bitcoin wallet via your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. You will also need Internet access to confirm the transaction has gone through. Always check that the Bitcoin has been transferred into your account before you pay the seller., Bitcoin ATMs are a relatively new concept, but they are growing in number. You can use an online Bitcoin ATM map to find an ATM near you.Many institutions around the world now offer Bitcoin ATMs, from universities to local banks.

, Most Bitcoin ATMs only accept cash, as they are not set up to process debit or credit card transactions., Then, scan your mobile wallet QR code or access the codes needed from your account via your smartphone to load bitcoins onto your wallet.Exchange rates at Bitcoin ATMS can vary from 3% to 8% on top of the standard exchange price.

Store coupons work exactly like manufacturer ones, but only valid at the specific store. It needs to state the item and weight/size, if applicable. Many times, a store might base a unique coupon off the bar code numbers or the wording if it says ""Manufacturer"" or ""Store"" on it.

You have a manufacturer coupon, ""Save $1.00 on 1 Tide Laundry Detergent"".
You have a store coupon, ""Save $1.50 on any one laundry detergent"".
Combining these two coupons, you are saving an additional $2.50 and your final price would be $5.49. You're spending at minimum $0.11 per load, while using the manufacturer coupon alone would be $0.16 per load, the sale price is $0.17 per load, and the regular price is at $0.29 per load.

, Something that comes with individualized sections already does half the work for you. You can place labels on each of the tabs in the sorting system that you choose.


Accordion files now come in all sorts of shapes and colors; some are plastic and bendy and others are more like a box. Think about the volume of your coupons and what your needs are.
Use a small accordion check file for your purse or a clutch. That way when you go to the store, you're not carrying around all of your coupons.

The downside to an accordion-style coupon organizer is the accessibility of the coupons. Because coupons are merely stacked on top of one another within each category, they are difficult to see and often stick together.



, One of the most popular methods of organizing coupons is in a binder. With fewer coupons, they virtually collapse. With more, they expand to just about as big as you need. If you're serious about couponing, get a 3"" or 5"" binder -- the 1 inch (2.5 cm) ones just won't do.


Use trading card sheets. They keep all your coupons separate and easy to reference. You can find these at toy stores, hobby shops, or sporting good stores.This style of coupon organizer allows your stash of coupons to be easily viewed, readily accessible and simple to take into the store. The downside to this system of coupon organizing is the bulk of the binder.



, Since couponing has become so trendy, products and companies have sprung up as a result. Now you can find little gadgets dedicated just for coupon organizing.


Most coupon organizers have pages for shopping lists, a coupon stacker section, a coupon tracker section, scissors with a blunt tip, and a carrying bag., Surprisingly, couponing isn't just about coupons. You need more than just your system to stay on top of things. Couponing is a lifestyle and you'll need everything to be as easy as possible.


Keep scissors with your system. Otherwise they'll be easy to lose as a family member or roommate may misplace them. What's more, keep a pen and paper handy. You may need to write a grocery list, take notes on stacking or plan meals.

Magazines are also available at the doctor’s or dentist office, so you can look through them while you are waiting.

, Electronic coupons – these are issued after your purchases have been checked out at the register. When the cashier gives you the receipt, check the front and back of the receipt. Coupons can be part of the receipt, which can be used on your next purchase.

Sort them by category.,
Sort them by store.,
Sort them alphabetically.,
Sort by expiration date.,
Decide whether to clip or not to clip.",How to Organize Coupons2," Even once you decide to sort by category, there's still a bit of wiggle room. Your categories can be whatever you choose -- aisle, product type, or how often you buy.


Examples include ""dairy/frozen,"" ""paper products/cleaning products"" and a category dedicated to drinks and snacks. This method used to organize coupons allows you to focus on a specific category of products if your trip to the store is for a few items only.

If your coupons are in order by aisle, you are less apt to forget important items on your list. Think about how you meander through the store as you organize.



, If you have a bunch of stores you frequent, this may be the method for you. if you sit down on Sunday mornings with the newspaper, it's pretty easy to grab each store's ad and file away accordingly.


Generally this method should only be used if the number of stores you frequent is greater than the coupons you use at each store. If not, you'll wind up with 50 coupons in each section and have to sift through them to get to the ones you want.

, You can do this either by brand name or by product type. This can be easy to flip through if you're shopping for a specific product. However, this also may be a bit more difficult if you have a lot of coupons on your hands.You also may need a lot more tabs. If you try this method, you may need to refine your system by adding more space for the common letters and take out the tabs that don't get used.

, If you want to get the most bang for your buck, you'll want to use every coupon before it expires. Organizing by expiration date may help you plan meals in addition to saving money.


The main downside to this system is that sometimes expiration dates are long into the future. Your coupons will stack up and you may be looking at months and months and stacks and stacks of coupons.

, Whether it is nobler in the binder to include the width and length of the entire sheet or to take scissors against the border of the sales and by cutting make them smaller. Some couponers swear that filing away the entire insert saves them time and thus money. Others say it's just too bulky and nonsensical. You decide which way feels right for you.


The pros of not clipping: You don't clip any coupons you won't use, so you never have to waste time clipping something that will later just get thrown away and you won't accidentally throw away a coupon that, at the time, you didn't think you'd use but now discover an awesome deal where it could be used, and wish you had saved it.The cons? You'll spend more time right before a shopping trip getting ready, since you'll have to retrieve and clip specific coupons at that time. And to the extent you also collect and use loose coupons, such as printable coupons, blinkies, catalinas, peelies, etc., you'll need to keep track of these coupons too, and since they aren't in an insert you'll have to create a separate organization system to organize coupons from these categories. In addition, because expiration dates differ, you'll be holding onto some inserts for a very, very long time."
"
Clean out the expired coupons.,
Compare grocery store prices.,
Get into stacking.",How to Organize Coupons3," You'll be sifting through piles and piles of ads if you don't routinely clean out your binder/filing system. As the coupons expire, throw out the ones you haven't used -- you'll be carrying around fewer and notice which products you aren't buying.


Set aside a time each week to coupon and throw out. Getting into a routine will help you stay organized. Saturday and Sunday mornings make the most sense, as ads are greater on those two days.
Send the expired ones to the troops. They can use coupons up to 6 months past the expiration date., As you get into this, it'll benefit you to know what the base prices are. A coupon for a product at one store may be the retail price at another. You'll be able to toss out coupons that really don't save you any money.


Take a spreadsheet (or grab a grocery price book) when you go on your shopping quest. Write down the prices of the products you buy most often. Soon enough, getting the best deals will become a breeze.

, So your coupons are organized in the manner of your choosing, but what about stacking? If you find manufacturer's and store coupons, sometimes they both can be used, doubling your savings.


If it appeals to you, deem a section just for this purpose. It should be the first section you go to if you're trying to see how much money you can save.

, You may have purchased the same brand of spaghetti sauce your entire life, but that manufacturer may not put out as many coupons as its competitor.

, Coupons are generally valid for a range of dates. Sometimes, you will receive multiple coupons at the same time that are valid for different date ranges.

, You will save more if you use the coupon that gives you a higher percentage off for the higher priced product. For example, if you have two coupons that give 50% and 40% off respectively, and you plan to buy two products for $10 and $5 respectively, use the 50% coupon for the $10 product and the 40% coupon for the $5 product. This way, you will save $5 and $2 respectively for a total of $7 off. If these are reversed, you would only save $4 and $2.50 for just $6.50 in savings.

Define your company image.,
Create a brand.,
Choose a specialty.,
Determine a marketing budget.",How to Market a Real Estate Company1," How you choose to market your real estate company will have a major impact on the clients you attract, your volume of business, and how you conduct business on the whole. Ask yourself some of the questions below and try to look at your company through the eyes of potential clients.Who is your target audience? Are you trying to attract first-time home buyers, small business owners, growing families, or some other group?
What are your business strengths? How can you capitalize on these? What about your weaknesses? How might you improve these?
Where do you want your business to be in a year? Five years? Ten years? Try to see the big picture and determine whether a large investment in advertising is a practical option.
What types of real estate are you selling? It might not make sense to go all-out on pricey advertisements if your average home sale/purchase price is $100K, for example.;
, If your company doesn't already have one, develop a logo or other visual element to go along with your visual media marketing. Your brand will be an identifying symbol by which your target market will come to recognize you.Make sure your brand suits your target clientele. For instance, it will be especially important to develop an elegant and tasteful logo if you are aiming to attract a wealthy or elderly subset of the population, whereas something more catchy or bold might be more appropriate for bringing in younger clients.
If you already have a logo, consider how it might be improved and the sunk cost involved in updating it (such as the money you've already spent on print ads or billboards).
If you are not the artistic or visual type, consider hiring a consulting artist or designer to spruce up your brand image.
Use your brand in all real estate advertising and marketing; this includes print, television broadcast, and online ads. You want your brand to become synonymous with your company.

, If you don't already have a specialty, consider selecting a category of real estate on which you'd like to focus your business. This can be anything you are qualified to do, from beachside bungalows to 50,000 square foot commercial buildings. Having a specialty can help you narrow down your marketing efforts.For many businesses both within and outside real estate, the key to success is finding and filling a niche. Do some research to find out whether any market subgroups are underrepresented by real estate companies in your area. If demand is high enough, you can benefit by tailoring your company to this gap in the market.
You may find that marketing your company becomes easier once you've identified a niche. This is because even a small amount of advertisement can alert interested clientele to your existence if you are the only game in town.
Having a niche can also help you to target your marketing efforts. For example, if you are a buyer's agent brokerage, then you might want to advertise on TV or have a first time buyers seminar.
Keep in mind that your niche should be something you have experience and special training or education to help you be successful. You can also use your credentials in advertisements for your services.

, Assess your company's resources and the cost of various advertising options. This will help you settle on a budget for marketing that will be enough to get your brand out there without bankrupting you. Consider also what and who you are up against to avoid being overshadowed by larger, more visible competitors.


Be sure to take into account your target clientele and their habits. For example, don't spend $10K on local cable television ads if you are targeting young adults fresh out of college, as a large portion of them are not likely regularly watching cable TV. Do some research on advertising strategies suited to your target market.
Consider consulting a financial analyst or accountant (or your company's in-house finance representative) if you are not sure how to set an appropriate marketing budget. An appropriate marketing budget is usually between 7 to 10% of your annual income. If you do not yet have an annual income because you are just starting out, then get business cards and hand them out to everyone you meet.
Keep in mind that there are many free advertising options available to you as well, such as by using social media and posting on online listing sites such as Craigslist. Consider all of your possibilities for free advertising as you plan your approach.
If necessary, look into business loan options to boost your advertising funds.

To do this, contact your local newspaper by phone or email, which is usually provided in the newspaper's advertisements section.
Although they usually cost more, newspaper ads with pictures (or at least featuring a brand logo) will be much more likely to be noticed and remembered by readers.
Again, consider your audience. If you want to reach young buyers, newspaper print ads might not be the way to go. In addition, newspaper ads are a shotgun approach and the majority of readers may not be potential customers.
Newspaper ads may be cheap, but are not as targeted as other approaches.

This tells potential clients looking to sell that you have already successfully handled similar deals in their area.In your mailer, highlight one or two specific homes sold by your clients and provide basic information about the house(s). Images are a plus!
Have your solicitations professionally designed and printed on heavy duty card stock or photo paper to convey a professional image to potential clients.
Don't forget to include several means by which your company may be contacted. At a minimum, this should include a phone number, email, and business address.
Consider including a photo of yourself on the mailer next to the company contact information. This might help recipients see the ad as more personal and make them less likely to toss it away before reading it.

, These kinds of ads can appear on anything from coffee shop flyers to freeway billboards and should be visually appealing, simple, and informative. Your approach should take into account your company's marketing budget, your clientele, and your real estate niche, if applicable.


Since many public advertisements will only be seen for a few seconds at a time by passersby, you should make your brand and contact information large and noticeable. Make sure that any pictures in the ad are colorful and not confusing to the eye as well. Also, be aware of the federal fair housing guidelines when you are planning your ads.
Make sure you comply with any state and/or local laws and regulations regarding business advertisement, such as being required to print licensing or brokerage information on the ad itself.
To get in touch with the proper individuals for setting up visual marketing arrangements, check online for advertising information pertaining to the exact location, agency, or business where you wish to have your ad displayed.

, Create signs that can be placed at intersections or neighborhood entrances while the properties currently listed with your company are on the market. This will not only help promote your brand, but also could help you make a sale! Use the following tips to help draw attention to your signage:


First, you must include a provision for your sign in the sale contract, so that the homebuyer can approve its placement.
Be sure to check local restrictions on the use of signs.
Keep the design simple and easy to read by limiting it to two or three contrasting (and eye-grabbing) colors.
Avoid using images on these signs other than your company brand so basic company information can more easily be seen in a matter of a few seconds by passing motorists.
For calm weather days, consider tying colorful balloons or other attention-grabbing objects to your signs to increase their visibility.
Be sure to retrieve portable signs at the end of a showing, even if you plan to put them up again the next morning. This will keep them from being stolen or vandalized overnight (and protects your investment, however small).

, These can be the most expensive types of marketing campaigns, but often reach the largest audiences. However, consider that only a very small portion of this audience may be potential clients. You will need to contact a cable or broadcasting company in your area (the specific radio or television station you are considering) to ask about your options. Consider public access TV or radio if you cannot afford private channel broadcasting costs.Design an ad that is memorable and that will resonate with your target audience. You can come up with a short tune ('jingle') or slogan to help accomplish this, or hire someone with experience in this area to assist you.
Be sure to feature an informative, concise speech about your company and its services in your ad. If you are not a good speaker, find someone who is and put them in the ad instead.
Repeat important contact information such as your web address and phone number so viewers/listeners can take note of it.
Consider incorporating a gimmick or tasteful joke into your ad that will grab the attention of inattentive audiences, but only if this fits your brand image and target clientele.

Develop a website.,
Use social networking.,
Share testimonials.,
Draw attention to your company using online tools.",How to Market a Real Estate Company3," Your site should be user friendly and should be set up to include an internet data exchange (IDX) or Multiple Listing Service (MLS) feed that allows prospective clients to search listings anonymously without needing to contact you. These systems allow your website to stay current and gives customers the freedom to research your listings without pressure from an agent.


In the modern real estate market, a strong internet presence is critical to be competitive and successful. Having a poorly-designed or infrequently-updated website can cost you business and even gain you a reputation for incompetence. Avoid this pitfall by making your website a marketing priority.
Consider hiring a web developer to design your website if you do not have website programming knowledge or experience. This can be a tricky thing to accomplish without the proper know-how. Considering the importance of having a functioning website, this is probably a worthwhile investment.
Make certain your website implements search engine optimization (SEO). This is a means of ensuring that your website will show up high on major search engine results lists.Make it easy for visitors to your website to contact you. Don't bury your phone number or email address under three levels of page tabs; put this information at the top or bottom of the website's front page.
Consider including a lead capture system on your website along with a backend database. This will allow you to develop a drip campaign and/or send out general information.

, Much like having a good website, social media is becoming an essential element of business marketing in the 21st century. While the importance of having a social media presence may vary depending upon your target market, there is no denying that the quickest way to spread information about your business is through social media.


Go to where your clients are. Whether it's Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, or some other hot new site, find out what your target clientele are using, create a profile, and use it every day. You can share images and listings on these sites as you build a network of connections, each of whom could later become clients. You can also add the IDX search feature on Facebook so that people can search for homes on your Facebook page.
Stay up to date on social networking tools like Flowtown.com or Ping.fm that save you time by updating all your social networking accounts at the same time.
While it might be a good idea to have some fun with your social media accounts, be careful to keep your posts tasteful and free of political or social statements. You don't want to alienate potential clients!

, Given the high user traffic on websites and in social media, one of the fastest ways to spread positive testimonials to potential clients is to post them to your web site and/or social networking sites. This shows others that you are capable of satisfying your clients.


When choosing to post testimonials from former clients, be sure to first obtain written permission from the author to post their statement(s) online.
If you don't already have testimonials you can use, ask satisfied clients to provide some specifically for the purpose of sharing them online. Be sure to obtain their permission first, such as by having them sign a permission form, and specify where their names will appear as well, such as on presentations, emails, or regular mail.
Set up a Yelp business profile and encourage previous clients to write reviews and post ratings of your business there.

, There are a host of online mediums that can add visibility and legitimacy to your company's image. A few examples are listed below:


Post video tours of current listings to your website and on YouTube. This allows potential clients to view your listings in detail any time of the day or night.
If you are a good speaker with a great deal of real estate knowledge, consider producing webinars and advertise them on your website and social media accounts. This will reassure potential clients that you are knowledgeable and qualified to meet their needs. To check out how this works, research webinar systems online.
Blog about real estate. Put your career expertise to work by blogging about real estate issues and developments, and personal experiences. Don't forget to post the link to your blog on your company website and share new entries on social media!

Build networks.,
Keep in touch with past clients.,
Offer referral incentives.,
Send a thank you to those who send clients your way.",How to Market a Real Estate Company4," The key to gaining a sizable client base is getting the word out to as many people as possible about your business. To do this, ask everyone you know to spread the word about your business to their personal contacts whenever possible.Form mutually-beneficial relationships with other Realtors. While you shouldn't expect your competitors to direct their own potential clients to you, it could be very useful to have a contact who specializes in a different kind of real estate sales or lives in another city. This way, she can send clients your way without losing any business herself, and you can do the same for her.
Make sure to update your address and other contact information on Google so people can easily find you. This will also allow people to use GPS navigation to get to your office and identify your office as one of the ones that may be close to them.
Realtors may be willing to work with you on transactions because all parties will benefit. Real estate commissions are often shared by the listing broker, the broker representing the seller, and the broker representing the buyer.
Politely ask friends and family members to tell their own friends, families, and coworkers about your business. Having people who know you well vouch for you and your company can go a long way toward gaining new clients.
Ask past clients to tell everyone they know about their experience working with you (especially if the transaction went smoothly). Most people are happy to refer their friends and families to businesses with which they have had positive experiences.

, Even if your clients had a great experience with you, their tendency to bring up your company when talking with their friends and families will fade with time. Maintain fairly regular correspondence with old clients so they will continue to spread the word about your company.Ask your clients to fill out a short questionnaire with their birthday, contact information, and mail preferences. Keep this information and reference it often so you can send out appropriate correspondence whenever you can (without overdoing it).
Send past clients ""just sold"" email flyers, monthly company newsletters, and holiday/birthday greeting cards. To avoid becoming an annoyance, be sure to get clients' permission to do this first! This is important because you may want to include their names in a variety of different places, such as on listing presentations, other types of print advertising or emails, or regular mail. Have each client sign a permission form that includes their testimonial and that clearly lists the places where their names may appear.
Provide past clients with something of value. For example, you could offer them a yearly free valuation of their property and include a report on the neighborhood trends.

, By having a structured incentive program in place, you can encourage previous clients to send potential clients your way. Be sure to mention the incentive(s) to your clients during the home-buying/selling process and include a pamphlet about it along with the other paperwork they receive at the close of the transaction.Only offer incentives for referrals that result in a successful sale and communicate this clearly to your clients.
You may want to create a structured incentive program that rewards successful referrals according to the sales price of the resulting transaction. For instance, you could offer $10 in Home Depot gift cards for every $10,000 of the home sale that resulted from a referral.

, For each serious potential client you receive through a referral, send a small gift and personalized letter to the person who made the referral (whether or not it results in a successful sale). This will always be appreciated and will improve the chance that a referrer will continue to spread the word about your business.Thank-you gifts for referrals do not need to be expensive or fancy -- A restaurant gift certificate, picture frame, or potted plant will do the trick. It's the gesture that counts!
Hand-write your letter for a personalized feel. Many people find written letters to be more sincere and personal, so opt for this instead of a typed and printed (or emailed) version.

Be patient.",How to Move a Building," Most local governments a require that you to have a pre-moving inspection performed by them. This is to see if the move is feasible, and if the structure can survive the move.;
, Most cities require you to fill an application to move your building, a land survey, and the plans to build a new foundation and secure the structure to it. For the land survey, your will have to show the proposed location, any setbacks, and any other structures on the site. #Gather information about the building you want to move. Anything from photos to blueprints can help the movers determine the best way to move the structure. Look for documents that will help the contractors locate the main posts and beams.If the building is commercial, include information about the existing and proposed uses of the building., Choosing the new location of your building is a very important decision. You will have to examine a site’s natural hazards, utility connections, accessibility for site preparation, and the route between the two sites.One of the main things to consider is property value. Contact a real estate broker to determine if there will be a change in the value of your building.

, See if you can find someone who has moved their building before and see whom they recommend. This will help you get started. Most moving companies in your area will send out a representative to give you an estimate. The representative will determine how feasible the move is by looking at structural soundness, lot accessibility, possible route problems, and the new site location.Selecting a moving company early in the process gives them more time to provide recommendations and important contacts.

, The moving company should have a structural engineer examine both the existing site and the new site. It must be determined if your building can survive being moved. If it cannot, you will have to repair any structural problems before proceeding.The moving company will ask you if you plan on including structural additions such as a porch or garage. Decide what you want to include so that the mover can provide you with an accurate assessment of the total moving costs to relocate your building.

, Usually, you will have to pay utility fees for moving your house. These fees cover wire lifting/removal, railroad crossing, and tree trimming. Additional fees may occur if the house has to cross a park, go through the property of a neighbor, or be transported over water. Depending on where you live and the size of the building, a police or utility escort may be required for the move.Check to see if the building codes in your area require masonry fireplaces/chimneys to come down before the move. Discuss the best way to bring them down with your general contractor.
While most moving companies require you to pay these fees, they will tell you who to contact to make arrangements.

, Get estimates on moving the house, buying the permits, building the new foundation, hiring contractors, route planning, and consulting experts. Moving the building can cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars for a small building or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a large building. Decide if the price is feasible., Contact your local government and ask about all the permits you will need. You will need permits for constructing a foundation at the new site, moving the building, and restoring the old site. You will also need to get a new address for your home.


If your building is older, contact your State Historic Preservation officer before you relocate your building to see if you need any special permits from them.

, Your mortgage company must be notified of any change that affects the address of your house as it appears on the deed. Without their approval, you may have to pay the mortgage in full. Many moving companies have legal contacts to help you move., It’s best to hire a general contractor who can disconnect the services at one location and reconnect them at the new location. A general contractor can handle the plumbing, electrical, foundation, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) contractors. This will relieve a considerable amount of stress from you, as they will take over a considerable amount of planning.


Ask friends or the moving company for general contractor recommendations.
The general contractor will also make sure work done at both the old and new site is up to code.

, Depending on the site you chose, you will have to look at many factors when moving a building. This includes erosion control, grading/clearing, driveway or parking lot construction, construction of a new foundation, and the installation of new utilities. Consult the your general contractor to make sure this process goes smooth.


Foundations provide the support for the building to stand. Some movers will move the building and keep it on a temporary lift if the foundation is not complete. This is more expensive, however, as the movers will have to come back out once the foundation is completed and move the house again.

, While most movers have comprehensive insurance that covers moving the building, you should consider short-term insurance to cover unforeseen problems that the movers cannot cover. For example, there might be existing structural faults that aren't covered by the moving company.

, Most moving companies will provide a comprehensive outline of all parties and contractors and their responsibilities. It is important to review all steps to make sure that every aspect of the move is handled. Talk to the moving company about any concerns you have.

, Your general foreman should be able to take care of this, but you want to make sure you’re not responsible for violating code.

, You may need to hire a landscaper or an excavator to cut down large trees and to remove the roots

, There can be nothing left in these areas. Depending on the size of your building, you can leave the furniture and other items where they are.

, The movers will come and move the house according to the plans. Once they are done, make sure the utilities are turned on at the new site. Check with your general contractor to make sure the old site is cleaned and restored.

, Relocating a structure is a long process with lots of factors affecting it such as environmental conditions, structural concerns, and routes. It’s a long process, but if you need to relocate your structure, it’s worth the time."

Make your property suitable for students.,
Advertise your property.,
Quote the right rent for your student accommodation.,
Hire a real estate agent.",How to Market Your Property as Student Accommodation," Once you have done your advertising right, students will start visiting your property. Whether you are planning to let out one room in your house or simply converting your entire property into a student accommodation, you have to make sure that it comprises of the best facilities. You will be able to attract students if you offer a wide range of amenities.


The most important aspect of a student accommodation is food. If you want to provide meals, you have to first decide the cuisine. Students who belong to different parts of the city or belong to different nationalities will look for home-style cooked meals. Therefore, if you are comfortable in providing only a particular cuisine, let them know in advance. But, if you are ready to provide your tenants with meals of their choice, discuss their food preferences and work out a plan accordingly.
Provide all necessary furniture. You should make sure that the room has a bed, a wardrobe, a table, and a chair. Since students are looking for a homely environment where they can relax and study, it is important that they have basic furniture. Also, when students come visiting your property, you can ask them about their requirements and upgrade the furniture accordingly.
Make sure that your student accommodation has a high-speed internet connection, power backup, hot water facility, and a modern kitchen with necessary appliances, such as a refrigerator and a microwave. Additionally, it is always better to provide students with attached bathrooms so that they don’t have to worry about privacy and personal hygiene. Make sure that the bathroom has good ventilation, proper sanitation facility, and hot and cold water options.;
, This is an important step because you can’t manage to get students unless they know about your property.


List your property online. Since, students are usually internet savvy, they will first search for accommodation online. Look for housing websites and post your ad along with good images. Remember to click good quality pictures of your property that are taken under natural light and offer clarity. Take as many pictures as you can, including the bathroom, kitchen area, lounge, and parking space. This will give students a broader idea about your accommodation.
Post a sign outside your house. This is the easiest step since it just involves putting up an advertisement right outside your house, stating that you want to host students. Often passersby will see the sign and it will help your property get noticed. Alternatively, if you are going to turn your entire property into a student accommodation, you can opt for glow sign boards or non-lit boards.
Use word of mouth publicity. Let your neighbors and friends know that you are looking for student tenants. Sometimes, they will know someone who is looking for a student accommodation and usually such tenants are trustworthy.
Distribute pamphlets in your locality. You can print pamphlets mentioning the details of your student accommodation. Stick to a single leaf pamphlet as students are not interested in reading thick booklets. Make the design attractive and mention more than one phone number so that they can contact you easily. You can also stick pamphlets in and around your locality. However, don’t stick bills in restricted areas. Visit colleges and universities near your area and ask them if you can put up the pamphlet on their notice boards. Usually, students look for accommodation closer to their college or university, so make that the focus of your advertising campaign. Contact the student accommodation department and register yourself so that they can send students over to your house to check the accommodation.

, This is the most crucial step as it can make or break your business venture. You should keep the following salient points in mind before you decide the rental amount:


Understand the budgetary constraints of a college-going student. Since students live on a tight budget, they will look for a budget-friendly accommodation. In such a case, you should quote a reasonable rent. You can remove some amenities if you think you can’t make sufficient profit.
Find out the rent quoted by other student accommodations in your locality. If there are many such rental options in your neighborhood, you’ll face stiff competition. In order to attract more students, you can lower your rent slightly when compared to the other accommodations. Additionally, you can also upgrade the amenities at your house and offer a better lifestyle. This way you will be able to fill in vacant rooms faster than your competitors.
Since this is your home that you are converting into a student accommodation, you can’t change the location. Remember that most students will look for a property that is surrounded by shopping complexes, restaurants, and is easily accessible from other parts of the town. If your property is not situated in such a locality, lower your rent and provide better facilities, since they are the sole selling points of your accommodation. However, if you are planning to buy a property and then convert it into a student accommodation, always choose a locality that has adequate social and civic infrastructure.

, Most real estate brokers cater to a wide range of clients, especially students. You can contact them and discuss your requirements. Since real estate agents have better contacts than yourself, they will be able to find student tenants faster.

Look into seller financing.,
Lease the property with the option to buy.,
Work out a trade.,
Take over mortgage payments.",How to Invest In Real Estate With No Money1," If the seller is motivated enough, s/he may be willing to make it easy for you to purchase by giving you a loan. You could offer to make higher monthly payments instead of a down payment.You could also negotiate a deal where the seller pays your down payment to a traditional lender in order to sell the property faster. The seller might expect you to pay him/her back or s/he may throw the down payment in for free, essentially lowering the selling price.
For each of these scenarios, make sure you have a real estate attorney write up the agreement so that both parties are protected.;
, You can invest in real estate slowly by making payments on a lease agreement until you have the money to buy. Your payments would (at least in part) be credited toward the purchase price.Ensure the agreement specifically states a final price for the property. Define the exact portion of the rental payments that will be put toward the final purchase price.

, You can pay for real estate by bartering another piece of property or a specialized skill you have. For example, a contractor could offer a real estate developer labor in exchange for a down payment.Other possessions you could offer to swap include motor homes, campers, boats, cars, large appliances, valuable artwork and furniture.For any bartering deal, draw up a legal agreement with an attorney specifically stating the value of each item in the trade. An outside appraisal may be needed.

, If you are interested in investing in a piece of real estate but you can't afford the down payment, offer to take over the mortgage payments in exchange for the deed. However, you will need to investigate the existing loan before you make such an offer. Some mortgage loans have specific language preventing this type of transaction.You could also offer to take over a seller's other debts such as credit card payments instead of a down payment. This is something you could pay off over time. Put the agreement in writing, as if you don't pay the credit cards on time the seller's credit rating will be negatively affected.

Hire an attorney.,
Draft a life estate deed.,
Create a Life Estate by Will.,
Record your life estate by deed.,
Maintain the Property.,
Collect profits from the property.,
Sell his or his interest.",How to Set up a Life Estate," A life estate usually refers to a transaction related to property, such as a home, where the homeowner sells or gives the property to their children (or someone else) but maintains the right to live in the house until they die.


The person who sells their home but maintains a life interest is referred to as the “life tenant.”
The person(s) who will receive the house upon the death of the life tenant is called the ""remainderman."";
, There are several reasons why a person may create a life estate. These include:


The homeowner wants to avoid probate for their children. By creating a life estate, the property avoids probate and the remainderman immediately becomes the owner of the property upon the life tenant’s death.The property receives a step-up in basis. This means that when the government calculates capital gains taxes, value is calculated from the date of death, not from the date the original party acquired the property. Typically, there will be a greater increase in value from the date the property was acquired and therefore the tax owed on a property when sold would be much higher. By establishing a life estate, a parent could significantly reduce the amount of capital gains that a child has to pay.A life estate may also be useful to qualify for medical assistance such as Medicaid, which limits the amount of assets you can own if you want support to pay a nursing home. The legal rules involving Medicaid are very complicated and you should contact a trust and estates attorney or an elder law attorney to assist you in making this determination., Before entering into a life estate, it is important for you to understand and weigh the drawbacks of a life estate against any potential benefits. These drawbacks may include:


Selling property subject to a life estate is very difficult. While you maintain the right to live in the home, when you enter a life estate, you give up your right to sell or mortgage your home without the consent of all remaindermen. If the remaindermen refuse to agree to a sale, you are unable to sell the property.A remainderman’s legal problems could impact the property. Since the remainderman has a legal interest in the property, if they run into financial trouble, a lien could be placed on the property while the life tenant is still alive. While the claims may impact the property, a life tenant cannot be forced to leave the property.A life estate may impact your ability to receive medical assistance to pay for nursing home care or in-home care. If you grant a life estate, you may be restricted or ineligible from receiving government assistance through Medicaid for up to five years., States have different rules related to life estates and there are complicated implications, such as potential Medicaid ineligibility, which may significantly impact you. If you are considering entering into a life estate, speak with an attorney so that you understand all of the risks as well as benefits. You can locate attorneys in a number of ways, including:


Referral from friend or family member. If someone you know used a trust and estates or elder law attorney, you can ask them whether they would recommend that attorney. A recommendation from a trusted person who has personal experience with an attorney is a good place to start.
Local or state legal bar associations. Local and state bar associations often provide referral services to attorneys in your area. Through state bar associations, you can check whether any complaints were filed against your prospective attorney. The American Bar Association has compiled a list of state-by-state resources that can direct you to attorney referral sites, such as contact information for state bar associations. The ABA provides this information at http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm


, Each state may have different requirements for a life estate to be valid. You should review your state’s law by locating your state’s legal codes and searching for the phrase “life estate.” You can find links to state codes here:http://www.findlaw.com/11stategov/indexcode.html. Generally, life estate deeds will require the following:


The date the deed was made;
The name of the party granting the life estate and their address;
The name of the grantee and their address;
The address and a legal description of the property that is subject to the life estate;
A statement expressly reserving the life estate; For example, the statement could read “EXPRESSLY RESERVING Life Estate in the above described property unto the Grantor and its assigns. The Grantor shall have full ownership, possession and use of the property, as well as the rents, revenues and profits generated by the property during the term of the Grantor's natural life.”
The signatures of both/all parties, and the document should be notarized., You can also create a life estate by will, which means you grant a part a life interest in your property once you are deceased. For example, you are remarried but you ultimately want the property to go to your children, not the relatives of your new spouse. You can grant your spouse a life estate in the property and upon the spouse’s death, the property would pass directly to your children.


Your will must clearly state that the property goes to one party for the rest of their life then is transferred to another when the first beneficiary dies. This should create a life estate.
You should speak with an attorney to make sure that the will and the life estate language meets your state’s legal requirements for a life estate., If you created a life estate by deed, you must record the deed in order for it to be valid. You need to locate the place where deeds are recorded in town or city where the property is located, typically at a county recorders office.


Conduct an internet search for the name of your town or city and “record a deed.” This search should provide you the contact information for the county office.
Call the deed recorders office and ask what steps you need to take to properly record a life estate deed., While the life tenant has exclusive use of the property during his or her lifetime, the life tenant also has obligations under the life estate. The most basic obligation is to maintain the property. Generally, the life tenant must:


Make necessary repairs to the home;
Maintain insurance for the property;
Pay all real estate taxes; and
Make mortgage payments., The life tenant has the right to all income and profits generated by the property. If the life tenant rents the property, the life tenant is entitled to collect the rent and profits., Unlike a life tenant who cannot sell the property or the remainder interest, the remainderman may be allowed to sell his or her remainder interest in the property even before the life estate terminates.


Generally, the ability to sell a remainder interest during the term of life interest needs to be set forth in the legal document establishing the life estate.
Remaindermen can also sell the property with the permission of the life tenant."

Bring in a partner.,
Invest with a building contractor.",How to Invest In Real Estate With No Money2," If you are big on ideas but short on cash, bringing in a partner who will provide the funding and allow you to do the managing might be an attractive option. You will need to write up a contract that establishes who is responsible for what, and how the profits will be divided.


If your partner is in place strictly for financial support, make sure you retain all control over the day-to-day management of your investment.

, If you lack carpentry, plumbing and electrical skills to fix up and resell a property, partner with someone who does have these skills and could help with the down payment. Once you make a profit on the sale, you will have the down payment for your next real estate investment.

Borrow money from family or friends.,
Take out a home equity loan.,
Consider a micro lender.",How to Invest In Real Estate With No Money3," If you have little or no money on hand and you want to make a real estate investment, borrowing money from family and friends is another option. Be sure to write up an official promissory note with payment due dates, a specific interest rate, and what ownership, if any, the lender will have in the property. If you pay back the loan on time and with interest, these lenders might be willing to lend to you again for future projects.


Consider whether the relationship you have with your lender could be harmed if you were unable to repay the loan. Ask yourself if securing real estate is worth endangering your relationship with someone close to you.

, Find a bank who will allow you to take out a loan for a down payment on top of the mortgage loan you have on your own house. This could be a line of credit or a second mortgage using your home as collateral. Look for a low interest rate that will allow you to purchase the property economically enough that you can still make a profit later on your investment.Make sure you can pay back this loan or you risk losing your own home. You will also have to have a credit score in the high 600s to take out this type of loan.

, Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) help borrowers find lenders for relatively small loans, usually under $35,000. Research these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.Popular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.

Once every 40 years there is a major housing bubble caused by cheap money that inflates Real Estate. This happened in the 1890s, 1930s, 1970s and 2010s. During this severe recession, the Government prints money and spend it on stimulus packages (McKinley, FDR, Nixon) causing an inflationary up-leg. The initial contraction in Construction and Jobs causes inflation to be under control the first half of the decade, but when the population increase absorbs the foreclosed homes, then the Banks start to aggressively loan money on homes as they rise in price the second half of the decade. The printing of 4.1 billion dollars of cash per day insures another inflationary up-leg and a good jump in Real Estate prices.
Currently in 2011 one million foreclosures are expected as the ALT-A and Option Adjustable rate loan packages adjust higher. This caused an average 3.9% drop in prices in 2010 and another 3.9% average drop in home prices is expected in 2011. After March 2012 the loan packages are 99% done resetting to higher payments and you can expect Real Estate to rise in price some.

For example, sellers must disclose the presence of lead-based paint or asbestos if the home was built after 1978.Your state and local law will also have additional disclosure requirements. You should get copies of the law to see what you are entitled to. Search online or stop into your local city planning department to ask.You can also ask a real estate agent or an attorney for a copy of the disclosure law.
Your state’s Department of Real Estate might also have information about what disclosures are required in your state.;
, The seller or the seller’s agent should send this to you without any prompting. However, if you haven’t received it yet, then call up and ask. Your purchase agreement should provide a deadline for the seller to give you their disclosures.


Make sure you have all sheets and that you can read the information.
Also compare what you received to what the seller was required to give you. Confirm that the seller has turned over all required disclosures.

, Set aside some time to go through the disclosure forms. Note anything that you don’t understand or any information that is missing. Also check what problems have been identified.


In most states, owners are not legally responsible for any problems they are unaware of. They could honestly answer that they are unaware of any termite infestation when there is an actual infestation. Most states don’t require that sellers go looking for problems.
Realize owners also don’t have to hire someone to search for problems unless they agreed to in the purchase agreement.For this reason, you shouldn’t assume no problems exist with the house simply because they aren’t noted on the disclosure form.

, If information is missing from a disclosure form, then follow up with the seller or their agent. Request the missing information. Remember not to go through with the purchase until you receive complete disclosures. Disclosure laws should typically cover the following:water leakage of any kind, including around windows and in basements
termites or other insects
pest, mold, or rot
plumbing and sewage problems
defects in the roof
drainage problems
issues with air conditioning and heating
foundation problems
boundary disputes with a neighbor
issues with legal title
other (depending on the state)

, You should never rely solely on disclosures to protect you. Instead, you need a home inspection done. In fact, an inspection should be one of the “contingencies” of the contract. This means you can cancel the contract based on the results of the inspection.Even if the seller already had an inspection done before putting the home on the market, you should think about hiring your own inspector. It will cost you around $1,000 but it is money well spent.You’d rather find problems before agreeing to buy a house.
Your contract can also set the timetable for the inspection. You might only get a week or two to have the inspection done. Try to negotiate as much time as possible, such as 60 days.

, You might not know any inspection companies. Although you can search for inspectors online, it can be difficult to judge inspectors based on their websites. Obtain referrals from people you trust, such as the following:


real estate agentlawyer
another homeowner
International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (www.nachi.org)

, Ask inspectors if they can provide references. Call up the references and check that the people were happy with the service provided. Ask if the inspector showed up on time and did a complete inspection.Obtain a quote in writing for how much it will cost to hire the inspector.
Winnow down your list and hire the inspector whose price and reputation works for you.

, The inspection should take two to five hours. Once finished, the inspector should give you and your agent a report of about 20-30 pages. You should also get color photographs of any problems.Don’t be surprised if there are problems. A good home inspection should be thorough and identify even small flaws.
Discuss with your agent or lawyer whether any of the problems seem particularly serious or expensive to fix. If so, you’ll need to consider next steps. For example, if you are in a “seller’s market,” you might want to avoid asking the seller to fix minor issues.
However, you shouldn’t ignore big structural flaws, like a cracked foundation.

, A general inspection can reveal certain problems, such as low water pressure. However, you might need to hire a specialist to uncover the root cause of the problem. Inspector specialists work in the following areas:chimney
electrical
heating and air conditioning
termites and other pests
lead-based paint
easement and encroachment
roofs
foundation and basement
trees, vegetation, and soil stability
septic system or sewer
mold
other

, A well-drafted purchase agreement should give you rights in case the inspection report identifies defects. For example, you typically have the following options:


Cancel the contract. Your contract should tell you how to notify the seller that you want out of the sale. Make sure to provide the appropriate notice before any deadline. If you miss the deadline, then you probably will forfeit your earnest money.Ask the seller to fix the problem. This can slow up the sale. Furthermore, the seller will need to find a licensed contractor.Negotiate a reduction in the purchase price. This is called getting a “credit.” You can use the money to fix the problem yourself. You might want to pursue this option if you want to choose the contractor.

, You’ll need evidence of the defect. You’ll also need proof that the owner knew about the defect but didn’t disclose it. Talk with the lawyer about what kinds of evidence to get. Consider the following:


Photographs of the defect. The home inspector should provide you with them.
Repair estimates. Find out how much it will cost to fix the problem. If you have a leaky roof, ask a roofer for an estimate. The amount of money it will cost to fix the problem is generally the amount of money you can sue for.Witness testimony. A neighbor might tell you that the seller was aware of a faulty foundation before selling. You’ll want that person’s testimony, which you can get admitted into court.
Your own memories. Write down what the seller and their agent told you.

, You should try to resolve the dispute on your own before filing a lawsuit. Write a demand letter and send it to the seller. Some states require that you send a demand letter before suing, but it’s a good idea even if your state doesn’t require this. A demand letter should contain the following:The date you are sending the letter.
The factual background to the dispute. Explain the defect and how you discovered it.
How much you want to be paid. Make sure to give a deadline for payment.
Contact information if the seller has questions.
A promise to sue if the seller doesn’t pay or contact you by a certain date.

, To sue for non-disclosure, a few facts need to exist. The facts will differ depending on your state. However, you generally need to prove the following to sue:The problem existed before you bought the house. If it didn’t, then you can’t blame the prior owner.
The problem wasn’t so obvious you should have been able to see it on a walkthrough. If there’s a giant hole in the roof, you’ll struggle to explain how this defect was a surprise to you.
No one disclosed the defect. For example, neither the seller, the seller’s agent, or an inspector told you.
You relied on any lies or non-disclosure. This is usually easy to prove. However, if you said, “I don’t care if there’s a hole in the roof, I need this property,” then you probably didn’t rely on the non-disclosure.
The defect has caused you financial damage.

, If you buy a home that has problems, you should consult with a lawyer to discuss your options. Share the disclosure forms you received and talk about any promises or statements of fact the seller made to you orally. You can find a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.


Also talk about whether you should even sue. Lawsuits can take more than a year to resolve, and they can be quite expensive. Share your evidence with the lawyer and ask if you have a strong case.
Ask what legal theories you can use to sue. For example, you can sue under your state’s disclosure statute if the seller didn’t make a required disclosure. If the seller made an inaccurate statement, then you could sue for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.Avoid delay. You have a limited amount of time to sue, depending on your cause of action. This deadline is called the “statute of limitation.” The length of time will differ depending on the state.

, If your complaint isn’t worth a lot of money, you can sue in small claims court. This court is set up for people representing themselves without an attorney. Often, the process is simplified and the case can be resolved faster.


There’s a maximum amount you can sue for in small claims.The amount will differ by state. Check with the court clerk.
If you want to sue for more than the maximum, then you will sue in regular civil court.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. Your lawyer can draft this document for you. However, if you don’t have a lawyer, then you will need to create your own complaint. It should identify you and the defendant, the reason you are suing, and how much money you are requesting.Some courts might have fillable complaint forms. If you sue in small claims court, then there is usually a form. Ask the court clerk or look on the court’s website.
In other courts, you might need to draft your own. Ask the clerk if there is a sample or try to find a sample complaint online or in a library book of legal forms.

, Make a copy of the complaint for your records and then take the original and several copies to the court clerk. Ask to file. You will probably have to pay a filing fee, which will depend on the court.


You’ll have to give the seller notice that you are suing them. You can provide the notice by sending a copy of your complaint and a “summons,” which you can get from the court clerk.
Your court will have specific rules about service. For example, you may have to pay someone to hand deliver the summons and complaint on the defendant. Don’t assume you can just mail the paperwork to the other party. Check with a lawyer.

The US population grew from 1980 to 2010 at the rate of 2.75 million per year (in 1980 was 227 million and was 310 million in 2010 and still growing) so the population increase will eventually absorb the foreclosures and there will be another housing boom.;
, This is especially important if Make an application to a mortgage company. You need to know what they can do for you and let them know what it is that you are looking to do. If you are going to buy single Family Homes or Multi-family buildings. Make sure they can make the loans and how much of the rental with they use towards qualifying you for a mortgage.

, Make sure you tell the loan officer what you want up front. Once you find the property you want to purchase you can make the deal a cash offer subject to appraisal.


If you take the asking price and divide it by the square footage of the property, properties sell for around a certain average price per square foot. In my city in California the properties sell for around $200 per square foot while in Central Phoenix Arizona they sell for around $50 per square foot. In 2011, if you want to get the Bank to approve the Loan, don't select a property above the average or the Bank will not approve the loan (even if the property appraises for what you offered, the Bank will not make the loan).

, Contact agents that specialize in working with Buyers and not an agent who works for the seller. However, a sellers agent can provide information about a property that a buyer's agent may not know.

Make sure your agent knows that you are going to move very quickly and you want the seller to move just as fast.

, Don't buy properties because they look good or you like the interior. Make smart educated purchases from good data. Ignore the decorations and the potpourri try to compare house size, location and age. You may be willing to redecorate a bargain if everything else is good.

Understand how financing affects your ability to negotiate a real estate deal.,
Have cash on hand for a down payment.,
Check your credit history.,
Get pre-qualified.,
Shop for loans.,
Get pre-approved.",How to Negotiate a Deal in Real Estate1," Whether you are the buyer or seller, understanding the financial aspect of a real estate deal is the single most important thing when negotiating.


If you are the seller, you should know what financing you would be willing to accept and you should have the evidence to support your claim. For example, you may only be willing to negotiate with buyers that have been pre-approved for a mortgage that would cover the price of your home, minus any down payment the buyers can make. Put another way, you may only want to negotiate with potential buyers that you know have access to the funds and loans necessary to purchase your home.
If you are the buyer, you need to understand that a lot of sellers accept deals based on your financing arrangements. Therefore, if you have not secured financing for the purchase, you may not even get to the negotiating table. In addition, you will want to show the sellers that the financing you have is secure and stable. For example, being able to show the seller a mortgage pre-approval letter will go along way in securing a spot at the negotiating table. On the other hand, if the only financing you have is a personal loan from a friend, the seller may have trouble trusting your ability to pay.;
, The first step in securing financing on a home is gathering enough cash to make a down payment.A down payment will generally be at least 20% of the real estate purchase price.If you are a buyer, the more money you can put down, the more bargaining power you will have during negotiations. Sellers like cash deals and, in general, the more cash you have, the lower the purchase price will go.
If you are the seller, you should understand how much cash they are willing to put on the table. Be willing to work with the buyers if they offer more cash. However, if they are unable to offer a large down payment, you may decline their offer to purchase the property or request more money.

, Before you can get a home loan you will need to check your credit score. The higher your credit score is, the lower your interest rate will be.This is the case because banks and other lenders are taking less risk in loaning money to someone with a history of paying back loans.


To check your credit score, you can call Equifax, Trans-Union, or Experian.You can also get your credit report for free once a year from annualcreditreport.com., When you shop for a home loan, you need to know how much home you can afford and the type of loan you are likely to be qualified for. Allow lenders to estimate how much mortgage you will be able to afford.To do this, you will provide potential lenders with certain information about your credit history, income, and debts, and they will give you an idea of what you can afford.As a buyer, a pre-qualification letter can help you negotiate with sellers. This is great evidence that tells sellers that you are able to get financing., Once you have been pre-qualified, you can begin the search for a mortgage that fits your needs. When looking for a mortgage, you should look at the interest rate, the loan term, the size of the down payment, and the fees associated with each loan., A pre-approval is a firm offer from a lender to give you a loan.Once pre-approved, you will be able to make an offer on the home of your dreams, so long as it is within your finances.


As a buyer, a pre-approval letter is a powerful negotiation tool and it tells the seller that you are ready and able to make the deal.

You have more properties than you can handle.
You live far away.
You do not have the time.
You’re not sure how to manage properties.
You don’t want to deal with the legal and tax liability associated with being a employer.
Your property is part of an affordable housing program. These often have complicated regulations that will make management more time consuming.;
, If you have any friends in the business, ask them about their experiences with property managers. Consider attending the meetings of local real estate groups to ask other professionals about their experiences. Real Estate Investment Association meetings can be a useful resource. Some locations even have specific landlord groups, known as Property Owners Associations.Your priority should be finding a property manager who is reliable. Ask other professionals if the property managers they worked with kept the property in good shape, responded quickly to their concerns, and maintained a consistent flow of revenue.

, To broaden your search, look online for companies. The Institute of Real Estate Management and the National Association of Residential Property both offer online databases that allow you to search for local management companies.Other online resources include: AllPropertyManagement.com and ManagemyProperty.com

, If you are concerned about how a third party would care for your properties, set up a management structure and train a new but trustworthy manager in the system that you have set up., Most property managers calculate fees as a percentage of rent (6-12% is typical). Though these rates are fairly standard, you should be attentive to the details.


Some companies charge rent on the basis of rent collected, others on the basis of potential rent. You should negotiate for fees to be based on actual rent, otherwise the manager will have less incentive to fill rooms and collect rent.Will you be charged for 'extras' such as advertising, rent-up, or quarterly inspections? If so, consider carefully the value of those services.

, When something goes wrong with your investment property, you want to be sure the manager has a plan for how to handle a variety of problems and that you know how much it will cost.


Is there a mark-up for vendor provided maintenance services? Some property managers mark-up a vendor's invoice by 10% or more. Try to negotiate over this rate.
Most managers will want to perform repair costs up to a fixed dollar amount (normally between $250-500) without your prior approval. Negotiate over a defined amount, depending upon your price point.How will he handle maintenance emergencies? Most good property managers will have a 24 hour maintenance emergency line to handle emergency requests immediately. Be sure the manager has a maintenance line and it is staffed 24/7/365.Does the manager have a list of vetted and approved vendors? Be sure the list includes a plumber, handyman, electrician, appliance technician, and painters.

, You should have your own insurance to cover the property, but you should confirm that the property manager has his own insurance in case of lawsuits. In some states, your property manager will be legally required to own such insurance. He should be willing to share the details of their liability insurance.You should negotiate with the property manager as to whether they will be added on to your insurance as ""additional insured"" in case of tenant disputes and property damage incurred when they work on your property.
In many states, your property manager will be legal required to have E & O insurance. You should also ask if he has liability insurance that cover him in cases when an employee sues him.

, Ask how frequently formal inspections will be conducted and get the pledge in writing. If he is reticent to agree to a particular timeline or asks for higher fees as compensation, he probably does not provide a high level of service.The manager should perform a thorough inspection of the inside of the property at least once a year. The outside should be inspected at least once a quarter. Furthermore, an apartment should be inspected every time a tenant ends their lease., Most states require property managers to have a real estate license and some states require a real estate broker's license. Check with the United States Department of Housing Authority (HUD) for more information about your state's licensing requirements.Similarly, you should inquire as to whether he is part of an accredited national organization.Visit the Better Business Bureau online (BBB.org). The BBB accredits property managers. If your property manager is accredited, that is reasonably good indication that they are reliable., It is important that your manager knows what rental rates are appropriate for your properties. Test the candidate’s knowledge by asking for a rental comparison (often referred to as a “rent comp”), as well as a rental rate recommendation. The property manager should be able to give you a ballpark rental rate recommendation based on a neighborhood’s rent comp.

, Look for a property manager who has taken care of residential properties that are similar to your own. Some managers focus on single family homes, while others prefer large apartment buildings, duplexes, or townhouses. Each property type comes with its own set of challenges, and you want to be sure you hire a manager who knows how to handle those challenges.You should also ask how long he has been in business and if he has any notable success stories.Visit some of the properties yourself. You should see how well they are maintained. If they are not well kept, the property manager isn't doing his job., One employee can generally handle 35-40 units efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, divide the total number of units managed by the number of employees assisting in the management effort (ie: 200 properties / 5 employees = 40 properties per individual). If there are more than 40 units per individual, the company's resources are likely stretched thin.


You should also know if he manages any of his own properties. If this is the case, he is also your competition and might devote a disproportionate amount of his energy to his own properties.

, A property manager should be able to provide you with at least 3 references. Call the references and have a conversation about the manager's performance. Ensure confidentiality to get the most honest feedback. Include the following questions in your assessment:


Was rent collected on time?
Did the manager fill vacancies quickly?
Were maintenance problems addressed in a timely fashion?
Did the manager handle most problems with little to no intervention required?
Were you ever charged for services that should have been included in the management fee?, Look for a manager who will communicate well with you. Responsiveness is one of the best qualities of a good property manager. If your manager doesn't return your calls quickly, how will he treat your tenants and prospective renters?A responsive property manager will make your tenants and prospects happy, which will reduce your turnover rate.
You should also consider how the manager interacts with you in your meetings. He should be providing a service to you and your renters. If he appears rude, abrupt or generally disinclined to serve you, then he is not likely to perform his job well., Establish when rent will be collected and how quickly it will be deposited into your bank account. Make sure your property manager understands accounting. You should receive detailed statements including a monthly rent roll, deposit breakdown, management fee summary, and maintenance charges breakdown., Most management firms now use software that keeps track of lease expiration data on your properties, move-in/move-out summaries, executed lease documents, occupancy lists, open work orders, and tax information. Ask the candidate to provide samples of output reports., How does the company collect rents? How do they advertise for and screen tenets? Try to meet tenants in properties they manage to determine how happy they are with their service., Every good property manager will have policies in place to handle difficult tenants. These policies are important because they protect your financial and legal interests.What are the late rent policies? Be sure the manager has a system in place to properly document late rent payments. This will come in handy if you need to evict the tenant for unpaid rent.
How does the manager deal with lease violations and complaints? The manager should have a formal addendum attached to every lease stating the property rules and restrictions. If the tenant violates a rule, be sure the manager knows how to properly document violations in case the evidence is needed for litigation in the future.
Ask how frequently the property manager files for evictions. If they do so frequently, then they have not properly screened tenants before leasing the property., It is important that you have an exit strategy should you have difficulty with the property manager. A provision that ends the arrangement 30 days after receipt of written notice should be a reasonable request., Once you have a contract that appears to work to the mutual benefit of both parties, you should consult a lawyer. You are making an important deal. You should confirm that there are no hidden provisions that will detrimentally affect your financial situation or your property.

Research the property.,
Learn about the neighborhood.,
Create a budget and keep financing in mind.,
Consider a property inspection.,
Set the boundaries and tone.,
Prepare to make counter-offers.,
Close the deal.",How to Negotiate a Deal in Real Estate2," Whether it is a residential or commercial deal, you need to know as much as possible about the property. Find out the basics of age, square footage, layout, and if there have been any significant upgrades or remodels. This information should be in the real estate listing. If not, ask the seller. If you are not getting answers or don't believe them, check the city or county building department for a history of building permits issued for the property.


If you are considering a historical property, find out if it is listed on the local, state, or federal historical register.This can be a plus or a minus depending on your goals. If the property is registered, there may be financial assistance and tax relief for restoration and renovation.However, you may be strictly limited in the changes you can make to the structure.
Find out if there are any grandfathered zoning or code allowances for the structure. When zoning and building codes change, sometimes older structures are allowed to remain as they are so long as no changes are made. However, if new building permits are issued, the codes enforcement agency may require the existing work to be upgraded. That bathroom remodel could turn into new plumbing for the entire house. This should be factored into your offer.

, List price is less important than comparative market analysis (CMA).If you are working with an agent, she can run a listing of the most recent property sales and listings of comparable properties in the neighborhood. An unrepresented buyer can pay a real estate attorney or agent for a report.Don't rely on the report alone. Drive around and check out the properties and see which ones are most similar to the property under negotiation.
Using the data in the CMA report, you can evaluate if the property price is in line with the current state of the market.

, If a buyer has cash or pre-approved financing in hand, he may be in a position to drive a harder bargain than one who has to wait on mortgage applications and approvals. The advantage to the seller is a firm contract with a quick closing date rather than gambling with the property essentially off the market for weeks or months while the buyer tries to secure financing., As the prospective buyer, an inspection can uncover potential deal-breakers, such as structural damage, and give you a list of needed repairs to use as leverage for a reduction in price or a credit against closing costs.


A serious flaw, such as needing a new roof, doesn't have to be the end of an otherwise desirable property. Before asking for a credit, consult with a local contractor to get a good idea of the cost of repair.

, The seller has his asking price. Using your CMA report, you can formulate an offer. That sets the two end points of the negotiation. If both parties have used reliable data to create their price points, the selling price will be somewhere in the middle.Don't insult the seller. Offering an unreasonable offer, ""just to get the ball rolling,"" will likely be interpreted as you not being serious about buying the property.You can be honest about issues, but talking down the property in disrespectful terms such as ""ugly"", ""worthless"", and offering to ""take it off their hands,"" is likely to result in the owners refusal to work with you any longer.

, In the typical list price-offer exchange, the seller will make the first counter-offer. Buyers should not get too hung up on small differences in price. With interest rates between 4 and 5 percent, a $5,000 difference in the mortgage is less than $20 per month on the payment. If the seller says $195,000 and you had offered $190,000, strongly consider accepting the seller's counter-offer if it fits into your pre-approved financing range. This is a business deal, not a competition.

, All offers and counter-offers should be in writing. When a mutually agreeable offer is reached, both parties should sign it to indicate acceptance. Detail the sales price, any credits for repairs, allocation of closing costs, and a prospective closing date. This will become the basis of your sales contract.


If you have not had real estate agents involved in the negotiation, you should consider retaining a real estate attorney to handle the closing. Transactions such as title insurance, rescission clauses, calculating and apportioning taxes, and other business details can be handled to make sure the deal remains fair to both parties."

Price your property.,
Consider a pre-sale property inspection.,
Understand the buyer mindset.,
Receive your offer.,
Prepare to make counter-offers.,
Consider owner financing.,
Close the deal.",How to Negotiate a Deal in Real Estate3," The price you choose will be a combination of the comparative market analysis (CMA).for your area, your equity versus pay-off amount, and your goals. For example, an investment property in a desirable neighborhood can be listed for a higher price because you don't necessarily need a quick sale. Conversely, if you have moved or need to sell quickly in order to buy a new house, you'll want to price to the lower end of the neighborhood spectrum.


If you have agent, she can run a listing of the most recent property sales and listings of comparable properties in the neighborhood. An ""For Sale By Owner"" seller can pay a real estate attorney or agent for a report., Inspections aren't just for buyers. Investing in an inspection before you list the property can reveal small issues that can be repaired before the listing and more serious repairs can be factored into the listing price., Unless you have a very desirable property in a hot neighborhood, the buyer has many choices. He is looking to stretch his budget as far as it will go. Stage your property to highlight its benefits and be prepared to include your property upgrades in the negotiation. For example, if you had planned on taking the appliances, but the buyer expresses an interest, consider adding them to the deal.

, If the offer is verbal, and you believe the offer is serious, request that the buyer put it in writing. You can have blank forms ready.A written offer shows the buyer is serious and makes it harder for him to renege during the negotiation.

, In the typical list price-offer exchange, the seller will make the first counter-offer. You need to think about the daily costs of owning the property and figure that into their counter-offer. Mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, lawn care, and HOA fees are real costs coming out of your pocket while the property remains unsold. If you have already moved, you are also dealing with the risk of storm damage or vandalism on the vacant property. Ask yourself how much the property has cost you since you put it on the market and if you are willing to continuing to pay those costs while waiting for another serious buyer. Factor these costs into your counter-offer. If you have limited interest in the property consider coming down closer to the buyer's offer.


Keep your cool. If buyer's offer is insultingly low, don't respond with anger or sarcasm. Make a reasonable counter-offer to show your position. The buyer may still be serious and simply a poor negotiator. Calling the buyer ""cheap"" or ""ridiculous"" may lose you a serious buyer.
Offer to assume or split some of the closing costs. If the buyer insists on an inspection, that is his choice, but you can split costs like title insurance, a real estate attorney, and miscellaneous fees.

, If you have an otherwise qualified buyer who can't get a conventional mortgage because of credit issues or the bank won't lend on the property because of age, location, or condition, you can carry the loan yourself. The disadvantage is you won't be paid immediately and may have to deal with a loan default. The advantage is you may be able to realize a higher purchase price.


Unless you have experience with setting up loan agreements, consult with a real estate attorney to craft the best loan agreement for you and the buyer., Both parties should sign the final offer, even if it is an informal document you and the buyer both worked on. This will become the basis of your sales contract. Hiring a real estate agent or attorney to prepare the final contract and closing documents is a worthwhile investment.


Set a closing date that is far enough out to allow the title work to be finished and your attorney to prepare the final contracts and deed. Typically, 30 to 45 days should suffice.

Calculate the total income for the year from that rental property.,
Total the mortgage, insurance and tax payments for the rental property.,
Add other property-related expenses to the total loan payments.,
Divide the total income from your rental property by the total expenses.",How to Work Out Yield on Rental Property," This is usually the total rent payments, but may also include application fees, payments for repairs or improvements, and any portions you kept from a security deposit.


Example: For 4 months of the year, your property has a tenant paying $1,400 per month. It is vacant for 2 months, then your rent it out for the remainder of the year at $1,500 monthly. Your total rental income is $14,600.
You keep the entire $1,000 security deposit from the first renter, and collect a $120 application fee from the second renter.
Your total annual income for the rental property is (14,600 + 1000 + 120 = ) $15,720.;
, Often, these 3 payments are all part of the same draft for your loan.


Your monthly payments for mortgage, insurance and tax come to $1,000 per month, which is a total of $12,000 annually.

, These typically include material and service costs for repairs and improvements, but could also include legal fees, utility fees for times the property is vacant and advertising or processing expenses associated with finding new tenants.


You spend $1,100 on new paint and minor repairs when the first tenants move out, plus $250 in advertising and background checks for the new tenants.
Your total annual expenses for the rental property is (12,000 + 1,100 = 250 =) $13,350.

, Multiply the difference by 100. The result is the annual yield for your rental property.


Your net profit on the rental property is (15,720 - 13,350=) $2,370.
If the property originally cost you $180,000, your annual yield is (2,370/180,000 =0.013*100=) 1.3 percent.

Remember to listen.",How to Stop Cold Calling in Real Estate Sales1," If you're calling someone at a company, you need to know about that company. Of course, you can find out about the company through its website, but you can also check out its Facebook page and other public pages. Another good way to learn about the company is through news stories; do a search on the company, and switch the search to just news stories. Make notes on any information relevant to your real estate business., Yes, you need to know the person's company and what the company does. However, it's equally important to know about the person you are calling. Look her up on her company's website. Check out her LinkedIn profile or even her Facebook profile, if she has it set on public., Show how what you're offering can help the person and the company. That is, make your email as specific as you can to the company. It's much like writing a cover letter to a resume; you're selling yourself by offering up specifics about why your real estate offerings would be the best option for the company and the person.For instance, you can write, ""Dear Ms. Jones, I'm writing because I am a realtor with real estate offerings that you or your company would be interest in. I noticed that your company is purchasing small local shops, and I think I have some properties you would be interested in. I would like to discuss these properties with you over the phone. Would Friday at 3 work for you?""
Including a time usually gets people to at least offer a response.

, If you sound tired or bored, no one is going to want to listen to you. Try to put a smile on your face (people can tell by the sound of your voice), and try to act enthusiastic about what you're doing., The person you are calling is busy. If you want her to actually listen to her, you need to respect her time. Keep your call short and to the point, and ask if you can call back at a better time if she turns you down because she's too busy., You are actually trying to have a conversation with the person you are calling. If you dump information on her, she'll likely want to end the conversation before it really begins."

Pay for required property improvements.",How to Subdivide Property," Subdividing property means dividing it into several parts. Land owners typically subdivide their property into multiple residential units. This usually increases the value of the land.When the land is subdivided into more than one lot, each lot is then sold to one or more buyers. This is more profitable than keeping the property as one residential unit.
Smaller residential lots may be easier to sell than larger pieces of land. This increases the overall value of the land.;
, Subdividing property is commonplace among land developers, builders, real estate agents and other professionals. However, if you are new to the process, it can be risky if you don’t do your due diligence. Evaluate a number of preliminary items to determine whether your property is even eligible for subdivision. You could waste a lot of time and money designing and applying for a subdivision when your property isn’t even eligible. , The complexities associated with subdividing property increase as the property size increases. It is less complicated to subdivide a smaller piece of property (one that is less than an acre in size) into only two plots. Larger projects are more complex. Once you start planning to divide properties that are larger than an acre into three or more plots, things get much more complicated. Other factors that complicate subdivision of property include whether the lot fronts an existing public road and whether you intend to build new roads, utilities and other infrastructure. Depending on the site design and layout, a subdivision project can easily escalate into a full-scale community development project. , Make sure there are no local ordinances, neighborhood covenants or deed restrictions that may block your plans. A title search will identify any of these problems as well as the existence of any outstanding liens or other claims on the land.Find a title company. Your real estate agent or lender can recommend one with whom they usually work, or you can get recommendations from peers. The title company does the title search to make sure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. Once the title company verifies the validity of the title, they will release a title-opinion letter that states their findings.
The title company will also issue title insurance. Title insurance protects the buyer should previous owners or debtors state they have a claim on the property. During the title search, the title company scrutinizes old deeds to verify that the seller is the only owner of the property. The title search also uncovers any unpaid debts on the property, such as taxes, liens or loans., Make sure there is a market for lots in your area. Sell them at a price that makes sense. Research the market and other properties in the area to determine a lot size, layout and price that is marketable in the area.Consult a trusted real estate agent with local experience for advice on this matter. Get input from other builders who have worked in your area.
Understand that the location of your property impacts its current value and how it might appreciate. Study the values of properties that are currently on the market in the area and others that have sold in the recent past.For example, if you are planning to subdivide property to build residential homes, determine the home and lot size that will carry the highest value in your location. If most homes that sell in the area are smaller or are on smaller lots, don't elect to build large, expensive houses on big lots. They won't sell for nearly as much as they might in a more upscale neighborhood. An appraiser won't be able to assign a value to a home that's any higher than the highest home price in the location. So it's wise to research the market and begin with an appropriate size and price in mind. , Even if there are no ordinances, covenants or other restrictions stopping you from subdividing the land, local zoning, subdivision and property-development laws may affect your plans. Every municipality and county has its own zoning regulations, lot- and building-size restrictions and requirements pertaining to open space. Research these laws before investing in any plans to subdivide the property. It is possible to apply for zoning variances, which may be granted if your request is deemed reasonable. Contact the the municipal planning and building department of the township or municipality to learn the property's zoning category. If you cannot find the information there, research local laws on websites such as State and Local Government on the Net or the Municipal Code Corporation (Municode). Zoning and local rules may affect the way the property can be used. The neighborhood might be classified for single-family residential, multi-family residential, transitional, or a mixed use such as residential plus commercial., You will not be able to sell the properties if they do not have access to public roads and utilities such as water, sewer and power. Confirm that these utilities are available for your lots and that they can handle the added capacity of the new residences you plan to build there. This process is sometimes referred to as site development or technical due diligence. It is the process of evaluating the availability of and options for key utilities and infrastructure at the building lot like power, water, sewer and communications. If you are buying a finished lot for sale, your agreement with the builder will cover these services. If you are buying a vacant or undeveloped lot outside of a neighborhood or established city limit, you will have to make plans for getting power, water, sewer and communications services to the property.Electric and gas power can be brought to the property by the power company. Don't rule out alternative or green sources of power: solar, natural gas, propane, heating oil or even geothermal.Even if sewer and public water are available for a parcel of land, you may have to make arrangements to extend these services to the structures you plan to build. Consider alternatives like wells, and rainwater containment and filtration systems. Public sewer service is not always available. In these cases you may have to install a septic system. Plan to wire appropriately for the types of communications systems you want to install, such as high-speed Internet, telephone and cable television. Costs for site development can add up significantly. These costs include fees and permits and will vary depending on site and soil conditions, your development plans, and local fees and permitting costs. The town or state may also charge you impact fees. These help communities pay for schools, infrastructure and other public costs associated with adding new homes to the community. Impact fees can conceivably be quite high. , A title search is performed by a title company. It is an examination of public records to find out if there are any previous owners who might claim an interest in the property or if there are unpaid debts such as taxes or loans. If you already own the property, a title search was likely done before you made settlement. However, if you are purchasing the property with the intention of subdividing it, make sure a title search is completed before you go to settlement., Contact the nearest planning, zoning and/or development office. Your city or township may post information on their website. If not, you will have to call them. Ask whether your property qualifies for subdivision. Find out about ordinances or restrictions with which you will have to comply., Hire a developer or civil engineer to design the property. The plan will specify how the land is to be divided, including the number and size of subdivisions. The design should also illustrate how roads will reach the properties. Hire a firm that employs civil engineers, land surveyors and environmental consultants with experience in your area.They will begin by studying the topography of the land and identifying critical resource areas that cannot be developed. They will use this information to draft approximate property lines. Then they will review local bylaws and present you with concept sketches that show you options for development of the site.Open-space subdivisions conserve open space with shorter roads and reduced lot frontage. Mixed-use developments include residential, business and recreational areas. Affordable housing developments not only help low-income people to purchase a home, but they can also turn sites with difficult constraints or little design potential into lucrative properties. Senior housing combines open space with accessible recreation and condominiums. It can be a way to attract new residents to an area without overburdening the schools. Once you choose the subdivision you want, the design firm will work with you to survey the land, delineate wetlands, design drainage and control erosion. , Your city or town may offer surveying services. If not, hire a private surveyor or engineer to survey the property and create a plat. A plat is a map, drawn to scale, that shows the subdivisions on a plot of land. It identifies boundaries, easements, flood zones, roadways, and access rights-of-way. It provides the legal description of the piece of property. Plats are required for any land that is to be subdivided. , Your local planning board will decide whether or not to approve your petition. Include your plat map, certificate of title and application fee with your application. In most cases the planning board will decide your case during a regular meeting. In other cases they will hold a public hearing. Once you have your subdivision plans all put together, go to the local planning board and schedule a pre-lodgement meeting. Bring your certificate of title and your subdivision plans.
Show how big the property is, and identify areas for open spaces, existing and new houses, driveways and car parks.
Urban planners on the council will review your proposal to make sure it meets local planning policies and guidelines. Don't be surprised if they make recommendations for you to adjust or refine your plans.
If necessary, meet with your team of architects, land surveyors and development planners to rework the plan to meet the council's recommendations.
Once you have met the above requirements, it is time to lodge your application. The township or municipality will accept your application and go through the process of approving it. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Track your application by communicating with the council frequently to see if they have questions or need more information.

, If your property does not qualify for subdivision or your application for subdivision is denied for some reason, you do have recourse. Filing for a planning or zoning variance or waiver re-opens the case. Often upon re-examination, planning boards will grant exceptions when they deem them reasonable. , Many variables influence the cost. These include the size of the property, its location, and the way you intend to use it. The number of subdivisions also affects the cost. The more subdivisions you intend, the more it is going to cost. There is no way to accurately estimate how much it is going to cost to subdivide your property since so many factors impact the total cost. These include your location, property laws, zoning requirements, the size and shape of your property, whether or not there are any existing buildings on the property and the availability of access to utilities and infrastructure.Land-subdivision costs may include a land survey, legal fees, application fees, clearing the site, supplying utilities, inspection fees and permit costs. If you want to get an estimate for the cost of subdivision of a specific property, contact a land-developing firm in your area that has civil engineers, architects and land surveyors. They will have the knowledge and experience in your locale to be able to tell you what costs to anticipate. , This will accompany your application and is paid to your local government agency. You may also be responsible for hearing, recording, review and tax-map-update fees. You could pay as much as $10,000 on these fees, depending on your location and how many subdivisions you are requesting. For only two subdivisions, the cost will much lower.

, Surveyors charge by the hour. The amount you need to budget for surveying depends on the size of the property. For a smaller property, the surveyor may charge you between $500 and $2,500. The cost of surveying and platting larger properties can range much higher. , These requirements can make your expenses skyrocket. Approval for property subdivision usually comes with requirements that you must make certain improvements to the property. These usually have to do with access roads, sewer and utilities. These improvements can typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. "

Ask them if any of their friends or family would be willing to meet with you or if they are looking to buy property. It's easier to start with people you know and move outward., You can't network in your office. You have to go meet people. Go to business events. Have a drink after work at a swanky business bar. Volunteer at charities. Go to church or to the gym. Join classes or clubs that focus on your hobbies. Basically, you have to get out in the world to meet people., That is, if you volunteer, talk to the other volunteers. If you go to church, talk to people you meet there. The first rule of networking is just to meet people and start creating relationships with them., When you are networking, it's important not to try to get the person to buy what you're selling. If he or she thinks you are trying to sell rather than build a relationship, that person will likely not stay around long enough to be sold to. Rather, build relationships with people. Have conversations, and make a real connection. Get to know the people you meet for who they are, not what you can sell them., That is, learn how to start conversations and keep them going. One of the simplest ways to start engaging with another person is to smile at him or her.

Ask about their work, their family, their pets, and their hobbies. Just pick one to get the conversation going., If you are trying to engage a person, one of the best ways you can do so is to really listen to the other person. You can show you are listening by using nonverbal clues (nodding and smiling) and repeating what the other person has said (""What I hear you saying is...""). Also, don't use the time the other person is talking to try to come up with a response; actually hear what she is saying instead., Of course, the main social media network for business is LinkedIn. You can meet people on social networking sites by engaging groups and discussions. It's also important that you have information filled out on your profile, so people can see who you are., Once you meet someone, make sure to continue that relationship. Ask for a business card so you can email or call the person to say you enjoy the time you spent with him or her. That way, you stay fresh in that person's mind. It's especially important to call or email if you say you will; people remember when you don't do what you say you will., Remember, the person you are meeting wants to use you for networking, too, so you need to be ready when he or she needs something, as well. Sometimes, it may just be that you can recommend a contact with another person, or maybe you hear about a job or a good real estate deal that you can pass on. Try to keep your contacts in mind, and provide services as you can, especially when someone asks for something specific., When you're establishing relationships, it's fine to let them know you are in real estate. In fact, you'll likely exchange business cards. If you continue contact with person, you'll likely be the person she calls when she has a real estate need.

For instance, choosing between two property locations in A and B can turn into an easy decision if the price trend reflects an increase or decrease in the respective locations.

, After negotiating price with the seller, get ready to accept the offer and go for the completion of legal formalities.


Do not forget to get all the property documents varied by a legal professional to avoid any issues about property title in the future.

Identify your need for an escrow account.,
Read your purchase agreement.,
Find an escrow agent yourself.,
Gather necessary information.,
Visit the escrow company.,
Receive your escrow number.",How to Set Up an Escrow Account1," An escrow account holds money, much like a bank account, except the money is held with an escrow company. The escrow company will only release the money once certain conditions are met.


Escrow accounts are most commonly used in real estate transactions. When the conditions for the sale are satisfied, the escrow agent will release the money to the seller. In this way, the escrow agent guarantees the transaction, making sure each side fulfills its obligations.;
, You create an escrow account with an escrow agent. The real estate agent typically names the escrow company you should use in the purchase agreement.Find your purchase agreement and read it to find the name of the escrow company you should use.


If you are using an agent to buy or sell a home, then the agent should handle setting up the escrow account.

, You might be selling your home in a “private sale,” which means you are not using a real estate agent.In this situation, you will need to find an escrow agent. You can find an escrow agent in the following ways:


Ask your bank if they provide an escrow service.
Search online for escrow agents. You can type “escrow company” and “your city” into your favorite search engine. You can call the phone number provided.
Contact a title insurance agency. Sometimes they will create an escrow account.

, You will need to provide the escrow company with certain information so that they can open the account. The information might vary slightly from company to company, but you generally will need to provide the following:seller’s name and address
buyer’s name and address
purchase price, address, and a description of the property
termite report information, such as who will do the inspection
financing information
rent, if any
any personal property involved in the sale
amount of deposit to be held in the escrow account

, Set up a meeting so that you can complete necessary paperwork. Either the purchaser or the seller can open an escrow account, although sellers typically do. You need to take the deposit with you. You will also need to discuss the conditions of the sale.Remember that the escrow agent is charged with making sure that both buyer and seller fulfill their obligations. You should talk with the escrow agent about what those obligations will be. You should bring a copy of your purchase agreement, since that will contain most of the obligations.

, This is the identification number you will need whenever you call the escrow agent to ask questions or get updates.Be sure to store it someplace where it is always handy, such as a note in your purse or saved on your cell phone.

Identify repairs that need to be made.,
Notify your landlord of the hazard.,
Wait a certain amount of time.,
Get a form from the court clerk.,
Complete the petition form.,
Serve notice of the action on the landlord.,
Attend a hearing.,
Pay rent into the escrow account.",How to Set Up an Escrow Account2," In some states, you can withhold rent from a landlord who does not make necessary repairs. The repairs can’t be for minor things, like small cracks in the walls or missing linoleum or tile.Instead, the danger should be a substantial and serious threat to your health and safety. For example, if no heat is being provided during winter, then you have a serious threat.

, Typically, state law requires that you give the landlord sufficient time to make repairs before withholding rent. Accordingly, you should send written notice to your landlord that repairs are needed.Be specific about the problem in the apartment.
Also explicitly request that the landlord repair the problem as soon as possible.
Be sure to type up a letter and mail it, preferably certified mail, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt as it serves as proof that your landlord received the notice.

, Your landlord generally gets a “reasonable” amount of time to make repairs. If the violation is more serious, then the landlord should correct the problem promptly.


Typically, if the landlord hasn’t acted within 30 days, then you don’t have to wait any longer.Instead, you should stop into your courthouse and ask about creating a “rent escrow.”

, With a rent escrow, you would not pay your rent to the landlord. Instead, you pay it into the escrow, where it accumulates until the landlord actually makes necessary repairs. If you can create a rent escrow in your county, then the clerk should give you the form to complete.


The form might be called an “Application and Affidavit for Tenant Rent Escrow,” “Petition in Action of Rent Escrow,” or some other title., Be sure to enter the information neatly, using black ink or a typewriter. In some counties, you can download the form and type in the information directly. Although each form will differ, you generally will be asked the following:your name and address
your landlord’s name and address
the amount of your rent
the conditions on the property that are hazardous
the date you notified your landlord of the hazard
that you request the creation of a rent escrow
your signature

, You have to give the landlord notice that you are trying to create a rent escrow. Accordingly, you will need to serve notice on your landlord. Generally, you can serve notice by having someone deliver a copy of your petition and also a “summons,” which is a legal document you can get from the court clerk.


Ask the clerk about acceptable methods of service.

, Before the judge will create the escrow account, you will need to attend a hearing.You will have to explain why you want to withhold rent and create the escrow. Be sure to bring any evidence that you have:


a witness who can testify as to the hazardous condition
photographs or video of the hazard
a copy of your notice to your landlord

, If the judge creates the escrow account, then you will need to regularly pay your rent into it. Be sure to make your payments, since the judge might close the escrow if you forget to.The judge may order that some or all of the money in the escrow be given to the landlord to help pay for the repairs.
If the landlord still refuses to make repairs, then all of the money in the escrow could be returned to you.

Identify your need.,
Calculate how much you will need.,
Set up a savings account.,
Pay your non-monthly expenses from the escrow account.",How to Set Up an Escrow Account3," A personal escrow is a nice idea for someone who has difficulty controlling their spending. It isn’t technically an escrow—no third party oversees the account—but you can benefit from segregating your money into a separate account. Personal escrows are used often for the following purposes:Non-monthly expenses. For example, you might be billed quarterly for car insurance and annually for a gym membership. A personal escrow can help you save sufficient funds for these expenses.
Unforeseen expenses. These are small expenses which catch you by surprise—gifts that you need to purchase for the host of a party, unexpected veterinary expenses or car repairs, etc.

, You should go through your bills for the past year and check how much you had to spend on non-monthly expenses. Also pay attention to unexpected expenses, such as the bottle of wine you had to buy someone when you were invited to their dinner party. Non-monthly expenses could include:car insurance premiums
car registration
car repair and maintenance
life insurance premiums
conference fees
veterinary expenses
gifts
holiday shopping
school or tuition expenses

, You should set up a separate savings account (or high yield checking account) which you can use for a specific purpose, such as paying non-monthly bills. You could also set up multiple individual accounts for each non-monthly expense, though this could be difficult for you to handle.To properly fund your account, total all non-monthly expenses, then divide by 12. This is the amount you will need to contribute to your account each month.
You should set up automatic deposit, so that this amount is deducted from your monthly paycheck. If you are paid biweekly, then divide your total amount by 26.

, Whenever an unexpected or non-monthly expense arises, remember to take the money out of your escrow account. In this way, you can preserve the balance in your regular savings and/or checking account.

Be aware of tax consequences.",How to Short Sale Your Home," This is usually a pretty simple step. You may have an idea, based on your town’s appraisal for real estate tax purposes. However, the best way to estimate value is to contact a real estate broker and ask for an opinion of the value. The broker will study your home and compare it with recent sales of other properties in your area. The broker will then give you a written estimate of the expected value of your home.


Most brokers will provide a written estimate of value at no charge. This is not as involved as a full “appraisal” of your property, which usually has a fee attached.
You can also get a quick estimate of your property’s value online. If you search for “real estate value estimate,” you will find several sources that provide an estimate of value. You will be asked to enter your address, and within seconds you will get an estimate.;
, Check your most recent statement from the bank to see the amount outstanding on your mortgage. If you have multiple mortgages on the property, make sure to include them all and add them together.


Ask your lender for a payout quote to find out what you owe. This will make it easier to determine what you owe.

, If the amount of your mortgage is greater than the estimated value of your home, then you have a “deficiency.” Some people refer to this situation as “being underwater” on your mortgage. Subtract the estimated value of your home from the amount due on your mortgage(s) to find the amount.


For example, suppose the broker estimates a value of $200,000 for your home, and you have a first mortgage of $175,000 and a second mortgage of $50,000. The total debt is $225,000, and the deficiency, therefore, is $25,000.
Remember that this is only a theoretical amount. Until you actually have an offer from a buyer, and conduct a sale (which will have some costs associated with it), you will not know what the actual deficiency amount is.

, If your home’s value is less than the amount you owe, and especially if you have difficulty paying the mortgage bills each month, you may wish to consider a short sale. A short sale can get you out of your obligations, and you can find a new home that you can more easily afford. A short sale will be a negative mark against your credit rating, but it can help you avoid foreclosure, which would probably be worse. It would be a good idea to discuss this possibility with an attorney, accountant or licensed real estate broker.Keep in mind that a short sale may have some serious tax consequences and it may not get you out of your obligations, so it is important to consider your situation carefully before proceeding.

, Before you short sale your home, consider using one of two government programs designed to help you refinance your home. The first, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), allows homeowners who are behind on their loans to modify their existing loans to a more manageable monthly payment. The second, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) allows homeowners who are able to pay their mortgage payments, but are unable to refinance, a chance to refinance despite being underwater on their loan (owing more than the home is worth) or having a reduced income.


If either of these situations sounds like yours, contact your lender for more information about these programs.
HARP is also useful for borrowers who have experienced a decline in the value of their home since purchasing it.
Refinancing may lead to a lower interest rate and, accordingly, a lower monthly payment., Some lenders that do not want to participate in a short sale may be willing to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This is an arrangement whereby you will just sign over the deed to your home to the bank, and the bank will agree to accept it in full satisfaction of your debt.Keep in mind that this may not be a good alternative if your home is in sale condition. This transaction will appear on rental reports as a negative mortgage history. Talk with a Realtor before you sign over your deed because it might not be necessary.

, Check your latest mortgage bill or monthly statement. You will find a phone number for customer service or the lending office. Contact them and say that you are interested in talking with someone about a possible short sale of your property. The lender will review your account and let you know if they will consider a short sale.You will need to contact multiple lenders if more than one entity has a lien on the home. Both lenders must be satisfied before the short sale can go forward.
Before contacting your lender directly, you may wish to consult with a lawyer and have the lawyer contact the lender.

, When you use the phrase “short sale,” the lender will refer to this as “loss mitigation.” This means that you are trying to reduce your losses on your property. As part of the application, the lender is likely to require you to provide the following documentation:financial statement
proof of current income
recent tax returns
copies of recent bank statements
hardship letter (This is a statement, in the form of a letter, in which you explain to the bank why you are asking for the short sale. There is no specific form, but you need to give an understandable reason for your financial hardship. Some examples might be recent unemployment, medical emergency, divorce, death in the family.)

, Even in a short sale, you are encouraged to use a real estate broker to maximize the publicity of the property and get the best offer.This stage is really no different than any other sale of a property. You are hoping to get the best offer possible, to help you pay off your mortgage(s).


Keep in mind that the property will usually need to be in the MLS system for a minimum amount of time to ensure that it is being sold at market value and that as many buyers as possible have the opportunity to buy it.

, When you receive an offer that you believe is reasonable, based on the advice of your broker, you will notify the lender. You, your broker and your lender are essentially partners at this point, trying to get the best price for your home. Keep your lender informed of the offers that you receive. You will eventually get an offer that the three of you believe is the best possible. The lender should give you a statement in writing that the offer will be acceptable for the purpose of the short sale.Before approving a short sale, lenders will typically want to see the comps. They will also request a broker price opinion (BPO) from another Realtor who is not the listing agent.

, Once the offer has been made and you and your bank have accepted it, then there are some procedures for completing the sale. The real estate broker will most likely take care of everything to get you to the closing. The buyer will need to obtain financing, a title report must be completed, and the sale documents must be prepared. When this is all done, you will attend the closing and sell your home. A representative of the lender will probably attend as well.


Be aware that you may end up waiting for a while to get the lender’s decision, but having a Realtor on your side who is persistent and keeps in contact with the lender may help to move things along.
Make sure to turn in everything on time because turning in something late may make it necessary to start the process all over again.

, In order to avoid any further liability toward your lender, you need to finish this deal with a written settlement agreement. Get a statement in writing from the lender that verifies that they accept the sale proceeds in full satisfaction of your mortgage.The agreement needs to identify the mortgage clearly and with specificity. Make sure it refers to the date and amount of the original mortgage, along with any other identifying information that the bank may have, such as a loan number or file number.
Be sure that the statement uses the phrase “in full satisfaction” and that it clearly waives the lender’s right to collect any deficiency amount.

, This is the most important part of the short sale. Under normal circumstances, anytime you sell your home with a mortgage on it, you must pay the mortgage in full. If you do not, then be aware that in some states the lender has the right to sue you for any remaining amount that is due. Always consult with an attorney to find out what kind of mortgage you have and how many mortgages are on the property.


For example, if you owe $250,000 on your mortgage, but at a short sale your best offer is only $200,000, the bank will have a deficiency of $50,000. In most states, the bank will be able to sue you for this remaining amount, unless they have agreed not to.
You have to consider the costs related to the sale when you calculate a deficiency. In the example above, if the buyer’s offer is $200,000, there will be costs associated with the sale. The broker’s commission will be approximately 5%, or $10,000, and there will be other legal fees and costs of conducting the sale. In the end, you may actually only receive $180-185,000. In this case, your deficiency will be more like $65,000.

, If your home only has one mortgage, then negotiating a short sale may be a good possibility. But if you have a second or third mortgage as well, it becomes more difficult. Using the short sale to fully payoff your debts only works if the lender agrees. In a short sale, usually only the first mortgage will get paid off. The second or third mortgages get nothing. They are not likely to agree, and will likely sue you for a deficiency., If you have conducted a short sale, but one or more lenders have not agreed to accept the sale in full satisfaction of their loan, then you will be facing a deficiency judgment. If you file bankruptcy, you will most likely be able to discharge that debt, which means you will not be responsible for paying it. Bankruptcy does not look good on a credit rating, but it does prevent creditors from pursuing you further and it lets you get on with your life. You should talk with an attorney about this option.Alternatives to bankruptcy include renegotiation of debt or allowing a judgement (if you have no assets, a judgement is essentially uncollectible).
Keep in mind that if your home is heading towards foreclosure, then bankruptcy can put a hold on the foreclosure process and give you more time to get an offer. Before the property is sold, you can cancel the bankruptcy or you can continue with it in conjunction with the sale. Discuss your options with your attorney to be sure.

, When you get approval from your lender to forgive any deficiency, that forgiven amount is actually considered “income” for tax purposes. You will be responsible for reporting the amount of the deficiency and pay income tax on it.For example, suppose you owed the bank $250,000, but the short sale (after expenses) only produced $200,000. If the bank accepted that as full satisfaction of your debt, then you “earned” $50,000 and must report it on your tax return as income.
Make sure to check with an accountant regarding the current laws around forgiveness.

Review an agent's online presence before making a decision.,
Ask for a 90-day contract.",How to Select a Realtor," One designation many agents have is that of Realtor. A Realtor is a member of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). To receive that distinction (it's actually a trademark), an agent must undergo additional training, demonstrate appropriate professional skills, and subscribe to the NAR code of ethics.Other designations to look for include:ABR, or Accredited Buyer's Representative. This means the agent has passed courses in buyer representation and would know how to protect your interests when negotiating a purchase or a mortgage.MRP, or Military Relocation Professional. An agent who is an MRP has experience working with military personnel and their families.
CIPS, or a Certified International Property Specialist. If you want to buy property overseas, an agent with this designation will know exactly how to help you.
SRES, or Seniors Real Estate Specialist. If you are over 50, an SRES is a good choice, as s/he specializes in meeting your particular needs.;
, Your agent must have a current license. Make sure your agent has completed all the proper training before doing business with him/her.


Your state has a real estate regulatory board, which can be found online. Your agent's name should be listed on the website among the licensed agents in the area.You can also check to see if there's been any disciplinary action or complaints about an agent. You might not want to work with someone who has a reputation for dishonesty in the community.Any prizes such as an ""Agent of the Year"" award are also a plus. If you're looking for the best possible option, it's a good idea to select someone who has stood out from the crowd during the course of a career., A good agent will gladly provide you with a list of past clients on request. You can contact these people and ask them for an honest assessment of the agent's skills. In addition, seek out reviews and testimonials online. Look on the agent's website or review sites like Yelp to see what others are saying about the agent.


A good question to ask past clients is the difference between the asking price and selling price in their case. This will give you a sense of how well the agent was able to reduce prices for buyers or maintain prices for sellers.Ask the client about their overall experience. Ask if the agent could have done anything better, whether the client would recommend the agent to a friend, and what the agent's strengths and weaknesses are.Remember to account for human subjectivity. Some people are difficult to please, so you should contact more than one past client to get an accurate read., There are a few warning signs you should watch for when selecting an agent.


If you're selling your home, and the agent immediately suggests a very high listing price, this is a bad sign. Pricing a home too high means it could take a lot longer to sell. An experienced professional will know better than to do this except in a very hot market.An agent who only works part time might not be the best choice. They tend to be less experienced and less dedicated to their clients.If the agent does not typically deal with the kind of property you're buying or selling, try to find another agent. Find someone who can cater to your specific needs.Do not pick someone who does not usually deal with people looking to buy in your price range. As agents are paid on commission, they'll pay more attention to wealthier clients. If your agent typically deals with luxury homes, and you're looking for a modest starting home, that agent may not necessarily be helpful for you., A good Realtor may not fit all of your criteria, but they might be well-equipped to help you. Don't immediately discount Realtors for things like a lack of experience or sales. Be willing to go with a newer Realtor if they seem motivated, hard-working, and knowledgeable., Before hiring one, interview several. Ask as many questions as possible to get a sense of whether an agent is right for you.


Ask how long the agent has been in the business. You would prefer someone with a lot of experience. Ask how many buyers the agent has dealt with. Agents who work part time or don't take many clients might not be as adept as others.Ask what kinds of properties the agent typically handles. You want someone who buys and sells properties like yours or the kind you're looking for.Ask the agent how s/he plans to communicate with you. You don't want someone who's hard to get a hold of or who utilizes only one medium of communication. Good agents will communicate on your terms. Buying or selling a home is complicated enough without having to rely on someone who's hard to work with., Once you've conducted interviews, look at the listings the agent advertises. These can be found on the agent's website, national websites like Realtor.com., and local advertising.


How closely do the agent's listings match the type of home you want to buy? Do you see anything right away that's interesting to you? These are questions to ask yourself while looking over available listings.Pay attention to price range. Does the agent typically work within your price range? If not, you might not get as much attention as you need., Even after talking to the agent and past clients, review the agent's online presence. Look for reviews that the agent cannot control. If a particular client had a very bad experience, the agent will likely not have used this person as a reference.


Online reviews are subjective. People often go to sites like Yelp when very frustrated or angry and enjoy the anonymity provided by such sites. While you should have some skepticism regarding such outlets, if there are a lot of bad reviews and accusations of shady dealings, this is a bad sign., It's a good idea to ask for a 90-day contract with an agent. If your relationship with the agent works out well, you can renew. If it does not, you can let the contract expire without having wasted too much time with the wrong person. See if the agent you're considering is willing to provide a short-term contract or even a short trial period before signing any paperwork."

Attend your consultation.,
Ask about fees.,
Ask which attorney will work on the case.,
Answer questions accurately and honestly.The attorney will need a better understanding of the facts of your case and should be able to discuss in general terms how he or she will proceed and how your tax case will be handled.

,
Request a referral.",How to Select a Property Tax Attorney," Search online for tax attorneys, by typing in “tax attorney” and then your state. If you live in Alabama, for example, you would type “tax attorneys in Alabama.” Look for attorneys who have offices in your county or city.


You can also search through online phone directories, such as Yellow Pages, Yellow Book, or Switchboard.
Visit your state’s bar association website or call them and ask for a referral. State bar associations keep referral lists which can be searched by area of legal specialty.;
, Ask friends or business associates if they have ever worked with a property tax attorney. Ask them about their experience with their attorney.As in other areas, a referral from someone who has had direct experience with a professional and whose judgment you trust can be a reliable guide.

, Once you have a list of attorneys, run web searches to look for their website. It is standard practice today for lawyers to have a website. Here are a few things to look for when you find the website:


Prior property tax experience. Attorneys should list representative cases they have worked on. Look to see that they have worked on property tax cases during the past couple years.
Information about tax or property law. Many attorneys keep blogs on their website. Check to see if the attorney has written articles about property tax issues. This will show that she is engaged in this area of law.
Professional affiliations. Look for any professional organizations that the attorney belongs to, especially those related to property tax. The National Association of Property Tax Attorneys is a group of real estate attorneys across the nation who work in the field.Grammar and spelling. An abundance of grammar and spelling errors signals that the attorney is sloppy. An attorney should be able to use proper grammar, or at the least know how to turn on the spell check.

, Many websites offer free reviews of businesses, including law firms and individual attorneys. Some places to look for reviews include Find Law, Avvo, and Yahoo Local.


Be mindful that negative reviews often outnumber positive reviews since those who are upset are often more motivated to leave reviews.Furthermore, reviews are one-sided, offering only the client’s perspective.
Find out if the attorney has earned a Martindale-Hubbell rating. ""AV"" is the highest ability/highest ethics rating based on the opinion of lawyers and judges who know the attorney. Only 10% of American lawyers have achieved this rating.Only 50% of all lawyers have earned a rating, so A-B-C rated lawyers are in the top 50%. Moreover, you cannot have an ability rating unless you have earned the highest ethics rating (the ""V"" rating)., Call the attorney and ask for a consultation. A receptionist may ask you a series of preliminary questions to find out if your legal issue is one that the attorney works on. If it is, then the receptionist should schedule you for either an in-person or telephone consultation.


Try to get an in-person consultation. This will ensure that you like the attorney and know that you can work with him or her.
The consultation will likely be free. More and more attorneys offer free consultations. If the attorney wants to charge a fee, it should be small (not more than $50). However, if you don’t want to pay any fee, then rest assured that there will be plenty of attorneys who will meet with you for free.

, You can prepare for the consultation by writing out a short list of questions. Be sure to ask: br>


The number of property tax cases the attorney has handled in the past 5 years.
If the attorney knows the people who assess property taxes.

, Arrive early and prepared. Be sure to bring any documents requested.For example, the attorney will probably want to see a copy of your property tax assessment or home appraisal.

, An attorney should be willing to discuss his fee schedule during a free consultation.Be sure to ask about costs as well. Many property tax attorneys will work on a contingency fee basis. Under this arrangement, the attorney will not be paid anything unless she recovers money for you. You will still probably have to pay for costs, such as filing fees.


If the attorney offers only hourly rates, ask if she would be open to a contingency or a flat-fee arrangement. Flat fees are often available for routine legal tasks of little complexity.
If you decide to hire the attorney then you will have to sign an engagement letter. This letter will spell out the attorney’s obligations and define the scope of the representation. It should also lay out in detail the fee schedule. Check to see that you are being charged the same fee as was quoted at the consultation.
If the fees are different, ask why before signing the engagement letter.

, In large firms, work is often handed off to junior attorneys to complete and then reviewed by the senior attorney. Clarify what portion of the work will be completed by junior attorneys.


For example, ask if the senior attorney attends all of the hearings. If not, ask whether he sometimes assigns this task to non-lawyers, as he is authorized to do in most jurisdictions.

,, If the attorney cannot represent you, either because of a conflict or because he does not practice the specific area of law, then ask for a referral. An attorney probably knows several other property tax attorneys and could be a good source of recommendations.


When contacting the referred attorney, be sure to mention who referred you to him or her.

Wait to receive your recorded deed.",How to Transfer Real Estate Property," There are a few kinds of deeds. Each can transfer property. But they differ in the amount of protection that they give the buyer.



Warranty Deed. With this deed, the seller guarantees that he or she owns the property being transferred.If the seller does not actually hold title, then the buyer can sue for compensation. A warranty deed provides the buyer with the most protection. You should use it if you don’t know the seller.Quitclaim Deed. With a quitclaim deed, the seller transfers whatever interest in the property that they own. However, the seller does not promise that it actually owns the title to the property.Because quitclaim deeds provide less protection, they are usually used to transfer property between family members or between close friends.

Grant Deed. With a grant deed, the seller promises that the title hasn’t been transferred to someone else.Grant deeds are not available in all states.;
, To transfer the property, you need the legal description of the property. You can find this information on the current deed.


If you don’t have a copy of the deed in your possession, you should go to the Recorder of Deeds office in your county and get a copy.
The description of property will be listed under “Legal Description” or “Description.” The property will usually be written as metes and bounds, which usually begins with the following language: “Commencing for reference at the dividing line between the City of.…”, You can also use the property’s tax identification number—though you should use this number to supplement the legal description of property. Some deeds will request this number as a form of identification as well.You can get the tax number from your property tax bill or by visiting the local tax assessor’s office.

, You can find blank deed forms in a variety of places. These “fill in the blank” forms make transferring property easy. To find an appropriate form, you can look in the following places:


Your county town office. You can stop in and ask if they have a blank deed form available.
Online. There are many deed forms online. You should look for a copy from a reputable source, such as a bar association of attorneys or from your county government.Books. There are books or compact discs of legal forms for sale at many retailers. They often have blank deed forms you can use.

, At the beginning of the deed, you need to identify the sellers and the buyers. The seller is typically called the “grantor” while the buyer is called the “grantee.”The form should read something like the following: “This deed, made on June 1, 2015 between Michael J. Smith (‘Grantor’) and Alice K. Jones and Adam Y. Jones (‘Grantees’).”, If you are transferring the property to more than one person, then you have to specify how the grantees will hold the property. People can hold a property in the following ways:Tenants in common. The grantees can take unequal shares. For example, you might transfer property to two siblings, one of whom will take 70% ownership and the other will take 30% ownership. Either person can sell their share when they want. Also, when one owner dies, their share can be left to whoever they want.

Language to create a tenancy in common would read: “Grantor, for a valuable consideration, conveys to Grantees, Alice K. Jones and Adam Y. Jones, as tenants in common, the following described real estate, together with rents, profits, fixtures, and other appurtenant interests, in Dane County, State of Wisconsin (‘Property’):”Joint tenants. The grantees take equal shares. When one dies, the other grantee gets the share automatically.

Sample language: “…to Grantees, Alice K. Jones and Adam Y. Jones, as joint owners with rights of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.…”Tenants by the entirety. This is also called “community property.” Each spouse owns the whole property and neither can transfer their right in the property without the consent of the other spouse.Sample language: “…to Grantees, Alice K. Jones and Adam Y. Jones, husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, and not as tenants in common….”, The form will have a blank space for the legal description of property. You can type in the entire legal description of property on the face of the deed. Often, however, people will state “See Attachment A” and then attach a description of the property. If the description is especially lengthy, you might want to use an attachment.


If you use an attachment, clearly label the piece of paper “Attachment A.”
Make sure that you describe the property accurately. Have someone else look at the description on the current deed and the description you have typed into the transfer deed. If the description is different, then the deed will probably be invalid.

, If you drafted your own deed, you might want to show it to a lawyer before executing it. A lawyer can look over the deed and make sure that you have not left anything out.


You can get a referral to a real estate lawyer by calling your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.
You should be particularly careful when trying to transfer a deed to a couple as joint tenants. The law in this area is fairly complicated, and you could benefit from a lawyer’s advice.If you don’t want to pay for the lawyer, then the buyers could pay for the lawyer to look over the deed.

, In some states, you need people to witness the transfer of real estate property.In other states, like Ohio for example, a deed no longer must be witnessed.To find out if you need witnesses, you should read your state’s law. It should be published online. You can search by typing “your state” and “real estate transfer witnesses” into your favorite web engine.
You can also stop by your county manager’s office and ask if they know whether you need your deed witnessed.
If you get a printed form from the county, then check if there are signature lines for witnesses. If there are, then you should get witnesses.

, Whoever is selling the property must sign the deed. Their signatures must also be notarized.You can get a document notarized by signing in front of a notary public. Notaries can be found at most courthouses, town offices, and large banks.


You can also find a notary by visiting the American Society of Notaries website and using the Locator function. Type in your address to find the nearest notary.If the property is owned by more than one person, then all owners must sign the deed. To make things easy, you can all go to the notary public at the same time.

, You must show the notary sufficient personal identification. Generally, a valid driver’s license or passport should be sufficient. The notary will need to confirm who you are before notarizing the document.


All people who are signing the deed need personal identification.
You should expect to pay the notary a small fee for his or her services.

, You need to record the deed in the county where the land is located. The appropriate office might go by different names:County Recorder’s office
Land Registry office
Registrar of Titles
Register of Deeds

, Take your deed to the appropriate office and tell the clerk that you want to record the deed. The clerk should look over the deed to see that it has been filled out properly.


You will have to pay a fee in order to record the new deed.You should call ahead and ask the clerk the amount and acceptable methods of payment.

, You will probably also have to pay a “transfer tax” to transfer the land.The tax is typically calculated based on the amount paid for the property.


Each state has its own rules on who pays the transfer tax. In some states, such as Maine, the tax is divided equally between the grantor and the grantee.In others, like New York, the grantor pays the tax., It usually takes four to eight weeks to record the deed and have a copy sent to you. You will receive your copy in the mail.If you don’t receive a copy of the deed after eight weeks, you should call the Recorder’s office and ask.

Await the verdict.",How to Take Action Against the Breach of a Purchase and Sale Agreement," You need to learn why the other party is breaching the contract in order to determine how you will proceed. If the other party is breaching by choice, you might be able to ask for more substantial remedies (i.e., specific performance) than if the other party is breaching because it is impossible for them to meet the terms of the agreement. When you contact the breaching party, have an honest conversation about the circumstances and try to understand their side of things. Having this conversation early could avoid a lot of problems down the road.;
, When you contact the other party, you need to do it in a way that leaves a trail of evidence regarding your efforts. Start by calling the other party and having an informal conversation. If the conversation does not resolve the dispute, send an email to the other party so you have a paper trail of your efforts. If you need to go further, you may have to send an official letter and maybe even official notice that they are in breach of the contract. These notices, letters, and emails will provide you with important paper trails if you should decide to sue.


Additionally, you should consider offering the other party an opportunity to resolve the dispute through mediation or binding arbitration. By doing this, you are evidencing your willingness to resolve the dispute amicably. Some courts might even require you take these steps before going to trial.

, Your agreement might spell out what actions you can take if one side breaches. Because you agreed to these remedies ahead of time, you are probably limited to the remedies spelled out in the purchase and sale agreement.The agreement might also tell you how much time you have to bring any lawsuit.As soon as you realize the sale has fallen through, take out your copy of the agreement and read it.
A lot of purchase and sale agreements will contain binding arbitration agreements, which require you to arbitrate your dispute instead of litigating it. If you're contract contains one of these provisions, you may be limited in how you can proceed with a dispute.
You also need to look for venue provisions, which restrict where you can bring a lawsuit. For example, your contract might state that any litigation needs to be brought in a certain county in a certain state.
Some contracts will also dictate that attorneys' fees will be awarded to the winning party. If this is the case, you may be able to use this clause to your advantage during settlement negotiations.

, Your state’s law may tell you what options are available. For example, in Minnesota (and other states), the following three remedies are generally available to you if the other party breached the contract:Cancel the contract. Either the buyer or seller could cancel the contract. The seller may be able to keep the earnest money deposited.
Sue for “specific performance.” This means you sue and ask the judge to order the seller or buyer to go through with the sale. Generally, a buyer is more likely to get specific performance, although a seller can sometimes force a buyer to purchase the property. Specific performance is only ordered when the injured party can’t get another adequate remedy.
Sue for damages. Money compensation is called “damages.” If the failure to close the sale cost you financially, then you can be compensated for the financial damage you suffered.

, You can only sue for a breach of a valid contract. However, there are many contingencies in the standard purchase and sale agreement, particularly for buyers.A contract is not binding until all contingencies are satisfied. Accordingly, you need to check whether all of them were satisfied:Financing contingencies. Many purchase and sale agreements make the sale contingent on the buyer getting financing. If he or she can’t get financing, then there isn’t a valid contract to breach.
Inspection contingencies. Another common contingency is for an inspection to be performed and for the buyer to be satisfied with the results. If one wasn’t performed, or the inspection reveals defects, then the buyer hasn’t breached the contract by backing out.
Contingencies for sale of the buyer’s home. Because a buyer often needs to sell their home first to free up money, many contracts contain a contingency for sale of the buyer’s home. If the buyer can’t sell their home, then there isn’t a valid contract.
Contingency for title review. The buyer reviews the home’s title report to uncover whether the home is free and clear of any liens or other problems.If no report is provided or if the home has liens, then the buyer can back out of the sale.

, To fully understand your options, you should meet for a consultation with a qualified real estate lawyer.Take your copy of the contract with you and ask for the lawyer’s advice.


You can find a qualified lawyer by contacting your state or local bar association. Bar associations are lawyer organizations and most provide referrals.
Think about hiring the lawyer to represent you, especially if a lot of money is at stake. It can be difficult to bring a lawsuit yourself, and a qualified attorney can make your strongest case possible.

, Generally, the buyer and seller can come to a mutual agreement to cancel the contract. Because you are mutually deciding how to end the contract, you can also decide what happens to the earnest money. You could split it, return it to the buyer, or let the seller keep it.This is a great opportunity to take part in mediation if the other party agrees. A mediator will help you and the other party find common ground and create a mutual agreement that helps both parties.
Both sides should sign a “mutual rescission agreement,” which formalizes that you have ended the contract.
You can find sample rescission agreements online., Unfortunately, both sides might not be able to reach a mutual agreement. You should read your state law to find out what steps to take in this situation. In some states, there is a “statutory cancellation” procedure.For example, in Minnesota, the buyer or the seller can send a legal notice to the other side telling them that they are in default of the contract. Also remind them of how much time they have to fix (“cure”) the default.
You should read your state statute, which will contain language you need to include in your legal notice.

, After serving your legal notice, you might have to wait to give the other side a certain amount of time to go through with the sale. If the other side doesn’t go through, then you can cancel the contract.When the seller refuses to cure, then the buyer is usually entitled to a refund of the earnest money.
However, if the buyer refuses to cure, then the seller can typically keep the earnest money.

, According to the “statue of frauds,” contracts for the sale of land must be in writing.If you had only an oral contract, then you probably can’t sue because there isn’t a valid agreement.

, In many states, you can file your complaint in the county or district court where the property is located. However, in some states, you have to file in a particular court depending on whether you are asking the judge for specific performance or for money damages.


Some states have “equity” courts and “law” courts. You can ask for specific performance by filing in equity court, since law courts cannot provide that remedy. However, if you sue for money damages, then you would file your lawsuit in the law courts.Check your state’s judiciary website to see if your state maintains separate law and equity courts. Many states no longer do. Nevertheless, you should find out ahead of time whether your state does so that you will file your complaint in the correct court.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a complaint. In the complaint, you identify yourself as the “plaintiff” and the other party as the “defendant.” You also give the judge some idea of the factual circumstances of the dispute and make a request for relief (i.e., specific performance or money damages).Your lawyer should draft the complaint. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you can ask the court clerk if there is a printed “fill in the blank” form you can use.
Alternately, you could look in a book of legal forms for sample complaints. You can find these books at your local library or at a bookstore.

, If you sue for damages, then you need to prove to a court that you suffered financially because of the failed sale. There are a couple ways to calculate damages:


Generally, a seller can calculate their damages by subtracting the amount the house sold for from the amount listed in the breached purchase and sale agreement. For example, the buyer might have agreed to buy a house for $500,000 but then backed out. If the seller sells the house for $400,000 to a second buyer, then the seller can generally get $100,000 in compensation. The seller can also add on any amounts spent to maintain the property.The buyer must also prove any financial damage suffered from the failed sale. For example, he or she might have had to rent temporary housing as a consequence of the breach.

, Make several copies of your complaint and take the copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date.


You may have to pay a filing fee. The amount will differ by court, so call ahead of time and ask the court clerk for the amount and acceptable methods of payment.

, You must provide notice to the other side that you are filing a lawsuit. Generally, you will provide notice by sending a copy of your complaint and a summons, which you can get from the court clerk. Service can typically be made in the following ways:Hire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers in your phone book or online. They typically charge $45-75 per service.Pay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery. They typically charge about the same amount as private process servers.
Have someone 18 or older not related to the case make hand delivery on the other side.

, Whoever makes service usually has to complete a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service” form, which you can get from your court clerk. The server completes the form and signs it in front of a notary public before returning the form to you.


Make a copy of the completed form and file the original with the court to show that service was made., Typically, the other side will respond to your lawsuit by filing an answer in which they deny your allegations and possibly raise different affirmative defenses, such as your waiting too long to sue.A copy should be sent to you. Read it closely and understand what arguments the defendant makes.


In addition to an answer, the defendant might also file counterclaims against you. Counterclaims are like mini-lawsuits that result in you becoming the defendant for those claims. The defendant's counterclaims must arise out of the same actions you are suing for.

, Once the defendant files his or her response, a period of ""discovery"" will commence during which you can get information about the case from the other party. During discovery you will gather facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other party is going to say, and see how good your case is. You can accomplish these things by using the following tools:Depositions, which are in person interviews conducted under oath. The answers given during these interviews can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to parties and witnesses. The questions must be answered under oath and the answer given can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents from the other party. You can request almost anything that is relevant to the case including emails, text messages, phone records, and contracts.
Requests for admission, which are written statements sent to the other party. The other party will have to admit or deny each factual statement that is sent to them.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will usually file a motion for summary judgment. To succeed, the defendant will have to show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the other party will have to persuade the judge that, even if every fact was assumed to be in your favor, you would still lose the court case.


To oppose this motion, you will file one of your own. Your motion will try to persuade the judge that there are issues of fact that need to be hashed out at trial. You can prove this by providing the judge with evidence and affidavits.If the defendant filed counterclaims against you, you might consider filing a motion for summary judgment on those issues.

, You might be suing for a small amount of damages. In this situation, it could make sense to try and settle your lawsuit out of court. You could negotiate a settlement, participate in mediation, or try non-binding arbitration.


Mediation is ideal if you don’t have a lawyer. You and the other side meet with a third party neutral, who is the “mediator.” The mediator listens to each side and then helps you work towards a mutually-agreeable solution. Mediators generally charge about $70-400 an hour, which you could split with the other side.To find a mediator, you should contact your local courthouse or local bar association and check if they offer referrals.
If mediation doesn't work, you might try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, you and the other party will meet with a judge-like third party who will listen to both sides present evidence. At the end, the arbitrator will issue his or her opinion, which will state who they think won and how much should be awarded to the prevailing party. Because this is non-binding, neither party will need to abide by the arbitrator's decision unless both parties agree to be bound.

, If you fail to settle your case, trial may be inevitable. Before you go to court, you will take part in one last pretrial conference. During this conference, you and the other party will sit down with the judge to discuss a trial schedule. Make sure you bring up every issue you want to raise during trial. If you fail to get an issue on the trial schedule, the judge might not let you present evidence on that issue once trial starts., If you or the defendant elected to have a jury trial, you will choose your jury through a process called ""voire dire"". During voire dire, you and the defendant will have an opportunity to ask questions of potential jurors in order to assess their ability to fairly hear your case. If you think a potential juror has a bias, you can excuse them. A jury is chosen when both parties agree to the jury that is currently in the jury box., As the plaintiff, you will make your opening statements first. The purpose of your opening statement is to describe the issues of the trial and the facts you intend to prove in support of your case. This is not an opportunity to present evidence and you should avoid talking about the law as much as possible. Keep your opening statement short and to the point.


After you present your opening statement, the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same., You will present your case before the defendant by calling witnesses to the stand, taking their testimony, and presenting physical evidence through them. This is your opportunity to show the judge and/or jury the facts of the case and why you should win. After you ask your questions to each witness (called direct examination), the defendant will have an opportunity to conduct cross-examination.


You will rest (i.e., end your presentation of evidence) after you have called all of your witnesses and presented all of your evidence., The defendant will present their case after you rest. During the defendant's presentation of evidence, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses after the defendant questions them. The purpose of cross-examination is to challenge the witnesses testimony.


For example, if a witness testifies to one fact but a prior statement or document contradicts that testimony, you can use that information to ""impeach"" the witness., After both parties have rested and all the evidence has been presented, you will be given an opportunity to address the judge and/or jury one last time. This opportunity, called closing arguments, should be used to summarize the evidence, explain how the evidence falls in your favor, and explain why you should win the case.


Once you make your closing arguments, the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same., Once the trial is over, the fact-finder (jury or judge) will deliberate and discuss the trial in private. Once the fact-finder comes to a conclusion as to who should win the case, they will present their decision to the judge. The judge will look it over and announce the verdict to both parties. If you win, you will be awarded damages and/or equitable relief.


If you lose, you might be able to appeal the decision if your judge did something wrong. If you want to appeal, you need to file your appeal papers soon after the verdict is read and judgment is entered( usually within 30 days)."

Pre Screen before handing out the application.,
Ask serious applicants to fill out an application.,
Request references.,
Ask for lifestyle information.,
Don’t ask discriminatory questions.,
Review the application before proceeding.,
Run a credit check.,
Run a background check.,
Call the person’s references.,
Ask the person in for a detailed viewing and interview.,
Ask questions to help you get to know the person better.,
Figure out if it’s a good personality match.,
Compare and contrast with other applicants before making your decision.",How to Screen Tenants," Before you even give out the application, or invite people to see the place you're renting, do a prescreening over the phone. This is an easy way to eliminate the people for whom the property just isn't right for whatever reason. Prescreening will save both you and the applicants time and money, since you won't have to bother doing credit and background checks.


Ask up front to make sure all your basic qualifications with regards to pets, smoking, and so on are met. If smoking is a deal breaker, for example, don't wait until the person comes in for a viewing to find out.
Answer their questions to see if it’s a good fit, too. Invite the applicants to ask you questions about the property and neighborhood, and give honest answers.;
, You can design your own application or download a standard one and print it out for your applicants. The most important purpose of a rental application is to obtain information that will help you decide whether the tenant has a stable job and finances, so you can be reasonably sure they'll be able to pay rent on time. Ask the following questions on the application:


Ask for the name, birth date, address and social security number of anyone who will be on the lease. You need this information so you can conduct a credit and background check.Ask about applicants' job history and current employment. Get detailed information about where they are employed and how long they've worked there.
Ask about current income. The monthly income should be at least three times as high as the monthly rent.

, Either on the same application or using a separate form, it's important to have applications provide information on previous landlords as well as job references and personal references. The references should paint a clear picture of the applicant's history as a tenant, employee and neighbor. No matter how well the applicant checks out in other areas, if one of his or her references doesn't recommend that you rent to him, you probably want to heed that advice.


Ask for the names and phone number of three or more references. Specify that you want to talk to the last landlord the person had as well as his or her employer.
You can also ask the applicant to specify why he or she left previous residences, and how things stand with the previous landlords.

, Try to figure out what type of situation you'll be getting into by renting to each particular person. Things will go more smoothly if you pick someone who fits with the vibe in the building. For example, if you own an apartment building and your other tenants are mostly seniors, you might run into trouble if you rent to members of a rock band who want to practice in the apartment.


Request to know the of people who will live in the apartment, including children.
Find out whether they have pets, and what size the pets are. You have the right to deny people or charge a higher security deposit to account for pets.

, The Federal Fair Housing Acts prohibit landlords from refusing tenants based on certain qualities. Make sure your application doesn't have questions that could be construed as discriminatory, and don't ask these questions in person, either. If you do, you could be subjected to a lawsuit.You aren’t allowed to discriminate based on someone’s race, religion, national origin, gender, age, familial status, physical or mental disability.
In many states you aren’t allowed to discriminate based on marital status or sexual orientation.

, The application is an important step in the screening process, and many people will be eliminated at this point. Read through the applications carefully see if there are any red flags before you go deeper into the screening process. If you find some that check out fine, you can move on to conducting credit and background checks.


Make sure the income level and employment situation are sufficient. If you have concerns that the person might have trouble making rent, it might not be worth the risk.
Make sure the lifestyle information checks out with what you want. Don't get yourself into a situation where you're renting to someone with three cats and three dogs unless you're truly ready for what it would entail.
Look for blanks where info was left out. If they didn’t fill out a certain question, that could be a red flag. For example, if they provided only two references and you asked for three, find out why.

, Choose the applications that checked out fine and run credit checks on the applicants to determine whether they have solid credit. In some states you’re responsible for the cost, but in other states you can charge the tenant. It's usually between $25 and $50 per credit check.Assess the person's credit history. See if there’s a history of late payments. If you see information that's troubling to you, ask the applicant what happened.
See if the person has debt. It can be risky to rent to someone who's deep in debt. However, if records show that her or she has been making consistently monthly payments to get rid of the debt, you might not want to hold it against him or her.

, Hire an agency to find information on the person’s criminal history, eviction history, and so on. Do an online search for trusted agencies, and you'll see dozens of results. While not all landlords do background checks, since they can be costly, a background check can provide plenty of information that will affect your decision. When you're about to enter a lease agreement with someone that could last a year or more, it's worth the relatively small cost of making sure you're renting to someone you can trust.


See if the person has ever been evicted. If so, you’ll need to find out why and be wary of renting to the person until you've received a satisfactory explanation. If the person was evicted for failing to pay rent, you should probably pass on him or her.
See if the person has criminal records. It's up to you to determine what your comfort zone is in this area.
See if the person has public records indicating they were part of a lawsuit. If they were sued by a previous landlord or for reasons having to do with financial problems, you might not want to rent to them.

, This step is almost as important as credit and background checks. Talking to other people who have rented to or worked with the the applicant in question will give you a much better picture of his or her personality. Call each reference to ask about the person’s history as a tenant. Here are some good questions to ask:Ask if the person paid rent on time each month.
Ask if there were any problems, and if so, how they were resolved.
Ask if the person would recommend the tenant.
If no one answers, consider it a red flag. Keep trying until you reach the person.

, Once the person has cleared all the other checks, it's time to make your decision. Having a longer conversation with the applicant and showing him or her the property you're renting will provide the last pieces of information you need in order to feel secure with your final choice.


You can let the person know that you're going to interview him or her, or you can just invite the person to the property with the understanding that it's for a detailed viewing. The interaction might be more revealing if the person doesn't feel put on the spot.
Ask the person to bring pay stubs so you can verify employment history. He or she should might also bring a check for the amount of the deposit, in case you both want to seal the deal right away.

, Keeping in mind that certain questions are off limits, start a conversation that will help you understand where the person is coming from. Find out why the person wants to move, how long he or she intends to stay, and anything else you might want to know.


Take the opportunity to ask about any red flags that came up in the application process. For example, if one of the person's references didn't answer the phone, ask if there's a better way to get in touch.
Be ready to answer questions, too. Remember that the potential tenant also needs to feel comfortable and trusting before deciding to commit to a lease.

, As you're talking with the applicant, try to get a read on his or her personality, and decide if you can picture a long-term business relationship going smoothly. It's good to rent to tenants who are responsible and punctual. Keep the following in mind as you talk:


Was the person punctual, or did he or she show up late?
Is the person dressed neatly, or did he or she come wearing sloppy clothes? This might say something about how he or she will take care of the property.
Does he or she already have complaints about the place? It's better to rent to someone who actually likes the property up front.
Lay out ground rules and assess the person’s response. If you sense defensiveness or other attitude issues, think twice before renting.

, After interviewing several people, it's time to make your decision. Remember that in most cases, you don't have to be great friends with the person you're renting to. As long as the person pays rent on time and takes good care of the property, it doesn't matter how much the two of you have in common.


Remember to be consistent and give each person an equal shot. Fairness laws specify that in the absence of red flags, you must give each person who fills out an application an equal shot at getting the apartment.
When you've made your choice, be sure to take the time to draw up a lease that protects you. While having tenants undergo a rigorous screening process is always helpful, you can't always predict how things will end up. A good lease is one you can fall back on in case you end up having to evict the tenant.

File with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).",How to Run a Homeowners' Association," Whether you're new to an existing board or part of a new startup board in a recently-formed HOA, you'll need to learn how your association works. Every board member should understand his or her responsibilities and obligations, and the entire board should be familiar with the management plan that's been set in place for that HOA.All board members are bound by the HOA's governing documents.
No board member may exercise authorities that are not explicitly outlined in those documents, and all board members must adhere to the responsibilities established therein.;
, Many new board members become overly enthusiastic and eager to prove themselves. This often results in an overreach of powers or the introduction of flawed or unnecessary policies. Before you attempt to change a policy or introduce an entirely new one, make sure you familiarize yourself with the existing policies on that topic as they are currently written.Even if a new policy is warranted, make sure you and the other board members collectively take your time to examine all the ins and outs of the proposed policy to ensure it is feasible and will be effective.
Familiarize yourself with the previous boards that have served your community (if your development has had other boards in the past). Read through the minutes from their meetings and take the time to understand the history of your community and its past decisions.

, A homeowners' association board must be completely transparent in all its decisions and proceedings. Transparency is the only thing that will give the homeowners confidence and trust in the board. Talk about issues your community faces, invite feedback from other homeowners, and hold open public discussions on HOA proposals for your community., The owners' meeting opens the board up to input from homeowners and unit owners in that development. Owners' meetings typically address board elections, budgetary approval/amendments, amendments to the HOA's governing documents, and other factors that involve the homeowners. Depending on where you live, there may be certain requirements about the frequency of meetings. For example, in Colorado, a general homeowners' or unit owners' meeting must be held at least once each year.Each state may have specific requirements about how far in advance an owners' meeting is scheduled. All owners must be notified of the upcoming meeting within that time frame.
Many HOAs are required to post a physical notice about upcoming meetings in a visible community area. The HOA may also send out email notifications or mailed letters of correspondence to the development's homeowners.
All notices and correspondences should include the date, time, and place of the meeting, as well as any items scheduled to be on the agenda that day.

, Board meetings should be open to all association members, or a designated representative if a given member cannot be present. All HOA residents should be permitted to see the agenda for a board meeting, and the HOA must adhere to the association's bylaws that govern board meeting notifications.In order to ensure a productive board meeting, it's best to prepare an agenda and stick to it during the meeting.The board must stick to items that are already on the agenda and may not introduce new items without prior review.
The agenda should ratify the minutes from the last board meeting, discuss unresolved (""old"") business, and discuss new items up for discussion or vote.
Boards may also wish to have an open forum for homeowners during the meeting to ensure that residents have a say in their HOA's government.Make sure all board members follow an agreed-upon code of conduct. This may include following parliamentary proceedings during the meeting, allowing homeowners to watch the board conduct business, and other procedures to ensure a smooth and productive meeting.

, Special meetings may be called to address emergencies and other time-sensitive issues. A homeowners' or unit owners' special meeting may be called by the HOA president, a majority of the HOA's executive board, or by home/unit owners with a certain percentage (outlined in the bylaws) of the association's votes., The HOA's bylaws are a functional set of rules for the association's day-to-day management. It should include information on the various types of meetings that will be held, as well as election and removal proceedings for new or outgoing board members.The requirements for an HOA's bylaws will vary from one state to another, though some things should remain uniform across all HOA bylaws.
The bylaws should require that the HOA can buy back stock/membership interest from homeowners who are not permanent residents of the community.Any stock/membership interest bought back by the HOA must be sold to new members at the same price.
Two-thirds of resident owners/shareholders must vote in favor of an amendment in order for the HOA's bylaws or articles of incorporation to be revised.

, The articles of incorporation lay out the name of your HOA, the principal office address, and the name/address of the registered agent for your HOA. This document establishes the purpose of your HOA, as well as its governing powers. In many states the articles must be filed with the Secretary of State in order for the HOA to be incorporated as a non-profit entity.The articles must establish in writing that the homeowners' association is organized for non-profit purposes, and that no individual associated with the HOA (as a corporation) will see any private gain.In order to qualify as a non-profit organization, the HOA must also cite the home state's tax code that governs non-profits.
The articles should also incorporate a limitation clause, which states that the HOA will not utilize powers that are not declared in the governing documents.
The HOA may choose to incorporate the features of the articles of incorporation into the bylaws, or the HOA may create and adopt the articles as a new and independent document.

, An HOA declaration is a separate document that details the mandated appearance of all governed properties, any restrictions on property use, and the property maintenance obligations of all residents. The declaration may also establish any necessary requirements regarding common expense assessments for residents, and should be filed with the county clerk's office.Typically, any private property that affects the structure or overall appearance of a home (including the yard, roof, and outside walls of a home) is considered association property. As such, it is subject to the declaration's mandates for appearance and upkeep., The rules and regulations lay out what a board member's authority is within that development, and should also state what potential consequences may come with a given infraction of the rules. For example, if a board member has the authority to give notice and subsequently inspect a homeowner's property to check for rule infractions (like pets, maintenance needs, etc), those powers must be plainly stated in the rules.As part of the rules and regulations, homeowners must be informed of when and how to challenge a given rule. There must also be a fair process for arguing against an infraction citation, with the homeowner given a chance to tell their side of the story.

, As your homeowners' association grows, you'll need to establish how much homeowners must pay each month in dues to the HOA. Other budgetary obligations for homeowners may include assessments for maintenance, significant repairs, property upgrades, and structural improvements. However, the HOA's budget must adhere to state law when it assesses and quotes the financial obligations of its homeowners.Talk to a real estate lawyer in your community to determine what is fair and legal to charge homeowners in your development.
You can find real estate lawyers in your area by searching online or in a local phone book.

, Many HOAs file with the IRS to receive tax benefits, such as excluding exempt-function income from the HOA's reported gross income. In order to receive these benefits, the HOA must complete and file Form 1120-H with the IRS. This form must generally be filed before the income tax return due date.Form 1120-H can be downloaded and printed from the IRS website. You can also place an order online through the IRS website to have the necessary forms mailed to your HOA.
Requests for mail ordered forms should be completed by the IRS and received by the HOA within 10 business days.

Close the estate in a timely manner.",How to Know when to Reopen an Estate," This is the most common reason for reopening an estate. For example, you may discover a bank account, retirement account, bonds, or some other type of asset after the estate has been closed. If so, you can petition the court to reopen the estate.Check to see that the asset has been titled in the deceased’s name. For example, vehicles, boats, bank accounts, and investment accounts should have a title or other documentation identifying the owner. However, other assets don’t.
Also look to see who the beneficiary is. Some assets, such as retirement accounts, have designated beneficiaries. If so, then the asset doesn’t need to pass through probate, so you won’t need to reopen the estate.
Other assets won’t have a designated beneficiary, which means you will have to collect it for the estate.;
, Someone who lent the deceased money might appear to make a claim for payment from the estate. In some situations, you may need to reopen the estate.Analyze whether or not the claim is timely.


During administration, the personal representative should have given notice to possible creditors via publication in a newspaper or by direct mailing. Creditors then had a certain amount of time to file a claim against the estate. If they file too late, they are typically barred from attempting to collect on the debt.
Laws vary by state, so consult a probate attorney and find out if the estate is responsible for the debt.

, The personal representative might have closed the estate without properly distributing all assets to heirs or beneficiaries. If so, you can petition the court to reopen the estate.


You should look at your copy of the will. Check to see if some gift wasn’t distributed to a beneficiary. However, things can get complicated because the will does not list every asset in the estate.
You will have a very strong case to reopen the estate if the personal representative committed fraud or other wrongdoing., You may unearth a new will when going through the deceased’s belongings. Often, a court will refuse to revoke probate because a new will has been discovered. However, you should analyze the situation.


The new will must be valid and enforceable. It should have been signed according to your state’s formalities. The rules differ by state, but generally at least two people must witness the signing of the will.The will also must have been written later than the will that was probated. If not, then it is not valid.
If the estate has already been distributed, then the personal representative may need to recover gifts from the initial beneficiaries., Previously unknown heirs have been known to come out of the woodwork when someone passes away. If a new heir steps forward, you’ll have to analyze whether to reopen the estate.


Generally, the heir should be mentioned in the will. If not, they usually can’t inherit. Most states don’t require that a person name every heir they are intentionally disinheriting.
If there was no will, then the heir could inherit under the state’s intestacy laws, which apply in the absence of a will. Analyze your state law. For example, in Texas, you can only reopen the estate if property was omitted from the will or not administered in probate.Look if the personal representative gave the heir notice of the probate proceedings. If not, then you may need to reopen the estate for further administration. However, if the heir did receive notice, they should have pressed their claim during the time prescribed.

, Sometimes, an estate will bring a wrongful death lawsuit for the death of the deceased. Also, the estate might be sued for any wrongdoing committed by the deceased. In these situations, you may need to reopen the estate., If you ever have a question, you should meet with an experienced probate attorney. Every situation is different, and laws often vary by jurisdiction. Accordingly, only an attorney can analyze your specific situation and offer tailored advice.


Find a probate attorney by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.Once you have the name of someone, call them up and schedule a consultation.

, Once an estate has been closed, you’ll need to petition the probate court to reopen the estate. However, not anyone can file this petition. Generally, only “interested parties” can file. An interested party is generally someone with a property right or financial interest at stake, such as an heir or creditor.In some states, interested parties may need to get the personal representative’s permission to reopen the estate.Typically, the prior personal representative can also petition to reopen the estate., Your probate court might have a printed, fill-in-the-blank petition form you can fill out.Check with the probate court or look on their website.


If no form is available, you’ll need to draft your own petition. Your petition should provide background facts about the dispute and explain why the estate should be reopened.Court documents like petitions must look a certain way. Search online to find sample probate petitions.
Consult with an attorney if you find this difficult.

, Make several copies, including one for your records. Take the original and copies to the probate court where the estate was initially administered. Ask to file.


You may also have to pay a filing fee.Call the court ahead of time

, Depending on your court, you may need to serve a copy of the petition on all heirs who were listed in the original probate petition.You will also need to certify that you have served notice. Often, you can serve using a process server, who will fill out a certificate of service and return it to you.

, If you’re named the personal representative after the estate has been reopened, then you must give all interested parties a copy of any newly discovered will. They will need to unanimously consent to the will, or the judge will hold a hearing to determine if the will is valid., The personal representative is responsible for collecting and safekeeping all assets. Create an inventory of any recently discovered assets.If necessary, you may also need to have them appraised.
Generally, you’ll need to file an inventory of newly discovered assets with the court or give the inventory to all interested parties.

, Personal representatives must carefully account for all money and property collected and distributed. Even if the estate is small, keep accurate records. You may need to keep receipts of all expenses to share with the court or with interested parties.Remember to consult with a lawyer or accountant with questions. The judge and court staff can’t provide legal advice.
Usually, you can pay your lawyer or accountant out of estate assets, which makes getting professional help feasible.

, In some states, you need court approval before you finally distribute assets to the beneficiaries.Remember that the estate may owe taxes, so you should hold back enough to cover them.


Consult with an accountant if you have questions about taxes, because you may be held personally responsible for any unpaid amount.As the personal representative, you will also have to file the estate’s tax returns.

, Consult your state’s law. In Michigan, for example, you must close a reopened estate within one year.Remember to file required reports with the court.

Be sure to outline your expectations respecting Tenant Improvement Allowance dollars, free rent, discounts on asking rate, and lease term. This process is going to save you more money when it comes time to see your lawyer later for lease review. Additionally, once a landlord has your business, they are not as likely to negotiate concessions.
Be patient during negotiations; this LOI process may go for awhile until the landlord and you can come to an agreement.

Assemble A Buyer's List.,

If All Else Fails, Return To The Buyer's List.",How to Reverse Wholesale," These buyers are typically people who frequently invest in real estate, like fix and flippers and landlords who rent out properties. The best way to find these people is by networking. Try going to places like REIA meetings and trading some business cards. Once you have a solid list assembled, start contacting each person individually.;
, Eventually you will find someone who is interested in working with you, and you can start to build a rapport. You will find out exactly what types of properties they are interested in-- what size, what location, what price range, and any intangibles that they might want. Then you will agree on a set wholesaler's fee to be rewarded after the contract is exchange.

, You will go out searching for exactly what the investor wants. This often makes the process easier, because you don't have to guess what the people from you buyers list are looking for, like you would in a traditional wholesale. This does make your selection a bit narrower, however.

, Once you find the property that meets all of the predetermined criteria, make sure you put it under contract. If you fail to do this before present the property to the investor, he or she could cut you out of the deal and go straight to the seller. If you did everything correctly, the buyer should buy the contract from you, giving you your wholesaler's fee, and then close in your place.

, At the odd chance that the investor is not interested in the contract that you've selected for him, you'll need to find a replacement buyer. If this happens, don't worry. You've essentially returned to a traditional wholesale. Just send out an email notifying the people on your buyer's list about your property until one bites.

A lot of contractors are small operations with only a few employees. What’s more, home improvement contractors often cover a large geographic area since it’s difficult to predict when and where a potential job will come from. They’re busy people who do a lot of driving, so it may take a week or two for them to get to you.
After the initial visit, it will probably take another week to get an estimate.;
, The internet age has made it possible for nearly anyone to work up a preliminary estimate all by themselves with just a few hours and the willingness to do some research.There are many cost-estimation sites online, including Homewyze, Home Advisor, and This Old House. Some, like Homewyze, are more detailed than others.
Depending on your online estimator’s level of detail, you might need to measure square footage and make some preliminary decisions on materials—like wood, vinyl, or laminate flooring—to get an accurate estimate.

, Since most people don’t have the expertise to evaluate a contractor’s work at a glance, they rely on word of mouth and consumer reviews to find contractors to work with. There’s nothing wrong with that strategy, but it’s not perfect. You should be aware of a few points:, Start by checking online reviews. Many online review aggregators are less impartial then they may seem. Angie’s List is one of the best review aggregators, and all of the ratings on Angie’s List are legitimate. But even Angie’s List allows highly rated contractors to pay to have their names come up first in the search results. The same problem pops up with word of mouth referrals. For example, say you want to build a stone wall in your front yard. Your sister had a stone wall built a year ago, and it looks great, and she highly recommends the stonemason. The problem is, structures are about more than looks—they also have to be built soundly. How does your sister know she didn’t pay for a beautiful wall that’s going to fall over in three years?
The contractor’s experience is probably the best way to ease some of these anxieties. If they’ve been working in your area for three decades, they come recommended, and they’ve got good online reviews, then they’re probably worth taking a look at.
Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) online to see their score, any previous complaints, and customer comments.
Although most people won’t do it, it’s not a bad idea to conduct a personal background check on your contractor. If your contractor has defrauded people before, there’s a good chance it was in another state—because they won’t be licensed in a state where they have committed fraud. A thorough background check can help to ferret out any troubling criminal history.

, If you only need one item repaired or replaced, this isn’t as important. But if you’re getting a lot of work done, make a list of everything that you might want taken care of.For example, if you’re just getting your windows replaced, you probably don’t need a list to keep track of that. If you’re getting your entire home remodeled, make a list.

, Never underestimate what you can learn from a face-to-face meeting. There are all kinds of details you might not catch over the phone or online.


Walking the job site together with the contractor can also remind you of items you may have left off your list.

, If you have time, schedule more. But you need to get at least three estimates, because without three, you’ll never be able to tell if one estimate is an outlier.Even beyond the price of an estimate, it’s important to get three because a contractor might be wrong. Whether you’re getting something repaired, replaced, remodeled, or built from scratch, there’s a good chance the estimate from at least one contractor will be too high, too low, or for the wrong thing altogether. If one contractor tells you that you need to have your hot water heater replaced, and another says they can repair it, how do you know who’s right? The third estimate might do the trick.

, Unless a job is massive, it shouldn’t take longer than a couple of weeks to get a estimate. What’s probably more relevant than the amount of time it takes to get the estimate is the difference between how long they said it would take and how long it actually takes.


Use your best judgement when weighing this factor. If it takes someone three weeks to tell you how much they’ll charge to replace your garbage disposal, you probably want to avoid them. If you’ve got a big job and the contractor can explain the reason for a delay and takes the initiative to tell you it’s going to be late, then it’s probably not reflective on their diligence.

, Estimation is inherently inexact, but that doesn’t mean it has to be inaccurate. A vague estimate should immediately strike you as unreliable. The bigger the job, the more detailed the estimate should be. A small job can be less detailed, because there are fewer variables to consider.All contractors should be bidding the same job under the same conditions. Otherwise, it will be hard to properly evaluate and compare offers.
For example, if you’re getting a ceiling fan installed, that’s a small job. You pick the fan, which accounts for the cost of materials, so the only variable is labor.
If your entire house is getting renovated and the contractor tells you the kitchen will cost $7,000, let that serve as a warning sign. Unless you’ve already picked out the appliances, the countertops, fixtures, flooring and more, there’s simply no way to know how much it will cost. The best a reputable contractor will do is give you range: “kitchens of this size usually cost between $5,000 and $10,000.”

, Hidden costs can make an estimate appear to be great when it’s anything but. One way of masking costs is to work up an estimate using the lowest grade materials or appliances available. Verify the contractor is using the materials or appliances you want used, and not just what’s cheapest.

, Remember to state any other conditions or other requirements that will affect the job. For example, you may require that contractors work certain hours, have a distinct level of access to site, or require site maintenance. Include any special details when talking to contractors so that they can give you a comprehensive estimate. Examples of these conditions might include:

Waste disposal and cleanup. Most large projects generate a lot of trash, dumpsters have to be rented and hazardous materials ( like asbestos) need to be disposed of by specialists.Permits and inspections. Every home improvement project of any consequence is going to require some type of permit. Who is responsible for obtaining the permits and who pays for the inspectors?Landscaping. Large projects can do quite a bit of damage to a residential landscape. Who is responsible for returning the yard back to its original condition?
Warranties. Make sure that your contractor warranties their work. If they charge extra, do the math. Is the length of the warranty worth the cost?

, Compare the estimates you’ve received from the contractors and the preliminary estimate you created. Is there one that’s substantially higher or lower than the others? If so, is there a good reason why?A lot of people will say to eliminate the high and low estimate right off the bat, but that’s simply not good advice. If you only got three estimates, and one of them is much higher than the others, don’t you want to know why? The high contractor might have spotted a problem the other two missed. The same principle applies to a very low estimate. That contractor may have identified a cheaper way of getting the job done than the other two that’s equally as good.
If you find yourself in that kind of dilemma, the best option may be to get another estimate from a fourth contractor.
Ask for an explanation when costs vary significantly. Does one contractor see a problem another missed or does one wants the job more and is willing to take a lower profit?

, It’s far from certain that it will change anyone’s estimate, but you might be able to get a better deal if you tell the contractors what your other offers are.


Inform them of the other offers respectfully. Don’t accuse anyone of trying to cheat you or take advantage, because most of the time, they aren’t. Not every contractor pays the same price for materials or labor. Plus, a lot of the variation is based on what a contractor thinks his crews can do and how they’ll have to do it.

, Before you commit to a specific contractor, make sure you know exactly what’s included in the estimate. All terms and conditions included in the requirements and conditions of the job should be included. You should also ask for an explanation and process for cost over-runs or change orders. Some contractors bid low to get work and then make their profits on change orders.

, Choose the contractor that meets your requirements, is reputable, and offers a fair process for cost over-runs. If there are more than one contractors that do so, choose the lowest offer., Have your chosen contractor draw up a contract based on the estimate. The contract should include details like the schedule, payments, and approvals. Have an attorney look over the contract to make sure you are covered for any eventuality. In particular, the contractor should have adequate liability insurance to protect you from suits by employees or bystanders hurt during the performance of their work."

Different law may exist concerning surface water or ground water. For example, in Texas, the rights to surface water run with the land, while rights to ground water can be severed and sold separately from the land itself.It is possible in many states for you to buy land but not have automatic rights to use the ground water running within or beneath that land if those rights have been severed and sold to someone else.Water rights typically are sold using a contract which may specify total amounts of water to be withdrawn, a particular rate of withdrawal, and a term during which the rights are valid.;
, The state's water authority maintains records on water sources in each region, who controls the rights to the water, and what rights are available.


Since many water rights are held first by the state, the state commission has records regarding what water rights are available and who you must contact to purchase those rights.Some states such as Texas maintain separate files on permits for irrigation water rights, which also specify the particular land to be irrigated. The sale of that land may transfer those irrigation water rights.If you want to divert water from a river rather than groundwater from an underground aquifer, you may have to deal with a different authority. For example, river authorities in Texas operate independently of other water management entities and create their own regulations regarding the diversion of water from the rivers.The state engineer's office may hire other engineers or geologists to collect and analyze data on the state's water supply. They use this data to create forecasts that help guarantee that the water rights you seek to buy will actually continue to be available for the term of your contract for water rights.Essentially, the state engineer's studies help determine whether your request for water rights will intrude upon the rights of those who came before you., Different states may have different rules regarding which water rights claims have priority over others, and having a basic understanding of your state's law can help ensure you get the water you need.


The priority of claims is important in determining what water rights remain to be bought or sold for a given water source. For example, Texas follows the rule that the first claim in time has the first priority to water rights for the water source.Colorado adds the requirement that the first claim also must put the water to beneficial use.The ""first in time"" rule requires that additional water rights can be granted only if they would not disrupt earlier water rights.For example, suppose you require 10 acre-feet in water rights, and the nearest source has a capacity of 500 acre-feet. If there is only one older claim ahead of you for 250 acre-feet, the source has enough water to meet your needs and also satisfy all of the older claim. However, if the source only has a capacity of 255 acre-feet, it cannot meet your need and still fulfill the older claim, which has priority over yours.
In addition to state water law, your particular water district may have its own rules regarding the transfer of water rights for sources within that district. For example, most water districts in Texas have specific rules governing the transfer of water rights related to wells located in those districts.The essential elements of water appropriation are that you divert water and apply that water to beneficial use. Beneficial use typically includes irrigation, watering your livestock or garden, or for use in the home., If another individual or business has priority rights to the water you want to use and there are no remaining open water rights for the water in that source, you must negotiate a contract to purchase some or all of their water rights.The price and relative value of water rights depends not only on the location of the source but the location of the rights on the priority list for that source.Some states such as Texas also have a water bank or a water trust that works to protect water rights and facilitate the transfer of water rights between buyers and sellers.In some states such as Utah, water rights are classified as real property and bought and sold just as land or homes are sold. These rights have predetermined usages and rates, and are recorded with the county recorder the same as deeds to land. For example, a water right might be sold for a single family residence, two head of cattle, and irrigation of a quarter-acre garden., To begin your claim for water rights, you typically must make your intentions to use the water clear to the public.


For example, in Colorado, you must first appropriate water by making a physical display of your intent to divert and use the water. Conducting a field survey puts people in the area on notice that you are searching for and intend to use the area's ground water., One way to publicly proclaim your intent to divert water from the water source is to file a well permit application for your property.


In Utah, for example, water well drillers must be licensed by the state, and cannot drill a well unless you have permission from the state engineer to do so.You must file a different application depending on whether your area is open, restricted, or closed to water rights.When you file your application, you must be prepared to pay a fee ranging from $150 to $1,000.A well permit application also serves as sufficient notice to others who own water rights to the source in your area that you are in the process of buying water rights.Well permits are reviewed by the state engineer's office, which determines the amount of water available and makes sure no new wells will injure existing water rights.In some states such as Colorado, certain types of wells, including wells for household use only, are exempt from the general priority system. These wells operate under conditional permits and typically are only allowed where a municipality or rural water district cannot provide water to the property., The water court typically will have an application available online that you can use.


Once you've downloaded the application, read it and make note of the information you'll need to include.
Your application typically must specify the scope of the water rights you want to buy or claim, which includes the amount of water to be diverted, the rate of diversion, and the purpose of your use., After you've read the application, conduct whatever surveys or other studies are necessary to get the information you need to complete the application.


Your application typically will include the type of water rights, location where you intend to divert the water, name of the source, dates you intend to use the water, how you intend to divert the water, the rate at which the water will be appropriated, and what you intend to use it for., Once you've completed your application, you must file it with the water court in the district where your water source is located.


The date on your application sets your priority for water rights from the source you've chosen.In some states such as Colorado, applications are filed with judges who only hear cases involving water rights and review applications for water rights., Generally you must publish a legal notice in a local newspaper of record that provides the public with notice of your application.


For example, in Colorado, you must publish legal notices for two months. During that time, anyone who disagrees that you should be granted permission to buy water rights can file a statement in opposition with the water court., The water court may have additional surveys or notices that must be completed before the judge will make a final decision on your application.


In some states such as Colorado, your application also will be reviewed by an engineer, who will make a recommendation to the court as to whether your application should be approved or denied., If others contest your application and you cannot arrive at a settlement, the water court will schedule a trial to hear all sides on the matter.


You cannot purchase water rights until your application is approved. The court reviews the recommendation from the engineer, as well as any other information from prior rights holders.You also may want to consider hiring your own water engineer to evaluate your application and perform additional surveys before you go to trial. A water engineer can help you identify the type of water rights you need and how you should categorize your use., If you haven't already retained an attorney, it may be in your best interest to find someone experienced in water law to represent you at trial.


Water rights can be extremely complex, and require a lot of time and work. An experienced water rights attorney can protect you throughout the transaction.Before you hire a water rights attorney, interview him and make sure he is familiar with the area and has an understanding of and experience with real estate contracts, since water rights typically are considered real property and governed by the same laws as real estate transactions.A good water rights attorney also will know how to search the records for prior claims with priority, and assess your chances that your application will be approved., At trial, you will have an opportunity to explain to the judge why your application should be granted.


If there is no opposition to your application for water rights, you still must appear. The judge may ask you questions or request documentation or other clarification regarding the information you included in your application.If someone does contest your application, you must appear before a judge, who will make the final determination on whether your application should be approved.If your application for water rights is approved, you are free to purchase your water rights. You will receive a permit to use the amount of water you described in your application."

This approach works best if you’re not sure what you want to buy yet and simply want to identify the best deals. Include a general description of the product you’re looking for and add the phrase “online coupons.” Try out some of the suggestions that your search browser offers you as you type in your search phrase and see if there are search terms that help you find things that interest you., Use any web search engine to find coupons for specific online stores and products.

Make sure the website is offering coupons for online shopping. Some websites offer coupons for in-store purchase only. Compare deals and coupons between websites. Save any coupon code you find for your online purchase.

, Some of the websites that you come across may actually be fake. These websites don’t actually offer anything and instead might try to steal your personal information or infect your computer with a virus.Identify a fake coupon website by watching out for the following:


The website offers coupons for free things.
The coupon doesn’t have an expiration date.
The coupon doesn’t appear to come from the company itself.
The coupon appears on the Coupon Information Center blacklist., Make sure you read the details of your coupon closely. Some coupons policies require you to buy a certain number of items before you can use them.Other coupons exclude certain items from their sale and instead require you to buy a specific brand. It can be frustrating to spend time figuring out what to purchase only to discover that your coupon is not valid when you try to pay."

Be on the lookout for unadvertised deals.",How to Do Coupon Matchups," This is vital to do because they tell you what kinds of coupons they accept, if they accept competitor's coupons, if they double or triple coupons, if they accept expired coupons, how many coupons are accepted in one transaction, etc. Like a website's terms of service, store and coupon policies do change over time, so be sure to keep yourself updated as much as possible. It's always wise to print them out, as you may need them at the register when processing coupons.;
, These prices are typically lower than the regular shelf price. Some prices can be considered a ""rock bottom"" price, where it will hit the lowest price of its sale cycle.

, This will help you determine if the store circular price is truly a rock bottom price, sale price, or something to skip/not a bargain.

, Make sure you're only targeting on the sale and rock bottom prices.

, Remember that the coupons will need to be in range of any weight/size or specific details, if any. Always read the fine print and pay attention to the reading. You can only use one manufacturer coupon per item. If your coupon states, ""Save $___ on two"", you must purchase two of the same items in order to use the coupon. Depending on your store coupon policy, you may use two ""Save $___ on one"" on a ""Buy One Get One Free"" (BOGO) sale.

, This is an easy example on a real life deal from Rite Aid:


Mentos UP2U Gum, 14 count - sale price $1.00 between February 26 and March 3
There was a ""Save $1.00 off when you buy any one UP2U pack"" in the February 5th SmartSource newspaper insert with an expiration date of March 31st.
Your initial transaction total will be $1.00.
After coupon(s), your gum will be free.

, By doing so, when you get to the register, it will be altogether instead of all over the place. Write out your coupon shopping list on the outer part of the envelope for convenience.

, Unadvertised deals are as good as store circular ad deals. These can either be valid as the same time range as circulars, a two week period, or a monthly deal. Never be afraid nor embarrassed in poking around the clearance rack; you will never know if a random product is in there while you have a coupon for it.

Zipper binders are very useful if you wish to carry scissors, other notes, whole inserts, store circulars, pens, etc. It also keeps your coupons intact in case the binder falls. The bigger and higher quality the binder is, the more expensive it would be.
, There are several ways to organize it - it really depends on you and your shopping styles.

Divide coupons by product type (dairy, cleaning supplies, meat, etc)
Divide coupons by aisle (if you want to keep small binders for different stores, it's easy to flip through when you walk around)
Divide coupons according to the expiration dates (placing the soonest expiring coupons in front and latest in the back). Majority of the coupons distributed usually expires on the first, 15th, and last day of each month.

, Having your ""category names"" on the side makes it easier and faster to swipe through a huge binder. Your personal organization choosing will determine how many dividers you will need. If you are going with the alphabetical order, you will need at least 26 dividers (more for extra categories). If you are going with the expiration dates, you can divide them into 2 week blocks. The product type method may change from time to time, as it depends how thin or thick your variety is. You can have one divider for a ""Personal Hygiene"" category or several dividers for sub-categories, such as ""Hair Care"", ""Skin Care"", ""Makeup"", etc., You can find these at discount or sporting stores. The most common is nine sleeves (3 x 3) on each page. There is a strong preference amongst couponers to invest in different size sleeves. The 3 x 3 sleeve pages can hold regular square inserts, however, to avoid folding long ones, coupons you get in the mail, or internet printed coupons, page width sleeves are the best., You can always adjust the amount per category depending on your needs and how much the binder can hold., The main point of a coupon binder is organization throughout the entire process, so make sure it's updated and discard the expired ones (if your store doesn't accept them).

Expect bizarre reactions.",How to Become an Extreme Coupon Shopper," The Sunday paper is the traditional go-to place for coupons, since it tends to have several coupon inserts.


When you're just getting started, you might be happy with one copy, but true extreme couponing requires more than one copy of each coupon. Most extreme couponers need at least four copies of the newspaper,so to avoid purchasing so many papers, ask neighbors, friends, or family for their inserts if they will not use them.
Another way to get extra inserts is to check coffee shops. People often leave newspapers there when they are finished reading them, and not many people take the coupon inserts.
Don't be afraid to go dumpster diving for inserts. In some areas, stores recycle their unsold papers with inserts, so check recycling bins outside of places like Starbucks on Monday mornings. Sometimes the newspaper itself does not use all the inserts and throws away many copies. Serious couponers know that the newspaper office dumpster can be a goldmine on Sundays.;
, Sites offer many manufacturer coupons that you can print out at home. You can choose which ones you want and only print the ones you will use.


Some popular coupon sites include www.coupon.com, www.redplum.com, or www.smartsource.com.If there is a certain product you need a coupon for, try doing a Google image search for the product name plus the word coupon (for example, ""toothbrush coupon"") or a more specific search if you want a certain brand or type.
You can also check manufacturer websites, sign up for emails from companies and manufacturers, and check retailer websites for current coupons.

, If you know you are definitely going to make use of a coupon, buying it for less than its face value can be a good way to save money.


You can purchase copies of coupons at online at sites like The Coupon Clippers or eBay. You can buy single coupons or whole newspaper inserts.
You can also check your local Craigslist or Freecycle website for people selling or giving away coupons. Be sure that if you do buy coupons from a stranger, you meet up with them in a public, well-lit place like a local grocery store or bank. Never give them your home address and never meet up after dark or in a secluded location.

, Many grocery stores are learning the value of offering small discounts on products and have begun to offer coupons in the store itself.


Many stores have devices that give out in-store coupons in the aisles or next to product displays. Some stores also have their own coupon booklets.
Some stores print out coupons on the back of or in addition to your receipt at check-out. In this case, of course, you'll have to use the coupons at your next visit.

, Using a binder will allow you to easily see all your coupons and when they expire. It is very portable and can be easily taken with you in the grocery store.


One popular way to organize coupons is to use baseball card sheets in your binder.These clear plastic sheets have openings sized just right so you can slip the coupons in and out easily.

, You can group your coupons any way you wish within the binder, but finding a way that works for you is key to a manageable extreme couponing experience.


Some coupons make sense to organize by store. If your coupon is only good at a particular retailer, it makes sense to group it with other coupons for that retailer so that you don't forget to use it while you're there.
Most other coupons make sense to organize by type: dairy, produce, meat and snacks for example. If you're very organized, you can then organize the sheets themselves based on the path you walk through the grocery store (shelf-stable foods and households goods first, then produce, then refrigerated and frozen goods last).

, The more organized each sheet of coupons is when you go to the store, the easier it will be to find the products you need, remember what you are combining, and make a successful purchase.


On a given sheet, put coupons you definitely plan to redeem at the top of the page. Organize the rest by expiration date so that you won't forget to use them before they expire.
If you don't know for sure which coupons you will use, file coupons as whole inserts. Instead of clipping coupons and filing them individually, you will file whole inserts together. If you have 4 of the same insert, file them all together. When it is time to use your coupons, you can just clip the ones that you will need.

, A spreadsheet can help you organize the coupons you have and the savings you accrue, so you will learn what strategies work best. If you're familiar with Microsoft Excel, using formulas can make the process much simpler.Some people use spreadsheets to keep track of each individual coupon, but that can be tedious. Instead, aim to track your total savings at each store. Use headings on the spreadsheet such as date, store, total savings, and total spent in the transaction.Use Excel SUM formulas to total each column as you go. Fill in the amounts after every shopping trip and let Excel do the rest of the work for you. You can visit popular couponing website Krazy Coupon Lady at http://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/couponing/extreme-couponing-tip-tracking-savings-spreadsheets/ for a free downloadable spreadsheet.

, Stores vary in how many coupons they will accept and under what circumstances, so you need to know before you go in and spend a lot of time gathering products. Read the store's website and/or ask the store manager what their policies are regarding coupons. Many stores will accept up to four identical coupons for a single purchase. For instance, if you have four $1 off Colgate coupons, you can use all four and save $4 on a single tube of toothpaste, which essentially will make the tube free. Still other stores, like Target, will allow one manufacturer coupon and one retailer coupon per item.
Other stores, however, will only allow one coupon. These stores are not the best for extreme couponing as you only get a great deal if you have a very high value coupon.
The best stores for extreme couponing will accept more than one coupon and will also double the value of coupons. This means if the coupon is for $.25 off, they will value it as $ .50 off. If they do double, make sure to find out if there are any limits on doubling, or if they only double on certain days.

, Since store policies vary, its important to keep a running list of every store you frequent, along with answers to questions about their specific store policies.


Check to see if the stores offer any kind of discounts for seniors, students, or military.
Ask if they will price match competitors' ad prices and accept a coupon for the item on top of that.
If a store does ""BOGO"" or buy-one-get-one free sales, ask if you have to buy two products to get the sale price. For instance, some stores will advertise BOGO shredded cheese, but actually you can choose to just buy one bag and get it at 50% off. Other stores require you to buy both bags of cheese to take advantage of the sale. Either policy is good, but the first policy allows you to take advantage of coupons on top of the sale and enjoy a larger percent savings.

, In order to maximize your savings, you need to combine sales, promotions, and coupons. For instance, if Target is having a special sale of a particular brand of yogurt for $2 and it is normally $3, you can use your two $1 off coupons and get it for free.


Decide which coupons are worth redeeming. Its not a good deal if you are buying a product you don't need and won't use, unless the item is shelf-stable. Coupons are really only worth redeeming if you would be buying the product regardless, or if the savings will make the product virtually free and you can give it to someone else.
Check your weekly circulars for items that are on sale. Match up the coupons that you have with the items that are on sale. If you have multiples of the coupon, get as many of that item as you can, as long as the item is nonperishable. This will allow you to stock up on items so that you will never have to pay full price for something if you run out. Take advantage of matching sales with coupons at stores that allow you to double coupons.
Look for ""buy-one-get-one"" deals and use a coupon on that. Some stores will allow you to use a coupon on the 2nd item that is discounted, so you can get even more savings.

, Depending on the types of coupons that you have gathered and the promotions at stores, you can take a couple of extreme couponing approaches:


Doubling: Some stores will match the value of a coupon, so that you end up saving double the face value of your coupon. This is an especially good strategy if the coupon value is high and the item itself is on sale.
Stacking: Some stores will allow you to use a manufacturer's coupon and a store coupon.
Store-specific policies: Some stores will allow discounts for students, military, or senior citizens. Some will price-match other stores.

, Many extreme couponers experience negative or surprised reactions from sales clerks and other customers when they buy many identical items, and sometimes face resistance to complete the sale.


Sometimes cashiers are unaware of their own store's policy and will refuse to do a transaction. If you have read the store's policy, its a good idea to politely ask to speak to the manager.
Occasionally, even a manager will refuse to allow a transaction that is within the company's policy. In that case, you don't have much recourse except to try another store.
You can mitigate some of these reactions a bit by timing your shopping trip for when the store is very slow (try 8 am on a Tuesday for example), instead of timing it for rush hour or a weekend when your coupon redemption process will hold up the line at check-out.

, Programs and apps like Snap (by Groupon), Saving Star, Ibotta, Checkout 51, and Shopmium allow you to download coupons to your smartphone. Then you can redeem them for cash after you’ve purchased a product.One benefit of using mobile coupons is that they don’t technically count as a coupon, which means that you can use them at the same time you’re using other forms of coupon. Since usually you’re only permitted one coupon per item, you’re definitely going to save more by combining mobile and printed coupon.
You may be required to purchase a minimum amount for some services. For example, Checkout 51 has a $20.00 minimum purchase.

, An eCoupon is a coupon that’s loaded electronically via your store’s loyalty card, through your phone or your computer. Many grocery stores, such as Safeway, Publix, and Kroger, use loyalty cards. To access their eCoupons, go to the grocery store’s website and register for their program. Then, you’ll have access to their coupons.Each store will have hundreds of coupons for a variety of grocery products, just like newspaper inserts.
Select the coupons you want. Then, when you’re in the store, your coupons will automatically be linked to your loyalty number. You don’t have to print, cut, or carry the coupons with you for them to work.

, You'll receive special sales and coupons by following the social media feeds of your favorite grocery stores. You can also ""like"" or ""follow"" grocery coupon distributors, such as Cheaptwitter, Mycoupons and Couponmom, to see more coupon deals.You'll find contests, Daily Deals, and promotional codes for free or discounted items that aren't advertised in other forms.
You can also search social media sites for coupons that you can use. For example, if you're looking for a discounted cup of joe, search the site for ""coupon"" and ""coffee"" and see what comes up.

, Online grocery shopping comes with its own coupons and savings. Sites such as Groupon have special deals on individual grocery items, but you can also shop at online retailers such as Amazon, or online wholesalers such as Vitacost (owned by Kroger), Peapod, and Fresh Direct.


Some groceries offer online ordering so that you can pick up your groceries at the store nearest you.
Other stores will ship your grocery order through the mail. It's safe to order refrigerated and frozen goods through the mail, as special packaging means that it will arrive fresh and in good condition.

Title the lease.,
Identify all parties to the lease agreement.,
Describe the asset that is covered by the rental agreement.,
State the length of the lease agreement.,
Account for all funds associated with the lease agreement.,
Assign responsibilities.,
Outline the specific obligations of the tenant under the lease agreement.,
Specify the consequences for defaulting on payments or violating the terms of the lease agreement.,
Include spaces for both parties to sign and date the agreement.,
Follow your state's laws.,
Have the lease reviewed by an attorney.,
Make sure the language is clear.",How to Write a Lease," At the top of the paper, write ""Residential Lease"" or another appropriate title to make it clear that this is a legal contract.

, Clearly list the landlord's name and address and the tenant's name and address, making it clear who is the lessee and who is the lessor. Include additional contact information such as telephone numbers and email addresses if you wish.

, If you're writing a residential lease, write out the complete address and apartment number of the rental property.Describe the property's condition at the time of the rental agreement., This should have starting and ending dates as well as the specific length of time in days, weeks or months that the agreement lasts. If there is any scheduled interruption in the continuity of the usage, or if there is an option for early lease termination, this should be specified.


Most leases last three months, six months, or a year.
You also have the option of issuing a monthly or weekly lease agreement., For a housing agreement, payment information should include the rent amount and stipulations regarding how it should be paid.


Write what day of the month the rent is due, and where it should be sent.
Specify the whether a late fee will be charged after a certain amount of time and the amount. For example, you could write, ""If the tenant pays more than ten days after the due date, the tenant will be charged a $60.00 late fee.""
Describe the terms of the deposit. State the amount of the deposit and the terms under which it will be returned. Note that the deposit won't be returned unless the property is in good condition at the end of the lease. State how many days after the lease is completed the deposit will be returned.

, State who is in charge of paying utilities (gas, water, and electricity), taking care of trash and recycling, maintaining the outdoor areas on the property, and any other responsibilities specific to the rental property.


Check into local laws to find out how to parse out the responsibilities. In some cases the landlord is legally obligated to pay for gas and water, while in other areas the tenant may take care of these expenses.
Outline who is responsible for making repairs, keeping appliances in working order, and so on. Again, you should check into local laws to determine what your role should be. In most cases the landlord is responsible for keeping the living space safe and functional.
State that the tenant is responsible for informing the landlord about problems with the rental property, including safety concerns, lost keys, and so on., This should typically state that the tenant is responsible for adhering to all applicable laws, that the tenant agrees to only utilize the property in manners for which it is intended, and that the tenant is responsible for any tickets or fines received for failing to do so.


State that the rental is to be used for residential purposes only.
Write out what the tenant should do if something on the property gets damaged.
Specify whether the tenant is allowed to make changes to the rental. For example, if the tenant wants to paint the walls, install a cable modem, and so on, you should state in the lease whether these changes are allowed.
Decide whether pets are allowed and specify the rules regarding them in the lease. You might require an additional, nonrefundable pet deposit for each animal based on animal weight. You might state that pets will be allowed indoors or must stay outdoors. You might specify actions that you will take if the pets are not treated humanely. Carefully consider all aspects of allowing pets on your property.
Determine whether the tenant is allowed to sublet the unit, and outline the process for doing so.

, This should detail the action which will be taken by the landlord in the event that the tenant fails to make the agreed upon payments or is found to be violating other assigned responsibilities. Detail the remedies available to you as the landlord, including eviction, repossession and/or court action.

, Both the landlord and tenant must sign the agreement in order for the contract to take effect.

, Laws pertaining to landlord and tenant rights vary from state to state. It is very important that you understand the laws in your jurisdiction when you write up a lease. If you end up writing something that enforceable, your lease might become worthless to you. You can start with a standard lease agreement, but make sure it contains the correct provisions., Get legal advice for two reasons: to make sure your lease adheres to local laws, and to make sure it will give you adequate protection should any problems arise. Find an attorney who has plenty of experience drawing up and approving rental agreements and other contracts. He or she will know the correct language to use and the right provisions to include to make sure your lease is legally airtight.

, A lease should not be difficult for either party to understand. Don't use too much legalese. Write in clear, concise sentences. Do your best to make sure no confusion will arise as a result of an unclear lease.


Check the spelling and grammar. A lease with poor grammar, bad punctuation, and misspelled words can be confusing to read.
Use special formatting to highlight important information. You can bold the rent amount and deposit amount, and underline important dates.

Find coupons in the inserts from companies like SmartSource. You can usually find 2 to 3 dedicated coupon inserts every Sunday.
Check for sale fliers from your favorite stores. These may have coupons printed across the bottom of the page or next to some of your favorite items.
Find out when your favorite store prints its sales flyer. If your favorite grocery store prints its flier in Thursday's paper, then consider subscribing on Thursday as well.;
, Many stores will email coupons to you or send you an electronic copy of their sales fliers. If you purchase or sign up for a loyalty card from a company, be sure that you provide your email address and indicate that you want to receive messages containing deals.

, Some ideas include:


SmartSource.com
Coupons.com
Redplum.com
CouponNetwork.com
Groupon.com

, These subscriptions will deliver coupons to your mailbox based on deals available in your region.

, If your favorite companies have a Twitter feed, then subscribe so you can get a link to deals.

, All You, for instance, is a magazine sold by Walmart that is chock full of great coupons.

, You may find coupons on store shelves next to your favorite products. You can also look at the front of your store for a machine that dispenses deals. Some stores have machines into which you can insert your loyalty card and receive coupons based on your past purchase patterns.

, You can scan these codes with your mobile phone and be led to an online coupon that you can use at checkout. A QR code looks something like this:


Purchase a mobile phone app that will read QR codes, such as QRReader for iPhone or QR Droid for Android. Tap on the app to open it.
Generally, you point your camera at the code and press the key in the bottom center of your phone to activate a scanner. You then scan the code and the coupon or website opens on your phone. Different apps have different instructions, so check your app to be sure.

, If you have friends who also love to extreme coupon, then get together and swap coupons that you don't use for some that are more valuable to you., Note the expiration date on each. They usually have to be used within 10 days to 3 months of the day they print out.

, You can list the stores at which you most commonly shop and receive information about catalinas that they are currently printing.

, Extreme couponers leave comments in the forum letting you know what deals are currently out there in the form of catalinas.

, For instance, if you receive a catalina for $1 off 3 jars of applesauce, try this trick:


Come back into the store and buy more applesauce. Use the catalina at the cash register. If you're lucky, another catalina will be given to you after your transaction.
Go back for more applesauce as long as the catalinas keep printing. You can usually get away with a maximum of 3 transactions per store.

, For instance, if you know that your grocery store has 4 locations close to your home, then visit all 4 locations. Use the catalinas to stock up on your favorite items. Be aware that not every location will print the same catalinas, but if the stores are close-by, it's worth exploring.

, If you receive in-store coupons for $5 off a $30 purchase, then save the catalinas for when you need to purchase expensive items, like meat or seafood. Then, use as many as you can in 1 transaction to save money on these items.

, If a store is willing to accept competitor coupons, then you can get the same deals in a different store instead of waiting on your preferred store to run a sale.

, Go to a coupon forum yourself and let your fellow extreme couponers know what catalinas you found. If you are generous with your tips, then your fellow couponers will reciprocate.

, One good idea is to use a website like The Grocery Game. This site will list the sales flyers for your favorite stores. When you see an item in the flyer, and you know you have a coupon for that item, then it's time to save yourself some money. Otherwise, you can do the research yourself.

, Try 1 of these methods:


Use baseball cardholders inside a 3-ring binder to make your coupons easy to reach. Then, use divider tabs to split your coupons into sections by product, by store or by another method that makes sense to you.
Use an alphabetically organized accordion file. Place your coupons in order by product name. Sort through each pocket weekly and put soon-to-expire coupons at the front of the pocket so you don't forget to use them.
If you can't be bothered cutting out the coupons to insert into separate card slots in a binder, simply hole punch the page and attach a pair of small scissors (such as a child's safety pair) by a string to the binder. That way, you can cut out the coupon as you find the product.

, You can do this on an Excel spreadsheet.


As you walk around, you can place the relevant coupon into a small envelope sitting in your bag or in the cart, in readiness to hand over all coupons for items you found to the cashier.
As you use coupons, mark them off your list with a pen or pencil. When you get home, delete them from your spreadsheet.

, If your store is selling cereal in a ""Buy 2, Get the 3rd Free"" promotion, and you have a coupon for the same cereal, then get as much cereal as you can under the terms of the deal.


Watch the language on the sale flyer to make sure the store has a reasonable limit on the amount of items that you can buy under the promotion.
Avoid buying perishable items in bulk. For example, don't stockpile dairy or produce.
At home, shop from your stash. If you don't know what to cook for dinner, then choose an item from your bulk purchases to avoid ordering takeout or running to the store for something you can live without.

, If you have manufacturer's coupons and store coupons, then combine them to get even more money off your purchase.

, If your store will let you place a bulk order for the items listed on your coupon, then don't be afraid to ask.

, Extreme coupon transactions take time, and other customers will feel impatient if you hold up the line with your coupons. Also, cashiers can become frustrated with many coupons because of not only transaction length but also confusion about store policies. You need to go at a time the store isn't too busy to minimize conflict.

, Extreme coupon transactions require clear communication. If your children are running wild or trying to talk to you while you're interacting with the cashier, then you won't be able to concentrate on what you're doing. Find a babysitter for your early extreme coupon adventures.

, You may have to go with a brand that isn't your tried and true choice to get a deal. As long as the difference in taste and quality is negligible, the savings will be worth it.

, This is simply a safeguard against cashiers who aren't aware of store policies themselves and don't really want to have to deal with your extreme coupling.


It is far easier to say ""we don't accept that"" than to go to the effort of ringing it all through, so be prepared to politely but firmly clarify the appropriateness of your coupon actions by pointing out the store policy.
You will often find the policy online; if not, ask the store manager for a copy.

, Stick to these good practices:


Be considerate to your cashier and to the people lined up behind you.
Never photocopy coupons. Some stores will no longer accept coupons that even appear to be photocopied.
Avoid hoarding. Items usually go on sale on a 6 to 8 week cycle. Stock up on enough to take you through the sales cycle and no more. Don't become a person who stacks cases of toothpaste under your bed.
Don't commit fraud. Avoid using coupons for items other than the item printed on the paper. Also, never alter existing coupons or print off counterfeits., Some stores will match and even undercut the price of the same product sold in other stores. Just bring in a sales flyer from the competing store as proof of the price.

, You might feel limited at first, but you'll come to enjoy the creative challenge of coming up with meals that your family will enjoy at a low cost.

, If you can accumulate points toward a fuel purchase by shopping at a certain store, then you'll save money on top of your coupon discounts.

, For instance, buy a winter coat in the spring, or purchase bedding and home items in January. Look for big post-holiday clearance sales or summer clearance sales.

, Don't go crazy with your credit card just to get bargains, but use it wisely to help yourself save money. Some cards offer gift cards to use in certain stores or discounts on certain products. You can also earn rewards toward restaurants, airline tickets or hotel stays.

, Sometimes, a store's generic product is cheaper even than a brand-name product combined with a coupon offer. The generic version is often comparably good, so be open-minded.

, If you can't possibly use all those boxes of pancake mix, then donate them to needy families in your community.

, You're probably going to have to coupon for at least 3 months to build your stockpile of goods. Then, you will begin to see significant savings.

Look for old Sunday papers.,
Check in dumpsters or recycling centers.,
Check out your local libraries.,
Trade coupons with others.,
Get coupons in the store.,
Collect Catalinas.,
Find coupons on existing grocery products.",How to Find Grocery Coupons Online2," Most grocery coupons are found in the newspapers on Sundays and Wednesdays. If you have a newspaper subscription, you can easily locate the coupons inserted in your newspaper.There are three different inserts that might be found in your newspaper: Smart Source (SS), Red Plum (RP) and Procter & Gamble (PG). You’ll be likely to find at least one, if not more, of these inserts.
Save multiple copies of the inserts, and you’ll be able to save even more when you find the product on sale. Most coupon-clippers like to have 2-4 copies of their coupons on hand at any given time.

, Even if you don’t subscribe to the newspaper yourself, you might be able to cash in on free coupons that other people were planning to throw away. Many people throw away or recycle their coupon inserts, and would happily share theirs with you. Start by finding out whether people you know subscribe to the local newspaper.Check with your coworkers as well. You could even set up a coupon exchange at work.
If your workplace has a newspaper subscription, you might be able to take the coupon inserts unless they’re used for another purpose.

, If you live near a coffee shop or restaurant that sells the newspaper, you’ve probably seen people reading the paper on Sunday mornings, then leaving it behind for someone else to read. Take advantage of these old papers that would likely be headed straight to the trash.Some gas stations might give you their unsold Sunday papers on Sunday evening or Monday mornings.
You can also find the coupon inserts that have fallen out of the newspapers stacked in the bottom of the newspaper box.

, If you don’t mind what people think, you can almost always find Sunday newspapers tossed into recycling centers. You can usually gather many weeks’ worth of coupon inserts within a few minutes.Once you’ve located the best locations for dumpster diving in your area, revisit every couple of weeks.
Some dumpsters might be locked, or have an attendant to prevent you from getting inside the dumpster. In this case, it’s worth getting to know the attendant. Usually, once you establish yourself as a safe, respectful person, the attendant won’t mind your trespassing.

, Almost all libraries carry newspaper subscriptions. They discard the coupons, and so are usually happy to give you their coupon inserts if you ask them nicely.If your city has many libraries, get to know them all.
Don’t forget to stop by on Wednesdays as well as Sundays.

, Start a coupon exchange with others in your community if there's not already one in existence. The premise of the coupon exchange is simple: provide a coupon exchange box in selected community locations (the gym, community center, church basement, etc.) and put the coupons you don't want in the box.Invite others to do the same.
You'll then multiply the number of coupons you all have to choose from, and find the coupons you need for your own use.
There are plenty of options for online coupon exchange as well.

, You can sometimes find coupons in an automatic dispenser mounted on a grocery shelf beside the product. These coupons are called “Blinkie’s” because the machines sometimes have little red blinking lights.These coupons are usually provided by the manufacturer.
The downside of Blinkie coupons is that you can’t predict when they will appear.

, Catalinas are the coupons that you might receive after you check out at the grocery store’s cashier’s station. These coupons can be for a certain amount of money off a specific product (for example 50¢ off your purchase of a 16-ounce coffee) or for money off your next order (for example $1.00 off your next order).They are called Catalinas because this is the name of the company that produces this type of coupon. However, they might be knows as “register rewards” or another name.
The disadvantage of Catalinas is that you can’t spend them at the time of your purchase. They are provided as a way to lure you back to the store.

, Manufacturers will often provide coupons taped to the lids or labels of their products to encourage the consumer to buy their product. These are called Peelies. You might find a coupon for $1.00 off the purchase of 3 cans of a certain product, for example.When coupons are found hanging around the necks of bottles or jars, they are known as hangtag coupons.
You’ll need to make sure to check and see that the cashier notices these coupons if you aren’t using a self-check lane. Because they’re attached to the product, they’re occasionally missed.

Some lease provisions will be required by the laws of your state, while some provisions that are required in one state may be illegal in another. Working with an experienced real estate attorney will help you make sure that your lease will be enforceable in your state.Typically, if one provision isn’t legal, then that provision won’t be enforced but the rest of the lease will be.;
, If you are in or near a city, you can probably find a local real estate housing authority. This office exists to provide assistance to landlords and tenants. They also oversee certain low-income rental situations, to make sure that landlords comply with local regulations. In some cases, if you fall under their jurisdiction, you may be even be required to use a particular lease form that the housing authority will provide.The Housing Authority of Salt Lake City, for example, requires the landlord to provide a lease document. However, the landlord must comply with Housing Authority requirements.The St. Louis Housing Authority will review and certify any leases for properties that are rented as part of the affordable housing program.The Baltimore Housing Authority has a full website dedicated to information for landlords. This includes information about requirements for rentals and provisions that must be included in your lease., Use the Internet to find a variety of prepared residential lease forms. A simple search for “residential lease forms” will result in many samples. If you review the results, you will find that some are designated for particular states or cities. These will already include provisions that may be required by state or local law. Other results will be more general but still provide a good starting point for creating a lease.


The Minnesota State Bar Association has prepared and published a sample lease agreement that complies with state property law. You will need to fill in the details for your particular property and tenant.The Chicago Association of Realtors provides a sample lease agreement for use within the city of Chicago.The Province of British Columbia has posted a website with information about local real estate laws. The site includes a template of a residential tenancy agreement, along with other forms that could become necessary.The website RentalLeaseAgreement.org contains a list of all 50 U.S. states, which link to standard lease agreements that will be valid in each state. Select your state from the list, and you will be redirected to a page that highlights some particular rental requirements for your state. You will also find a link to download a lease agreement form., A residential lease is a binding contract between two or more parties. One of the first provisions of your lease should be the identification of the landlord and tenant. If you are using a prepared lease form, you will see spaces to fill in the names. If you are drafting your own lease agreement, you may use complete sentences or simply write out any clear form that identifies the landlord and tenants.For example, your first paragraph could read, “This is a residential lease between John Smith, Landlord, and Robert Adams, Tenant.”
Alternatively, your lease could simply begin, “Landlord: John Smith. Tenant: Robert Adams.”
If you have more than one tenant, you must make sure that you identify each one clearly by name. For example, if a married couple is going to be renting the property, the lease should identify the tenants as, “Robert Adams and Mary Adams,” and not simply as “Mr. and Mrs. Adams.”
If two or more unrelated tenants will be renting as roommates, they should be identified individually., If the owner is going to live at the property and will personally be responsible for any maintenance or emergencies that arise, the lease should say so. If, however, a separate superintendent or property manager will be handling the routine affairs, then this person or company should be mentioned early in the lease. The lease should include information about who the tenants should contact with problems and how they can reach the appropriate person or office., The lease must clearly identify the property. You should begin by giving its address. If it is an apartment in a multi-unit apartment building, be sure to include the apartment number. You should also include at least a brief description of the property, such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, closets, and so on.If you are leasing an apartment in a complex with multiple similar units, it may be a good idea to include a floor plan of the apartment.
If the lease is for a space in a townhouse or single family home, for example, there may not be an apartment number. The lease may just have a description, such as “Second Floor apartment at 276 Grove Street, with use of communal bathroom and first floor kitchen.”
Specify which appliances and features are included or not included. For example, if the landlord is providing a refrigerator and there’s no functioning garbage disposal in the property, those things should be stated in the lease.

, The lease should state the amount that is due. You should include a statement that defines what form of payment will be acceptable, such as cash, check, credit or money order. The lease should also say where the payment is to be delivered., The lease should inform the tenant when the payments are to be due. Payments are traditionally due on the first of the month, although the lease may specify any day that you wish. Some leases will set the last day of the month or set a date in the middle., Many leases will allow five to ten days after the due date for payments to be received without penalty. This is called a grace period. If you wish to allow such provision, make sure that it is written into the lease., In the same provision about rent payments, a lease should include any penalty terms for late payments. If this provision is not written into the lease, the landlord will not later be able to collect a penalty. The penalty for late payments may range from a small additional fee to possible eviction, depending on the degree and repetition of the lateness.Many state laws will regulate the amount of money that a landlord may charge as a late penalty. Check with a real estate attorney or local housing board to ensure that your late provision is in compliance with state law., The lease must spell out any changes that are anticipated for the rent and must define when and to what extent the landlord may increase the rent. For example, in a multi-year lease, the landlord may want the right to increase the rent at the end of each year. This must be identified in the lease, or the landlord may not have the right to do so.Some state laws include sections that limit allowable rent increases. You should become familiar with your local requirements.

, The lease must clearly identify when it begins and how long it will last. You cannot simply assume anything. Usually, a lease term will be planned to begin on the first day of a month and to end on the last of a month. However, this is simply a matter of convention designed to make the dates easier to remember, but the parties to the lease can agree to any dates., Residential leases usually last for a single year. Some leases, more often for apartments than for homes, may have a month-to-month term. Some may also be multi-year leases. As you are writing or negotiating the lease, you will want to consider the pros and cons of each period and choose the one that best suits your needs.An annual lease lasts for one year. At the end of the initial year, the parties will have the opportunity to negotiate new lease terms. A one-year lease provides security to both parties for a year but has the flexibility of renegotiating or terminating at the end of that time if either party wishes.
A multi-year lease is usually written for two or three years. Some residential leases may be written even longer. In some high-end apartment complexes, it may be more common to use multi-year leases because residents there tend to be more stable.
Month-to-month leases provide a high level of flexibility for both parties but they limit certainty. A tenant can give notice to move out at almost any time, with only one month’s notice. Similarly, the landlord on a month-to-month lease has the right to terminate the agreement with short notice and get rid of undesirable tenants. A month-to-month agreement also allows the landlord more opportunity to increase the rent.

, You should consider what you want to happen when the initial term of the lease expires. It is common for many annual leases to revert to a month-to-month lease, if no action is taken. The lease should include a notice provision that describes how much time is required before the original expiration date of the lease. This notice period is intended to give both parties time to negotiate any new terms for a revised lease.As an example, you may include a paragraph that says, ""This lease shall continue for one year from September 1, 2016, through August 31, 2017. If the tenant wishes to renew the lease beyond the expiration date, the tenant shall make such request in writing, 30 days prior to the expiration date. If no such renewal is made, then the lease shall become a month-to-month tenancy following the expiration date.""

, Every lease should contain provisions about early termination. This clause will apply equally to both parties. The early termination clause should explain how much notice the tenant must provide to leave the property early. It should also spell out what notice the landlord must give before terminating the lease early. Early termination by the landlord may not be allowed in many places other than for cause, such as extreme damage to the property or non-payment of rent.The lease should specify that an early termination notice should be provided in writing.

, The utilities are an important part of any residential property lease. The lease should consider all the utilities that are connected to the property and should define whether the landlord or tenant is responsible for payment.For example, this paragraph might read, ""The tenant agrees to be responsible for all utilities for the property except ______."" The landlord can then fill in whichever utilities the landlord will pay.

, Both parties to the lease need to understand and agree which maintenance tasks belong to the tenant and which will be handled by the landlord. Very often, a lease will assign minor repairs within the residence to the tenant, with the landlord taking care of more extensive work (plumbing and heating, for example).For example, if the landlord is providing a washer and dryer in the property but will not do any repairs on or replacements of the machines, this should be mentioned in the lease.

, If the rental property includes anything additional and out of the ordinary, these special services should be defined in the lease. Some examples might be available laundry facilities, the use of a communal swimming pool, or on-site trash removal., A standard part of any lease agreement is the security deposit. In the majority of leases, the security deposit will often be set equal to one month’s rent, although different amounts can be negotiated. The security deposit is an amount that the tenant must pay the landlord, which the landlord will keep until the tenant departs.The lease should contain the requirements about the landlord’s handling of the security deposit. Usually, this money must be held in a secure account and not be commingled with the tenant’s rent payments. This provision of the lease should also explain when the landlord must return it to the tenant.

, The lease needs to spell out when the landlord is allowed to keep the security deposit. The security deposit money legally belongs to the tenant, until some event of forfeiture occurs. Such events are usually going to be damage to the apartment or nonpayment of rent.The lease should define what notice is required from the landlord to the tenant if the landlord intends to keep any part of the security deposit. This notice must also contain a detailed explanation of the reason.

, The lease needs to explain how and when the landlord must return the security deposit, barring any forfeiture. Usually this will be some time after the tenant leaves the property. The landlord should have a reasonable amount of time to inspect the property after the tenant has left and determine whether any damages have occurred., If there are any agreements between the landlord and tenant that are not included in the primary lease, they should be written on separate pages called ""Addenda."" These should then be added to the back of the lease. The landlord and tenants should sign each addendum separately. Some common topics for addenda are:Pet Addendum
Subleasing Addendum
House Rules Addendum

, Include a paragraph in the lease agreement that verifies that the lease represents the entire agreement between the parties. A paragraph like this will prevent either the landlord or tenant from trying in the future to change some provision of the lease by saying, ""But the landlord told me....""


This paragraph can be a simple sentence that says, ""This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Landlord and Tenant. No oral agreements have been entered into, and any modifications to this lease shall be made in writing.""

, A lease is a contract, and as such must have the signatures of all parties or their legal representatives. At the end of the lease, there should be a space for ""Landlord's Signature: ____________"" and ""Tenant's Signature:___________."" Similar signature lines should appear at the bottom of each addendum page as well.


Initial any changes to the lease. Throughout the lease document, if there is a reason to change any of the typed provisions of the lease, the changes should be made in ink, and both parties should initial the change in the margin.
All tenants should sign individually. Except for minor children who may be living in the property, each tenant should sign separately. This applies equally to husband and wife couples, non-married couples, or individuals who will be sharing the lease.
Make sure all parties sign every page and the addenda included and that they clearly understand everything they are signing.
Allow about one hour with the tenants to review and sign the lease.

, After all parties sign the lease, photocopies should be provided to each tenant. The landlord should retain the original in a safe place. If any dispute arises during the tenancy, each party should be able to refer to the signed copies."

Format the letter appropriately.",How to Write a Complaint Letter to Your Landlord," If something is bothering you enough to write to your landlord about it, it needs to be important. Choose the most important issue to write about. Try to choose between annoying things and serious issues that make your place unlivable.Important maintenance your landlord needs to address include:


Waterproofing the roof and exterior walls
Providing unbroken windows and doors
Plumbing, electricity and gas upkeep
Sewage, trash, water, and heat upkeep
Keeping electrical wiring to code
Keeping floors, stairways and railings in working order
Removal of rodents and other pests;
, Before you write, it's important to back up your claims with specific evidence. Keep a detailed account of the problem, including dates. Take pictures of the problem so that you can provide the landlord with evidence. Writing that you've ""Seen some roaches from time to time"" is vague. Instead, you want to write, ""The first cockroach was seen on May 7th at 4 pm under the stairwell.""


Keep a notebook handy and write down the date, time, and content of the problem when it occurs. If you see roaches, write down where, when, and how many. Keep this as up-to-date as possible.
If some part of the property needs fixed, take several high-quality pictures. Keep track of them by date.

, Before writing your complaint letter, it's a good idea to read over your legal lease agreement. See how your contract applies to the issue in question. If your lease addresses your issue, your complaint will be much stronger.


Check for any vague language that could be interpreted in your favor. There's a lot of legalese in lease agreements, some of which is debatable.

, Many local, state or province and federal laws may apply to your particular grievance. Reference these in your letter to help give it some weight.


Look up noise ordinances. Look up trash burning ordinances. Depending on the problem, you want to find something be applicable. Attach this legal text to your complaint.Renters' rights and laws vary widely, state-by-state. To learn more about regulations in your state, click here.

, What will you do, if your landlord doesn't fix the situation in the amount of time you're calling for it to be fixed? If you withhold rent in reaction, state this up front. Make sure your landlord gets the message.


Only choose responses that you can back up. Don't say you'll sue unless you've talked to an attorney. It's important to understand the legal costs for which you may be responsible. The landlord may choose to call your bluff, putting you in a tough position.

, It's important for your letter to come across and calm and professional, but as stern as is necessary. You can be tactful and kind while still being firm about what you want. This is a serious matter, and your writing should reflect that.


Avoid four-letter words and jargon. Keep it calm and avoid inflammatory language. Instead of writing something like ""We're freaking tired of all the construction noise,"" a good tone for a formal complaint letter might read like this: ""The constant noise level has negatively affected the tenant's quality of life.""

, Address the letter to your landlord simply, and then explain why you're writing. Explain that you have a problem with the property and that you'd like it fixed immediately, or you'll be forced to take action. Get to it in the first 2-3 sentences.


An intro like this works well: ""A problem with the property has arisen which needs your immediate attention. This is outlined in our lease agreement. We hope the problem can be fixed quickly, so further action won't be required on our part.""
Don't worry too much about including pleasantries and small-talk in the writing. It's not necessary for this kind of letter.

, The most important part of the complaint letter is obviously the complaint itself. Explain in detail what the problem is. Provide the evidence necessary to make your case, or to make your request clear.


Just get into the details: ""On August 1st, we noticed the first of the cockroaches. You were initially contacted the afternoon of August 2nd, and required three phone-calls to get you to come address our concerns. Cockroaches have been found in the kitchen, under the stairwell floorboards, and can be heard in the walls. As of September 1st, the cockroaches are still present. Here is a detailed list of all occasions we have had food ruined by roaches, and photographs of the infestation.""

, Make it clear how you want the situation to be handled in accordance with your rights as a tenant. If you want something to be fixed, express this demand clearly and professionally. Write, ""The stairs need to be fixed immediately so that the property can be considered tenable.""


Depending on the issue, you may get as specific as you want. What do you want done about the cockroaches, exactly? If the landlord has set out some cheap dollar-store traps, is that enough? The job may legally be taken care of, even if there are still roaches present. Demand a professional exterminator be hired, if necessary. Make your request clear.

, If your landlord ignores your request, what action have you decided to take? Make it clear in your letter. Cite your lease agreement and local regulations.


One option lots of renters have is to withhold rent payments until the problem is rectified. If you deem the property unlivable according to your lease, you may withhold rent until it is fixed.Another option you have will be contacting local housing authorities, who can come down hard on landlords. Give your landlord an opportunity to fix the issue before you do this.

, Once you've made your specific request and explained what you'll be forced to do, give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the letter. Usually no more than two weeks is necessary to expect a response, but usually less will be required.


Mandatory response times for landlords responding to tenants can vary by state or jurisdiction. Some U.S. states refer to a reasonable standard of 5 to 10 days. Be sure to include a call for a timely response according to local law.

, Dumb typos and spelling mistakes could doom your case. Go back through the letter and clear it up as much as possible, to present your complaint in the best possible light.Your letter needs to be crystal clear and concise, not only in spelling and grammar, but in sentence structure and logic. Read through your draft to make sure that what you say makes sense, as it would if you said it out loud.
Don't Try to write in too much legalese to make it ""sound smart."" Use the same type of language you'd use in any professional letter, and keep it as clear as possible.

, Complaint letters should always be word processed and printed, or faxed. Make the letter look as professional as the content included.


Include your contact information in the top right-hand corner of the letter. Include your phone number, e-mail address, and the address of the rental property in question at the top.
Sign the letter and date it, to provide a reference point for the time-agreement. Deliver the letter yourself, personally, so it doesn't get lost in the mail.
Generally, letters don't need to be longer than a single page, one-sided. If you need to go on much longer, consider breaking it up into multiple requests. If you've got that much to complain about, don't do it all at once.

Realize that a home made available via a standard lease may include an option to purchase that home at a specified price over a specified time period (usually one or two years).,
Negotiate a fair contract that will credit the buyer 100% of that option consideration upon closing of the sale.

,
Look for a negotiated percentage of all rent payments being applied toward the purchase price of the home.

,
Consider what you might expect to find in a contract as follows:


a.,
Learn how this works by studying this example transaction:


Imagine a nice 3 bedroom, 1 bath single family home located in a near west suburb of Chicago, in a great neighborhood with good schools and a strong community.,
Assure that this is a sound approach by getting it in contract form.,
Consider the many advantages for the renter.",How to Understand Rent to Own Homes by Example," In order to acquire that option, the renter/buyer must pay a one time, non-refundable, fee called the ""option consideration"". The exact amount is negotiable, but it is usually ranges from 2.5 to 7% of the purchase price.

,,, In order to receive a rent credit of 50%, time is of the essence. You must pay your rent on or before the due date of your lease (typically the 1st of the month). This means it must be received by the lessor (landlord) on or before the due date. Any payment received after the due date will result in a 0% rent credit for that month, a late fee may apply and you will not be building any equity.
b. Maintenance is the responsibility of the tenant buyer. You are now renting to own, and home ownership requires maintenance. This includes things like broken windows from stones or baseballs, clogged drains, peeling paint, broken appliances, burnt out bulbs, lawn work/snow removal, etc. If any major repairs are required to ensure habitability, the owner remains responsible.
c. You need to have ""option consideration"". Option consideration is typically 2.5% to 7% of the purchase price of the home. It is a non-refundable payment, of which 100% is credited toward the purchase price, which binds the lease purchase contract.;
, It has been freshly painted, cleaned, and is ready to move in. The purchase price will be $215,000. Monthly rent payments will be $1,500 and you will receive a 50% rent credit ($750 per month). You need between 2.5% and 7% in up front option consideration. Let's say your budget allows for $6,000 for option consideration. This equates to approximately 2.8% ($6,000/215,000). You will also need $1,500 for the first months rent for a total initial payment of $7,500.

Please note: Option consideration is not a security deposit. It is a non refundable payment toward the purchase price and is 100% credited toward reducing the price of the home.


Suppose you paid all your monthly rent payments on or before the due date and you choose to buy the rent-to-own home at the end of the 12 month lease purchase contract. You will have $15,000 in equity before you even own the home! Here's the math:

Lease Purchase Price - $215,000
Less: Option Consideration paid at lease signing - $6,000
Less: 50% rent credit of $750/m * 12 months - $9,000
Net Purchase Price after credits - $200,000
You started with $6,000 and by paying your rent on time, your equity position grew 150% (another $9,000) for a total of $15,000 with 12 months. Not a bad deal! Many people find it nearly impossible to save $9,000 in a year with all the costs of living constantly on the rise.



, Now you may be thinking, ""OK, what's the catch? This sounds too good to be true."" Answer, there is no catch. There are many possible reasons a landlord/seller may want to enter into a rent-to-own agreement. Some reasons may include:


Needs to maintain ownership for at least one year for tax purposes,
Unable to get a fair price due to local conditions
Tired of performing minor maintenance.
When one sells a home through a realty service, a commission of 5-7% is typically paid. In the example above, this can cost more than the rent credit. Since Realtors are usually not involved with this type of transaction, there is no commissions and the landlord can afford to pass along the savings to tenant/buyer in the form of rent credits
When the tenant becomes the tenant buyer (via rent-to-own), there is an immediate sense of pride in ownership. Tenant buyers add value to the community. They take care of their future property, make improvements, and feel good knowing their rent money is working for them (reducing the purchase price) rather than just making their landlord rich.

, Some include:


build equity toward home ownership
no bank or finance company involvement
poor credit history may not be an issue.

Sign or initial and date any attached pages.",How to Understand Your Apartment Lease," In most standard written leases, one of the first paragraphs will be the identification of the parties. You will need to make sure that you are correctly identified as the tenant. If you are renting with a roommate, spouse or family, you should make sure that everyone who is legally responsible for the rent is named as a tenant.You can find a Sample Rental Agreement at http://www.masshousinginfo.org/resources/download/landlord/property_management/Lease%20form.pdf?item_id=98098. This template includes general terms that will be acceptable in most states. In the Sample Rental Agreement, the parties are identified right away in paragraph 1.
If you are married and have children, the children are not going to be named as tenants, because they will not be legally responsible for the contract. However, you may check to see if the lease contains a paragraph about children or a section to name everyone who will be living in the apartment. On the Sample Rental Agreement, you would list children in paragraph 7.
If you are renting with a roommate, you and the roommate should decide how you will share the liability for the lease. In most cases, the landlord is likely to want to name both individuals as tenants. In that way, if one tenant defaults or moves away, the landlord can still hold the other tenant responsible. It is usually in your best interest to have all roommates named on the lease, so you don’t get stuck with the entire legal responsibility.;
, The person showing you the apartment and discussing the terms with you may not be the owner of the property. For a large apartment building or complex, the owner may be a corporation or someone who does not even reside at the property. The lease should clearly identify the landlord.On the Sample Rental Agreement, the landlord is also identified in Paragraph 1.

, If the owner does not reside at the property to take care of any concerns that might arise, you will want to make sure that you know who to contact for any problems. Look for the name of a property manager or supervisor, with a way to contact him or her at any time of day with a problem.Consider the possibility that your heat could go out or a pipe could burst in the middle of the night. You need a telephone number for a person you can contact at any time.
The Sample Rental Agreement does not contain a notice provision of this sort. You may just ask the landlord to provide you with the information, or you could attach it as an extra provision (see Paragraph 21).

, Although it may seem obvious, the lease must include a clear statement of the property you are renting. Make sure that the apartment is clearly identified by number or description. The identification should include at least a brief description of the apartment, such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, closets, and so on.In the Sample Rental Agreement, Paragraph 2 defines the property. Paragraph 5 then provides a description of fixtures and other property that is included with the apartment.
A lease in an apartment complex with multiple similar units may will attach a floor plan of the apartment.
If you are renting a space in a townhouse or single family home, for example, there may not be an apartment number. The lease may just have a description, such as “Second Floor apartment at 276 Grove Street, with use of communal bathroom and first floor kitchen.”

, When renting an apartment, perhaps the most important detail is the rent. This needs to be stated clearly, usually in one of the first few paragraphs of a lease contract. Make sure that the rent stated in the contract matches what you and the landlord have agreed.In the Sample Rental Agreement, you can find the rent clause at Paragraph 4.
Avoid “side agreements.” Sometimes, a landlord and tenant might agree to print one thing in the lease contract and then agree privately to something else. For example, they might agree privately on monthly rent of $1,300, but report a rent of $1,600 so the landlord in the future might be able to rent to someone else more easily for a higher amount. You must understand that, in case a problem or dispute arises between you and your landlord, the court is going to uphold what the written lease says. In this example, it could be possible for the landlord to turn on you and demand an additional $300 each month.

, The lease should define when your rent payments are due. Usually, payments are to be made by the first of the month, although some leases will call for payments on the last day of the month or may set a specific date in the middle of the month.Paragraph 4 of the Sample Rental Agreement defines both the amount of the rent payments and the due dates.

, You should always get your rent paid by the due date. However, most leases will include a provision for a grace period. With this, if you make your payment within 5, 10, or sometimes as many as 15 days late, the landlord will accept the payment and take no action against you.The Sample Rental Agreement says nothing about late payments. On one hand, this is beneficial to the tenant because it limits the landlord's ability to charge a late fee. On the other hand, you are not protected by a grace period, and the landlord could just declare you in default of the contract on the first day that you are late. It would be a good idea to negotiate for a grace period and add that to the lease.
Be careful about relying on the grace period. Even though the landlord may not impose a penalty or take any action against you for a payment that is only a couple days late, he or she may still take note of the fact that the payment is late. If you need a referral from the landlord to move to another apartment someday, it will not serve you well if the referral says that you made every payment late.

, In the same provision about rent payments, you should find an explanation of the landlord’s right in case your payments are late beyond the grace period. This may range from a small penalty fee to possible eviction.State laws often regulate the amount a landlord may charge as a penalty. If you believe that the lease allows a penalty that seems unreasonable, you should check with a real estate lawyer or local housing board., The lease should define any changes that are planned in your rent, or describe when and to what extent the landlord may increase the rent. For example, if you sign a multi-year lease, it would be reasonable to include a provision that allows the landlord to increase the rent at the end of each year by a limited percentage.Some state laws limit rent increases, while other states do not.
If the lease does not address the issue of a rent increase, then the landlord must honor the rent amount for the duration of the lease. If the lease expires or reverts to a month-to-month lease, then the landlord would be entitled to issue an increase.
The Sample Rental Agreement says nothing about rent increases.

, The lease should clearly identify the first and last dates of your tenancy. Usually, this will be planned to begin on the first of a month and to end on the last of a month, although you and the landlord can agree to any start and end dates that you wish.If you need to move in before the first of the month, you may be able to negotiate with the landlord for an earlier state date. If the property is empty anyway and is ready for you, the landlord might be willing to let you move in early and pro rate the rent for a few days.

, Apartment leases usually last for either a year or are month-to-month. Some may also be multi-year leases. These different lease types have different pros and cons, which you will want to consider in negotiating your agreement.An annual lease lasts for one year, and you and the landlord would have the right to negotiate a new lease at the end of that year. This provides you security for a year, that you have a home, but has the flexibility of being able to move out at the end of that time if you wish.
A multi-year lease lasts for usually two or three years, although some residential leases run even longer. In some high end apartment complexes, where residents tend to be more stable, a multi-year lease may be more common.
A month-to-month lease provides the most flexibility but the least security. You have the ability to give notice at almost any time that you are moving out, as long as you finish out the month. If your plans are unstable, this may be the lease you want. However, a landlord also has the right to terminate the agreement on short notice and have you move out. The landlord also has more opportunity to increase your rent in a month-to-month lease.
The Sample Rental Agreement defines the term of the lease in Paragraph 3. However, if you read it closely, the language is not very clearly written. It is unclear whether the lease is intended to be a month-to-month or an annual lease. If the starting and ending dates are a year apart, that would imply an annual lease, which reverts to a month-to-month lease at the end of the year.

, In almost every jurisdiction, you do not need to do anything to remain in a month-to-month lease. However, you should read the contract carefully to understand what you must do if you wish to renew an annual lease or a multi-year lease. Usually, you will need to notify your landlord at least 30 or 60 days before the original expiration date of the lease. That will give you and the landlord time to negotiate any new terms for a revised lease. Some leases will renew automatically for an additional year, unless you notify the landlord that you are leaving.In the Sample Rental Agreement, when the initial term of the lease expires, the lease will continue as a month-to-month lease. This is defined in Paragraph 3.

, Every lease should contain instructions about early termination. This will apply to both the tenant and the landlord. Read the provisions to find out how much notice you must provide if you wish to leave, and how much notice the landlord must provide if he or she wants you to leave early. (Early termination by the landlord may not be allowed in many places.)This notice must usually be provided in writing, to a certain person at a particular address. Pay attention to these details.
In the Sample Rental Agreement, early termination is addressed in Paragraph 20. Don't be confused by Paragraph 16, which is called ""Termination."" The provisions of Paragraph 16 focus on the tenant's departure from the unit at the regular end of the lease.

, In addition to rent, paying for the utilities can be one of your greatest expenses. If the utilities are included in the rent, this can represent a great savings. You need to make sure that the lease defines which utilities are included with the rent and which ones are not.The Sample Rental Agreement provides a good example of a way to spell out the responsibilities for utility payments, in Paragraph 9.
If you are responsible for paying for certain utilities, find out if you must use certain vendors or if you may shop around for better prices.

, You need to understand which maintenance tasks are your responsibility and which are the landlord’s. In general, the tenant will be responsible for minor repairs within the apartment, and the landlord will take care of more extensive work (plumbing, heating).If you have any question about what you might be responsible for doing, you should ask and have it clarified in the lease.


According to the Sample Rental Agreement, the Landlord will provide most of the maintenance services (Paragraph 18). Additional provisions require the tenant to make regular repairs to minor damage (Paragraph 11) and to maintain the property in a regularly neat and habitable condition (Paragraph 9).

, Anything that the landlord described when you were deciding on the apartment should be included in the lease agreement. This may be anything from available laundry facilities to use of a swimming pool to trash removal. If something was represented that is important to you, make sure that it is included in the lease., A standard part of any lease agreement is the security deposit. For most leases, the security deposit will be equal to one month’s rent, although different amounts can be negotiated. The security deposit is an amount that you must pay your landlord, which he or she will keep until you leave. The lease should contain the rules about the landlord’s handling of the security deposit in a secure account and should explain when the landlord must return it to you.The Sample Rental Agreement defines the security deposit in Paragraph 6.

, The lease needs to contain provisions that address when the landlord is allowed to keep your security deposit. Usually this will be for damage to the apartment, or for nonpayment of rent. According to many standard leases, the landlord must provide the tenant with written notice if he or she intends to keep any part of the security deposit, with an detailed explanation of the reason.In many cases, the security deposit is to be kept in an interest-bearing account for the duration of your tenancy. Ask your landlord about this if you do not see it in the lease agreement.

, The contract should explain when you are entitled to receive your security deposit. Usually this will be some time after you leave the apartment, with a reasonable amount of time for the landlord to get in and inspect and clean behind you., Any details that are important to you must be included in the written lease agreement. If they are not included, you need to have them added. If you and your landlord ever have a dispute about your lease and need to go to court, a judge is going to interpret the written lease as it is. It will not help for you to tell the judge, “But the landlord said...,” unless you can prove it somehow.No matter how “nice” your landlord may seem when you are moving in, you must have every part of your agreement in writing. The landlord may smile and tell you that “of course dogs are allowed,” but if you don’t put that in writing, he could change his mind and tell you to get rid of your Great Dane after two months.

, This may include such issues as smoking, subleasing, or allowing pets in the apartment. Many standard leases are just form agreements. To personalize them, you and your landlord may type additional agreements and attach them. If you do this, make sure that the attachments are identified and referred to as part of the original lease.For example, a common paragraph toward the end of the lease may be labeled, “Additional Agreements,” or something similar. This will be the place for you to identify the name of any added documents. Additional provisions are referenced in the Sample Rental Agreement in Paragraph 21. Although that paragraph does not include space to define any attachments, it would be a good idea to name any attachments, even in the margin of the page, and have both parties to the lease initial the addition. Then attach the extra page or pages.

, Any added agreements must be separately signed or initialed by the parties to the original lease. You should also date any attachments, preferably with the same date as the lease agreement itself. These additions are to be part of the original agreement, so they should contain the same formalities as the original agreement and should match the original as much as possible."

Be aware that every person will not receive the same weekly coupons in newspapers.,
Use your coupons at the rock bottom sales.,

Get used to setting aside some time to think through and write out possible transactions.,
Get out of any ""brand commitment"" you might currently have.,
Avoid using coupons just because you have coupons for an item.",How to Make the Most out of Coupon Savings," Coupon values will be regional, as some people might receive a $1.00 savings off one item, while others will receive a $1.00 savings off for two items. At times, you will need to be flexible and get into trading. eBay and coupon message boards are the best methods to get the right coupons for the maximum savings for your family needs. Set up an alert or have email alerts sent to you for such sites, so that you can keep up with coupon trades as relevant.;
, Rock bottom prices are considered to be those where an item goes at its lowest for the store sale cycle. Hitting these prices and using your coupons will guarantee the best results for your shopping trip.


Be aware that to get the most out of the coupon savings at this sale time, you can expect to purchase multiple of the same items, not just one or two of them. Doing this may seem like you're spending more all at once, but because you have a stockpile, you won't be going to the store at the last minute paying the regular and higher price.

, By piling up the coupon savings, you can go very far in making decent savings. Be sure to double check with stores in your area that they do accept doubling up or tripling in their coupon policy and how much of the coupon's value they multiply them by. Most drug and super stores, such as Target, CVS, and Rite Aid do not multiply coupon values. Compare different supermarkets and see which one offers the best deals.


If Store A doubles coupons up to 99 cents, a $0.75 coupon is actually worth $1.50 off, but a $1.00 coupon would be worth $1.00 off. If Store B doubles coupons up to $1.00, the $0.75 coupon is still worth $1.50 off, but a $1.00 coupon by their policy actually turns into $2.00 off.

, There are ways to get free and cheap stuff if it's in the right stores at the right time, with coupons. You might see yourself having to do either one transaction in person or multiple transactions in order to get the best deals. It's important to have worked through the best options in advance.


Some stores offer additional benefits, such as reward card savings, gas points, free store gift cards/rewards, or Box Top for Education points if you purchase either a minimum amount of items or in value in one transaction or during a special sale event.

, It will be harder than ever if you commit to one brand, as the coupons will be infrequent and possibly never. Always think outside of the box and try out either different brands or store brands. The bigger your variety is, the easier it will be to discover better savings with coupons.


Keep in mind that many home brands are made by the same manufacturer as the name brand; they just don't clarify this. Use your own experience to judge whether the substitute products are satisfactory or not––often, they'll be just fine.

If you have a coupon that you won't use or don't mind ""giving it away"", use it in a random act of kindness way. Leave coupons on aisle shelves near the goods in question or quickly scan other people's carts to see if you can match things. Ask them if they might want the coupons for their benefit. You never know what friendships you might strike up this way!
If a coupon expires before you use it, don't fret. Store sales come and go all the time and so do coupon offers. If the stores you shop at do not accept expired coupons, never let them go to waste. Military overseas and selected stores do accept these up to six months after the expiration date.

These courses are offered both online and in classrooms. Classroom courses are offered on a variety of schedules. The Georgia Real Estate Commission (GREC) maintains a list of approved schools on its website.The course you need to obtain an entry-level real estate license is called the Real Estate Salesperson Pre License course.
Different learners have different needs; be sure to choose a course option (online vs. classroom) that works best for your schedule and learning style.
Not all real estate schools offer the same level of service. When choosing a class, don't look only at the cost; also consider the services (live help, tech support, practice tests) that the school provides before making your choice.
Keep in mind that some classes are all text and others use animation in their presentations. Consider what you would prefer before signing up.

, Within 60 days of taking your exam, you must obtain a certified criminal history (CGIC) report, which includes information about any criminal history you may have, including arrests, judgments, sentences, and so forth. CGIC reports can be obtained at most sheriff's offices and police stations in Georgia.If you have prior criminal convictions or disciplinary actions from any licensing or regulatory agency, you will need to complete and submit a Background Clearance Application and supporting documentation that verifies each incident, along with a detailed written explanation of the circumstances surrounding the event, any restitution you may still owe, etc., Be sure to pay attention, take notes, and read your textbook carefully. You must receive at least a passing score on the school's final exam to receive a completion certificate. Different schools have different score and retake requirements, so be sure you are well-prepared for the test before you begin., If you are diligent and pay attention, your Prelicense course should sufficiently prepare you to take the exam; however, many people require additional study help to pass.

, In order to activate your real estate license, you will need a signed statement verifying that you will be working under the guidance of a licensed broker.

In exchange, you pay the broker either a monthly fee or a set part of your commission. You can begin looking for a broker to sponsor you at any time during the licensing process. Be sure to interview with a number of different brokers before making a selection, as different brokers have different fee schedules.Most real estate brokerages are always looking for new salespersons.

Edit your letter carefully.",How to Write a Hardship Letter for Mortgage Loan Modification," Writing a hardship letter may not always be the best solution. Before beginning your hardship letter, consider whether this is the best option for your situation. There may be an alternative that would work better for you.

For example, you may consider refinancing an underwater mortgage through HARP, consolidating other debts, or selling luxury items to free up some extra money and pay the debt.;
, Call your lender's loss mitigation department and speak to a representative. Ask the person for the name and direct phone line of who you need to address your hardship letter to. Be sure to clarify both the spelling of the name and the number so you are sure that you have both right. You should also ask for the address of the lender. Make sure to have a pen and paper ready to write this information down.Keep in mind that company you are contacting may not be the same as the original lender. Make sure to contact the company listed on the bill.

, When you write your letter, you will need to know exactly what to ask for. You know that you can't afford your current mortgage payments, but what exactly do you want the lender to do about it? Do you want them to forgive your missed payments and then restart with your regular payments? Or do you need a lower payment for a period of time? Having a reasonable request of the lender can improve your chances of success., There is no set format for addressing your letter. However, it is important that your letter gets to the right place in the lender's organization and that they have enough information to access your loan information. To make sure you include all of the required information, consider using the following format:


On your first line, write your full name. Go down a line and write your address on the next two lines (the second and third lines).
Write in your lender's name (the name of institution, not the individual recipient).
Skip another line, then write ""Loan number:"" and then your loan number. This number can be found on your loan contract., Skip another line after your loan number and write in your greeting. This can be either the generic, ""To Whom It May Concern"" or a ""Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. ___,"" depending on how much you know about who are writing the letter to. Then, skip another line before beginning the body of your letter., In the next part of your letter, clearly mention which kind of hardship you are suffering from and how you got there. Financial hardship is defined for the purpose of loan modification as a decrease in income or increase in expenses that was completely beyond your control or unexpected. State your hardship and then briefly explain how the situation arose. If you have more than one hardship currently affecting you, be sure to include all of them.


Different lenders have different standards for what exactly qualifies as financial hardship. In general, valid hardships include the following:

Loss of income/job.
Sudden illness/medical expenses.
Death of immediate family/other borrower on the loan.
Divorce/separation.
Military service.
Legal expenses.
Changes in loan payments (ARM adjustment).An example of an invalid hardship is that you were misled in the loan agreement or were unaware of the terms of the loan., It's best when the lender knows exactly what your goals are in obtaining loan modification. Do you want to keep the house or sell it as soon as possible? If you plan to keep the house, state that doing so is ""a priority."" Otherwise, make sure to note whether you are willing to do a ""short sale"" to get out of the house quickly. This means selling the house at below market value so that it will sell more quickly., You'll need to offer potential solutions to the lender so that you can work together with them to modify your loan. Think about your loan needs and suggest a loan modification that you think would be fair to your lender and allow you to get out of current financial hardship. For example, consider the following modifications:


If your interest rate has increased to an unmanageable level, consider asking for a reduction in that interest rate.
If you are behind on your payments, ask for your lender to grant you a temporary reduction in payments and a plan to repay the back payments over time after your situation improves. When you do this, make sure that the amount you offer is something you can actually afford right now.
If your home is less valuable than the balance of your loan (due to falling home prices), you may be able to get your lender to decrease the balance of your loan.Make sure to state your request in clear terms. For example, don't say, ""I want lower payments."" Instead, try saying, ""I would be able to afford payments of $500 per month for the next three months, at which point I could resume paying my current payments.""

, Write down what measures you have taken to overcome this hardship. Talk about your attempt to refinance the mortgage if you have applied for a refinance and failed to qualify. Describe your efforts to cut household expenses or sell other items to cover your mortgage. If you've lost a job, make it clear to the lender that you are actively seeking a new one. Here is where you can make your case that this loan modification is your last resort., Mention that you are a good and responsible citizen and, if you get a chance to modify your mortgage loan, you will never default in your mortgage payments and prove yourself a genuine borrower. If your financial situation has improved since you experienced the hardship, say so. Anything that will convince your lender of your ability to pay modified payments can only help your case., Briefly restate your hardship, specific loan modification request, and your promise to make future payments. Make this section only one or two sentences long., Start a new paragraph and provide the lender with an phone number and email at which you can be reached. Offer to submit any documentation or proof of your financial situation or hardship at their request. Finish by writing ""Sincerely,"" and then signing your name beneath. Under your signature, type or print your full name again.Thank your lender for their time and consideration at the end of the body of the letter.If the loan is in more than one person's name, each borrower should sign the bottom of the letter., Check the length of your letter. Your goal should be to shoot for about a page in total. If it is any longer, the lender may not bother to read all of your letter. If your letter is too long, go back and eliminate any unnecessary or irrelevant sentences or details. Try to eliminate personal information that you may have included to make your case. These facts may be important to you but not as much for the lender.For example, don't mention if your financial hardship is partially due to a drinking or drug problem.
Make sure to avoid complaining in the letter because these types of letters are often ignored.

, It is likely that your lender will request documentation of your financial situation or hardship. Anticipate this need by attaching information like pay stubs and bank statements from the relevant time period to your letter. Be ready to supply other documents if the lender asks you to., Your lender will have access to your financial documentation and likely will request other records of your employment or other documents as necessary. Because of this, it is likely that they will know if you are lying in your hardship letter. Doing so will result in the immediate denial of your loan modification request. This may even be considered fraud, which could give the lender reason to request that you pay the entire loan balance immediately., When you've edited your letter down to size, go back through and try to identify any errors in your spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Presenting yourself well in your letter depends on your ability to craft a well-written and error-free letter. If necessary, have a friend or relative read over your letter for you to spot any errors or inconsistencies.


It may be helpful to type your letter, rather than write it by hand, because of the spellchecker included in word processors. Doing so will also make revisions much simpler."

Expect to live on housing sites.",How to Get Free Land in the USA," Most of the time, free land is offered by small towns or farming communities. Usually, the goal is to draw in business or increase population. The best places to find free land are in states with low population densities.Try searching for ""Homestead Act of 2010"" or ""Free Land in United States"" online.;
, Most land is technically free. That is, you get it for free but you must do something in return. For instance, you may be required to build a home on the property (though some places allow mobile homes) or create a certain number of jobs in an area., The federal government got rid of homesteading 1976, meaning it doesn't offer free land for development anymore. If you see advertisements for free land from the federal government, it's not legitimate.Instead, you'll be looking for land offered by the town itself.

, Most communities that offer free land have websites about the program, which you can find through search engines. They use those websites to provide information on the land they offer, plus many have the application forms online. If you want to see the land yourself, you'll find contact information for the program, along with the appropriate people to show you the land.To find these websites, try searching for ""free land in "". For example, Marquette, Kansas has a website dedicated to their free land offers. This website offers information about applying, conditions for getting the free land, and contact information in case you have questions., Often, you will need to fill out an application to receive free land. You'll need to provide some basic biographical information, such as who will be living on the land and where you're living now. You also need to provide information on what you plan to do with the land. The cities offering this benefit want to make sure you will fulfill the requirements they set out. Otherwise, they may reject your application., To get the land, you will have to submit a housing plan and prove you have the financial means to build. With some communities, you'll need to submit a blueprint for approval. Basically, they want to see you have a plan for your house or business, and that you have the money to do it. In some locations, you may only be asked to provide a blueprint.
To prove you have the financial means to build, you don't need to have the cash in your bank account. If you are pre-approved for a loan, that may be enough., Most of the time you will be required to take certain actions or forfeit the land. For instance, in Marquette, Kansas, you must build a house within a year. To do so, you must sign with a contractor within four months and start building within six months.Be aware that you may forfeit the free land if you don't meet conditions, even after the land has been transferred to you.

, Most cities require that you put down a deposit. Usually, it's not very much. For instance, in Lincoln, Kansas, it's $0.08 per square foot., To keep your land, you must fulfill your side of the agreement. Pay attention to the fine print and meet the required conditions.That doesn't absolutely mean you'll be kicked off your land if you don't get your house built in time. If you've made an honest effort to do so, the city or town may grant you an extension.

, If you're building a business, you must do more than build. For instance, in Muskegon, Michigan, you can get free land in industrial areas. However, you must provide a certain number of jobs. For 5 acres of land, you must create 25 jobs; for 30 acres of land, you must create 100 jobs., Some towns offer these sites fully developed, with things like water, sewage, and electricity already hooked up. However, some of them require you to have an assessment first, which can be thousands of dollars. For instance, in New Richland, Minnesota, the assessment will cost you $25,000.

, These communities want you to make the plot your permanent home. Therefore, most have a residency requirement. Some only require that you live there a year full-time, while others want you to make it a permanent residence."

Visit houses with ""for sale by owner signs.""",How to Get Real Estate Listings1," In high end real estate markets like New York or San Francisco, you will need to spend money on meals and cards to finesse upscale clients. For low end markets, you might want to lower your commission and use the internet to find a variety of clients and focus on volume. New agents, without connections, might want to build on personal connections.;
, You should build a database of contact information for people you know who could be clients. This includes friends and family or anyone with whom you have had a business relationship in the past. Offer to provide an estimate of the value of their home.


Most people are interested in knowing how much their home is worth. If they find that it is worth much more than they believed, they might be inclined to sell. Even if that is not the case, you have established a relationship with someone who might be inclined to get in touch with you when they do decide to sell.Send holiday or anniversary cards to individuals in the database. This will remind them about you and encourage them to get in touch when they want to relocate. If you send a card for the fifth or tenth year anniversary of the date on which you secured a property for a former client, you might find that they are back on the market., The MLS retains information for owners who have taken their property off their listings. Many of these owners might have been unable to sell their house at a reasonable price during the market downturn. If you contact them with good news about the prospects of their sale, you might find that they are interested in putting the house back on the market.MLS listings are available at www.MLS.com.

, When you stage an open house to advertise one of your current listings, you will meet a number of potential clients. Attendees are quite probably looking for an agent to help them buy a property, but might well be looking to sell their own property as well., Zillow offers a service by which potential sellers indicate that they would be willing to sell their house if it reached a certain value. Search the database for people whose properties might have accrued enough value for them to sell., Properties are often put on market for lease because the owner wasn't able to sell the house for as much as they would have liked. Now that the market has improved, it is possible the owner will reconsider selling the property. Contact them and offer to assess the value of the property., The owner here has decided to go it alone, but might be reevaluating that decision if the home has languished on the market for some time. Inform the owner that for sale by owner houses are often ignored by buying agents, and that with proper advertising you can sell the house for more than they can."

Be prepared to hire a lawyer.",How to Get Real Estate Listings2," A real estate agent should be able to market your house more effectively than you would. She will be able to sell your house faster and for a better price than you would. She will charge a fee of 5-7% of the total sale price of your house, but will often be able to compensate for that with a higher sale price.


Studies have shown that when real estate agents sell their own homes, they do so for on average 3% more than they sell their client’s houses for. That suggests that agents undervalue houses to sell them quicker. However, the increased volume of buyers they attract can counteract this effect.Conversely, home owners have a tendency to price their houses too high. This will mean that your house might languish on the market for a long time., There are a variety of services that help you list your own home. Visit fsbonetwork.com and www.homesbyowner.com for a list of local organizations that provide help pricing and advertising houses.Visit Forsalebyowner.com to have your house listed on a variety of online databases, including the MLS.


In the end you might not be able to avoid paying half of the commission. That is because your real estate agent would usually split half of her commission with the buyer’s real estate. To secure the deal, you might need to give 3% of selling price to a buyer’s agent. Approximately 10% of home sales are conducted by the owner., One of the most difficult parts of selling a home is picking a price that people are willing to pay, without going so low that you lose money in the sale. Begin by looking at comparable properties online to see what owners are asking for them. You should strongly consider finding a local appraiser to perform a professional valuation.Remember, you bought your house because it was to your taste. Not everyone will have the same preferences. It is very difficult to be objective when pricing your own home.

, Think about what makes your house special, take pictures that highlight its strengths and then cast a wide net. You should take out advertisements in local newspapers. You should also spend some money to have your price listed on the local “multiple listing service” (MLS). Don’t forget to design a sign to put outside of the house; this can often be an effective advertising tool because buyers interested in the area might already spend time there.


This process can cost money. The principal location for listing houses (MLS), can charge $400 a month.</ref>http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/sell-your-own-home.aspx#slide=2</ref> Forsalebyowner.com charges around $80 a month for listing your property, though rates vary depending upon how extensive your advertising package is. Zillow, Yahoo! Real Estate, and Craigslist are free.Be sure to discuss any high-end fixtures or appliances that you have in the house. These might not be conveyed with pictures alone.If you do plan to pay the buyer’s agent, advertise this on the listing. Otherwise, agents will be less likely to inform their clients about your property.</ref>

, If you do find a buyer, you will ultimately need to draw up a contract. An improperly constructed sale contract can make you liable for a lot of money. It is important to have expert assistance from a lawyer who specializes in real estate.


The services of a lawyer should cost at least $300 per hour.
If you there are structural problems with the property that are not disclosed in the contract, you could be liable for a lawsuit."

Verify the price.",How to Get Real Estate Listings3," The buyer’s real estate agent is paid for by the seller and so, in a sense, will be free. She will find houses for you, will tell you if the house is overpriced, and will help negotiate a lower price for you.


It is easy for buyers now to work without a real estate agent, but there is some safety in having a professional review a property on your behalf. Also, because you don’t pay your agent as a buyer, it isn’t clear that you will save money by not using an agent.

, Now that most houses are advertised online, it is easy to find a house on your own. You might even be able to cast a wider net than your real estate agent would. While technically you won’t save any money looking for a house on your own, you might be able to negotiate the price of the home down.


You do not pay your agent but the price of your agent is built in the house. So, if you have opted not to use an agent, you should negotiate for a lower selling price. Normally the buyer’s agent would ask the sellers agent for a 3% commission on the sale. You should try to negotiate with the seller’s agent to lower their commission and then with the seller to lower the price.
Often a buyer’s real estate agent will not look at houses being sold by owner. If you are conducting the search on your own, you might have better access to these properties.

, Look up the local MLS online for a comprehensive list of local properties. All properties that are listed by a real estate agent should be listed on the MLS. Alternatively, visit for sale by owner, for a list of properties in your area that are being sold independently. Real estate agents used to have exclusive access to the MLS listings, making them a nearly indispensable part of the process. Now, however, these listings are publicly available at www.MLS.com.

, One of the principle advantages of having a real estate agent is that she can tell you if a property is overpriced. However, there are other ways to do that. These include, hiring an appraiser, getting a CMA, and doing online research.


Websites like Yahoo Real Estate, Zillow, Find Comps Now, eppraisal, and Real Estate ABC will give you a free estimate of a property’s value. This is not a perfect system, but it will give you a sense as to whether the asking price is close enough to actual value to merit contracting out an appraiser.
Ask a real estate agent for a competitive market analysis. For approximately $75, she will give you an estimate of how much a property is really worth. Be sure to specify that you do not plan to contract with them as your agent in the sale.
For $400 you can have an appraiser estimate the value of the property. This will the most detailed and comprehensive analysis. Though this might seem pricey, at some point your bank will require that you have an appraiser look at the house before granting the loan. Consult with the bank to determine if it requires that a specific appraiser conduct the valuation."

You want to find a broker who primarily represents buyers, not sellers.
Also look for a broker who is based in Illinois, rather than someone who is based in another state but handles transactions in Illinois.
Brokers based in Illinois will have a better understanding and familiarity with the farmland available in the state.;
, The types of land you are interested in will depend to a large extent on the types of crops you want to grow. The ideal property size in which you want to invest also may determine the parts of the state on which you need to focus.Your interests also may affect the broker you choose, since different brokers may specialize in different crops or different types of land.
For example, if you want to invest in farmland where corn is grown, you shouldn't be hiring a broker whose past transactions have been primarily soy farms.
A broker who specializes in the type of farm in which you're interested will understand better how to evaluate the quality of the farmland, including soil composition and irrigation.

, Ideally, you should interview several brokers so you can compare and contrast their background and experience and choose the individual broker or brokerage firm that is best situated to meet your needs.Be up front with the broker about the reasons you want to invest in agricultural real estate and the type of farmland you're looking for.
Ideally, you want to find a broker who has had several clients with interests similar to yours, and has a successful track record of locating property for those clients.
You need to not only look at the purchase deals the broker has made, but the success of those investments and the production of those farms after the fact.

, After you've talked to several brokers, you're ready to make a decision on who will best meet your needs and help you find the type of property you want at a price that will fit within your budget.While the broker's fees should factor into your decision to some extent, don't make it the sole or even primary factor.
Keep in mind that ideally, you actually will save money, even after the broker's fees, because the broker should be able to get you a better price on the real estate than you would have been able to negotiate on your own.
Once you've decided which broker you want to hire, make sure you get the details of your relationship in writing.
Request a written agreement from your broker and read it carefully. Don't be afraid to ask if you have any questions, such as if there's a term you don't understand or with which you don't agree.
If you have serious doubts about a broker agreement, take the time to have an attorney read it before you sign.

, Before you start looking at properties, determine how much money you want to invest and whether you'll need to explore loans or other financing options to purchase your agricultural investment property.The money you make – your return on investment – depends on how much money you put into the property. Estimate your budget carefully, then stick to it.
If you're unsure exactly how to estimate operating costs or other expenses, speak with your broker and other agricultural business experts so you have a realistic picture of the money you'll need to spend.
Once you have a solid idea of the amount of money you're willing to spend on agricultural real estate, don't even look at properties outside your budget.
Keep in mind that it can be all too easy to fall in love with a property just over your budget, decide to take the risk, and end up losing money.

, You typically can find agricultural property listed for sale online. Your broker also may know of properties for sale, including properties that are being listed at auctions.Location is an important factor in evaluating property. If you're interested in a particular property, take a trip out to look at it in person. In addition to the land itself, pay attention to the neighboring properties and the areas surrounding the parcel.
If you've identified particular parts of the state that you prefer, get in contact with area realtors and find out what properties are available or potentially soon to come on the market.
You also can find properties for sale on the internet or even in the local newspaper.
When evaluating available properties, keep your budget in mind and have patience. If something that meets your needs and is within your budget isn't immediately available, you should be willing to wait for something that will work for you to come on the market.

, From your searches, you can zero in on properties that seem best suited to meet your needs, including the level of development of the property and the type of crops cultivated there.After you've identified properties in which you're interested, you'll want to put additional work into researching the property thoroughly before you make an offer.
Typically the realtor will have a lot of information to provide you about the property. However, keep in mind that they are working for the seller and their job is to sell the property.
Any information you get from the realtor usually should be independently verified, unless they've given you a report from a credentialed and independent third party.
You also want to make sure you go out and look at the property yourself at least once before you make an offer.

, For each property in which you're interested, you should receive a written list of what exactly is included, including equipment, structures, and any existing leases.Knowing what's included in the purchase price can help you determine what additional investment you'll need to make after you've purchased the property.
Ideally, you can find farmland within your budget that includes all the equipment, fencing, and structures you'll need to start (or continue) growing crops as soon as you close on the property.
In some cases, however, the current owner may be planning to remove necessary equipment to use elsewhere, which means you'll have additional expenses that must be added to the purchase price when considering whether the particular parcel fits in your budget.

, Once you've chosen a property in which you want to invest, you and your broker will make an offer. The seller may make a counter-offer, at which point you will begin negotiations until you reach a final purchase price.Be up front with your broker about what you want and where you'd ideally like to end up. If there are any items not included in the purchase price that you'd like to be added, you can discuss this with your broker as well.
Generally, you'll work with your broker to set a maximum you're willing to pay for the property. Your first offer, however, typically will be much lower than this amount.
Your broker will handle much of the real work of negotiating the sale, although you should expect to be consulted regularly during the process.
Once you and the seller have agreed upon a price, a sales contract will be drawn up. Typically you'll sign this contract and provide a sum of earnest money to guarantee the sale until closing.

, Expect to close on the property within 30 days of the date you and the seller sign the contract for the sale of the property. If you need to secure a loan or other financing, it must be done during this time.If you're seeking financing, your lender will take care of the necessary title searches and appraisals before closing.
Once all this is completed, you'll meet at the courthouse or county recorder's office to take care of transferring the deed.
After the transfer is complete, make sure you receive copies of the deed, as you'll need it to have any government programs or subsidies transferred to your name.

, If you have little experience managing an agricultural business, a farm manager can help you handle the business aspects of your investment as well as the farm's day-to-day operations.Farm managers can handle nearly everything connected with the farm, or be in charge of specific tasks or areas of operation.
If you decide you want to hire a farm manager, invite several managers to bid. You can evaluate those bids and choose the manger who best suits your needs.
Farm managers typically charge a percentage of your annual gross rent revenue, or your revenue from crop sales. Which revenue stream, and the percentage, will depend on competition in your area as well as the relative experience of the manager you hire.

, Your property may have come with existing crop leases. If not, you'll need to develop new crop leases by marketing your farm to potential buyers and negotiating the terms of the lease agreement.You'll need to gather information and complete projections and reports for your farmland so you can develop a marketing plan for your farm.
Various factors will impact the price of your crop leases, including the crop history and production levels of the property as well as the soil quality, drainage, and irrigation.
Many of these reports may have been completed when you were evaluating the property prior to purchase, but others you'll have to complete after the fact.
Being transparent about the condition of your property and providing reliable, independent assessments of the farm's potential can enhance tenant confidence and increase your lease's price point.

, As the landlord of the agricultural real estate in which you've invested, you are responsible for overseeing the farm's operations and ensuring that crops are being harvested according to the terms of your crop leases.As the landlord of your agricultural real estate, you are responsible for ensuring that the crops grown on your farmland are cared for and harvested according to the terms of the crop lease.
If you don't live close to the farmland or find it inconvenient for other reasons to check in on your farmland on a regular basis, this is a task for which hiring a farm manager can prove beneficial.

, There can be significant costs involved in an investment in agricultural real estate, including day-to-day expenses similar to operating any small business. You also will be responsible for buying and maintaining insurance on your property.These expenses should have been factored into your budget. However, you'll want to review your budget on a regular basis and adjust it as necessary to reflect your actual costs in operating your farm.
You'll need to keep tabs on your farm's infrastructure, so you know when important structures or equipment need to be replaced and can do this proactively rather than waiting until something breaks down and suffering down time and loss of production while it is replaced.
Keep detailed records of regular operating expenses as well as one-time and incidental costs you incur.

, As with any small business, annual reports and profit projections are crucial to business management and understanding your return on investment. The production of specific reports may depend on how you've financed your property purchase.Some lenders may require annual business reports, including budgets and profit-loss reports.
You also will need these figures to calculate your taxes and file your tax returns.
It may be to your benefit to hire an accountant who has experience working with agricultural businesses.

Check state laws, rules and regulations.,
Check your company's listing contracts.,
Search the MLS for properties that have only a few days left before they expire.",How to Get Expired Listings1," You need to ensure nothing prohibits taking post-dated listings. A good place to start is reviewing real estate license training manuals for your state such as (state name) Real Estate Principles, Practices & Law.

Post-dated listings are those where a client signs a listing agreement with a new real estate broker before their contract with another broker officially ends. The agreement is dated for the day after the current contract ends.
Check the National Association of REALTORS® Code of Ethics. Courts have used the NAR Code as a standard for ruling on cases dealing with taking post-dated listings.;
, It is not worth the effort to obtain a new listing if any other real estate broker has the right to collect a commission from a canceled or expired listing. If this is the case, try to have this clause removed or find another real estate company to work for.

, Contact the sellers you find with an about-to-expire listing. Ask them about their intent to sell their property after the listing expires if the property does not sell before. Disclose immediately the following:


You are a licensed real estate salesperson with (your name and company name).
Tell the seller on the call, ""I actually do not have a buyer but am wondering about something else. I viewed your property and saw it is going to fall off the market soon. After that happens, I was wondering if you had considered listing your home for sale with a different agent at that time?""

"
"
Find expiring listings with potential.,
Prepare a listing presentation.,
Follow up.",How to Get Expired Listings2," You want to find listings that expired because sellers were unhappy with their current agent, and not because their expectations were unrealistic. Choose properties that had poor marketing or have been for sale with the same broker for a long period of time, such as six months or more.Expiring listings with potential include those that have a history of price reductions (shows the sellers are flexible), poor photography and videos, a lack of advertising, and properties with unique features that were not marketed well.

, This will demonstrate how you will take care of any problems that kept the property from selling previously. First ask questions and do a lot of listening to hear why the sellers are dissatisfied with their current broker. Your presentation should include:Your past sales history and the average time it took to close deals.
Your marketing strategy. Describe how you promoted your listings and the tactics you used to maximize exposure. Give examples of how you found the right buyers such as those relocating from another state, people who want to be near a city vs. living in the country, those looking for good schools or to be on a bus route, etc.How you would market the expiring listing property. Include weaknesses in the current sales strategy and how you would do things better.
Quotes from past clients who were very happy with your services.

, The day after your presentation to potential clients, call them to ask if they have any questions. Ask what their timeframe is to make a decision on whether they will be changing real estate brokers.

"
"
Ask the seller for the listing.,
Ask if they would be willing to sign a listing agreement now.,
Keep track of when the date approaches for the expired listing.",How to Get Expired Listings3," You must tell the seller you are interested in listing their property only after their current listing expires. Tell them you will do a better job for them. Insist you have absolutely no interest in listing this property until its listing expires.

, Explain the agreement would be dated with a date immediately after the expiration of their current contract. They may be more than happy to do this because you gave them advance notice.


Often during the listing - if there is little traffic to the property - or if their agent does not advertise properly on their behalf - they will be excited to sign a postdated listing.
Ensure you tell them again that you have no intent to interrupt or force them to cancel their current contract.

, Meet with the customers and sign the listing, if you have not already signed a post-dated listing while following the previous step. Make a calendar for when to follow up with numerous expiring listings.

, In many communities with historical homes and other buildings, historical societies are established to promote research and education about community history. These societies can be a great resource for finding documents and information about your home, about the previous owners, and about the community in general.


To locate historical societies in your area, simply search the internet for ""historical society"" followed by the name of your town.

, If you have managed to track the history of your home to a specific contractor or architect responsible for its construction, then you can check to see if they are still in business. If so, then they may have records of the construction of your home, including building plans., While building inspectors typically inspect homes for the purposes of evaluating the home's structural integrity, they are also often familiar with architectural styles and details which may be unfamiliar to you. If your home has been recently inspected, get in touch with your building inspector and ask about the original construction and style of the house.

Talk to your neighbors.,
Look for original quirks and details.,
Find artifacts of your home's history.",How to Find the History of a House3," People who have lived near your home for a long time can be a wonderful resource for discovering more about your home's history. Ask your neighbors about major renovations, or remodeling or construction projects on the house. This will help you differentiate between original architectural details, and more recent additions. Also be sure to ask about the previous owners, as well as the history of the neighborhood in general.If any of your neighbors are still in touch with the home's previous owners, ask to be put in touch with them. Previous owners may be able to provide insight into the home's construction and renovation, and may have even conducted some research themselves!
You might also wish to ask your neighbors about the history of their own homes. In some neighborhoods, many of the buildings were constructed at around the same time, so insight into the history of other homes in the area might provide you with some clues.

, If your house is quite old, you may notice that parts of it have been remodeled or changed. Take some time to look closely at these changes, and try to identify unique or original elements. Here are some examples of things to looks for:Old windows framed with wood or metal instead of modern plastic.
Original glass panes in windows and doors. These can often be identified by the ""wavy"" pattern which can arise in glass over many years.
Original floorboards under more modern carpeting or flooring material.
Original wallpaper or paint which may be revealed when more recent coats of paint chip away.

, Sheds, basements, and storage spaces may contain clues regarding the history of your house and its occupants. Spare lumber, tools or building materials may still remain from your home's construction, or from more recent renovations. Because architectural technology and fashion changes over time, these items may help you understand the age of your home, as well as how it has changed over time. Investigation may also uncover documents, such as newspapers or discarded mail, which explicitly mention dates. If you have access to a metal detector, you can scour your home's yard for tools, coins and other metal artifacts which may be present.

The website of your state’s regulatory body will explain all of the specific requirements that you’ll have to meet to become licensed in that jurisdiction.


Go to USA.gov to find the official website for your state.
Oftentimes, state real estate regulatory bodies are under the division of commerce, insurance, or business regulation.
Feel free to visit your state’s regulatory body offices in person. You might learn more talking to someone than if you try to figure things out on the internet.;
, Your state’s real estate regulatory body will provide you with a list of state-approved schools and real estate education courses that meet their requirements for licensure. Make sure to read this list carefully so that the school you pick is indeed a school that is approved by the state., After you’ve selected an approved school and course, enroll in the course. Real estate education courses are the primary educational requirements for real estate licensing in most states. As a result, these courses are very important and required. Take your course work seriously.


Real estate education courses can be completed in person or online, depending on the school that offers them.
Courses generally take between 30 and 90 hours, depending on your state requirements.
Courses are generally concluded with a course exam. This is different than the state real estate exam. The course exam is created to make sure you’ve done the work on the course and understand what you have learned., Completing the course is no simple task. If you complete it online, you’ll move through a dozen or more modules that will include a wide variety of information. If you complete it in person, you’ll spend a week or more in a classroom for eight hours a day (depending on the hour requirement). Make sure to read or listen carefully, take good notes, and review all of the information you’ve covered. Generally, these courses include information on:Credit scores
Risk management
Foreclosures, short sales, real estate owned properties (REO) and real estate auctions
Real estate ethics

, After you've completed and passed the real estate education course, you'll need to prepare for your state exam. State exams are difficult and many people don’t pass the exam the first time around. You’ll increase your chances of passing the test if you are thoroughly prepared. There are books and online resources that you can use to study. Take as many practice tests as you can until you are confident you can pass the examination. Search online or ask your school to recommend real estate prep examinations.

Keep in mind that each state exam is different. Take practice exams only for the state in which you will be licensed.

, Depending on the state, you’ll either have to forward your course completion information to the state or testing company, or you’ll be automatically scheduled for a state exam once you complete the course. Either way, the state exam will be the culmination of your real estate education.


Most states require either a 70% or 75% score to pass the exam.
Exams are held in testing centers and generally take several hours.
Many states allow you to retake the exam several times.
You might be required to arrive up to 30 minutes before the exam begins.
Make sure to bring photo ID.
Your test results will, in many states, be automatically sent to the regulatory authority., After you’ve taken the appropriate education and passed the exam, you need to formally apply for your license. Some states might have you begin the application process before taking the exam, but many do not allow you to apply until you’ve passed the exam. Regardless, after you’ve passed your exam, you will have to contact the regulatory agency in your state that governs real estate.


Make sure you have the appropriate forms.
Contact the regulatory authority to make sure they’ve received the results of your test and your education completion.
You’ll probably have to pay a license fee at this stage.
The amount of time it takes the state to process your application will vary. Some states like Florida process applications almost instantly, while other states like Tennessee might take two weeks or longer., Each state has different requirements, and your real estate license is only good in the state that has granted it. Regardless of where you live, however, you must meet the basic requirements:


You must be at least 18 years old.
You must be a high school graduate.
You must have a Social Security number.
You must satisfactorily pass the state licensing examination in the state you want to work. (There is no such thing as a National real estate license.)
Generally, most states require you to take a real estate education course that familiarizes you with common practices and state laws that govern the real estate market., The cost of licensing in every state varies, but generally costs are very similar; however, costs go beyond state fees for licensing and include a number of things. Prepare yourself to pay for:


A real estate education course. This could range from $200 to $500 per course. Some states require multiple courses.
A real estate exam fee. Real estate exam fees range from $30 to $120 depending on the state.
Fingerprinting and a background screening. Fingerprinting and screening can cost between $30 and $60.
State licensing fees. These fees can range from $10 to over $100.
Errors and omissions insurance. This can range from $125 a year to much higher depending on coverage.
Association or board dues. These fees can be anywhere from $300 a year to $1,000 or more.
Some states, like Texas, require good standing on any student loans guaranteed by the state before you can obtain your license.
MLS and electronic key charges. These fees can range from $25 a month to $100. , In most states, in order for your license to be active and valid, you need to be affiliated with a real estate broker and sign up with them as an independent contractor. If you’re not affiliated with a broker and you practice real estate, you might be breaking the law and could be subject to heavy fines.


Real estate sales agents can’t practice real estate on their own and must be supervised by a broker.
In many places, a broker won’t accept you on unless you’ve joined the board or association to which they belong. This is often a requirement of many boards and associations.
The broker is charged with supervising and overseeing all of their agent's activities., Most regions of the country have real estate boards or associations which you’ll have to join to gain many of the tools to practice real estate in your area. Real estate boards and associations offer:


Education courses that help you keep your license and expand your certification.
A way to meet and build connections with other real estate sales agents.
Access to the multiple listing system for the region. The multiple listing system is a system in which real estate sales agents post their listings with specifics and is often accessible only by other real estate sales agents.
Access to electronic key systems that allow entry to homes. This is extremely important if you want to show a home to a customer/client., While all Realtors are real estate sales agents, not all real estate sales agents are Realtors. The term Realtor indicates membership in local real estate associations/boards and the NAR. Benefits of being a Realtor or doing business with a Realtor include:


Realtors are bound by a specific code of conduct and ethics enforced by the NAR.
Realtors have access to tools like the multiple listing system (MLS) and more than distinguish them from real estate sales agents.
The term “Realtor” is a branded term that the NAR has worked hard to associate with honesty and integrity., After you’ve applied for your license, you should start looking for a firm and a broker to work for. In most places it is illegal for you to practice real estate on your own. This is because it is the duty of an experienced broker (someone who has practiced real estate for more than three to five years) to supervise you and mentor you.


Sign the independent contractor agreement with your broker.
Shop around for a broker. Some firms and brokers charge their agents fees “desk fees” (a monthly fee to use their office and supplies). Some firms and brokers allow generous commission splits (for instance, you take 90% of the commission you earn, and they take 10%). In addition, the culture and interest level of brokers vary. Find a firm and broker you are comfortable working with.
Maintain a good relationship with your broker, as he or she will be invaluable to your success.
You’re not a real estate sales agent until you’ve signed on with a broker.
You’re not a Realtor until you’ve signed on with a broker and your local association or board., Errors and omissions insurance is insurance that protects you, the real estate sales agent, from liability if you make an error or omit something from a contract when conducting business. Some states require individuals to purchase their own insurance, or show proof of coverage, before they are granted their license and start practicing., Once you’ve got your license and are signed up with a firm, you need to keep up to date on changes in real estate law and practice. This is important, as regulatory agencies and state legislatures are always changing laws. To be successful, you need to know the law and know it well. You also need to understand common practices and other things that will benefit your customers.


Complete education hours required by your state. These range from nine to 14 hours every year or two, though agents renewing for the first time may be required to complete up to 45 hours of courses.
Complete education hours required by your local board or association. These range from none to 12 or more.
Attend conferences and conventions. At conferences and conventions you’ll hear experienced Realtors talk and you’ll have the chance to attend workshops and courses that will benefit you immensely."

In order to find out what the IRS considers income generating assets, it helps to know what the purpose of this knowledge is and where you can find information on it. Start your search by visiting the IRS website and looking for documents relating to ""estate income tax."" The information you find will help you identify assets that may generate income for an estate. In general, an estate's income will be calculated the same way as an individual's.The most important documents you will find include:


IRS Form 1041, which is the actual estate income tax return. This document lists the types of income that must be included and calculated in an estate's income tax return.IRS Form 1041 instructions, which provides detailed advice on filling out and completing Form 1041. Within these instructions are examples of income generating assets.IRS Publication 559, which is a helpful guide for survivors, executors, and administrators of estates. Within this guidance document is a discussion about income that needs to be included in estate income tax returns.;
, The first type of income that must be disclosed on an estate's income tax return is interest income. Therefore, any type of property owned by the estate that generates interest will generally be considered an income generating asset. Examples of assets that generate interest income include:Accounts with banks and credit unions (including certificates of deposit and money market accounts)
Notes, loans, and mortgages
U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds
U.S. savings bonds
Interest earned from other assets that show up on the decedent's IRS Form 1099-INT
Other assets described in IRS examples, Dividends are distributions from corporations and mutual funds paid to the decedent or estate when they own stock. Ordinary dividends are those that are taxable as income (i.e., not capital gains). You can usually assume that any dividend received from common or preferred stock is an ordinary dividend.


If the decedent or estate receives a 1099-DIV, ordinary dividends will be shown in box 1a. A 1099-DIV is given out by every payer (i.e., corporation) that provides dividends of at least $10 in a given year.
The asset that generates ordinary dividend income is usually stock., Business income is any income the decedent or their estate receives from their business. If there is any connection between the income received and the business, it is business income. A connection exists if the income payment would not have been made if you did not have the business. Business income is usually in the form of cash, checks, and credit card charges. Examples of business income include:Bartering for property or services (e.g., a lawyer who gives legal services for a fee, an artist who sells a painting)
Real estate rents (e.g., the owner of a hotel)
Personal property rents (e.g., the rental of vehicles, tuxedos, televisions)

, Capital gain (or loss) is the difference in the value of an asset from when it was bought to when it was sold. Capital gains are assessed on any asset the estate or decedent owned and used for personal or investment purposes (e.g., homes, couches, some stocks and bonds). If the decedent or estate has capital gains, they will usually be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.Examples of possible capital assets include:Stocks and bonds
A home
Timber
Household furnishings
A car used for pleasure or commuting
Coin and stamp collections
Gems and jewelry
Gold, silver, and other metals

, If the decedent or estate owns a farm, the income generated from the farm must usually be reported on the estate's income tax return. Here, the asset that generates the income is clear, it is the farm. In general, farm income usually comes from the sale of farm products (e.g., livestock and crops)., Ordinary gain is income earned from the sale of an asset that is not a capital asset. The sale of non-capital assets will result in ordinary gains or losses. The IRS rules on what is considered a non-capital asset are very complex. If you are having trouble determining whether an asset is generating ordinary gains or capital gains, you should reach out to an accountant or tax professional. Common examples of non-capital assets that can generate income include:Stock held mainly for sale to customers
Accounts receivable acquired in the ordinary course of business
Certain copyrights
Supplies normally used or consumed during the normal course of business

, As the executor of an estate, the main purpose for identifying estate assets that generate income is so you can accurately fill out and file an estate income tax return. To accurately fill out an estate income tax return, you will first need to identify every asset the estate holds that is generating income, define the income correctly, and obtain the proper tax forms to fill out.


For example, if the estate has a home that was recently sold, the difference in value between when it was bought and when it was sold might be considered a capital gain. If it is a capital gain, you will need to obtain a Schedule D (Form 1041) that you can fill out and attach to the estate's income tax return. As you can see, in this example, you identified the asset (the home), you defined the income (capital gains), and you obtained the proper tax forms (Schedule D).You will need to complete this process for every single asset that has produced income over the past year. At the end of this process you will have gathered all the required documents needed to accurately fill out the estate's income tax return.

, Starting with interest income and working your way through the various income types in IRS Form 1041, calculate the amount of income the estate has generated in the past year. Aside from using Form 1041 to see what other forms you may need, you will not fill in any spaces on Form 1041 until later. For example, by looking at Form 1041, you can see that if the estate has any business income you will need to fill out and attach Schedule C (Form 1040). In another example, if you have any farm income, you will have to fill out and attach Schedule F (Form 1040).


Each of these schedules will help you work through the process of determining how much income was produced from each income source. For example, if the estate has business income and you use Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040), you will calculate the business's gross receipts as well as the business's total expenses. When you subtract the total expenses from the gross receipts you are left with the business's net profit, which is the number entered on Form 1041.
For example, assume decedent's business has $6,000 in gross receipts and $3,000 in total expenses. When you subtract $3,000 from $6,000 you get a net profit of $3,000. This number will be entered into line 3 of Form 1041., Once you have filled out all the required schedules, you will simply transfer the appropriate numbers from your schedules into the appropriate boxes in Form 1041. Each schedule will provide you with instructions on how to do this. For example, Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) informs you that you should insert the number from line 3 of that schedule into line 3 of Form 1041.In another example, Schedule D (Form 1041) informs you that you should insert the number from line 19 of that schedule into line 4 of Form 1041., Once you complete all of the transfers, Form 1041 lines 1 through 8 should be filled in (if you have any income to report). To calculate the estate's total income you simply need to add together the numbers in lines 1 through 8. Enter this number into line 9 of Form 1041., Once the decedent passes away there is not a whole lot you can do, as the executor, to minimize the estate's income tax liability. However, while the decedent is still alive, he or she can make certain decisions to help reduce the amount of income tax their estate will have to pay when they pass away. One option is to donate income producing assets to charity before the decedent passes away. By donating the assets while the decedent is still alive, he or she will be able to take tax deductions on their personal income tax return. In addition, by removing an income producing asset from the possible estate, the decedent is minimizing the estate's income tax liability as well.


Assets the decedent might consider donating to charity include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate., Before the decedent passes away, he or she should designate beneficiaries for income producing assets where beneficiary designation is possible. One common asset where this is possible is retirement accounts (i.e., IRAs). If the decedent fails to designate a beneficiary in their IRA, the IRA will be included in the estate's assets and income tax will be due on it within five years of death.


However, if the decedent does designate a beneficiary, the beneficiary will receive the asset outside of the probate process and the asset will not be included in the estate., When someone creates a trust they take the trust assets and distribute them upon death outside of the probate process. When this happens, property placed in a trust is not included in the decedent's estate. Once the decedent passes away, the trust property is distributed in accordance with the terms of that trust. If the decedent places income producing assets in trust, that income will not be subject to estate income tax."

For unpaid tax sales, you will have to pay all back taxes owed on the property.
""Comparables"" refers to the price that properties are selling for that are similar to the one you are considering in regard to location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, condition, etc.
You can find out about tax auctions and sheriff's sales at the website of your county or city. Before the sale you must first register as a bidder. Sales are made at a public auction and buyers will have to bid on the property.

Enter an internet search on ”real estate wholesalers” into your favorite web search engine you’ll be inundated with firms. They usually only deal with people that have cash or approved asset-based loans (loans that you have put up collateral for such as another property).

, Believe it or not, people still do (as of now) advertise to sell their homes in the local paper. You’ll most likely find more “Open House” ads but they’ll usually list when, where, and the sale price. You can find a lot of mobile homes and condominiums for sale by owner (FSBO) in the local Penny Saver newspaper., This is a great way to pick up homes that are in decent shape at a discounted price. Probate sales are properties being sold by a probate court because the owner did not have a will or there are no heirs. This process is more of an advanced system to acquire houses but it can be invaluable once you understand the risks.There are disadvantages to buying a property through a probate sale. You will need to put down a 10% deposit that is not refundable if you can't close on the sale for any reason. Also, seller disclosures about known defects are not required.

Acquire current property documents.,

Pull archived codes.,
Study changed categories and definitions.,
Speak to the current owner.,
Get a copy of the current zoning map.,
Consult a zoning authority.,
Check conditions for particular uses.,
Consult an attorney.,
Determine if your proposed use conforms to current zoning.,
Find out if the property can be grandfathered.,
Speak to neighboring property owners.,
Consider whether you could apply for a variance.",How to Find Old Zoning Codes," If you want to learn about the zoning history of a property, you typically need to know that property's parcel number or legal description, which can be found on the property's deed.Deeds are recorded at the county clerk's office. You'll need the address of the property to get access to the deed.
Some county clerks or recorders have electronic databases of property information that you can access online.
Your county tax assessor's office also may have important information about the ownership of the property that can help you in your zoning research. You also may be able to search these records online.;
, If you're planning to purchase the property, you typically will conduct a title search anyway. The title search can let you know when and how the current owner purchased the property, as well as previous uses of the property.You can hire a title search company to do this work for you, but in many cases you can do it yourself and save a little money.
However, keep in mind that if you're planning to conduct a title search on your own, it may require a significant time investment, given you may have to sort through various paper documents by hand.
A title search can reveal a number of issues concerning the property, some of which may impact your proposed use. For example, the property may be subject to an easement by the neighboring property owner.

, Zoning ordinances are a matter of public record, so old zoning codes typically can be found by making a request at the city or county zoning board or planning office. You also may be able to find archived codes online.Most cities or counties that have archived codes available online only show old codes going back a few years. If you need an older code, you may need to make a trip to the office.
Some cities also have online directories that will allow you to view zoning documents and history for a specific property.
For example, the city of Philadelphia has an online zoning archive that allows you to search by property address.
Entering a Philadelphia address returns all zoning documents related to that property, which you can view and print out for your records.

, While there are basic zoning categories that are the same pretty much anywhere in the U.S., your particular city or county may further subdivide those categories to address more specific uses.For example, zoning regulations may require you to have a specific amount of off-street parking available for business clients, particularly in mixed-use neighborhoods that include both residences and commercial properties.
Other zoning regulations, such as those controlling the size and placement of commercial signs, may change even though the zoning of the property does not.

, One of the easiest ways to find out the current zoning for a property is to speak to the current owner, particularly if they currently occupy and use the property. This may not be helpful, however, if the property is vacant.An owner of a vacant lot typically will do the work to determine the zoning of the property before they list it for sale, but this doesn't mean you shouldn't check into it on your own as well.
However, in many situations, particularly if the owner is not local, you may not be able to get much information about vacant property.
Owners currently using the property usually can provide more information. For example, if they've applied for a variance or attended a zoning hearing, they'll be able to tell you what happened.

, The planning commission or zoning board typically has a copy of the zoning map for the city or county where the property is located. Finding the property on the zoning map can give you a better understanding of what uses are permitted there.Once you've located the property, you also might consider neighboring zones. For example, if the property is zoned residential but borders a commercial zone, it may be easier to get a variance if needed.
The zoning map also can give you a big picture understanding of the neighborhood where the property is located and the types of property it adjoins.

, Someone at the city or county planning office can help you interpret the zoning map, as well as figure out if perhaps the property you're looking at was zoned improperly. Mistakes can happen, particularly in dense areas that include many properties zoned for multiple uses.Staff at the city or county planning office are experts at reading and interpreting the zoning map, so they should be able to answer any questions you have.
Make sure you understand not only how the property is zoned, but any conditions that might apply to that particular location.
If you suspect your planned use won't conform with current zoning, but you're still interested in the property, planning office staff can give you information on how to apply for a variance or any other options available to you.

, Even if the use you have planned for the property fits into the overall category, your city or county may have specific conditions attached to certain uses. This is a particular risk if the property is zoned for multiple uses.Depending on how long the current owner has owned the property, they may not even be aware of certain conditions on the property.
This may also be true if the current owner bought the property and used it as it was without any additions or developments.
In other situations, conditions may have changed since the current owner bought the property, but the ordinance provides that the change won't take effect until the property is sold.

, If the zoning picture of the property is complex, talking to a local attorney who has experience with your local land use laws can help you make sense of it all. While attorney's fees can be steep, you'll generally save money when compared to the costs of violating a zoning ordinance.You need to find an attorney who is well-versed in your city or county's zoning ordinance, and has experience with the planning commission or before the zoning board.
If you don't know any attorneys who fit this profile, you might ask a real estate agent or other real estate professional if they have any recommendations.
Another place to check is the website of your state or local bar association. There, you'll typically find a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice in your areas that you can use to find someone that would work for you.
Be sure to ask any attorney you interview specific questions about their background working with zoning cases. Ideally, you can find someone who's had favorable results in situations similar to yours.

, Regardless of what current or previous owners have done, if your proposed use of the property falls squarely within the current zoning of the property, you won't have any problems.You already have a good general idea of this from your research into the past and present zoning of the property.
If you have any questions about how the zoning ordinance would operate in your situation, ask an attorney or speak to someone in the zoning office.
Keep in mind that your use of the property isn't necessarily determined by the previous owner's use – particularly if they applied for a variance, or if their use was grandfathered in to a recently enacted ordinance.

, The current owner may be using the property in a way that doesn't conform to the current zoning code, typically that permission for a non-conforming use doesn't transfer to you if you buy the property.However, in some circumstances a non-conforming use can continue as grandfathered in to the zoning code as an exception, even if the property is sold.
Your attorney will be able to tell you more about these exceptions and analyze whether you could continue the same non-conforming use as the current owner.
Where a grandfathered use is possible, this is so because the character of the property runs with the property itself, not with the property's ownership.
However, if the current owner is operating under a variance, this runs with the owner rather than with the property itself.
Even if you are able to grandfather in your use, you may not be ablate do any upgrades to the property or operations, and there may be additional restrictions on your use.

, If it appears that you'll need to apply for a variance or other conditional permission from the zoning board, having the neighboring property owners behind you can make a huge difference in your chances of being approved.For example, if you plan to continue the same use as the current owner, neighbors who weren't adversely affected by the current owner's operations shouldn't have any problem with yours.
You also may have an easier time getting the neighbor's support if you're planning to buy a vacant lot. As long as your use isn't uncommonly disruptive, most neighbors will find it preferable to the eyesore of a vacant lot.
If your use would differ from that of the current owner, in talking to neighboring property owners you want to emphasize that your use will cause a minimum of disruption and will improve the character of the neighborhood.

, To apply for a variance, you'll need to get the proper forms from the local zoning board or planning commission and submit them for approval before you can begin your use.Timing can be important here, because you have to own the property before you can apply for a zoning variance.
However, you can't begin your non-conforming use until a variance is granted. Depending on how long the process takes, your land could be sitting for several months before you can use it.
Typically your request will be evaluated by a single zoning officer, who will review the zoning ordinance and your property and make a determination.
If the zoning officer doesn't approve your request, you typically have the ability to appeal it to the zoning board.
If you think you'll need to apply for a variance, talk it over with your attorney first. If the chances are relatively low that a variance will be granted, it may be in your better interests to find a different property without as many challenges.

Work it out.,
Determine if you’re HAMP eligible.,
See what your alternatives are under HAFA.,
Ask for a short sale.",How to Deal with Foreclosure1," A “workout” is lending industry jargon for reaching an agreement between a lender and a borrower to modify a loan in the interest of avoiding default. When you come to a workout agreement with your lender, you approach the lender directly and come to a two party agreement on the necessary loan modifications. In order to increase your chances of coming to a successful agreement, you should:Talk to your lender right away. The farther you fall behind, the more likely it is your lender will refuse an attempt to come to an accord. The reason is more mathematical than it is mean-spirited: the farther behind you fall, the less likely it is you’ll be able to catch up.
Explain what the situation is, whether it’s likely to be temporary, the reason for your failure to make payments, and what you’re doing to change it. For example, if you lost your job, that’s an understandable situation. It’s also likely to be temporary. If you can show that you’re making every effort to find employment (or that you’ve secured temporary employment), it helps your chances of reaching an agreement with the lender.
Come to the lender with specific proposals for modification. For example, if you have a fifteen year mortgage, you might suggest moving to a thirty year mortgage. If your interest rate has recently ballooned, you might ask that they switch back to an older rate.;
, The Home Affordable Modification Program is a Federal program designed to lower the monthly payments of eligible borrowers. Although more than a million homeowners have modified their loans under HAMP, not everyone is eligible. The full terms and conditions can be viewed at, http://www.hsh.com/finance/government/home-affordable-modification-program.html but the basic terms of eligibility are:Your mortgage must predate January 1st 2009.
You can’t owe more than $729,750.
The property has to be your primary residence.
Your total expenses for housing ( mortgage payments, insurance, taxes, HOA dues) must be greater than 31% of your gross income.
You have to be under financial hardship.
If you meet the conditions, go to http://www.hsh.com/finance/government/home-affordable-modification-program.html to begin the application process.

, The Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program is another Federal program designed to help borrowers who are in immediate danger of foreclosure. Although the terms are not as attractive as those under HAMP, they can be a better option than going it alone. The terms of eligibility are basically the same as those under HAMP.Under HAFA, the lender agrees to a short sale of the property (selling it for less than the value of the mortgage), or in the alternative, a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure. To be clear, any borrower behind on their mortgage can directly ask their lender for a short sale or to turn over their deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure. But under HAFA, the borrower gets $10,000 in relocation assistance, and a waiver of any deficiency payment—the difference between the short sale price and the remainder of the mortgage.
Not all lenders participate in HAFA. To see if your does and begin the application process, visit https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/steps/Pages/step-2-program-hafa.aspx.

, If your lender doesn’t participate in HAFA or you aren’t eligible, you can still ask your lender to allow you to short sell your house. They don’t have to agree, but they sometimes will. In order to strengthen your case, explain the following:What your hardship is. If you can’t show your lender why you can’t make your payments, they’re far less likely to agree to a short sale.
The difference in the appraised value of the home and the mortgage debt. Although it isn’t mandatory, an appraisal from a licensed appraiser is the most credible way to demonstrate the current value of the home.
Verification of your income. The bank will want more than just your word of a hardship. They’ll want documentation to back it up, too. Gather documents like pay stubs, W-2s, property tax bills, and a statement of your assets and liabilities.

Consider bankruptcy.,
Hand over the deed.,
Don’t panic; you'll have time to find another place to live.",How to Deal with Foreclosure2," If you can’t get a loan modification or a short sale, your best option for keeping your home is most likely filing for bankruptcy. There are two types of bankruptcy protection available to homeowners, Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Both types allow the filer to keep their homes. While the details of bankruptcy law are too vast to tackle here, these are the very basic differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy:Chapter 7 bankruptcy is subject to a means test. It is typically reserved for debtors who have little income and assets. Unsecured debts (debts not backed by collateral, like a house or a car) are discharged under Chapter 7. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for ten years.Chapter 13 bankruptcy is usually reserved for debtors with higher incomes and greater assets. Under Chapter 13, the debtor's unsecured debts are consolidated. The lenders and the debtor work out a payment plan which lasts from three to five years, paid to a trustee who distributes and transfers the payments to your creditors. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on your credit history for seven years.
Bankruptcy does not keep a secured lender from recovering pledged property, but adds more time to the process. This allows you more timed to work out your finances and find a solution with your lender.
Bankruptcy can remove the liability to pay a deficit, but does not guarantee that you will get to keep the house.
The only way to keep the house is to work out a way to stay current on your payments to the bank.However, bankruptcy and elimination of other debt may allow you to maintain your mortgage by reinstating it.

, If you can’t agree to a short sale, a work out, and are ineligible for HAMP or HAFA, you can approach your lender about turning over the deed to the home in lieu of foreclosure. This is exactly what is sounds like—you give up the home and the bank agrees not to foreclose. However, you should consider this as one of your last resorts. The lender can still hold you liable for the deficiency, which is the difference between what the lender was able to sell the property for and the remaining value on your mortgage., While a foreclosure is a serious event with lasting financial and psychological consequences, it isn’t the end of the world, even if it may feel like it. Even if foreclosure is inevitable, you’ll still have time to make new living arrangements.The lender has to give you a notice of foreclosure at least thirty days in advance of the auction, and even if they sell the home at auction, they will still have to go through the formal eviction process in order to remove you from your home.
At their quickest, an eviction will usually take another thirty days, meaning you’ll have two months to find new lodging from the thirty days’ notice of foreclosure the lender gives you.

"
"
Talk with a credit counselor.,
Remember that you’re more than your home.,
Maintain ties to other constants in your life.,
Understand you’re not alone.",How to Deal with Foreclosure3," Credit counselors help negotiate terms and payment plans with a debtor’s creditors. Although (reputable) credit counseling organizations are nonprofits and creditors are under no obligation to deal with them, most usually do. However, credit counseling organizations aren’t the first place to go if you’re facing an impending foreclosure because they typically do not negotiate to reduce secured debts, like a mortgage or auto loan.Think of a credit counseling organization like an informal Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding (that doesn’t damage your credit). The credit counselor gets a list of your creditors, contacts them, and then works to negotiate a payment plan on your behalf. They typically collect the payments and disburse them to your creditors.

, Homeownership is seen as an integral part of the American dream, and the psychological consequences of losing a home can make a person feel like a failure. The truth is, it’s as much of a numbers game as anything else. In any economy, a certain number of people will fall victim to larger economic trends—whether it’s rampant fraud among mortgage lenders, absurdly high medical bills, or anything else. A house is just four walls and a roof. It isn’t your identity., Even if you're having to leave a home you've lived in for years, you can still keep and strengthen the ties to the community you entered into when you became a homeowner.


For example, there's no reason to move churches or leave your bowling league just because you've gone through a foreclosure. Isolating yourself from those communities will only worsen the pain of foreclosure, because it will seem like you're losing your life rather than just a home.
Even if you find it hard to stay active in your community, make an effort. This goes double if you have children. Children aren't equipped to understand and process change to the same degree as adults are, so events like foreclosures can be even more traumatic for them.

, Over 2 million Americans have been through the foreclosure process, so you’re far from the first person to go through the situation. You can find understanding and advice on internet forums, local foreclosure support groups, even with your local church. Millions have been in your situation and millions have bounced back. You will too."

Educate yourself on your rights if you feel that your lender is violating them.,
Take the time during the foreclosure process to build your savings.,
Get your finances in order.,
Start searching for a new living arrangement as soon as possible.,
Understand the consequences of foreclosure on your home.,
Seek support from friends and family.,
Realize that foreclosure on your home does not have to represent a failure.",How to Survive Foreclosure," Although the lender does have a right to collect on the home loan, there are limitations as to how this can be initiated. For example, some laws state that debt collectors cannot call your place of work or your friends, or that they cannot call you at your home before or after a certain time. Find out what these rights are, and make sure that you are not being harassed.;
, Foreclosure can take months to complete and oftentimes you can stay in your home during the process. If you have decided to rent a place once you eventually leave the home, you need to be financially prepared to pay a down payment.

, Create a new budget based on your income and current loans. Then determine how much you can put toward your new living arrangements. When designing a budget, make sure that you set money aside for your savings and emergencies. Your goal is to create a financial plan that meets your budget so that you can pay off your debts, build your credit and avoid losing any future homes.

, Don't leave it until the last minute, or you may be stuck without a place to live, in a place you don't want to live or on someone's couch. Research all your options, and make sure that you have a secure place to live that is within your budget.

, For example, foreclosing shows negatively on your credit score. In some cases, you won't qualify for any kind of loan. In other situations, you can get a loan, but your interest rate will be extortionate. Recognizing these implications should help guide you to make smart choices in the future.

, There are also help groups where people in similar situations get together and discuss the effects of a foreclosure. Share your fears and concerns, and come to terms with the situation.

, Foreclosure survival means learning from the situation and not allowing it to consume you, and then you can move on to success. Use the situation as an opportunity to start fresh.

If you don’t have a lawyer, you can pick up a packet of forms from your court. Also look on the court’s website.
Find your bankruptcy court here: http://www.uscourts.gov/court-locator. Select “bankruptcy” under Court Type and then enter your address.
You must pay a $335 filing fee., After you file, the bankruptcy court contacts all of the creditors listed on your schedules and tells them you have filed for bankruptcy. Your creditors must stop all collection actions, including foreclosures. This is called the “automatic stay.”If your lender calls, tell them you have filed for bankruptcy. Give them your attorney’s number.
Your mortgage company can file to have the stay lifted. It can file the motion in bankruptcy court, and you will have a chance to respond. Nevertheless, it usually takes a couple of months for the court to decide the motion, and your foreclosure is stopped until the judge lifts the stay.

, In exchange for wiping out debts, bankruptcy will require the trustee to sell some assets and use the proceeds to pay your creditors. For this reason, you still might lose your home even if you stop foreclosure.


The trustee can sell your home if you have equity in it.For example, your home might be worth $150,000. If your mortgage is worth $130,000, then you have $20,000 in equity. The trustee can sell your home and use that $20,000 to pay your creditors.
You can protect some equity in your home by using an exemption. Every state has exemptions for homes, but the amount of the exemption will differ depending on your state. For example, Texas allows most homeowners to exempt an unlimited amount in their home.Alabama, by contrast, allows homeowners to exempt $15,000.You should thoroughly consider whether you will lose your home in bankruptcy before filing. Check the appraised value by looking at your property tax bill or comparing the home to others listed for sale in your area. Then compare this estimated value with the amount of your mortgage.
If you have equity in your home, consider Chapter 13 bankruptcy instead.

, There’s no point saving your home if you can’t make payments. The automatic stay will end when your bankruptcy ends, usually in a few months. At that point, you’ll probably lose your home. If you want to work out a loan modification, consider what you can afford.



Make a budget. Add up your fixed expenses, including your mortgage payment. Other fixed expenses include health care, insurance, food, and transportation. See if you can cut discretionary spending on things like meals at restaurants and vacations.
Confirm that your budget is realistic. Ideally, you shouldn’t contribute more than 31% of your gross monthly income to your mortgage., Your automatic stay will eventually end. Work quickly to iron out a repayment plan with your lender that is affordable. Gather your loan paperwork and call. Your lender might be willing to help you out, although they may insist on foreclosure if you are already behind on payments. Ask about any of the following:Forbearance. Your lender might be willing to let you stop making payments for a short period of time. Once you are caught up, your mortgage payments will continue according to your regular schedule.
Loan reinstatement. If you can pull together the money to pay all of the unpaid mortgage payments, then ask for reinstatement. This will get you current on the mortgage.
Loan modification. The lender might agree to modify your loan by stretching out the payments or by lowering the interest rate. Your lender also might add your missed payments to the balance and let you pay the amount off over the remainder of your loan.

, Be careful as you consider your options for saving your home. If your lender won’t work with you, you might be tempted to use an agency that promises to save your home from foreclosure. You should always thoroughly research businesses before signing up with them. Unfortunately, there are many scammers out there. Protect yourself by doing the following:


Check with the Better Business Bureau for the city where the company has its headquarters. Also check for complaints with your state’s Attorney General office and a local consumer protection agency.
Make sure the agency is approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. You can find a list of agencies by calling 877-483-1515 or visiting https://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm.
Avoid working with anyone guaranteeing results. Reputable agencies cannot make promises.
Don’t work with anyone who charges fees before providing services or who requires that you wire money to them or pay with a cashier’s check.
Avoid signing blank forms or letting an agency complete forms for you. Always carefully read something before signing it.

, In a Chapter 13, you keep all of your property. This is a good option for people with a lot of equity in their home. Instead of selling assets to pay creditors, you come up with a repayment plan that lasts three to five years.Talk with a lawyer about whether Chapter 13 is a better option for you.
Your credit counselor also should have discussed Chapter 13 with you.

, Chapter 13 is more complicated than Chapter 7, so you need to hire a lawyer. You can find a bankruptcy lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a referral.


At your consultation, talk about how much it will cost for the lawyer to represent you. An average Chapter 13 bankruptcy usually costs $3,000, though this amount depends on where you live.You might qualify for legal aid if you’re low income (income below 125% of the federal poverty level). Visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website to find legal aid: http://www.lsc.gov.
You can fold some or all of your attorney’s fees into your repayment plan, which can make obtaining a lawyer affordable.

, Your repayment plan will last three to five years, depending on your income. You must pay 100% of certain debts, such as child support payments and secured loans (such as your mortgage). You’ll also pay only a percentage of your unsecured debts, like credit cards and medical debt.A judge must approve the repayment plan.


Your lawyer will help you come up with a repayment plan. You can also use the repayment plan you came up in credit counseling as a guide.
You can pay your mortgage arrears (unpaid mortgage payments) as part of repayment plan.
At the end of the repayment plan, your remaining unsecured debt will be wiped out. However, your mortgage won’t because that is a secured debt.

, You must submit a petition and schedules of income, expenditures, assets, and liabilities. You must also show that you attended credit counseling.Your lawyer should handle filing for you.


It costs $310 to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. You can pay in installments.
Once you file, an automatic stay immediately goes into effect, so your foreclosure should be stopped immediately.

, You must continue to make mortgage payments as they fall do.If you stop, your lender can start up the foreclosure process. Should you find yourself in financial difficulty, contact your attorney.


You may be able to submit a modified repayment plan, if necessary.Doing so could free up more money to contribute to your mortgage payments.

Realtors who have relationships with banks often know of listings that haven't come onto the database of foreclosures yet.


Get into contact with the financial institution to see which realtors they are working with, or search local foreclosure listings and see which realtors are managing the listings.;
, Once you’ve collected a list of names, call or email them and let them know that you are looking for a foreclosed home. Don't forget to specify your price range and what neighborhoods you want to stay in.Realtors who work with foreclosed properties also are more aware of the additional paperwork that comes with buying a foreclosed home.

, It is very important that you inspect the house to make sure that you will be able to afford all of the repairs necessary to make it livable. Foreclosed houses often sit empty for close to a year which means that there could be considerable damage done. Part Two explains what to look for.

, If you do not want to go the real estate broker route, you can find the properties yourself. Call around to local real estate agencies and ask about available foreclosed properties. Lenders that are selling properties at auction will also have information about the properties available to interested buyers.Search online for a list of foreclosed properties for sale. Sometimes, these databases will require a fee.

, This is a critical step if you are looking at a particular home. The title is the legal description of the propertyYou can find the title on a home by contacting the county clerk's office. The title has information on the estimated market value, the amount owed on the home, and any liens against the property.


The title also lets you know that the party offering the property for sale has the legal right to do so, so that you don't end up buying a house from someone who doesn't have the right to sell it.

, Foreclosure auctions can feel overwhelming if you are new to the house buying business. If you feel overwhelmed when attending a small scale auction that you are just observing, you may want to consider working with a realtor. However, take your time and learn how the auction system works--you can even ask someone to show you the ropes. This will help you to be successful when you go to purchase a home at your auction., When creating a budget, remember to take into account the repairs that the house will need. Visiting the home makes it much easier to decide what sort of repairs the house will need (see Part Two for what to look for). At an auction, sometimes bidders are required to pay the full amount on the property either by the close of auction of a few days afterwards, so knowing how much you are willing and able to spend will help you to determine whether to bid on a house or not.


Make sure that you stick to your budget and that you have enough money for both the house and the repairs necessary. If you plan to turn the house into a rental property, think about whether or not you can afford it if you don't find a tenant right away.

, You do not want to buy a house that you have not seen, especially if you are buying a foreclosed home at a low price. Most foreclosed houses will have sat empty for close to year while and will be sold as-is. It is very important to assess the damage and calculate whether you will be able to afford the repairs on top of the payment you will have to put down for the house., A foreclosure process usually takes a year or longer, so the property typically has not been properly repaired and kept up for at least a year. Have a professional inspector come in to see how much damage there is in the house and how much the repairs will cost.


The additional cost of repairs could cause the overall cost of owning the home to skyrocket.

, Aside from the major question of ‘is it safe?’ you should also find out what houses are worth in the area. Finding out this information will help you to keep your bid reasonable--you don’t want to pay an extra 50,000 when the houses in the area go for much less than what you are forced to bid at auction or are asked to pay by the realtor.You should also find out if it's an up and coming neighborhood where the property value will go up over time.

, Some states have foreclosure laws that allow owners to reclaim their properties even after it's been sold in an auction. During this redemption period, the owners may have 30 or 60 days to come up with the back mortgage payments. If they do, the house may not be yours even after you've purchased it. During this period, do not purchase anything for the property.

, Unless you are planning to pay for the entire cost of the property in cash, you will need a preapproval letter from a lender that describes how much money you can borrow. Getting prequalified allows you to buy a property faster and makes you more competitive if multiple people are bidding on the same property.

, The process for purchasing a foreclosed home can take longer because financial institutions make decisions slower than your average homeowner. If you're serious about a property, be patient after you submit the offer.

, Even if you buy the property in cash, you should purchase title insurance in order to reduce the risk of any liens on the property that you don't know about. If there is any problem with the title search, title insurance will get you reimbursed."

Sell your home.",How to Protect Yourself from Foreclosure," Buying a home is a big investment. This is especially true for first time home buyers. If you are considering purchasing a home in the near future, consider the benefits and drawbacks of doing so. Use your list of benefits and drawbacks to decide whether buying a home is right for you. If the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, consider waiting. Doing so will help ensure you are ready for home ownership, which will help you protect yourself from possible foreclosure.


The benefits of owning a home include tax breaks, steady payments if you have a fixed-rate mortgage (as opposed to rent payments that can increase over time), home equity, and a possible increase in your home's value over time.
The drawbacks of owning a home include having to pay for repairs and maintenance on your own, the possibility of foreclosure if you miss payments, and a possible decrease in your home's value over time.;
, Create a realistic budget that takes account of your current income and spending habits, as well as how those things would be affected by home ownership (e.g., maintenance costs, mortgage payments). A lot of lenders (i.e., banks) will have worksheets you can use to create a budget and assess your ability to purchase and pay for a home.


The worksheets will often ask you to identify projected and actual sources of income, fixed expenses (e.g., rent, electric, telephone, cable, insurance), creditor payments (e.g., car payments, credit card payments), and flexible expenses (e.g., groceries, savings, entertainment, clothes, doctor). You will then add up all of your expenses and subtract them from your income.
Establishing a budget will help you determine whether buying a home is feasible. If buying a home does not fit within your current budget, do not do it. Buying a home when you are unable to pay for it is a common way foreclosures occur., Buying a home does not just mean taking out a home loan (i.e., a mortgage) and paying it back over time. There are some costs and fees that will not be covered by a mortgage and that will have to be paid up front. In addition, your financial ability to make a substantial down payment will greatly affect the terms of your mortgage, which in turn will affect your overall ability to pay back the loan (and protect yourself from foreclosure).


Recognize that when you purchase a home, you will have to make a down payment, pay closing costs, pay for homeowner association fees, and incur moving expenses.
Think about the dynamics between a down payment and your mortgage. The more of a down payment you make, the less your monthly mortgage payments are likely to be. Therefore, if you can make a larger up front investment, you will likely be able to save on your monthly mortgage expense., If you look at your budget and realize that buying a home is not feasible right now, set financial goals for yourself so you can comfortably buy a home down the road. Figure out when you would like to buy a home, how much a down payment is likely to be, and how much you need to save to meet your goal. Start setting aside money each month to put towards the down payment. If possible, put your savings into an account with compound interest. By doing so, your money will grow by simply leaving it in your account., One of the major indicators lenders will look at to determine if you qualify for a home loan is your credit score. Your credit score is a number that indicates your credit risk. The number is created by certain companies using a statistical program that takes account of all the information contained in your credit report. In general, the better your credit score is, the better your loan terms will be. The worse your credit score is, the riskier it will be for banks to loan to you.


You can look at your credit score, for free, once per year. If your score is above 720, you are in good shape. However, if you are below 600, you should probably work to improve your credit score before applying for a home loan.To improve your credit score, you can pay your bills on time, limit your outstanding debt, create more of a credit history by borrowing money and paying it back on time, and diversify the types of debt you have.If you buy a home and take out a home loan with a bad credit score, the home loan you receive might have a higher interest rate, which means you will have higher monthly payments. The higher your monthly payments are, the likelier you are to be unable to pay them. That could lead to foreclosure. Therefore, raising your credit score before taking out a home loan can increase your chances of avoiding foreclosure.

, Before finding a home, if you think you are financially ready for the process, talk to a bank and get preapproved for a loan. When you get preapproved for a loan, a bank is telling you that you qualify for a certain loan amount at a certain interest rate. You can use this information to find a home that is within your budget. If you do not get preapproved, you may end up buying more home than you can afford, which may lead to foreclosure.


To start the preapproval process, reach out to a number of banks and tell them what you want to do. The banks will then ask for certain information about you.
In general, lenders will look at your income, your income's stability, your credit history, the increase in housing payments likely to occur if you get the loan, how much cash you have for a down payment, and what type of properties you are looking at.If a lender pre-approves you for a mortgage, you will receive a letter stating the type of loan you are approved for. You can use this letter when you go shopping for a home.

, Searching for the perfect home that fits your budget can be fun but time consuming. To lessen the stress, consider hiring a real estate agent. To select a realtor, conduct online searches and talk to past clients. When you find a few you like, sit down with them for interviews. Ask them how they will be able to help you and make sure you feel comfortable working with them. Hire the real estate agent you like best.


A real estate agent will help you find a home that meets your needs within your price range. They will make all the arrangements necessary to tour homes and put in offers. They will also negotiate on your behalf to help you buy a home at an affordable price.Be aware that real estate agents are incentivized to sell you the most expensive house possible, because they get paid based on the cost of the home they sell. If a real estate agent is dishonest, you may end up buying a home you can't afford. Therefore, finding a reputable, honest agent is key to protect yourself from foreclosure. To find an honest real estate agent, carefully check online reviews and past client testimonials. At the end of the day, use your gut and assess their honesty when you sit down for an interview.

, When you and your agent find a good home, ask your agent to put in an offer on your behalf. Make sure your offer falls within the price range of the mortgage you are preapproved for. Do not offer more for a home than you can afford. When you make an offer, ensure your agent is being savvy. Start by offering a lower amount than what the home is listed for, or request that the seller cover the closing costs. All of these tactics can help save you money, which will also help you avoid foreclosure.


If the seller disagrees with your offer, they may make a counteroffer. Negotiate with the seller until a reasonable price is agreed upon.
Once you and the seller agree on a price, you will both sign a purchase agreement, which is a contract laying out the terms and conditions of the sale., One of the conditions within your purchase agreement should state that the purchase is contingent upon a satisfactory home inspection. This allows you to check out the home, before purchasing it, to make sure it meets your standards. A home inspection is incredibly important to help minimize maintenance and repair costs after you purchase the home. If you conduct a home inspection and find problems with the home's foundation, plumbing, electricity, or anything else, you might consider passing on the house.If you buy a home with major problems, you might end up needing to make repairs you can't afford. When this happens, you might fall behind on your mortgage payments, which could lead to foreclosure. Therefore, purchasing a home that passes a home inspection can help you avoid foreclosure.


Your agent will help you find and complete the home inspection.

, Once your purchase agreement is finalized and everything is in order, you need to obtain a home loan. You will do this by submitting a loan application to a lender. In most cases, if you are happy with the loan you were preapproved for, you will apply with the same lender that preapproved you. To apply for a home loan, you will submit an application and provide the lender with certain financial information about yourself. The lender will then send you a loan estimate, which you can accept by paying a certain fee.


At this point, your loan will go through an approval process. The loan will be processed by the lender and, if approved, you will be given the money you need to purchase the home.Remember, only apply for as much loan as you can afford. If you take out a bigger home loan than you can pay back, you may find yourself fighting to keep your home.

, At closing, you and the seller will sit down, sign various legal documents, and finalize the purchase. Once everything is completed, you will receive the keys to your new home., Before you accept your home loan, and even after you finalize the purchase of your home, you need to analyze your loan carefully so you understand what is expected of you. Mortgages can take many forms and each one will affect how much you pay and how problems are resolved. The most common type of mortgage is a fixed-rate mortgage, which is a loan with a fixed interest rate. If you have this type of mortgage, your monthly payments will always be the same (absent some change in your tax or insurance liability). This type of mortgage provides stability because you always know what your payment will be. However, the interest rate on fixed-rate mortgages will often be higher than other loan types.


The other type of home loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). With an ARM, your interest rate will remain constant for a period of years, but then it will adjust up or down on an annual basis. An ARM will usually have a lower initial interest rate, but your rate go up drastically after the fixed period is done. While this loan provides a great deal of flexibility, it can lead to very different payments on a monthly basis, which might make it difficult for home buyers to budget properly., Paying your mortgage in a timely manner is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself from foreclosure. As long as you never miss a payment, you will never have to face foreclosure. To help you make payments on time, set a reminder on your phone or in your calendar. This reminder will help you keep on top of your payments and will make monthly payments a matter of habit.


Foreclosure proceedings can often take place when one person thinks another person is making the home payments, or when someone forgets to make multiple payments in a row. Therefore, simply setting a reminder can help you avoid all sorts of problems.

, When you send in your monthly mortgage payment, consider sending extra money if you can. This extra money will go towards paying off the principal on your loan, which will help you reduce the total you owe. Also, consider sending in one extra, full payment, once a year. This extra payment will also go towards paying off the principal of your loan.


Making these extra payments will help reduce your liability moving forward, which will help you avoid foreclosure. Additionally, by reducing the amount you owe, you reduce the risk of having a financial hardship affect your ability to keep up-to-date on payments.A lot of reputable websites will offer the free use of mortgage calculators, which you can use to see how making extra payments is truly affecting your loan., To help you stay on top of your payments, consider making payments weekly or bi-weekly instead of monthly. This is particularly helpful if you have a hard time saving money. By making more frequent payments, you are ensuring that the money you have is going towards the mortgage and not towards something else. If your bank does not allow you to do this, create an automatic transfer that will take money out of your checking account for the purpose of paying the mortgage., If you are having a financial hardship and you can't afford the current mortgage you have, contact your lender and ask about modifying your loan. When you modify your mortgage, you are changing certain mortgage terms (e.g., the interest rate or the overall time period of repayment). The modification will take account of your current financial situation, which means your monthly payments will be lowered. On the down side, you may have to continue making payments for longer than originally anticipated.


Mortgage modification is a great way to get ahead of financial problems and avoid foreclosure. Talk to your lender as soon as your financial troubles begin., If you are in serious financial trouble and cannot continue to make your mortgage payments, you need to get help immediately. Even with your troubles, you still may not have to resort to foreclosure. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for overseeing mortgage practices in the United States. HUD offers help to people struggling to make their mortgage payments through the approval of certain counselors. These HUD-approved counselors will work with your lender to find a solution to your mortgage problems. In fact, if you use a HUD-approved counselor, you are 60% more likely to avoid foreclosure.


HUD-approved counseling is free and you can get help by calling 1-888-995-HOPE (4673)., Do not be ashamed to confront your housing and financial problems. The only way to avoid foreclosure and keep your home is to be decisive and talk with your lender. Start talking to your lender even before you miss a payment. Your lender will try to work with you to find a solution. The more upfront you are the better your lender will be able to help you.Try to talk to your lender in person by going to the bank. If this does not work, give them a call. As a last resort, send them an email.


When you talk to your lender, tell them what is going on. Explain your financial hardship and how long you expect it to last. Your lender will take this information and think about what the bank can do to help. When you communicate with your lender, they will recommend various actions to help you keep your home. The options they recommend will depend on your personal situation.

, Mortgage reinstatement occurs when you pay the lender the entire amount that is past-due. This is a great option if you have the money but you have simply forgotten to make payments. This is not a great option when you do not have the money to make your loan current. Reinstatement laws vary from state to state, so be sure to check with your lender about the specifics where you live.


For example, in Oregon, you can make a reinstatement payment at any time prior to five days before the foreclosure sale of your house takes place. When you make a reinstatement payment, you will pay the total past-due amount, plus costs and fees. This payment must be a single, lump sum payment. Once you reinstate the loan, your lender will cancel the foreclosure sale and you will simply start making your normal monthly payments again. Contact your lender to find out how much your reinstatement cost is., If your financial hardship was relatively short-lived, you and your lender might agree to set up a repayment plan so you can keep your home. This option can be attractive because, unlike reinstatement, you will not need to write one big check. If you and your lender can come to an agreement, you will have to make up all of your past due payments over a certain period of time. The lender will apply a portion of your overdue payment to your regular mortgage payment and once the repayment period is up, your mortgage will be current.


Repayment plans typically last from three to six months depending on the severity of your delinquency. Your lender will also take into account how much you can afford to pay each month., A forbearance agreement, unlike a repayment plan agreement, is signed before you ever miss any payments. Under a forbearance agreement, your lender will agree to reduce or suspend your mortgage payments for a period of time. After the forbearance period, you will resume making normal mortgage payments, plus an amount that will help you get current due to your missed payments.


Forbearance periods can differ and depend on the circumstances. Talk to your lender to determine how long you will need. Forbearance agreements are a great option when you know you are going to have a financial hardship before it hits., In some circumstances, the only way to avoid foreclosure may be to sell your home. This option is best suited for people that have a lot of equity in their home (i.e., a large portion of your loan is already paid off). Once your home is sold, you will use that equity money to pay back the mortgage.


If you do not have enough equity to cover the outstanding balance of your loan, you will need to negotiate with your lender to find a way to sell your home without going through foreclosure. While you will lose your home, you will not have the damaging foreclosure on your credit history."

Pay your premiums.",How to Get Commercial Property Insurance," The state in which your business is located may require specific minimum amounts of commercial property insurance. These requirements represent the minimum commercial property insurance you must purchase for your business.You can contact your state's insurance commission to find out if there are any insurance requirements that apply to your business.
You also might check with a local small business association or Chamber of Commerce. These organizations typically have information about state or local insurance requirements.
Business organizations and industry associations also may have discounts with particular insurance companies that you can take advantage of.;
, Your commercial property may face different risks depending on where it is located and the prevalent weather threats in that area. Specific threats may dictate whether you need to purchase additional coverage.For example, if you have an oceanfront surf shop, you may need to be covered for floods, hurricanes, and wind damage.
On the other hand, if your business is located in the midwest, you wouldn't necessarily be worried about hurricanes – but tornadoes may be a concern.
The risks your property face don't just depend on its location, but also the type of building you want to insure, how old it is, and the materials with which it was built.
Different types of businesses may face different risks, or be threatened by the same risk to a different degree. For example, computer hackers are a risk to every business, but if you are a software developer, corruption to your files could destroy your business – as well as your reputation.

, If you are leasing your business's space, the property owner likely has property insurance. However, that insurance will not cover any damage or loss to your property, including fixtures, inventory, and business assets.If you are leasing your property, you need to contact the owner and find out what is covered under their commercial property insurance policy so you can get tenant coverage for your business assets that aren't protected.
However, if you own the property, you typically can find coverage that covers the building itself as well as the assets inside.
Take an inventory of your business assets and determine which, if any, are already covered under an existing insurance policy.
Keep in mind that the more you want commercial property insurance to cover, the more you'll typically pay in terms of your premiums.
In addition to the building itself, consider whether you want to include the grounds surrounding the building and any other property, such as a warehouse used for storage.

, Commercial property insurance may include a number of different types of coverage for different types of losses. While generally it's better to be over-insured than to be under-insured, you don't want to purchase insurance you don't need and likely will never use.If you're leasing a building, look for ""building occupied by the insured"" coverage. This covers your business property and other damages or loss to your business.
You also can purchase business interruption coverage, which pays you the income you would have made while your business is down, for example if the building is hit by a hurricane or tornado and you have to close for several weeks.
Specific machinery, such as boilers or compressors, can be covered specifically. This coverage typically must be purchased separately as an endorsement, and covers losses that result from a machinery malfunction.
If you have particular items of value, such as fine art or valuable papers such as original business documents, you can get an endorsement to provide additional coverage specifically for those items.
Other endorsements may be available based on the type of business you operate and the risks associated with that business.

, If your business has several locations, some may face greater risks than others. You want to keep this in mind as you search for commercial property insurance policies so that you can make sure each location is covered adequately.If the risks differ significantly between locations, you may save money by purchasing separate commercial property policies for each of the locations, rather than grouping the properties together under the same policy.
For example, if you own one surf shop on the boardwalk and another location 20 miles (32.2 km) inland, the boardwalk location may require additional coverage and be more expensive to insure than the inland location.
However, you can save money with a separate policy for the inland location, since it doesn't face the same risks associated with the boardwalk location.

, To get quotes for commercial property insurance, find agents or insurance companies located near your business that sell commercial property insurance. While many national insurance companies offer these policies, you may get better rates from a local agent.Most insurance agents and insurance companies have websites. You can find agents near you by doing a general search on the internet.
If you know other business owners nearby in your industry, you may want to ask them if they can recommend a particular insurance company for your commercial property insurance.
Small business associations or your local Chamber of Commerce also may be able to provide you with recommendations.

, Before you get a quote or have any dealings with a particular insurance company or agent you found in your search, make sure their license is in good standing.In most cases this should not be a problem, however, better safe than sorry. If you don't get your policy through a licensed agent, you may not be covered when you have a claim.
Most state insurance commissions or boards have a directory on their website. You can find out if the individual agent or company you're interested in has coverage by searching their name in the directory.
Some agents or companies may have more than one location in your area. Make sure you're checking for the correct location where you plan to get your policy.

, To get a commercial property insurance quote, you'll have to provide the insurance company with some basic information about your business and the location of the property you want to insure.The value of the property you want to insure will determine how much you'll have to pay for coverage. For this reason, it's important to include everything, and provide as many details as possible.
If you haven't already, take an inventory of your business and its assets. You'll want to know the value of all your business property, as well as the approximate value of the building itself.
This may mean you need to get an appraisal if your commercial property has not been appraised recently.

, Getting several quotes allows you to comparison shop to find the best premiums on coverage that adequately meets your insurance needs for your property and business.The insurance agent typically will have a brief application you can complete to request a quote for commercial property insurance.
If possible, try to request several different quotes from each company, so you can properly evaluate the cost of the insurance with any additional endorsements.
You'll also want to look at the cost of the insurance at different deductible levels. Generally, the higher your deductible, the less your premium will be.
If you're unable to find a private insurance company that will insure your commercial property, contact your state insurance commission and see if they offer insurance for business owners in your situation.

, If you have replacement cost coverage, that means the insurance will pay the full cost to replace lost or damaged property. With cash value coverage, you'll only get the actual cash value of your property, minus depreciation.Replacement cost coverage generally is more expensive than cash value coverage.
However, replacement cost coverage may make more sense if you have business assets that depreciate relatively quickly, such as computers.
Otherwise, you may not get enough money from cash-value coverage to purchase new computers if your computers are lost as the result of a disaster.
Replacement cost coverage also makes sense if you have machines that you use in manufacturing your products that are rare and difficult to replace, or have to be custom built.

, Your business must be able to pay the premiums for the coverage you choose. Beyond premiums, your deductible will be an important consideration in the event you make a claim.Generally, your total insurance coverage shouldn't represent more than 15 percent of your total operating budget.
However, keep in mind that this includes not only commercial property insurance, but all other insurance, such as professional liability insurance or workers' compensation insurance.
If you're close to going over your budget, you may want to take a second look at any endorsements or extra coverage you thought you needed.
You want to get enough insurance that if disaster strikes, it won't mean the end of your business. At the same time, you may have extra coverage that you don't really need.

, While you may be able to purchase your policy online, meeting with an agent in person can help you better understand your policy. You also have the opportunity to start a relationship with the person who will be handling your policy.Having a good agent who understands your business and your needs may be the most important part of finding a good commercial property insurance policy.
When you meet with the agent, think of it like an interview. If you wouldn't trust them in a job with your company, you probably shouldn't trust them to handle your insurance needs.
Look for an agent who puts the needs of your business, rather than their sales goals, first. If an agent keeps pressuring you to buy an endorsement or other coverage that you don't think you need, go elsewhere.

, When you meet with your chosen agent, have them explain your policy to you in detail. Come armed with plenty of questions about your coverage and the procedures you must follow to make a claim.Your agent should be able to explain your policy in great detail, using language that you understand.
Ask them how your policy was valued, and how risks were assessed. You also want to find out the agent's claim procedure, and how quickly claims are handled.
Make sure you understand your deductible and how it works, as well as what specific items are covered under your policy.
You also want to make sure you understand what your policy doesn't cover. For example, if flooding isn't covered by your policy and your business is located in a flood-prone area, this is something you may want to add.

, Once you're satisfied that the policy you've chosen will adequately meet your business's insurance needs, you'll have some documents to sign before your coverage will take effect.You may sign paper documents in person, or you may be able to submit an electronic signature online to activate your policy.
Make several copies of your property documents and keep them in different locations. Although it may make sense to keep a copy in your office, you also should have another copy at home, so you have it if your commercial property is destroyed or otherwise inaccessible.

, Whether you must pay your entire annual premium up front or are allowed to pay in installments generally depends on the insurance company. If you pay in installments, however, you may end up paying slightly more for coverage.How you choose to pay your premium will depend on how much the policy will cost you annually.
For example, if your commercial property insurance is several thousand dollars, it may not be possible for you to pay it all at once.
In contrast, if your annual premium is less than a thousand dollars, you should try to pay it all at once. This saves you from having to worry about missing a payment accidentally, which could result in loss or suspension of coverage.
Make sure you save your receipts for all premium payments. Keep them with your other insurance and business records.

Offer a competitive bid.",How to Negotiate the Best Offer on a Foreclosure or Pre Foreclosure," Foreclosure listings can be found in a variety of different places. Start by looking in the back of your local newspaper for foreclosure auctions. You can then visit the auctioneer's website for more information. Alternately, some real estate websites like Zillow.com and RealtyTrac.com will allow you to easily filter a real estate search for foreclosed properties.


You can also contact a real estate agent who specializes in foreclosures.;
, Bank will sometimes have foreclosed properties that they own listed on their websites. To find them, search online for the name of the bank and ""REO,"" which stands for real estate owned. You can then browse the properties that they own., Foreclosures can all seem like great deals, but that doesn't mean that they all are. Many times, foreclosures in poor locations will decrease even further in value after you buy them. Check for poor locations by assessing similar homes nearby and the area itself. If many nearby homes are also in foreclosure, this likely means that the property is not a good buy. Similarly, if the property is not near any amenities or in a good school district, you might want to stay away. Look for properties that are in good condition and located in better neighborhoods., In many cases, it's easier to purchase foreclosures in cash. Sellers are more motivated to sell to a cash buyer and it can make the closing process move along much faster.However, many buyers of foreclosed homes do so with a mortgage. Mortgages can be obtained for foreclosed homes the same way you get them for regular home purchases.


Be sure to add in the costs of repairs, renovations, and closing costs when determining how much to set aside or borrow., Look at recent sales in neighborhood for comparable homes. Calculate range of average square foot price received and multiply by target home square price. For example, a price $150 to $185 per square foot for home with 1500 square feet would be a range of $225,000 to $277,500. The median sales price would be $251,250.

, Estimate costs may include repairs, sales commission, closing costs, and interest. Additional repair costs run 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price. Expect a 6 percent Sales commission and 2 to 5 percent for closing costs. For example, a purchaser of foreclosed home purchased for $150,000 would likely have between 18 and 31 percent of the sales price in costs, or $27,000 to $46,500. This is also the sum a buyer will usually pay out of pocket.


If you see obvious flaws from a distance, such as poor landscaping, a damaged driveway, and/or a roof in need of repair, then you can expect that more repair will be required in areas that you can't see. Add these costs to your estimate.
Estimate the cost of repairing specific damage and add the additional costs to the 10 to 20 percent cushion you previously established. For example, if roof repairs will cost $5,000, then add $5,000 to your earlier estimate.

, You can use either a set dollar figure or a percentage. To calculate a percentage, multiply your average cost. by your desired percentage return. A targeted pre-tax profit estimate of 30 percent on your average out-of-pocket costs ($36,750) would be $11,025.

, Add the estimated costs to the targeted profit to calculate a range from $38,025 to $57,525.

, Subtract your expected costs and targeted profit from the probable average sales price. For example, if the probable sales price will be $251,250 and the range of costs is $38,025 to $57,525, your initial offer should be between $193,725 and $213,225.

, The homeowner may have months after the Notice Of Default (NOD)or Lis Pendens (LIS)is issued to pay back their default or sell the home in a short sale. The trustee or attorney will be able to tell you if the property is still facing foreclosure. There’s no use wasting time trying to make an offer on a home that is no longer available.


The name of the attorney and contact information should be on the NOD or LIS., If the homeowner has not already listed the home as a short sale, you may want to send a postcard expressing your interest in the property. Remember to be sensitive to the homeowner’s situation; try to avoid mentioning foreclosure in the postcard. You may also want to hire a real estate agent if you’d prefer to contact the owner more directly.


A short sale is when the homeowner sells the property for less than the amount that's owed on the mortgage.However, the sale must be approved by the bank that holds the note and that process can take months.
A good example of a non-hostile postcard that gets the point across is something like this: ""I'm interested in buying your property. I'd love to have a closer look at it and make you a competitive offer. Feel free to reach out to me at your convenience. (XXX) XXX-XXXX.""
If the homeowner allows you on the property, you can get a better idea of the repairs needed. That will also give you an idea of what you should offer for the house.

, If the homeowner is interested in selling the home to you as a short sale, it’s time to negotiate payment. Make an offer at the low end of your range with a closing contingency of onsite inspection.


Be sure to obtain a title search and hire a contractor and/or appraiser to look over the home if you can
There have likely been some difficulties and hardships that led to the homeowner defaulting on the loan. The homeowner may be more receptive if you can let him or her continue living in the home as a renter for the first couple of months after the sale. You can also offer to pay housing costs for the first couple of months after the owner finds a new home
Remember, you don't want to seem desperate when you're negotiating with anyone about anything. Otherwise, the other party will sense weakness on your part and use it as leverage. Stay cool and seem disinterested. Talk about your offer in such a way that you come across as someone who's volunteering to help the homeowner. If negotiating is difficult, hire a third-party (an attorney or real estate agent) to negotiate for you.
Be prepared to make a good faith deposit with an escrow agent to confirm serious nature of the offer. If possible, make delivery of deposit to homeowner contingent upon closing. You want to be sure that the house is taken off the market until you either purchase or it go.

, You may want to attend some foreclosure auctions as a spectator to get an idea of what they can be like. Be sure to especially take note of similar foreclosures and what people are bidding for them. This can help you form an idea of how much you should offer.You can go online to search for foreclosures that will be on the auction block., The homeowner may have up to five business days before the foreclosure sale to pay off the default. Foreclosure auctions can also be postponed or terminated in short notice. You’ll need to speak to the attorney or trustee to find out if the listing is still current. Ask as much as you can about the property during this time.


Ask about the extent of maintenance needed on the property.
Ask how long it's been vacated. Properties that have been unoccupied for a while might require more maintenance.
If the property has been on the market for a while, ask why there doesn't seem to be any demand for it.

, Ideally you’ll want to run a title search to find any liens or debts on the property and hire professionals to give you their estimate. However, because foreclosure auctions can be very fast-paced, you may not have time to do all of that before the sale. Find out as much as you can about the property and keep it in mind when making your bid.

, It’s easy to get caught up in fast-paced auctions and make bids for more than you want on home foreclosures. Use your comparative figures from similar foreclosure properties, other foreclosure auctions, and repair and debt estimates. If someone outbids your maximum offer, don’t bid higher in frustration. You’ll learn the hard way that it’s not worth it.

, A real-estate owned (REO) or bank-owned property is real estate that's owned by the bank that held the mortgage.If you don’t have access to the REO listing, you can find out the name and address of the bank in ownership of the property through the local property assessor. You may have to make a direct request to a bank to be able to see its REO listings.


For example, Wells Fargo lets you search for REO properties that are owned by the company., While this is not absolutely necessary, banks and lenders are less willing to cooperate with inexperienced buyers. Even if this is not the first time you’ve purchased a foreclosed home, having a real estate agent represent you can increase your chances.

, As with the pre-foreclosure and public auction stages in the foreclosure process, you’ll want to know the title condition and have the property professionally appraised. You’ll want to take the cost of any repairs into consideration when making your offer and subtract them from the total., The difference is the homeowner isn’t involved. It’s easy to think that getting a good deal is impossible without a stressed and desperate homeowner hoping to be cut a break.

, Banks aren't going to be interested in traditional incentives like lower closing costs and quick closings. You're going to be negotiating almost exclusively on price when you're buying REO properties.

, Your offer might not be accepted at first. However, banks will often voluntarily lower the price over time as the property remains unsold. Keep in touch with your contact at the bank and be sure to check in every month about the status of the property. You might be able to buy it a few months down the road for the price you want.

, You're not the only one looking for REO properties. Other bidders will likely be looking at that same piece of real estate. So, your bid should be low, but competitive. Otherwise, you'll get passed up for somebody who offered more money.

Speak generally. For example, you can say, “Hi. I’m Dianne Smith and I have a mortgage with you for my home. I’ve lost my job and can’t make payments anymore. I’d like to look into a deed in lieu of foreclosure.”;
, You’ll need to show the bank many financial documents, which you should gather as soon as possible. For example, find the following:recent tax returns
proof of all income, such as two recent paystubs or a profit-and-loss statement
proof of monthly debt payments for car loans, student loans, and credit cardslist of monthly expenses
two recent statements for all bank accounts
mortgage statement

, You’ll only qualify for loss mitigation if you have suffered a hardship beyond your control. For example, the following are common hardships that cause people to fall behind on their mortgage payments:lost job
reduced income
illness
medical expenses
death of a spouse
divorce
natural disaster (such as an earthquake, landslide, tornado, etc.)
adjustable rate mortgage that increases

, You’ll need to submit one of these documents to your lender as part of your application.Your lender may have a printed affidavit form that will ask you to check off certain boxes.Alternately, you might need to draft a letter in which you summarize your hardship. If you are struggling financially, explain how this is likely a long-term hardship.A nice touch is to mention how drawn-out and expensive the foreclosure process can be., Although you want to go ahead with the deed in lieu of foreclosure, you should at least consider your other options. Talk to the loss mitigation department about other options such as short sales, forbearances, and loan modifications.


You can also meet with a HUD counselor to discuss your options. Find a HUD-approved counselor here: https://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm. Click on your state.
You may be eligible for the deed-for-lease program if Fannie Mae owns your mortgage. Under this program, you can stay in the home for up to 12 months and lease it at the market rate., Go over your paperwork and check to make sure the information is complete and accurate. Then make a copy for your records. Mail the application and copies of supporting documents to the address provided.

, After you submit an application, the bank will order a broker’s price opinion, which determines the fair market value of your property.Look at this opinion closely. It will determine whether the bank can sue you after accepting the deed.


For example, you might owe $200,000 on the house. If the fair market value is only $150,000, then the bank may want to sue you for the difference--$50,000. It can seek a “deficiency judgment.”
However, if the house is worth $220,000, then there is no reason for the bank to sue you.

, Before negotiating with the bank, you’ll want to know your state’s laws on a bank seeking a deficiency judgment after accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Washington, for example, prevents banks from seeking deficiency judgments.You can find your state’s law online or by meeting with a HUD approved-counselor or private attorney.

, Historically, banks used to relieve borrowers of any deficiency after accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. However, more and more banks are suing today for the deficiency amount. You need to negotiate an agreement with the bank that they won’t sue you for any deficiency.


Have solid reasons why the bank shouldn’t sue you. For example, you may have no money. If the bank sues you, they won’t get anything because you have no valuable property they can foreclose on.

, Consider the following. Hammer out an agreement with your lender before agreeing to sign your deed over:


Ask the lender not to report negative information to the national credit bureaus.If they report a foreclosure, it can stay on your credit report for years.
Choose a date when you need to leave the property. You may need to leave the home immediately after transferring the deed, or you might be able to stay for several months.

, Realize that the bank has most of the leverage in negotiations: they don’t have to take your property from you. Accordingly, you’ll benefit from an attorney’s expert advice if the bank resists your proposals.


You can find an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral to a real estate attorney.Call up the attorney and schedule a consultation. Ask how much they charge.

, Some lenders will require that you try to sell your home for the fair market value before they will go ahead with a deed in lieu of foreclosure.If this is a requirement, you should make your best efforts to sell.


Get your home close to move-in condition. This means fixing obvious hazards, such as exposed wires, holes in the floor, and rickety stairs. But it also means giving your home a thorough clean and possibly a fresh coat of paint.
Commit to reaching potential buyers. You can work with a real estate agent, but that costs money. Instead, think of advertising online at websites such as Craigslist. You can also put up fliers at your local grocery store and library.
You probably can’t negotiate with buyers if the bank wants you to sell the house at market value. However, document your efforts to sell your house. You want to show the bank that you tried your best to find a buyer.

, Generally, a bank will accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure only if there are no other liens on the property, such as a second mortgage, mechanic’s lien, tax lien, etc. If you have other liens, your bank might give you a chance to pay them off and have them removed.


An exception exists if the same bank happens to own the other lien on the property.
This can be a complicated process. You’ll need to call up the person with the lien and negotiate payment. Then you must confirm that they have released the lien by filing appropriate paperwork.

, This document will explain whether or not the bank is reserving the right to seek a deficiency judgment against you. Accordingly, you should read it carefully and not sign until you agree with the terms of the agreement.You want the document to say the transaction is “in full satisfaction of the debt” or that the bank agrees not to sue you for a personal judgment.Show this document to your lawyer if you don’t understand it. You only want to sign if you agree with everything in the affidavit.

, This document transfers the property from you to the bank.The bank should prepare this document, though you can show it to your lawyer as well.


The deed in lieu of foreclosure process takes about 90 days to complete., You shouldn’t trash the house or leave it in terrible condition. Although you don’t need to do a total rehab to your home, you should do the following before leaving:remove debris
clear out all trash, inside and out
perform basic repairs, such as fixing holes in the floors and walls
remove all personal belongings

Know the facts.,
Understand who is at risk.,
Know your local ordinances.,
Understand the effects of foreclosure.",How to Find Out If a Home Is In Foreclosure3," Foreclosure is the process by which a mortgage lender sells or auctions off a piece of property to recover the losses from a mortgage loan that has been defaulted.Who sells the property depends on the terms of your mortgage. Most mortgages will specify that the bank earns the right to foreclose on the property if the homeowner fails to meet the agreed upon repayment terms.In some states the foreclosure auction may be run by the local sheriff's department, called a Sheriff's Sale.Some states permit the lender to foreclose without having to go to court or involve the sheriff's department. These foreclosures are called a Trustee's Sale, and typically involve a trust deed instead of a mortgage., Anyone who defaults on a mortgage runs the risk of having the property foreclosed. A homeowner is considered to have defaulted on the mortgage after one month of missed payments. After a payment is 10 to 15 days late, lenders may begin to tack on late fees. The homeowner then typically has an agreed upon grace period in which to make up the missed payments plus all accrued late fees before the lender may begin the foreclosure process.Some mortgage lenders will allow borrowers to work out a special forbearance, which adjusts the terms of the mortgage to avoid going into foreclosure., In some places, a homeowner who has lost his home due to foreclosure has up to 12 months to acquire the necessary funds to buy back a foreclosed home. This is good for the homeowner who initially defaulted on his loans but bad for investors, who may buy a foreclosure property only to lose that property within a few months of the auction.This is known as the redemption period. Generally banks will not resell a foreclosed property during the redemption period and will maintain the property during this period of time.

, Foreclosure of one home can affect the entire neighborhood. Having a neighborhood house foreclosed on can affect the property values of surrounding homes, as potential buyers may shy away from buying into the neighborhood. A foreclosed home may also fall into disrepair, which can make the property less appealing to potential buyers."

Negotiate with your lender.,
See if your lender will agree to a forbearance plan.,
Reinstate your loan.,
Sell your property.",How to Stop Foreclosure1," If you are behind on your mortgage and think that your lender may try to foreclose on your home, you should attempt to negotiate a new payment plan. Many lenders are willing to negotiate because they do not want to foreclose on the property. Instead, most lenders would prefer for you to keep your home and keep making payments on your mortgage. Two popular plans that lenders often offer to people who are behind on payments are “repayment” and “modification.” Repayment is a plan where the homeowner continues to make his regular monthly mortgage payments while paying back the amount that he is deficient over time. For example, if someone was 3 months behind on a $1,000 per month mortgage (for a total of $3,000), the lender could agree to let the homeowner continue to make the $1,000 per month payment, and pay back the $3,000 that is owed over time. Under this type of plan, the homeowner may pay $1,100 for 30 months or $1,500 for 6 months, depending on his financial situation.
Modification allows a homeowner to lower his mortgage payment permanently, usually because his income has gone down or expenses have gone up. Under this plan, the homeowner would pay the lender back over a longer period of time, but the monthly payments would be lower. Keep in mind that lenders often will only offer a modification if you are not already behind on your mortgage.
The sooner you tell your lender you are having problems staying current on your mortgage, the more options you will have. Therefore, you should tell your lender as soon as possible if you have having trouble making the payments.;
, If you “forbear” on your loans, your lender will suspend all payments for a certain amount of time, with the expectation that you will make the full payments plus any deficiency once the forbearance period is over. This plan works best for someone who has lost their job or has encountered an unusual circumstance that makes it difficult to make mortgage payments. During the forbearance period, the lender expects that the homeowner is getting his financial affairs in order so that he can resume paying off the loan.


Keep in mind that a forbearance plan requires you to agree with your lender about missing payments ahead of time. You probably will not be able to get a forbearance for payments that you have already missed.
Lenders typically will allow a homeowner to forbear for 3 to 6 months. A longer time is less common. , If you are behind on your loan payments, you can stop any impending foreclosure action by “reinstating” your loan, i.e., bringing the loan back to current status. To reinstate the loan, you must pay the entire delinquent amount plus any fees that the lender has had to incur as a result of your delinquency. You can also “redeem” your loan by paying it off in full. This is an option if you are able to refinance the loan. , If you do not think that you will be able to afford to catch up on payments, and your lender will not agree to a modification plan, you can still stop a foreclosure. Although you will not be able to stay in the home, selling the property takes the control away from the lender, and will not hurt your credit score the way a foreclosure would.


If you have equity in your home, you will also keep that for a future home purchase as long as you can sell your current home for enough to pay off the mortgage. "

Offer to pay for your cat’s expenses.For instance, you might ask your mother, “Mother, would you be willing to look after my cat? I think it really likes you.”
You could ask a friend, “Michael, since my home is in foreclosure, would you be willing to look after my cat? I can pay for its expenses.”
Close, trustworthy coworkers might also be willing to assist you if your cat needs a home due to your foreclosure.;
, Ask your vet if you can receive low-cost boarding for your cat. Alternately, ask if you can set up a payment plan to cover boarding costs over a long period.If you cannot board your cat at the vet’s, ask the vet for recommendations. Your vet may be able to offer information regarding how to find safe placement for your cat after foreclosure.

, Some shelters and rescue organizations hold pets for up to 60 days at low or no cost. After the designated period has elapsed, your cat might be placed for adoption. Ask about your options and clarify the organization’s protocol before leaving your cat at an animal shelter.As a last resort, surrender ownership of your pet at a shelter or rescue organization with a no-kill policy. This will ensure the cat is treated well and stays safe until either another family wishes to adopt or until you have the means to once again provide the cat with a stable home.

, If you don’t have another option, you might choose to sell or give away your cat to an individual or – preferably – a family. Be sure to thoroughly investigate anyone interested in buying or obtaining your cat. Ask the individual interested in obtaining your cat for references from their vet. Call the vet to ensure that the individual treats their pets well and takes them for regular (biannual) checkups.Avoid giving a cat to someone who has never owned a cat or dog. They might not fully understand the level or investment (in both time and money) that cat ownership entails.
Advertise your cat for sale online. Use social media to network with others with whom you share mutual friends and family.

, There are many ways to get help when attempting to find safe placement for your cat after foreclosure. For instance, you might crowdsource a fund to pay for a long-term cat boarding service through GoFundMe or a similar site. Alternately, you might be able to get help finding safe placement for your cat through an organization that provides temporary financial aid for individuals who have been foreclosed on.Local animal shelters often offer free or low-cost cat food to individuals who are experiencing financial hardship.

File for bankruptcy.,
Apply for a loan modification.,
File a lawsuit.",How to Stop Foreclosure2," If a foreclosure action on your home has already been started and a sale has been scheduled, filing for bankruptcy will immediately pause the sale. When you file for bankruptcy, an “automatic stay” goes into effect, stopping creditors from attempting to collect debts owed to them. The automatic stay acts as an injunction preventing the lender from foreclosing on your home while you are in bankruptcy. However, whether you will ultimately be able to keep your home could depend on the type of bankruptcy you file:


Chapter 13 bankruptcy: if you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, also known as “reorganization,” you may be able to keep your home. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy you will “restructure” your debts over a period of three to five years and you will get to keep your home if you make the required payments under your plan. Essentially, filing for reorganization stops the foreclosure and allows you time to get current on your mortgage payments.
Chapter 7 bankruptcy: if you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as “liquidation,” your home will likely still be foreclosed on. Because a liquidation bankruptcy is premised on selling all of the filer’s assets, you likely cannot keep your home. However, there are some advantages to filing a liquidation bankruptcy, including stalling the foreclosure sale for a couple of months (to allow you to save up for a rental) and eliminating your liability for the mortgage debt (so after the home is sold, you will no longer owe anything to the lender).
If you think that filing for bankruptcy may be the right choice for you, make an appointment with a specialist at a consumer credit counseling agency to discuss the specifics of your case. Meeting with a specialist is a prerequisite for filing bankruptcy in the United States.

, In all states, lenders cannot foreclose on a home while a loan modification application is pending as long as the application is file at least 37 days before the foreclosure sale. Therefore, if you file an application for a modification, the foreclosure sale cannot be held while the application is pending or while you appeal a denial, and if you are approved, the foreclosure sale may never happen. There are various loan modification programs that are offered through private lenders and the federal government to help consumers who are behind on mortgage payments.


Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP): this program is designed to lower monthly mortgage payments that you are having trouble staying current on due to financial hardship. Many different lenders participate in this program, to see if your mortgage company is participating, click here and follow the directions on the page.
Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP): This program is available to people whose mortgage is owned by Fanny Mae or Freddy Mac. However, you will not be eligible unless you are current on your mortgage at the time you apply.
Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program (HAFA): Under this program, you will not be able to stay in your home, but you will not go through a foreclosure sale. Instead, you will give up your house to the mortgage company in exchange for them releasing the mortgage debt you owe. You can also receive $10,000 in relocation assistance.
To apply for any of these programs, visit the Federal Government’s website at http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/steps/pages/step-2-all-programs.aspx.

, If your state allows lenders to foreclose on deficient mortgages without court supervision, you can stop or delay your foreclosure by filing a lawsuit challenging it. However, keep in mind that this will only work if your lender does not have prior court approval to foreclose. In order to stop a foreclosure with a lawsuit, you would need to prove that the lender should not be able to foreclose for some reason, such as they did not properly foreclose on the house or did not give you the required notice. Keep in mind that if you sue your lender, you must be able to prove your allegations or the foreclosure action will only be delayed while the case is decided.
If you think that your lender did something that should stop the foreclosure action, speak with an experienced attorney. If you are worried about affording an attorney, contact your state's legal aid office to see if you are eligible to receive free or reduced cost legal help.

Ask the right questions.",How to Find a Good Foreclosure Attorney," Before you contact any attorney, you need to understand your situation. Many people may jump to the conclusion that they are being foreclosed when that is not really the case. Carefully review any correspondence you have received from your bank or mortgage lending organization. Try to understand whether the bank is just at the stage of demanding payment, or if they have started any legal proceedings. Particularly highlight any dates or deadlines that you see. Before a bank can foreclose on your house, you must be given formal notice.If you do not have copies of letters or paperwork, or if you are unsure of the meaning of any correspondence, you can call your bank's lending department to ask questions. If you are in default on your mortgage, you are not likely to make the situation any worse just by asking for some clarification.;
, You need to decide if you are going to try to keep the house and defeat a foreclosure effort, or if you need an attorney to help you get out of the mortgage. To make this decision, you need to review your overall financial status. Make lists of your income and other financial assets, and compare this with your outstanding debts. Try to be realistic in deciding whether you can afford to keep paying the mortgage.For this purpose, you should limit your list of assets should to cash on hand and income from employment. There is no point listing all property that you own, unless it includes something that you may be able to sell to raise cash, such as a boat or an extra car.

, If your overall debts outweigh your assets, then filing bankruptcy may be a good idea. In a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may be able to discharge your unsecured debts, such as credit cards, and still retain your mortgage and avoid foreclosure. If you think this sounds promising, then you will want an attorney who is experienced in bankruptcy law as well as foreclosure law., An attorney with experience in foreclosure law can help you oppose the bank’s foreclosure efforts and retain your home, as long as you can catch up on the payments that you owe. If you simply cannot afford the home any longer, an attorney can help you find the best way out of the mortgage and minimize the damage to your credit rating.Some defenses that a foreclosure attorney can raise on your behalf include:


the loan company did not follow proper procedures
the loan company cannot prove it owns the loan
the loan company’s accounting is incorrect

, The bar association is an organization of lawyers in a particular area. You can search for your local or state bar association online. Most bar association websites have a search tool that lets you find lawyers by specialty., One of the best ways to find an attorney for any task is to get a recommendation from other people you know and trust. If they know someone who has worked well in the past, then that attorney is likely to be able to provide what you need.


Ask your own attorney, if you have one, for a referral to a specialist. If you have already worked with a general attorney, for something like a family will or investment advice, you may ask him or her to help you. If that attorney does not specialize in foreclosure or bankruptcy law, then ask for a referral. He or she may know someone and be able to recommend you.
Ask your friends or colleagues to recommend an attorney. Especially if you know people who have been in similar financial difficulty, you should ask who they used as an attorney. Try to find out from your friends how satisfied they were with the service, the attorney’s availability, and particularly the outcome of the case., The Internet is a very useful tool to help you find an attorney. You can tailor a search to “foreclosure attorney,” “bankruptcy attorney,” or “financial attorney.” You can also limit your search to your own geographical area. Look for facts about experience, cases handled and courts in which the attorney centers his or her practice. Advertising can be helpful, but read carefully.


Be cautious when reviewing advertising for attorneys, whether on the Internet, on television or in print. A flashy advertisement or well designed Internet page does not really tell you anything substantial about the attorney’s experience.
The American Bar Association has a nationwide Lawyer Referral Directory that is available online.You can search within your state for local contact information for the bar association that can help you find an attorney close to you.
As another example, the State Bar Association of Texas has a website that lets you search for attorneys by name, or by their field of specialty.The New York State Bar Association lists a Lawyer Referral Service on its home page.You can call the Lawyer Referral Service at 800-342-3661 and receive a referral to an attorney in your geographic area, with the skills that you need.

, You need to know, before going any further, that any attorney you are considering is in good standing with the bar association. If you find a report of something minor, like being delinquent in paying dues, that may not need to worry you. But you want to avoid someone with any major infractions.


You can use Findlaw.com for links to each state to help you check your prospective attorney’s discipline record., You can search the attorney’s name or the name of his or her firm to find records, written court opinions, and newspaper articles. This may give you some positive insight, if the attorney had any particularly noteworthy cases. Additionally, it may inform you of any problems that reached the level of public scrutiny.


Search for the attorney's name combined with words like ""review,"" ""complaint,"" or something similar. These searches can lead you to online complaint sites, blogs, and forums, where you may learn more about the attorney. Just realize that what you read on these sites are rarely substantiated, and your opinion may be different than someone else’s.
Some counties have online dockets or a public records terminal. If this is the case where you are, you may be able to search by the attorney's name and see what kind of cases he or she has handled.

, Meet with the attorney and ask direct questions about your case and the way that the attorney would expect to handle it. In the meeting, you should consider the attorney’s way of speaking to you and of explaining the situation. A good attorney will be able to explain the law to you in such a way that you can fully understand it.Find out about fees, pricing, and billing procedure. In addition to the amounts that you owe to the bank, you will be paying the attorney. Find out if the attorney charges an hourly rate or a flat fee to represent you through the foreclosure. With an hourly rate, you only pay for the work that the attorney actually performs, but hourly rates can add up quickly. Some attorneys prefer to charge a flat fee to handle your entire case. If you go with the flat fee arrangement, make sure you understand (and get in writing) what services are included. For example, a case that begins as a foreclosure matter and then turns into a bankruptcy case may require additional payment., When you meet with the attorney, you should pose questions that will help you figure out if that is someone you will want to work with, and who will be able to provide what you need.


Ask the attorney for references. An experienced attorney should be willing to let you contact one or more prior clients. Reach out to those people and ask them about the attorney’s work and how satisfied they were with the attorney.
Ask about the attorney’s experience handling cases similar to yours. You should discuss whether you want to save your home or let it go. Find out what the attorney recommends, based on your financial condition. Find out how successful the attorney has been in prior cases in avoiding foreclosure, if that is what you wish to do.
If you are considering bankruptcy, ask about the attorney’s practice in bankruptcy court. The rules and procedures in bankruptcy court are quite different than common foreclosure law. If you think that bankruptcy could be an option, you will want an attorney with specific bankruptcy experience.

That means you should make your monthly mortgage payment in full before you pay down unsecured debts like credit cards, hospital bills, medical bills, IRS debts, and student loan payments. If you do fall behind on other bills, you may start getting phone calls from debt collectors. Falling behind on these debts can cause you to accumulate fees and can damage your credit, but the consequences are simply not as serious as falling behind on your mortgage.;
, Evaluate your monthly spending and look for areas where you can cut back.


Cut back on elective purchases, like eating out, clothing, electronics, hobbies, and entertainment.
Consider bringing in a roommate to offset your monthly mortgage payment.
If your significant other has a vehicle or you have access to good public transportation, consider selling your car.

, You may benefit from a credit counseling or debt management program that includes housing counseling. A counselor can help you better understand what debt assistance options are available, help you manage your obligations, and develop a personalized plan to get through rough financial times.


Contact your lender and ask if they have a credit counseling program.
The U.S. Department of Justice maintains a list of approved credit counselors by state that you can contact for help. Ask your local housing authority, credit union, nonprofit organization, or extension service if they offer debt counseling.

, Check with an attorney to learn what your rights are when facing a foreclosure. There are two types of foreclosure. If you have a deed of trust then the foreclosure process will follow a particular pattern that is guided by the federal and state laws. If you have a mortgage instead of a deed of trust, the foreclosure must be a judicial foreclosure. In this case, the lender will be required to go to court to get the property back.


In a judicial foreclosure, you will have one year to redeem your debt. This means you will have to pay back the money owed on the house plus additional fees. If it is not a judicial foreclosure, you will not have this right.
Many foreclosure laws might vary by state, and some may expire. Always consult with a lawyer to understand the laws regarding your specific situation.

, Check to see if your state housing finance agency maintains funds under the Hardest Hit Fund which is specifically earmarked for foreclosure prevention. If your mortgage is secured by or funded by government programs such as HUD, FHA, or the Veterans Administration, you may have other options to save your home. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac administer the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) to make loans more affordable. You can find these and other types of loan modification programs at https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/pages/default.aspx.

, In a forbearance, your lender agrees to temporarily reduce or suspend your mortgage payments for a short period.


You're more likely to be able to get a forbearance if you can show that your financial difficulties are temporary or that you're expecting a large sum (for example, a tax refund) that will enable you to bring your account current soon.
Lenders generally don't want to foreclose on properties, and they'll generally be willing to work with you if you make a good-faith effort to make payments and if your inability to do so is temporary.
You will most likely need to provide the lender with bank statements and other financial documents so that they can review your financial situation. They may agree to extend your grace period for late payments or to allow you to skip anywhere from 1-6 payments over a 1-2 year period (a forbearance). They might also accept reduced payments for up to 18 months.

, If your financial situation has permanently changed, temporary measures probably won't do you much good. In this case, try to negotiate to restructure the mortgage. Ask your lender if you qualify for any mortgage restructuring programs.


Restructuring can take many forms, but generally involves extending the term of the loan so you have longer to pay (and thus make lower monthly payments), spreading delinquent payment of several years, and/or lowering the interest rate on the loan.
Consider if you will be able to follow through with your end of the agreement. If you still won't be able to afford to make the payments, the agreement won't do you any good.
Fannie Mae administers the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which helps modify home loans to make them more affordable for struggling buyers.You can find this and other types of loan modification programs at https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/pages/default.aspx.

, If you're able to negotiate an arrangement with your creditors on the phone, ask them to send you a new contract with updated terms. You may need to write them a letter asking for confirmation.

, If you can reduce your interest rate or take on a different type of mortgage you may be able to lower your payments to a manageable level.


Keep in mind that refinancing can be expensive. You may need to pay closing costs, points, and other fees. If you can’t afford the fees, you'll end up facing foreclosure again, with even less money this time.

, Bankruptcy shouldn't be taken lightly. Your credit score will be damaged when you file for bankruptcy, and it can stay on your record for up to ten years. If you file for bankruptcy, however, your lender can’t foreclose while your bankruptcy is pending.This can buy you some time to get current on your mortgage payments.


The damage to your credit score only occurs when you file for bankruptcy. While it can stay on your record for several years, credit scores typically improve after the bankruptcy because the debtor has been provided relief from the debt burden. If your credit score has risen enough, you may be able to get a home loan after two years of a bankruptcy.
If you file bankruptcy and want to keep your home then you can reaffirm your loan with the lender. Reaffirmation is an agreement with the mortgage lender that states you will continue your monthly payments during and after bankruptcy.You must reaffirm the mortgage before the bankruptcy is discharged. Once you reaffirm, you will be expected to bring the mortgage current unless there are other provisions in place, such as forbearance or refinance, or loan re-modification.

, Contact a Realtor experienced with short sales before foreclosure begins. Find out how much you can get for your home. A Realtor may be able to inform you of all of your options based on your current situation.


If the amount for which you can sell your house isn't enough to cover the balance of your loan, the lender may agree to accept a reduced amount in a ""short payoff"" or ""pre-foreclosure sale."" A short sale allows for full discharge of debt and will affect your credit for two years. You may also be able to receive some of the money to help with your moving costs or to pay off other lien holders.
If you are already struggling with payments and foreclosure has already begun, it still may not be too late to take action. Your lender may delay the auction for a short time to see if you can sell the house.
A buyer may be able to assume your loan (take over your payments) in order to buy your house. It may be an option even if your mortgage contract says it is non-assumable. Contact a housing counselor, real estate agent, or attorney to see if this situation might work for you.
If you have a second mortgage on the home, you may still owe money on the balance unless you also obtain a forgiveness of loan on this lien as well.
If you have substantial equity in the home, you may be able to come out of the deal with some money. After selling your home, you can then buy or rent a different home that is within your budget.

, If no other remedy is available, consider offering the lender a ""deed in lieu of foreclosure."" You essentially just sign the home over to the lender. While you do lose your home, this is not as damaging to your credit as a foreclosure.


In most cases, a seller will not get any money from a short sale. If you give the deed to the lender, however, you may be able to negotiate moving costs with them to help you move out.

Don't sweep the problem under the rug. As weird as it may sound, it's in the lender's best interest not to foreclose on you, as it costs close to $30,000 by some estimatesfor the lender to foreclose. That's time, hassle, and money down the drain for the lender; they want to avoid foreclosure if at all possible. Talking to your lender will start a dialogue in which both parties can talk about possible solutions before foreclosure becomes the only option.


Let the lender know if your problems are temporary.If you've incurred unexpected medical bills or have been laid off, for example, the lender is more likely to give you a reprieve until you've got your head above water. They might ask you to make a payment in one lump sum, or even freeze your monthly payments if you're lucky.;
, As far as the lender is concerned, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing. That means they'll often be willing to modify the terms of your loan to get you paying something, even if it's not the original monthly amount.


Try to extend the amortization period. Amortization period is a fancy word for the life of the loan. If you make the life of the loan longer, your monthly payment will go down.
Change the interest rate. The interest rate of your loan is determined by your credit rating, as well as other factors. Suffice it to know that it can be lowered in order to make monthly payments more manageable.
Switch from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) usually start off with a pretty low interest rate and then shoot up over the life of the loan. They look nice to start off with but they actually end up being pretty expensive. Switching from an ARM to a fixed rate — where the interest rate stays the same for each monthly payment — can save you a lot of money as well as make the monthly payment much more manageable.

, Asking for forbearance is a temporary way to stall the foreclosure proceeding, but it works in a lot of instances. Forbearance allows you to either pay partial payments or no mortgage payments for a specified time agreed upon by you and the lender.You must, however, eventually pay the full amount forbore. You may agree to one lump sum payment to catch up on your mortgage or make extra payments in addition to your monthly mortgage payments.

, A housing counselor will work on your behalf to get your finances back on track and find a compromise between you and the lender so that foreclosure can be avoided. A good quality counselor will usually be a good investment, especially if they help you hold onto your house.


Be weary of those housing counselors who ""guarantee"" a stall or stop in the foreclosure process. These counselors often charge exorbitant sums (think thousands of dollars) and sometimes only stall the proceedings, leaving you no better off than you were to begin with. Visit the Department of Housing and Urban Development's website to see a full list of approved housing counselors.

, Filing an answer and attending the hearing stops the lender or county from obtaining a default judgment against you. Research the defenses to foreclosure — these are the reasons why the mortgage lender or county shouldn't win, and they are listed below.


Select the defense to foreclosure that fits your circumstances.
Write an answer, including your defense to the foreclosure.
Submit the written answer to the county court where the lender or municipality filed the foreclosure complaint.

, When you sign a mortgage document, there's a promissory note that lenders are supposed to keep that details all the specifics of the loan agreement. During the housing boom, unscrupulous lenders underwrote so many loan documents and filed them away or sold them off, content simply to know they had made money. Now, many of the documents cannot be found, partly because they were sent off when the mortgage was securitized. The short story is this: if the lender cannot find the note, foreclosure can effectively be postponed, if not stopped completely.Making the lender ""produce the note"" can be effective, especially if the lender used less-than-savory means of getting you to agree to the loan, but it's not a long term strategy for success. You can buy a lot of time if the lender can't produce the note, but in most cases you won't be able to stop foreclosure once the note is found.

, If you can manage to sell the house before the foreclosure of your home actually clears, you can keep whatever equity you still have invested in the home.It may be hard to sell your home on such a quick turnaround, but it's definitely possible, especially with the market heating up. Read here for more tips on how to sell your home quickly.

, When a property is about to be foreclosed on, a database attempts to make sure that the ownership of the mortgage — from the time you signed the papers up to the present moment — is clear and unambiguous. This way, the courts can recognize the legality of the foreclosure. Because so many mortgages were bundled into complex securities and traded on the marketplace, the chain of title is often not clear and unambiguous. If you can successfully question the database that keeps track of the chain of title, you may be able to keep your home.The database that keeps of the chain of title is called the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS. It was established specifically in order to track the chain of title, a tall task given the rate at which many mortgages were being securitized and then traded. But some courts are skeptical of MERS' legitimacy. One popular foreclosure defense rests on forcing the lender to independently verify the chain of title without using MERS.In order to save your home from foreclosure using the chain of title defense, you're probably going to need a lawyer. This may be a bit more expensive than some of the other options, but it's a defense that's quickly gaining traction.

, If you have little other option, you can always ask the lender's loss mitigation department if they're willing to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This is a document where you legally agree to transfer ownership of the deed over to the lender in exchange for the ability to walk away owing nothing to the lender.If you don't think you'll be able to hold onto your house, this option can be especially attractive if you owe a significant amount on monthly payments in arrears.

, Bankruptcy is the process of eliminating some of all of your debts in exchange for either regular payments or a seizing of your property.Although it may not seem like an enviable option, it's the smartest way out of an underwater mortgage for many homeowners. When you file for bankruptcy, the foreclosure proceedings can be stopped with an automatic stay.


Qualify for bankruptcy. In order to qualify, you have to complete a means test, pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, as well as acquire the correct paperwork such as tax documents.

, There are essentially two different kinds of bankruptcy declarations, each with their own unique rules and specifications. As they relate to stopping a foreclosure, they are briefly described below:


In chapter 7 bankruptcy, you ask to have most, if not all, or your debts discharged by the courts.In exchange for this discharge, the courts can take any property not exempt from collection, sell it, and distribute the proceeds to your creditors. With chapter 7, you won't be able to keep your house, but you will be able to stall the foreclosure for at least a couple of months.
In chapter 13 bankruptcy, you agree to a plan to pay back all or most of your debts over a certain period of time. The time you have to repay the debt, as well as the repayment plan itself, depends on how much you earn, as well as the types of debt you currently own. With chapter 13, you should be able to keep your home, especially if you think you'll be able to make payments in the future. The repayment plan usually lasts three to five years.

, Meet with a lawyer and declare your bankruptcy. Start making payments. After a while, attend a meeting of the creditors. This is a meeting between you and a bankruptcy trustee. However, your creditors may also attend. This meeting will give you a better sense of where foreclosure proceedings are at.

, Some companies lure desperate families into a trap by promising to get the mortgage current and then re-sign the mortgage back over to you. Yet this rarely happens. More often than not, the company pulls equity out of the home, lets foreclosure proceedings continue, and dumps the home like a bag of wet peanuts. Worst of all, there's nothing you can do because the title of the property is no longer in your name.

, Seeking counseling is an important tool for many homeowners fighting to keep control of their home. Yet many sharks take advantage of people by demanding steep up-front fees and interest rate hikes after the dust has settled. Be sure to vet any counseling service you use on HUD's list of approved housing counselors.

, Although out of sight, out of mind may be a decent coping strategy for some of life's problems, it's generally not a good way to hang on to a house. Promptly honor any requests that come from either the court or lender, as failure to do so may result in hefty fees and even legal trouble."

Even if the home gets repossessed quickly and your cat is discovered, in many jurisdictions, leaving your cat behind is illegal., Some people assume that when they turn their cat loose in the woods or on the street, its hunting and survival instincts will kick in. But in fact, cats (along with most animals) raised in domestic environments are often unable to effectively adapt to life in the wild. Your cat risks being attacked by larger animals or hit by a car if you turn it loose. Additionally, doing so might be illegal in your jurisdiction."

File for bankruptcy.",How to Delay Foreclosure," When you purchase your home, the mortgage becomes a lien on the property. This lien gives the bank the legal right to repossess the property if you fail to pay the mortgage. The lien holder has two different options for foreclosure. In judicial foreclosures, the bank uses the legal system to take back the property. The laws and procedures for judicial foreclosure are very strict and complicated and vary from state to state.Certain jurisdictions allow for non-judicial foreclosure. If you purchased your property through a deed of trust or other non-traditional mortgage, the bank may be able to repossess the property without going through the legal system.;
, If you have received a default notice from your lender, you need to be realistic about the situation. At this point a foreclosure is inevitable. You need to decide if you want to cure the default and save your house or begin to make plans to move.


Review your mortgage documents to see if you would be facing a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure action. A judicial foreclosure is the most common. If you could be facing a non-judicial foreclosure, you have fewer rights and should seek legal assistance immediately.

, The foreclosure process is complicated and there are several options for delaying the process. Judicial foreclosures can be slowed down both through the court system and other legal means. A consultation with an attorney can answer your questions and give you guidance on your rights and options. Some options, such as bankruptcy, will require the assistance of an attorney.


Legal Services Corporation is the publicly-owned entity that manages the network of legal aid offices across the United States. If you are low income, you may qualify for advice and representation on managing your foreclosure and possible bankruptcy.The LawHelp online portal is a good resource for the laws and legal resources available in your state.The bar associations in every state have a referral service to local attorneys who are experienced in foreclosure and bankruptcy law. Most of these services offer a consultation for a reduced fee, in the $20 to $50 range, to discuss your situation., Most foreclosures are of the judicial variety and conducted through the civil court system in the county where the property is located. You are entitled to due process according to the laws of your state. While the process may vary some, there are some commonalities you can expect to see.


When you have missed enough payments, usually about three, the lender will send a Lis Pendens or Notice of Default to the address on your mortgage. In some states, the lender will also file it with the court clerk.The intent of this letter is to tell you how far behind you are and that the lender intends to file a foreclosure.
After the initial notice, there is a pre-foreclosure period that can last up to four months. During this time, you can delay the foreclosure by contacting the lender and trying to negotiate a payment plan to cure the default. Depending on the policies of the lien holder, you may be able to delay the foreclosure for additional months with a good faith effort to catch up the payments.If you are unable to get the payments caught up or come to an agreement on the mortgage, the bank will file a foreclosure action with the court in the county where the property is located.

, Once the complaint is filed in the court, you will be served with a summons and copy of the documents. Some states require the papers to be personally served on the person or persons on the mortgage while other states allow the sheriff or process server to leave it at the home address with any resident over the age of 13.Do not try to avoid service as a way to delay the foreclosure. The residents of your home also need to understand to accept the paperwork and direct it to you as soon as possible., The summons will list the date the response is due to the court. If you do not file an answer by the given date, the court can grant a default judgment in favor of the bank and you will not be able to delay the foreclosure.If you do not feel comfortable filing an answer on your own behalf, this is a good time to consult with a lawyer experienced in foreclosure law. By not retaining an attorney, you may lose valuable affirmative defenses by filing your own answer.
However, if you cannot hire an attorney or get help from Legal Aid, an answer does not have to be a formal or complicated document. It must identify the court, the case number, and the parties. After that, you can go paragraph by paragraph and agree or disagree with each allegation. You do not have to explain anything at this point. A simple, ""I agree with paragraph 1"" or ""I deny paragraph 2,"" or ""I don't have enough information to answer paragraph 3"" will suffice for the response. Your answer should be typed, but can be neatly printed in black ink. Sign the original copy in blue and take it to the court clerk's office for filing. There should not be a fee for this action. Then send a copy to the bank's lawyer. The address should be under the lawyer's signature at the end of the complaint.

, Once you have filed an answer, you are free to contact the lawyers representing the lender to see if you can negotiate a settlement. For example, you may be able to make partial payments for several months. If you know you will be unable to pay the mortgage or the house is worth less than the mortgage, you may be able to negotiate some extra time to move.

, If you can't come to an agreement, you must attend the court hearing. If you do not have an attorney, you can ask the judge to reschedule the hearing. This is a temporary delay to the foreclosure and can extend the proceedings by a few weeks.


Be on time. If the judge calls your case and you do not answer, he could find in favor of the lender and you will lose the foreclosure.

, Coming out of the flood of foreclosures starting with the collapse of the housing market in 2008 to 2012, lawyers developed new strategies to turn the tables on often predatory lenders. These experiences may be able to help you forestall the foreclosure action. You may even be able to file an amended answer to preserve all of your defenses.


Lawyers can ask lenders to produce original mortgage documents. With the advent of electronic mortgages and the fast bundling and assignment of mortgage securities, many original documents were lost. Demanding strict proof of the existence of the original contract can delay the foreclosure.In 2012 it came to light that foreclosures were being filed in bulk and signed by employees with no knowledge of the documents. This ""robo-signing"" scandal led to a routine challenge of the validity of the complaint., If you cannot negotiate a deal to keep your home and your defenses fail, you have to come up with a plan to either move or redeem the house.


If your home is scheduled for a sheriff's sale, you have time, in some states up until the day of the auction, to redeem the property. You will have to arrange it so you can pay cash to buy the property from the bank.
You generally cannot try to manipulate the sale by having someone buy the property for you. State laws are very clear on who is eligible to bid on the property.
If the property is bought by an investor, you may be able to stay on as a renter., If you are unable to pay your mortgage or the value of the home has fallen below the mortgage balance, you may want to consider a short sale of the property. In a short sale, the lender agrees to let you sell the property for a price in line with the market value.


A short sale can delay a foreclosure and having to move for several months.
Often you can negotiate that the lender will report the mortgage as paid in full to the credit agencies and lessen the effect on your credit score.

, Under the Home Affordable Modification Program, you can apply to have your home loan modified so that your payments do not exceed a percentage of your income. This is usually done by adjusting the interest rate or the loan term, either temporarily or permanently.


Applying for a HAMP loan freezes a foreclosure proceedings until your eligibility is determined.

, You will need to consult with an attorney, but Legal Aid may assist you if you are very low income, elderly, or disabled. The case will be filed in federal bankruptcy court and it is not at all advisable to try on your own.A bankruptcy filing will stop the progress of a foreclosure until the judge and the trustee approve the bankruptcy plan.
Your attorney will decide what type of bankruptcy is best for you. In a Chapter 7, your assets are liquidated and used to pay off your creditors in exchange for wiping out all of your debts. You may or may not be able to keep your home. It will depend on the type of loan and the amount of equity you have. Regardless, you will only be able to keep your home if you will be able to make the mortgage payments once the bankruptcy is complete.In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you make payments for a fixed time, usually 5 years, and the bankruptcy trustee disburses it to your creditors. At the end of the payment plan, all of your unsecured debts are eliminated.
You cannot keep your house in a Chapter 13 unless you can pay the mortgage payments on a secured first mortgage. However, if you have a second mortgage and the house does not appraise high enough to secure both the first and second mortgage, then the judge can eliminate or ""strip"" the second mortgage and discharge it with your other debts."

Have everyone sign and date the sublease agreement.",How to Sublet an Apartment," Depending upon the laws where you live, your landlord can almost certainly veto your chosen subtenant (with reasonable cause). He/she may also be able to make additional restrictions or perhaps deny your request altogether.


Your best bet for making it an agreeable process for all is to inform and even involve your landlord from the start. Explain why you want to sublet, for how long, and what you will look for in a sublessee.
You may even want to consult your landlord for advice on picking a good tenant, or ask if he/she knows of any good prospects.If your landlord is not on board with the idea, be prepared by brushing up on your tenant rights in your jurisdiction.;
, You may be itching to get things taken care of so you can head out knowing you won’t be paying full rent for an empty apartment. But this is a situation where it pays to do things right, and could easily cost you a good deal if you don’t.


Think of yourself as a landlord (or “sublandlord”). Your money is on the line based upon the person you choose to occupy the apartment, so do your due diligence in the selection process.

, Unless you have a subtenant lined up ahead of time, you’ll need to spread the word. Choosing the right channels can help ensure that you find the right candidate.


Placing ads in the local newspaper may seem old-fashioned but can still be a viable option, especially when combined with a presence on the paper’s website.
Popular social media, peer-to-peer transaction, and sublease-specific sites can be effective avenues, especially when seeking a younger clientele. Refer to this linked wikiHow article for some location-specific yet generally-useful tips.
In college towns, the school’s housing office may be able to provide information and assistance.Putting up fliers in strategic spots around campus can still work as well.

, As long as you’re on the lease, a roommate cannot really prevent you from subletting your share of the apartment, but he or she can sure make it a miserable and possibly costly process.


If you don’t want to go as far as letting them approve of the sublet or the candidate, at least make them feel heard and involved in the process.
They may have good leads on prospective candidates as well, so ask., Don’t be over-anxious and blindly accept the first person who shows interest. Think about the apartment as your place, which it is to a certain limited extent, and consider whether this is the type of person you want to live in your place.


Your landlord likely required some combination of a credit check, questionnaire on your finances, references, and perhaps even a full background check. It may seem like overkill to take these steps for a sublet, but they certainly can help weed out problematic prospects.Even if the potential sublessee is an acquaintance, risk a bit of awkwardness and request important background information as you would a stranger. Akin to borrowing money from friends or family, keeping the process at a “strictly business” level will probably pay off.
If you want to have a full background check done, you should probably offer to pay for it. You might want to ask your landlord for advice on the process as well, as he/she likely has ample experience.

, Reading reports and questionnaires is no substitute for meeting someone in person and judging his/her suitability as a sublessee. Doing so in combination with a walk-through of the apartment is a sensible way to make sure that tenant, subtenant, and apartment are all a good fit.


You can keep the interview more informal if desired, but still find ways to ask questions like: Why are you seeking a temporary living space? What kind of job do you have, and how much income do you take in? Do you have a significant other, kids, or pets that would be in the apartment regularly? Do you like to host parties or other gatherings?During the walk-through, be specific on the condition of the apartment, and especially possible problem areas. As a lessee, you will be ultimately responsible for damage done by your sublessee, so take pictures and be clear that you expect the apartment to remain in the same condition as you will leave it., Depending upon where you live, details such as your landlord’s ability to veto a sublet and the amount you are permitted to charge can vary. Consult the legal particulars in your jurisdiction before moving forward.


Generally speaking, in the U.S. your landlord cannot deny you the ability to sublet, but can reject a sublessee for reasonable cause. For instance, joblessness would be a reasonable criteria, while skin color would be unreasonable.
Regardless of where you live, it is safe to assume that you will need your landlord’s written consent in order to legally sublet your apartment. Skipping this step may put you at risk for eviction.
Please note: the steps in this section build off of How to Write a Sublease Contract, which is highly recommended for both legal and practical advice.

, Your landlord almost certainly had you provide one when you signed the lease for the apartment, in order to cover the cost of any damage or unpaid rent you might leave behind. Think about doing the same as a “sublandlord.”


Remember that, as the lessee, you will be ultimately responsible for damages or unpaid rent by your sublessee, so requiring a security deposit provides you with some insurance.
Your ability to collect a security deposit from a sublessee can vary depending upon where you live, as can the amount you can require and whether you or the landlord can hold the money. Again, it is wise to consult the laws for renters in your jurisdiction.

, Ideally, you will be able to find someone who will pay you the same amount you pay in rent. (Be warned that charging a subletter more than the rent you pay is usually illegal, depending on where you live.) In reality, you can probably hope for 75%-80% of what you pay if the apartment is unfurnished, a bit more if furnished.The monthly rent to be paid is a negotiation between you and the sublessee, just as the rent you pay was a negotiation between you and the landlord.
You will have to decide whether you want the subtenant to pay you directly while you continue to pay the full monthly rent to the landlord, or have the subtenant pay the landlord directly while you cover any remaining amount (if the subtenant is paying below 100%). Remember that you are ultimately responsible for unpaid rents to the landlord, so consider your options carefully.
Don’t forget about utilities as well. For a short-term sublease, you probably won’t go through the trouble of switching over the utilities to the subtenant’s name, so the responsibility for paying utilities (if not included in your rent) will remain yours. You can and should factor in your payment of these charges when you determine how much the subtenant pays in rent each month., If you are not allowed to smoke or have a dog in the apartment, then your sublessee must abide by those same rules or you will be in violation of your lease. You can add more restrictions than are in your own lease agreement (for instance, prohibiting a dog even though you can have one), but you cannot negate those that are in it.


Here, as elsewhere, you want to be sure to put the specifics in writing, in a legally-binding contract. See the next section for more on that part of the process.

, You can find a template for a lease agreement valid in each U.S. state online.Use the general template described in this section as a guide only.


To be safe, you may want to have an attorney look over your contract before signing. This will cost some money, but will be cheaper than having an attorney draw up the document (and much cheaper than getting tied up in a legal mess due to a faulty contract).
For more detailed information, see How to Write a Sublease Contract.

, Bring out your inner lawyer when drawing up the sublease agreement. Don’t leave any details “assumed” or “unstated.” Put them in writing in the document.


Explicitly detail how much the sublessee will pay each month; where the payment should go; when the payment is due; any penalties for late payments; your payment responsibilities (if the subtenant is not paying 100% of the rent); any security deposit due and terms for recovery; and other such particulars. Refer to the template below for further information.

, You are creating a legally binding contract among three parties: yourself, your landlord, and your subtenant. To prevent problems in the future, make sure that each party clearly understands the contract before signing.


If you are not personally delivering the contract to your landlord to sign, you may want to send it via certified mail with a return receipt, which proves delivery has been made.

Some will allow it but only with notification, sometimes with a period of notice like 30 days in advance of move-in. Some will charge additional fees or have their own process for approving subletters.Read your lease, condo agreement, or directly ask your renter/condo association.


Even if your lease doesn’t place any restriction on subletting you should still notify your landlord so they’re kept in the loop.;
, You’ll need to determine how much you’ll charge for monthly rent, what you’ll need for a security deposit, and how long the lease will be for. If you’re subletting the entire apartment and plan to live somewhere else, you should charge them the cost of your rent. If you’re only subletting a portion of the apartment, you could divide the rent by the number of bedrooms and charge for the number of rooms the subletter is taking.


If you’re charging by room, you should consider the relative square footage of the rooms and adjust the rent according.
A common security deposit is one month’s rent.

, Most New York City apartments require renter’s insurance so it’s likely that you already have coverage. However, not all insurance plans will cover someone either than the primary resident. Contact your renter’s insurance company and determine if you need additional coverage for a subletter., Photos will greatly increase the chances that someone will inquire about your sublet. Take photos of all of the relevant rooms including the bedroom being rented, the kitchen, bathroom, laundry, living room, and anything else that will be used by the subletter.

If you have a bird’s eye view of the apartment, include that on the ad as well.

, Include all of the important information about the terms of the lease and size of the apartment, the availability of parking, as well as rules like whether or not smoking or a pet are allowed. Make sure to describe the apartment building, the neighborhood, local restaurants and attractions, and your proximity to public transportation as well.If you are only subletting one room and plan to stay there, include information about yourself so they know what kind of roommate you will be. Include your profession, hobbies, if you have a pet, how often you go out, if you’re quiet, and if you tend to have people over.
Try to use descriptive adjectives like “spacious” and “convenient” and describe the subtle benefits like the view.

, It’s preferable to sublet with someone you know or at least someone you can meet through someone else you know. You will have a better sense of whether or not you can trust the subletter to make their rent payments and be generally responsible.Use social media pages like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram to post your rental advertisement and ask your friends for referrals from anyone they might know that is looking for an apartment.

, Use pages like Craigslist’s Housing section and Sublet.com to post your ad as well. These sites will allow you to post specifically for New York City and include all of the relevant information about the apartment.You may want to delete and repost your ad periodically so that it remains near the top of the search results.

, Ask potential tenants for at least one reference from a prior landlord to learn about their habits as a renter. Ask the landlord if they paid rent on time, if they left the apartment in decent condition, and if they ever received complaints for noise or any other untoward behavior.

, Ask potential tenants for proof of their income. They can either provide a recent paystub or contact information for an employer to confirm this.

, Always write out an agreement outlining all of the key terms and responsibilities of both parties.Use your own rental or condo agreement as a guide for this and make changes to fit the sublease situation. You can also use the sample sublease agreement at the end of this article as a template.

, As the renter, you are expected to provide a clean space for the subletter. Make sure you vacuum any carpet, mop hard floors, and provide a fresh coat of paint to the walls if necessary. You should also clean the bathroom thoroughly as well as any common areas.


You should clean as soon as possible so the apartment is presentable for the photos you take for the advertisement and for a tour of the apartment.

You must be prepared to evict your subtenant if he fails any of these responsibilities. This may include taking him to small claims court. You are stepping into the shoes of the landlord.The most common reason for eviction is failure to pay the rent. This breach could affect your master lease or even your credit if the landlord reports it to the credit reporting agencies.If you want to keep your own lease, you may have to pay the rent if your tenant defaults on the agreement.
You need to decide what personal property you are leaving behind for your tenant's use. You should consider secure storage for items that are fragile, valuable, and private. Do not assume that your tenant won't look through every corner of the apartment.;
, The lease is a contract between you and the owner of the property. When you signed it, you and your landlord agreed to a fixed rent for a fixed amount of time.Your lease will also have other conditions such as number of people in the apartment, pets, maintenance, and whether or not you can sublet the space.

If you live in a city with rent control, you should consult the rent stabilization ordinances for your rights to sublet., If you are allowed to sublease, you will need to let your landlord know your plans. Even if your lease is silent about subleasing, talk with your landlord. Lay out your reasons for subletting your apartment and see if you can come to an agreement.

Experts recommend that you notify him in writing by certified mail.Additionally, follow any requirements listed in your lease.

, When you are subletting, you must look at the same criteria as your landlord looked at when he rented to you. You want someone who will be able to pay the rent, be responsible for the apartment, and take care of any furniture or personal property you are leaving in the space.


Word of mouth can often get you a solid tenant. As soon as you know you want to sublet, let your friends and co-workers know.
If you are in a college area, the campus housing office may have a bulletin board or service to match short-term rentals with prospective tenants.
Only advertise in reputable publications. The local newspaper that publishes legal notices may be a better choice than a free newspaper., Unless you know and trust your prospective tenant completely, use a rental application.

You can verify employment with a phone call. The employer can only answer that the person works there. He can't give out any information about the applicant's character.
Subleases are subject to the Fair Housing Act. You cannot discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.Some states have also extended civil rights protection to sexual orientation and transgender individuals.

, This is no place for a handshake deal. You are ultimately responsible for the payment of the rent and any damage to the apartment.

If there are sections of the lease document that do not apply, cross them out and both of you should initial the change.
You can only sublease the property rights that you have. For example, if your lease forbids pets, you cannot allow your tenant to have pets. Other considerations include parking, laundry facilities, recreational areas, noise, and exterior maintenance.
The sublease cannot extend past the terms of your own lease. If your have six months left on your contract, you cannot rent out the apartment for nine months. If you need a tenant for longer than that (for example, you will be out of the state on a job assignment), you either need to re-negotiate with your landlord before the sublease, or execute a new sublet agreement when your renew your own contract.
Include a clause that prevents your tenant from subleasing under any circumstances.
Include a clause that prevents your tenant from unilaterally changing the locks. If there is a security reason for new locks, either you change them or your landlord changes them.

Inspect the property.,
Ask to see the master lease.,
Negotiate the price and terms.,
Receive the keys and move in.",How to Sublease2," If you are looking for a short-term rental in a tight housing market, it may be tempting to jump on an advertised sublease without knowing all the details. A sublease is a legal contract. You need to meet your prospective landlord and inspect the property.


Note and photograph any problems such as water damage, carpet stains, and damage to wall coverings. You don't want to be accused of damage you didn't cause.

, As the subtenant, you are bound by all the restrictions of the original lease. Don't trust that you will have guaranteed parking or can bring your cat until you see it in writing.


Make sure the leaseholder has contacted the landlord and has permission to sublet the property. The last thing you need is to move in and get a notice that the master lease has been terminated because of an unauthorized sublet.

, A sublease can be priced however you and the leaseholder want. Expect to pay more for a nicely furnished apartment. However, that doesn't mean that you can't ask for discounts, especially if you can pay some or all of the lease term upfront.


If the space is not vacant, inventory the leaseholder's personal property and attach it to the lease. If you do not do this, you could be accused of theft at the end of the sublease.
Discuss utilities and access to any services available at the property. For example, if the house has Internet or cable, will the services be disconnected or can you use them for a fee?
Discuss how to handle mail or packages that may arrive at the house. The leaseholder should pay postage for anything that is forwarded.
Ask for a termination clause. Discuss what will happen if the leaseholder wants to return earlier or if you need to move. Generally, either side should be able to terminate the agreement with 30-days written notice.

, You need to know when the property will be ready for you to occupy and if you need to have the utilities established in your own name or if you can pay the bills as them come in.


How you will receive the keys depends on the circumstances. If the leaseholder has been transferred, you may receive the keys from the property manager. Otherwise, you will get them when you sign the agreement.
Before you unpack, do a quick check and make sure you didn't miss anything in the initial inspection. For example, if the water was off when you looked it over, check the kitchen and bathroom faucets for leaks. If you find anything, document it, photograph it, and contact your sublease landlord.

Complete a Better Business Bureau (BBB) scam report form.",How to Avoid Foreclosure Scams," Scammers generally use common schemes over and over again because they know it gets your attention. Scammers search for homeowners in distress by looking through public foreclosure notices. These notices can usually be found in newspapers, on the internet, and at government offices. The scammer will then send you a personalized letter. In other circumstances, scammers take a broader approach and place ads around town, send mass mailings, and knock on your front door. Usually, the scam will involve one or more of the following deceptive messages:""Stop foreclosure now""
""Get a loan modification""
""Over 90% of our customers get results""
""We have special relationships that can speed up the process""
""100% money back guarantee""
""Keep your home. No problem"";

If you know what these red flags are, you can spot scams before they ever become a problem. Generally, each specific foreclosure scam will combine one or more of the following actions, which should lead you to believe it is a scam:Scammers will contact you. However, legitimate services will never seek out homeowners.
Scammers will try to collect fees before doing any work.
Scammers will tell you never to contact your lender. In reality, this should be the first person you contact and talk with.
Scammers will pressure you and make it seem like things need to be done quickly.

, The surest way to identify a scam is to check it out. Therefore, whenever you talk with someone who claims to be able to help you, ask for their personal information, a website you can check out, and a physical address you can visit. In almost every case, scammers will immediately leave you alone once you ask for this information. This is the case because they do not have any legitimate information to give you.


However, if a scammer tries to give you some of this information, take it and follow-up. Ask neighbors and friends if they have heard of the services being offered. Call your lender and ask about the program's legitimacy. Contact your local housing department and inquire.
After doing your research and checking out possible programs, you will usually be able to find out quickly which ones are scams.

, Once scammers have your attention, they will contact you and offer you various services. One of the most common schemes is fake counseling or help. In these scenarios, the scammers will ask for a fee and in return, they promise to negotiate with your lender. The scammers will claim they can reduce your mortgage payments and save your home.


When someone offers help negotiating with your lender, you will usually be able to tell if it is a scam because they will tell you not to contact your lender, lawyer, or legitimate counselor. They will make promises and urge you to pay them a fee quickly. However, as soon as you pay them, they will stop returning your calls and you will not hear from them again.Legitimate help, on the other hand, will have no problem with you contacting your lender. In fact, they will tell you that this is the first thing you should do. In addition, real help will not promise results. Instead, they will work with you to understand your case and work towards a resolution.

, In another common scheme, scammers will ask for a fee, which they say will pay for an auditor to look over your mortgage agreement. The scammers will tell you that the auditors will look for areas where your lender broke the law. In addition, the scammers will tell you that you will be able to use the auditor's report to avoid foreclosure and reduce your mortgage payments. However, in reality, as soon as the scammers get your money, you will never hear from them again.Forensic audits are never offered on a legitimate basis. In legitimate cases of help, an actual lawyer will work with you to look over your mortgage and determine if there are shortcomings. If there are, your lawyer will work with the lender to come to some settlement. If no settlement can be reached, your lawyer may file a lawsuit on your behalf.

, One of the most dangerous schemes involves individuals who ask you to sign your deed over to them. In return, the scammer will promise to let you stay in your house and lease it for a period of time until you can buy it back. In essence, the scammer will tell you that they have a better credit rating and will get a better mortgage deal than you can get.


When these scams take place, the scammer will make make buying your home back almost impossible. When you break one term in the rent-to-own contract, the scammer will keep your money and your home.
Additionally, if you give your deed to someone else, and they fail to pay the mortgage, the bank will still foreclose on your home and you will be evicted., Another common scam that people see is called a ""bait-and-switch"". Here, the scammer gives you a large stack of papers to sign and they will claim you need to sign them quickly in order to get a new loan and keep your house. However, buried in the stack of papers is a document that will surrender your deed to the scammer. Once you sign the documents, the scammer will take ownership of your home.Therefore, it is incredibly important to read every document you are ever handed carefully and completely. If you do not understand something, don't sign it.

, The final scam people commonly see is an offer for legal help. In this scam, someone will contact you claiming to be a lawyer or a law firm. They will claim that, if you pay them up front fees, the lawyer will represent you and help save your home. If you get contacted with this type of offer, ask the following questions that will help you determine the legitimacy of the claim:Will you be able to meet the lawyer in person? Scammers will usually not have real lawyers available.
Is the lawyer's office in your state and is the lawyer licensed to practice? If you are being asked to send documents to an office in another state, you should be concerned. Each state has different requirements for licensing lawyers and lawyers are not just able to practice wherever they like.
What services will they offer to you? Any qualified lawyer will be willing and able to send you a representation agreement that will describe the legal services they are offering. If they cannot do this, do not pay them any money.

, One of the best ways to avoid foreclosure scams is to fully understand the foreclosure process. Once you understand the foreclosure process, you will be able to navigate the system and understand common ways legitimate help can arise. For example, you can get help avoiding foreclosure by taking part in mediation and through exercising a right of redemption.


The foreclosure process starts when you fail to make a series of mortgage payments and you fall behind on your loan. At this point, your lender (i.e., the bank) will send you a letter saying you must get caught up on your payments (usually within 30 days) or they will start foreclosure proceedings.
A lot of states require lenders to take part in mediation and other programs to help you avoid the sale of your home. These programs will usually take place during the 30-day catch up period.
If you cannot catch up on your payments, the lender will take the required actions necessary to sell your home at auction. In some states, even once your home has been sold, you still have a right of redemption. If you have a right of redemption, you can keep your house, even after it has been sold at auction, if you can pay the purchaser the full price of the home plus interest and expenses., The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ""MARS Rule"" gives you certain rights when it comes to people selling mortgage relief assistance services. First, you never have to pay any money until the company you hire delivers the results you expect. In essence, you cannot be charged until you receive an offer for relief from your lender and you accept that offer. Second, companies must disclose certain information in their advertisements. For example:Companies must tell you whether they are associated with the government or not
They must tell you that your lender does not have to change your loan agreement
Companies cannot tell you to stop talking to your lender

, Lawyers can be a great source of information and help. The FTC MARS Rule does allow lawyers to collect fees up front, but only if they are licensed, offering real legal services, complying with ethics requirements, and place the money in a client trust account.If you want to hire a lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in touch with various qualified lawyers in your area.

, If you are having trouble making mortgage payments contact your lender immediately.At the end of the day, they hold your loan and they are the only ones that can modify it. Even if your lender does not modify your loan, you will need to keep in contact with them regarding deadlines and filing requirements. Scammers know this, which is why they want you to cut off contact with your lender., HUD offers counseling and help for individuals like you going through a tough time while trying to keep your home. Their services are always free and include budget counseling, help understanding and submitting documents, and help finding additional resources should they become necessary.


To get help, call 888-995-HOPE.You can also find local counselors by using the HUD website., Never give any money to someone claiming they will make your payments for you. Every mortgage payment should be made personally by you or someone in your family. This ensures the money is being allocated correctly and is going to your lender. In addition, even if you are paying for legitimate help, do not simply stop making mortgage payments., Contracts involving your home are usually not legally binding unless they are in writing. Therefore, you should never accept oral promises regarding your home and foreclosure relief. Once an agreement is in writing, do not sign it until you have read it and fully understand it. If you fail to do this, you may end up agreeing to something you didn't expect or want to agree to.


Any document you sign should be free of errors and blank spaces where things can be filled in later., If you ever feel uncomfortable or unsure with something, ask questions. Do not be afraid to say ""no"" until you can independently verify the validity of what people are telling you. If the help is legitimate, they will understand concerns and help you through the process.

, If you believe you have been the victim of a foreclosure scam, the first thing you need to do is keep good records. These records will be used when you file a complaint with various offices, agencies, and organizations. If you received an email, flyer, or any other paper materials from potential scammers, keep them. Do not throw them away as you will use them as evidence in your complaints.

, If you talked to potential scammers in person or over the phone, take detailed notes about those interactions. Specifically, write down what they said, what they were offering, and what they looked like. Additionally, if you sent them money, keep track of those checks and how much you sent. All of this information will help the people you report the fraud to.

, Your first point of contact should be the FTC. The FTC allows you to file a detailed complaint through their complaint assistant website. After accessing this website, select a complaint category and sub-category. In this instance, you will most likely choose the ""Credit and Debt"" category and the ""Credit and Loans"" sub-category.


Next, tell the FTC that your complaint relates to mortgages.
After this, you will be asked to tell the FTC how you were contacted, or whether you initiated the contact yourself.
You will then be given the opportunity to describe your complaint in detail by answering some general questions. For example, you will tell the FTC whether you paid the scammers, when you were contacted, and the name of the person that contacted you. If it was a business that contacted you, you can provide their information in the complaint as well.
You will finish your complaint by providing your personal information so the FTC can contact you. You will also have a chance to provide any additional comments you wish to provide. This is your opportunity to tell the FTC that you have documents and notes that may help, and you should ask if they want you to send those in., Each state's attorney general's office should give you the ability to file a consumer complaint. While the FTC complaint process helps that agency detect patterns of fraud, a complaint filed with the attorney general's office may lead to actual litigation.To start this complaint process, visit your attorney general's website. On their website, there should be a link to file a complaint. For example, in California, you can file a complaint online using their fillable forms. On the California website, you will need the following information in order to file a complaint:Your personal information
Information about the company or individual you think scammed you
Your comments about the potential scam
Copies of documents you want to show the attorney general's office (e.g., your notes, mailing, advertisements)

, In addition to filing complaints with government agencies and offices, you can also file a complaint with the BBB, which is an organization tasked with providing helpful information to consumers. By filing a scam report, you will allow consumers to look at the report so they do not fall in the same trap you did. To file a scam report, visit the BBB website and navigate to the BBB Scam Tracker page.


From there, include as much information as possible about the scammer and the scam. You will finish your report by giving the BBB information about yourself."

You may want to research local crime to know about potential security issues.Make sure to check window locks, fire escapes, and entrance doors.If anything isn’t working properly or the apartment isn’t up to your cleanliness standards, report it to your landlord or apartment management company and request that he fix any problem areas.;
, You want to make sure that your new apartment is ready the day you move in, so set up your utilities at least a few days in advance. This will help ensure there is no delay in your being able to move in and live in your space.Get electricity, gas, and water accounts set up as necessary. Some landlords will include all of these in rent price, while others will include some utilities and not others.
Your landlord should provide you with information the best companies to contact as well as the average typical monthly costs for electricity and gas.
Set up your internet. and cable TV if you want them. It’s a good idea to contact several different providers to find one that will meet your needs and your budget., Your landlord should make sure the space is properly cleaned and painted before you move in, but take the opportunity to deep clean it while it is empty. This will help you get to know the space better and may also help you identify problems inside the space.


Vacuum, dust, clean mirrors and windows, and disinfect the bathroom and kitchen.
Make sure to note if you find any problems or any cosmetic items that you’d like to fix.

, Once your belongings are delivered, you can unpack them and arrange your apartment. Unpack and arrange one room at a time from the rooms you will use the most to those you will use the least.


Consider starting with the bathroom, the kitchen, and bedroom(s). The most important spaces for you to finish first are the bathroom and your bedroom since you will be using both rooms as soon as you move. If you plan on cooking in your first week, then you’ll need to unpack and arrange the kitchen as well.
Pack priority boxes so that you can access anything you will need immediately without any hindrances.It can take a while to complete each room, but unpack your belongings completely so that you can see what you have and figure out what you may need., Make sure to file necessary paperwork for having mail and bills forwarded to your new address. If you are moving to a different area, you may need a new driver’s license or car registration., As you unpack and arrange each room, make a list of items you need to complete it. Think about not only how you would like the room to look, but also how that fits within your budget.Include kitchen utensils such as dishes, glassware, silverware, cookware, appliances such as a toaster or blender, a garbage can, and dishwashing products.Ask family members if they have any of these items that they’re willing to give away to help you defray costs.
You may also want to write down simple food items including spices, oils, vinegar, and noodles or canned goods to be sure you have these items as soon as you want to cook.
You’ll need office and lighting supplies including paper, light bulbs, and lamps and basics such as toilet paper and light bulbs.Make sure that you list bathroom products as well. Don’t forget basics such as toilet paper, body wash or soap, hand soap, a plunger for clogs, towels, a bath mat, and a shower curtain.
Prioritize the list according to what you absolutely need and what you want. For example, do you need more picture frames or do you have enough until you can save some money?
Remember to measure your available space carefully to make sure that any furniture you buy will fit into your new apartment.

, Moving is an inherently expensive process and you don’t want to go overboard. Be very aware of what you can afford and set a strict budget for yourself according to this.Stick to the list you made. It's easy to buy more than you need and go over budget very quickly.

, Every apartment requires basic pieces of furniture for you to live comfortably. Buying furniture at a discount or getting it for free will help you stay within the budget you set.


Shop at sales and look in thrift or second hand stores for cheap, good quality furniture or lamps. Remember to inspect furniture carefully for rips and insects, especially when buying secondhand.
Try to spend a little bit more on furniture if you will use it every day. Getting a good or decent quality bed or sofa will save you money in the long run because you won’t have to replace shoddy merchandise.
Ask family members or friends if they have any furniture they’d like to give away or which you can purchase inexpensively.
You don’t have to buy every piece of furniture you need immediately. Think about what you will use most like a bed or sofa and purchase those pieces first. Add to your furniture as you can afford.

, Give yourself plenty of time to decorate your new apartment. Moving is stressful and taking the time to make your place cozy and familiar will help relax you and make you feel settled.Create a timeline for yourself if you like. Tackling one room at a time is a good strategy and finishing two rooms per week should suffice.One of the easiest and least expensive ways to decorate a new apartment and add some atmosphere is to paint. Make sure you're allowed to paint inside your apartment, and then use color on one wall or a couple of walls to accent your home.
Hang familiar paintings, photographs and decorations. These will make you feel more at home and are an inexpensive way to jazz up your space.
Carpets and rugs can enlarge or make a space feel more cozy, and can also dampen noise.
Add small touches such as plants or candles. For example, placing a row of candles across a table or buying a few inexpensive plants and plant pots can add a lot of atmosphere to your apartment.
Remember that everything doesn’t have to match. It often looks much cooler and homier to have furniture and decorations that complement one another but don’t match exactly.

, Take the time to get to know your landlord and introduce yourself to any security personnel that may work in your building. If these people know you and where you live, they can watch for security issues or other problems., Meet your neighbors as soon as you can so that they know who you are and everyone feels as comfortable as possible. You can introduce yourself in different ways such as a letter to other tenants, a housewarming party, or going from door to door.If you live in a large apartment building, it may be advisable to just get to know people on your floor. Introduce yourself as you meet people in the elevator, lobby, or in other common spaces.
If you live in a smaller building or house, consider a more personal approach. You could have a simple housewarming party or introduce yourself to each neighbor by going door to door.

, Going for a leisurely walk around your neighborhood will help you become better acquainted with everything the area offers. Knowing what’s available can help you feel more settled in your new space.Check out parks, public gardens, and playgrounds. These kinds of spaces will give you and your family members a place to relax and unwind.Look for nearby restaurants and shops to get a feeling for what is close by, especially when you’re in a pinch. It might be worth it to build up a relationship with the businesses in your area.
This may also give you the chance to meet your neighbors.

, You’ll want to be aware of schools, grocery stores, and community buildings. Locating these places may be important to helping you and your family get settled.


Make sure to register your children for school if you haven’t done so already.Libraries, churches, fitness clubs, and community centers may offer activities that can help you meet people and get to know your new neighborhood better.

, Once you’re unpacked and know the neighborhood a bit, you may want to cook for yourself. Plan out some meals and stock your kitchen by shopping at a local grocery or specialty food store. You may meet some new neighbors or discover other hidden gems while grocery shopping.

, Capture the inside and the outside, including its gardens and the swimming pool, if the place has one. Include pictures of the bedrooms, bathrooms, and all common areas. Take the photographs at the angle that shows the room in its most ""open"" light.

, If the photo looks gloomy and dark, people will assume the property is gloomy and dark. You may need to bring extra light into a room to make it look as bright as it actually is, or you can play around with photo editing software afterwards. Do whatever works, but don't post dull photos!

, Put nice, clean linen on the beds, the best crockery you have on the dining table, and colorful flowers in the vases. You can also rearrange the furniture to fit the composition of the photo. This is something professional photographers do when photographing interiors, and there's no reason you shouldn't imitate them.

, You want your prospective guests to be clear about what you're portraying, so flatter each room in your captions. Suggest what your guest might do with the room and mention how versatile it is.

, If you're promoting your property as a base for visiting local attractions, include some photos of those too.

, Generally speaking, you want viewers to imagine themselves in your rental property. This is harder to do if the pictures are full of people or pets.


The exception to this is if the property has staff who will be helping to maintain the place or provide food, etc. If the guests benefit from the presence of staff, place the staff in their best clothes or uniform and take a group photo at the front of the house or in the garden. The caption can explain their roles, such as cook, gardener, pool cleaner, local food deliverer, masseur, etc.
Include pictures showing people partaking in and enjoying the activities available. If you want people to come and learn a rural craft such as thatching or dry stone walling, it's okay to show people thatching and dry stone walling.

, Sequence your photos accordingly. Visitors to your site may not even notice what you've done but it will give them a sense of logical progression through the space. Out-of-sequence photos can be disorientating.

, If you have a comprehensive vacation rentals software package, you may be building your website on that. This is beneficial, as it means you only have to do the major work once. If you're using lots of different sites and have to upload separately for each, make sure you keep photos safely for future use.

Check out your apartment carefully, and note anything that could obstruct you from sneaking out.,

Sneak out.,
Avoid any Guards.,
Now you can do whatever you want!,
Sneak in.",How to Sneak out of an Apartment at Night," Doors seem to be very noise, or at least my doors. If your apartment block has guards, spy on them. If they seem strict, they may tell your parents.;
, Tell your parents how tired you are, but don't overdo it. Sleep at your normal time. Go to your room and turn off all your lights. If you know your parents check on you, act like you're asleep until you know they won't check again. Then whip out a Nintendo, computer, iPod, or anything electronic and play a few games. Do NOT turn on any lights. Your parents will be able to see the light from under your door or from your window. If you don't have an electronic, read a book in the dimmest light possible. Put a dark coloured piece of clothing (Like a scarf) under your door to stop light shining through. Close your curtains.

, Once you are completely sure your parents are asleep, sneak out of bed. Put a few stuff toys or cushions under the blanket so it looks like you are still there. Grab some important things you need (Optional: Wallet, phone, Keys, Id card). Quietly open your door and stuff a sock at the bottom when you close it so it doesn't close completely, but doesn't open. Closing doors is usually very noisy. Sneak quietly over to the door. If you have a pet, don't wake it up, because when my dog sees me sneaking out, she thinks I'm going to play with her and starts running around. When opening the main door, remember to keep it unlocked. If you can't unlock it, bring keys. If you don't have keys, use a slipper to put under the door. Once you are out, stay still for a few seconds to make sure no one woke up when you were sneaking out.

, Casually walk by and tell them you couldn't sleep and you are going for a walk. If they are nice, they may not tell your parents or question you. Don't tell them your name, try not to show too much of your face and wear some clothes you never wear, so if they don't know you and they see you with your parents they may tell them. If your guard is strict, I suggest going through a different entrance with no guards. Maybe take the lift but go down to the car park instead. They may see you on the security camera, but just act casual, not suspicious, but don't show too much of your face. If they don't meet you face to face, they can't ask you anything.

, Party, visit some friends, go to your super secret agent base, create a plot to dominate the universe, or just take a midnight stroll!

, Now it's time to sneak in. If you passed the guard when sneaking out, do not go through another entrance. I repeat. Do NOT. Why? Because since they know you went out, they may not realize you went through another exit, and they may think you got lost, kidnapped, whatever. They could call your parents. Now quietly sneak back in the opposite of the way the snuck out. If your parents find out, tell them you just went for a stroll. And tell them you only went around the block. You'll get in trouble, just not as much.

Become familiar with the local rent board in your city or town.",How to Sublease Your Apartment in the US," The lease that you signed when you moved in to the apartment controls the relationship between yourself and your landlord. Your lease will probably say very clearly whether subleasing is or is not allowed.If the lease forbids subleasing, then you will need to get special permission from your landlord.


If you need to get permission from your landlord, you will want to try to convince him or her that a sublease is a good idea. An apartment is generally considered safer when it is occupied, because someone is there to watch for break-ins, plumbing problems and so on.
Do not try to sneak in a subtenant without your landlord’s permission. If you do, assuming that your lease forbids subleases, then you will be in direct violation of your contract, and your landlord will probably have grounds to evict you immediately.
Get your landlord’s permission in writing, either in a separate letter or as an addendum that you attach to your lease.;
, Once you get over the hurdle of getting your landlord’s permission, you will need to find someone to take over your lease. If you already have a friend who wants the apartment, that’s terrific. But if not, you will need to advertise.


Use word of mouth. Talk to your friends and family, and ask your landlord if he or she is aware of anyone looking for a temporary place to live. This is the cheapest and often most effective way to find someone acceptable.
Place an ad in a local paper. Local advertising is often quite affordable and is a very useful way to notify people of a vacancy.
Use social media or Internet sites. Getting the word out in as many different ways as possible will maximize the number of people who know about your apartment. Try posting on sites like Craigslist or Sublet.com, in addition to Facebook or Twitter. If you live in a college town, you might try Uloop.com.Post fliers around the neighborhood. Look for public bulletin boards in places like the public library or some small stores and restaurants.

, If you already share the apartment with one or more people, you should work together with them. If you are both named on the original lease, you have the right to sublease without the roommate’s approval, but the entire process will be easier if you work together.


Your roommate(s) might also be able to help you find a subtenant to take over your share of the apartment., Remember that you are still responsible to your landlord on the original lease. When you take on a subtenant, you are responsible to your landlord for any damages that subtenant may cause to the apartment. You also remain responsible for the rent, so you want to be sure to select someone you can trust.


Put yourself in the position of “landlord.” Recall the interview your landlord gave you, and the background check he or she required. You should treat a prospective subtenant the same way.You may choose to involve your landlord in this interview stage as well. Your landlord is likely more experienced. In addition, if your landlord has a role in helping you make the selection, you are likely to get some additional cooperation from your landlord if any problems arise with the subtenant.

, Before accepting someone to take over your lease, you should meet him or her in person. If the applicant is a stranger to you, you will need to ask some questions to get to know him or her. You should ask things like:Why are you looking for a temporary apartment?
What kind of work do you do, and what is your income?
Will you be the only one moving in?
Do you have any pets?
Do you entertain often? Will there be a lot of visitors or guests?

, Point out the condition of the apartment, and note any areas of concern. Impress on the subtenant that you expect to find the property in the same condition when you return and that he or she will be responsible for any damage.It is a good idea to take photographs of the apartment before you turn it over to someone. Be comprehensive, and get photos of all the walls, floors, carpeting, cabinets. Try to anticipate anything that could be damaged and get a picture. If any problems arise, these photographs will help you prove what happened.

, Even the best interview process cannot guarantee the honesty and integrity of your subtenant. If you have any important possessions, valuable property, or meaningful personal items, you should take them with you or put them into storage when you leave the apartment., You are not bound to charge exactly the amount of your own rent. You may ask for something less, if you want to encourage a tenant to move in soon. Or you could try to charge a bit more, so that it covers your rent completely and you gain a bit as well., It is common for a lease -- even a sublease -- to require a security deposit. This will protect you financially if your subtenant causes any damage to the apartment or leaves without paying rent., If your lease with your landlord has you paying for certain utilities, you remain responsible for those even with a sublease. You need to consider if you want to have your subtenant take over the payments, or if you will keep paying them. If you are passing the utilities on to your subtenant, be clear about which utilities the subtenant will be paying.


For a short-term sublease, it may just be easier for you to select an average amount that covers your utility payments, and add that into the rent that you charge. Then you can be sure that the payments get made (because you will make them), but you will be covered for the money., Discuss such personal accommodations as smoking or bringing pets into the apartment. Whatever you discuss with your subtenant, you need to make sure that your landlord will agree. Do not give your subtenant any rights that go beyond the rights that you have under the original lease., Even for a short sublease, it is important to put your agreement into writing. In case any dispute arises later, the written contract will control.


The Internet has numerous sources for lease agreement templates. If you search by state, you can find contract templates that incorporate local real estate law for your area.Using a standard contract will help you remember important issues that need to be included in your lease.
You may wish to consult with an attorney or licensed real estate broker before you finalize the lease. You can still use a template form, and then just pay an attorney or real estate agent for a brief consultation fee to review your contract.

, The standard form covers most of the legal details of a lease agreement. But if you and your subtenant discussed any special provisions, such as whether or not to allow pets, you need to make sure that this is written into the lease.The standard details to include in your written sublease agreement include the amount of the rent, due dates for rent payments, how and where to pay the rent, penalties for late payments, payment of utilities, and terms related to a security deposit.
If the standard lease contract does not include something that you want to include, feel free to write your own side agreement. Just write down whatever you and your subtenant wish to include and attach it to the lease as an extra page. Be sure to date and sign any of these additional pages.

, The written sublease agreement will be a legally binding contract between you and your subtenant. In some cases, you may even have your landlord sign the sublease agreement, to indicate his or her assent.


To help ensure full understand, you and your subtenant should sit together and review each paragraph of the sublease contract before signing it.
Keep a copy of the sublease agreement, and give a copy to your subtenant and to your landlord.

, The U.S. Congress passed a law known as the ""Fair Housing Act."" As a federal law, it controls activities related to selling and renting real estate across the country. In short, the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against people for race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap. This law will apply to the choices you make in finding a subtenant. It also controls your landlord's decision in choosing to allow or disallow a subtenant.Individual states may have passed their own versions of anti-discrimination laws. States must comply, at a minimum, with the federal law, but these individual state laws may impose stricter requirements. For example, Connecticut has enacted the Discriminatory Housing Practices Act (DHPA). The DHPA in Connecticut protects people against discrimination for an even wider range of reasons than the federal Fair Housing Act does., Different states will have different laws about subleasing. Many ""standard"" lease agreements that you may find across the country will include a provision that prohibits subleases. However, you need to research your individual state's law on this topic.


The state of New York, for example, expressly prohibits a landlord from ""unreasonably"" refusing a sublease. You will need to provide your landlord with certain information about your proposed subtenant, but as long as the tenant appears responsible, you should be allowed to proceed.On the other hand, California does not have such a law. In California, if your lease prohibits subletting without your landlord's approval, then you may not do it. You still might be able to convince your landlord that allowing you to sublet is a good idea., Especially in some larger cities, local real estate ordinances control rent levels for apartments. These rent control laws often apply to subleases as well as to the initial lease. It is up to you to research the local real estate laws in your area and find out how these will apply to you.


For example, in Berkeley, California, a tenant who chooses to sublet his apartment is limited and may not charge any more in rent than he or she pays on the original lease.In Washington, D.C., a similar local rent law also controls the amount a tenant may charge of a subtenant., Many large cities will have an agency known as a ""rent board."" These agencies generally are part of the local city government. They exist to provide information and assistance for tenants and landlords. You should either check online or call the city clerk's office to ask about a rent board for your area."

Learn when a letter of interest can benefit you.,
Form a connection.,
Tell the buyer why you love the home.,
Write emotionally but authentically.,
Paint a positive picture of yourself.,
Save the best for last.,
Keep the letter short.",How to Write a Letter of Interest for a House1," You can use a letter of interest to set yourself apart as a potential buyer for a particular property. In essence, the letter gives you the chance to describe yourself, your family, your situation, and any other aspects you’d like to make a lasting impression on the home’s seller.


You can maximize the effectiveness of a letter of interest in particular situations. For example, in a “seller’s market” situation, you can face competition from a crowded market of buyers all seeking the same house. A letter of interest is a tool you can use to make you stick out from the crowd.
Letters of interest are less common when both parties involved are using a realtor. If the seller uses a realtor, he or she may want to minimize any part in the selling process, and the seller’s realtor is more likely concerned with which potential buyer can close on the house quickly and for the largest percentage of the asking price.;
, Learn what you can about the current owners of the house and highlight similarities with your own life in your letter. If both you and the seller work as teachers, you can write something like, ""What would be better than to have a teacher taking care of your old house?""If you (or your partner, spouse, or children) attended the same school, work in the same sector, volunteer for the same charity, or share any other significant connections to the owners, be sure to make note of this in your letter.Don't sound too formal: I am a 30 year old alumnus of University Xyz with a degree in chemistry.Do sound approachable: The U Xyz banner at open house brought back memories — I didn't expect to meet another alumnus out here!



, Clearly express why you love this specific home and neighborhood. Write something along the lines of, ""My family and I love the beautiful backyard and look forward to many afternoons relaxing beside the pool.""Focus on specific features of the home and neighborhood that you love, such as the sunroom, yard, surrounding walking trails, etc.People are often still attached the houses they’re selling. Use this section to show the seller that you have the proper appreciation for the house. Show the seller that selling to you would leave the house in good hands.

, An emotional connection between buyer and seller can be crucial to purchasing a home, so don't be afraid to use emotional language. However, honesty and authenticity always go a long way, so avoid coming across as saccharine or desperate. Don't mention sad stories: ...turned down from several houses . . . looking to escape an awful neighborhood...Do tug on heartstrings in an upbeat way: ...kids loved running down the beach . . . couldn't stop smiling when I looked at the view...



This also means you shouldn’t exaggerate what you love about the house. The current owner will know the house better than anyone, including the work it needs. Overselling how perfect the house is can easily home across as inauthentic. Don’t be afraid to mention that you’d repaint, finish the basement, etc. This also tells the seller that you’re willing to invest in the upkeep of the house.

, Focus on your strengths, financial stability, and other positive characteristics that would make you the perfect homeowner. Highlight why you would make a great owner.

Don't brag: ...outstanding work ethic . . . pillar of the community...Do mention positive traits: I am community-minded and volunteer at my local school., Reiterate your excitement to purchase the house, as well as your most salient qualities. The closing paragraph of a letter of interest can be the most crucial, and thus it is important to close on a positive note.


A closing paragraph might also imagine the future you and your family will enjoy in the home. You might write, ""I would be so excited to raise my family here, and would enjoy many years creating memories in this home.""
Express your sincere appreciation for the owner's time. Include a warm thank you at the end of the letter, such as, ""Your consideration is greatly appreciated,"" or similar wording. , Outline a few important reasons why you would love to (and should) live in the house, but definitely keep it under a page.


Try to avoid including too much detail about your own life story, and avoid complaining about the difficulties you might be experiencing in finding a home."

Learn about the process of foreclosure.,
Answer calls or letters from your lender.,
Take action as soon as possible.,
Stay in your home until ordered to move out.,
Have all your financial information organized and close at hand.,
Learn about different types of scams.,
Consult an expert before signing any documents you don't fully understand.",How to Avoid Foreclosure1," The foreclosure process varies from state to state, so click here to investigate the laws in your particular state. According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, however, there is a general timeline of the process that you can look to as a guideline.It is important to keep in contact with your lender during every stage. This will increase the chances you can work out some kind of arrangement.


Usually when you fall 3 months behind on your payments, your lender will contact you and inform you that you are delinquent. They will usually give you 30 days to bring your loan current. If you fail to do so, they may begin foreclosure proceedings. If possible, try to make arrangements with your lender at this point, since proceedings haven't begun yet.
After those 30 days are up, the lender will contact attorneys and begin the foreclosure proceedings. You will be notified when this happens, and will probably also be charged attorney fees in addition to your debt.
The lender's attorney will schedule a date of sale. This means that your lender is putting the house back on the market to resell. You can receive word of this a number of ways, including an official letter or a notice taped to your door. The date will vary, but is often 2-3 months from the day you receive the notice.
The date of sale is not a move out date. Your lender will notify you when you're expected to move out. You still have until the date of sale to pay off the debt or make some other type of arrangement.;
, As you can see, you'll receive several notices from your lender before the foreclosure process starts. Some people choose to avoid letters or calls from their lenders if they're having trouble making payments. This is a mistake. In order to avoid foreclosure, you'll have to stay in contact with your lender., Don't wait until you are very far behind on your payments to address the problem. Ideally, you should contact your lender before you've missed any payments if you're afraid you might fall behind. The earlier you act, the better your chances of keeping your home., If you receive a notice that the foreclosure process is starting, you still have options. If you abandon the property, you may no longer qualify for certain assistance programs that can help you keep your home., Whether you negotiate with your lender, contact a lawyer, or seek government aid, all will want to see your finances. Having all of this information easily accessible you will make negotiations go by smoother and faster., People facing foreclosure are understandably upset, and may jump on any opportunity they think will help. Con artists prey upon this mentality and can further victimize you. There are a number of different ways they can do this, so be on the lookout.Lease-back programs. This involves you transferring the title of your home to a lender who allows you to stay in the house as a renter. Con artists often claim that this is a temporary arrangement, but if you sign up for this you've effectively surrendered your home and will likely not get it back.
False intermediaries. Sometimes scammers offer to negotiate with your lender to modify your loan. They will often charge high fees for their ""services,"" and by the time you realize that they aren't negotiating with your lender, you've already surrendered a lot of money.
Secret law claims. Some scammers pretend to be legal experts who know of a secret or little-known law that states you aren't required to pay your mortgage. Again, they will often charge high fees for their ""services.""

, It is often difficult for someone without legal training to understand the terminology and jargon in contracts and documents. Scammers often word things in a confusing way. Some people may even unknowingly sign away their houses because they didn't properly understand the document. If you are unsure of anything in a document you've been presented, consult a licensed real estate agent or lawyer."

Proceed to closing.",How to Invest in Preconstruction Real Estate," When it comes to investing in preconstruction real estate, you have a variety of options. For one, properties might be undeveloped, ""raw"" land without any planning or improvements performed by the current owner. However, develop-owned properties may be zoned or fully planned, with utilities and/or streets already in place. In addition, further properties might be already slated for construction, with existing plans for the buildings that will be constructed there. In general, less-developed land will be cheaper. However, this means that you'll have to organize utilities and work out zoning laws on your own as you develop the property.


Buying raw land will also require a large amount of due-diligence to make sure the land is surveyed properly, free of criminal activity (like drug growers or poaching), and to work out local regulations governing land use.Developers generally purchase large land sites for development. In most cases, the project is developed with streets and utilities, the sold to individual builders who then construct houses for sale or rent to home buyers or renters.
As each stage of development is completed, the cost of the property generally increases.;
, If the profits are so much better after construction, why sell earlier? Any time you buy something, it is a good idea to know why it is for sale. The reasons are often straightforward, but you want to make sure the builder isn’t concealing a fact about the property they discovered after breaking ground.


Builders sometimes need the money to complete their project on time. Selling preconstruction real estate gets them quick cash without having to worry about their credit or accruing interest on a loan.
Other times, they may need to have outside investors like you to get approved for a loan., If you are interested in investing in a hot property in an up-and-coming neighborhood, this may not be as inexpensive as you thought. Why? Investors and 'flippers' who have been doing this to make extra money for years monitor housing markets for the most profitable preconstruction projects. However, on the bright side, competition from seasoned investors may indicate that the project is worthwhile.The competition will depend upon the size of a development and its use.
For example, commercial developments for offices, apartments, and retail sites can be very expensive when compared to a single, undeveloped residential lot.

, The 2008 market crash burst every area of the housing bubble, including preconstruction real estate. As a result, builders are much more cautious about projects. While investors may get terms on large purchases, most sellers of single lots in a residential development require full payment.


By nature, preconstruction real estate requires you to do some speculation about the market value of the property not now, but after completion. However, keep in mind that you can't predict something cataclysmic like a housing market crash, which would likely mean that you lose your investment.
You may have to choose between signing a contract that means losing a deposit if the builder has to pull the plug, and walking away. This is a big reason why preconstruction real estate is such a risky investment.
Look for an experienced, reputable builder. The chances of a seasoned company calling off a construction problem are much lower than with a hot startup.As an investor, look for a builder that will contract your house or buy your lot to construct a house to sell. Generally, the lot market price will increase as the supply of vacant lots increase.

, Some realtors specialize in preconstruction real estate. They will assist you in setting up appointments with builders. If you are savvy enough with navigating real estate listings and contracts, you may be able to do this on your own. However, this is a cost-cutting measure that may not pay off in the long run., The less you pay for the property, the more your profit margin will be once the construction is complete. The first phase of selling is the cheapest. The downside is that it is much more difficult to determine if the construction will be completed in a timely manner, if at all., Before investing in a property, you'll need to be sure that it can be used for your intended purpose. Ask the selling agent about zoning restrictions and land use laws for the property to make sure that they mesh with your plans. Contact the city or county government if the agent seems unsure about any aspects of the zoning laws. Even if a neighboring property has a certain kind or extent of construction on it, this does not necessarily mean that your land can be used for the same purpose, so always check zoning laws carefully before proceeding with your investment.


If you're purchasing raw land, have the land re-surveyed to be sure about where your property line is., Real estate agents are working with you to find the best property. However, they get paid off commission, whether they close tomorrow or a year from now. Make sure they aren’t sugar coating the truth about a supposedly up-and-coming area. Do some internet searching and ask local businesses if the area is growing.

, Your real estate agent will want to close a deal with you as quickly as possible. You may only get a few days to make your decision. However, make it clear to them that you want to have a couple preconstruction real estate properties to choose from when the day comes for you to decide. This gives you a chance to weigh up-front costs versus long-term returns.

, The first 3-6 months of the pre-selling phase of preconstruction consists of the reservation stage. When you sign up for the project of interest you will a receive contract from the developer. If you are working with a consultant firm they will coordinate the delivery of the necessary paperwork.

, As an investor, you're purchasing a property with the intention of eventually selling or renting that property to an end-user. To get the best return on investment, you'll need to identify your ideal end-user and then focus your property choices and selling efforts on that end-user. End-users might be other investors, renters, homebuyers, or vacation renters. Before investing, make sure that there is a sizable local market of end-users for your property. Then, look at the supply of similar properties. If there are too few end-users or too many properties like yours, it may be difficult to sell the property down the road., Financing for investment properties can vary based on developer preferences and the attributes of the property. However, the average deal starts with a down payment of 5 or 10 percent of the purchase price. The balance, or a large portion of it, is then due upon completion of the property. Some investors choose to flip these properties before the total amount is due, betting on the fact that the property's value will have appreciated significantly before this point. Others pay for and hold the property until a buyer can be found a the appropriate price.In either case, you will need money for the down payment. This is usually paid for with the investor's own money, as obtaining a loan for investment purposes can be difficult.
Purchasing raw land is slightly more expensive. For this type of transaction, you will typically need to be put about 25 percent down. Finding a lender may also be challenging. Try using a mortgage broker to locate an affordable land purchase loan., Work with the seller of the property to draft an agreement for the sale of the property. The agreement should include a timeline for building milestones with clauses that allow you to pull your investment or reduce the amount paid if these milestones are not met. This reduces your risk in the event that the property goes uncompleted or partially completed., You won’t have the option of selling your current home and moving into the new property yet. Unless your personal wealth is enough to cover the cost of the real estate, you will have to take out a loan. Though the cost of your current home will not be exactly the same as the new property, imagine doubling the amount you pay for housing each month.


If you do have enough money to cover the costs up front, think about the risk of losing your nest egg. Rainy day money is always good to have around, and you may think twice about risking it.
The good news is that you may have paid off the home loan for the new property by the time construction is completed. This means you will be the property owner with no payments or strings attached.

, Tell them you are considering investing in preconstruction real estate in the next few months. You will likely need a loan, but you don’t have the specific numbers yet. They will walk you through the home loan process and hopefully give you an idea, or even an estimate, of the interest rates you would qualify for. You will be able to consider loans from other financial institutions when you actually buy the property, but this will help you know what rates you can expect. It will also give you more precise estimate of the cost of this investment.

, If you are doing this merely as an investment, look at financial periodicals for up-and-coming housing markets. You want to get in on a property whose value will rise. If you are buying preconstruction real estate instead as a place you will one day live, this is completely up to you. Keep in mind, however, that the area will not be the same after the construction project is complete, which may take several years.


Beachfront properties are an alluring buy, but factor in the added environmental dangers that would require an expensive insurance policy.

, Depending on the project you decide to buy in on, this chapter of your life may last several years. Do you have the stability for that kind of undertaking? Are you thinking about making major changes to your life in the meantime, such as having kids? Smart investments may be a way to make future life changes easier on you, but remember that unexpected developments may make you regret this expenditure.


Unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do to speed up the project. You can't strap on a hard hat and operate one of the cranes. You will need to accept that you are at the mercy of the builder's pace.

, A good way to determine the value of a property after the construction is complete is asking about the building materials. Unless you're an architect or an experienced realtor, you may not be aware of the relative advantages of certain materials. Talk with your real estate agent or another realty investment consultant. A basic internet search may give you an idea of the value of the material, but you should do more exhaustive research.If you are buying the property to eventually live in, look at the materials of your current home. If you like the materials your current home is made of, look for similar materials in the new property.

, This is a stipulation in the contract that entitles you to seeing the property in person. You can specify that you want to look through it now, before you sign the initial contract, or before you sign the final sales papers when construction is complete. You will need to be escorted by the builder, and probably wear a hard hat.For initial walk-throughs, this is a good way to look for drawbacks you don’t notice over the phone or looking at a map, such as strange smells, poor soil, road noise, etc. There may be little or no fee for backing out at this point.
Final walk-throughs are a good way to spot construction flaws. Are the building materials actually what they described initially? Depending on the terms of your contract, you may have a bigger fee for backing out at this stage.

, The sales contract will be accompanied by a refundable deposit, usually 10% of the purchase price. The deposit is held in escrow with a selected title company and is fully refundable should you wish to cancel your reservation. The reservation stage of a project usually lasts until the project is at least 70% sold out.

, The reservation period can last anywhere from several days to 6 months. However, once the final contract is delivered, the buyer typically has 15 days to review the documents. At that point you can choose to commit to move forward or cancel. Have the experts make sure the contract is not exploitative in any way.

, After signing, you will be asked to provide roughly 20% of your purchase price or the balance of your earnest money. This balance should subtract your initial reservation deposit. It takes approximately 18-24 months after you submit your hard contract for construction and closing to be completed.

, At approximately 18-24 months after hard contract when the project is at or almost fully completed, you will be issued a Certificate of Occupancy (CO). At this point you are granted access to inspect your unit and create a list of any faults you find. If everything is satisfactory, you will go to closing. At closing you should have financial arrangements made regarding the balance of the unit or units. This is done by securing financing or having available cash or transferable assets.

This includes selecting and communicating with tenants, repairing the property when necessary, and dealing with a large variety of day-to-day issues. Make sure that you aren't already juggling too much with work and family before deciding to become a landlord.


If you don't have time to manage the property yourself, you will need to find a good property management company. However, this may be prohibitively expensive at first.;
, In order to rent out a property, you'll obviously have to purchase it first. This will be done with a buy to let mortgage, which is assessed differently than an owner occupied mortgage. The bank will consider the potential rental income and expenses of the property versus the owner's ability to pay for it. Use a mortgage calculator online to determine how much you can afford to spend on a rental property.If this is your first rental property, you may still need to meet the income requirement for a rental mortgage. This will be calculated in addition to your current mortgage. After a few years of proven rental success, the requirement may be waived., Owning a rental property can have unexpected problems. Your tenant can lose their job and not be able to pay the rent. You have to have enough money in the bank to get you through months without any money coming in. There are owners who are dependent on the rent to pay their mortgage. If you are in that situation then do not buy until you have a six month reserve built up.


Remember that you will also need to pay for property taxes and regular maintenance on the property.
Unexpected expenses can arise from anywhere. The cost of each can range from negligible to very expensive., Never buy real estate as an investment unless you have a 10 to 15 year horizon. Housing bubbles seem to come every 10 to 15 years and everyone wants a piece of the action. The great majority of people never get the chance to get out in time and get financially hurt. The wise investor is not swayed by greed and quick returns. They buy homes that make financial sense as a rental, not as a quick opportunity to make money., Investing with a partner or partners can provide a number of benefits. Partners can pool resources and talent between them, allowing for greater potential investment success. However, you will need to find partners that are fair and easy to work with. Ideally, you will find a partner with a skill set complementary to yours. For example, if you excel at home improvements and maintenance, try finding a partner who is skilled with crunching numbers.


Set up your partnership with an operating agreement that lays out responsibilities, contributions, and the division of returns.
Having a partner can give you the ability to more easily qualify for a mortgage., Look for a local rental market that is excellent with high demand for rental homes. The tenant pool should be made up of people who have made financial mistakes in the past and cannot qualify to buy. There may also be many people who have lost their homes in foreclosure. The market should have experienced an increase in prices over the past year.Ideally, you should invest somewhere close to home that you are already familiar with. Otherwise, you will need to do a lot of in-depth research., Even if you have the money, you shouldn't jump in to real estate investing with a larger or complex property. Large properties like shopping centers or condominiums may have more complicated requirements or need larger down payments. Instead, start with a single-family home that is well within your budget. This will allow you to become accustomed to being a landlord and the bookkeeping required of you. You can then move up when you become more experienced.Locate properties by searching online for listings at websites like Realtor.com, Redfin.com, Zillow.com, and Trulia.com.
You can also use a realtor who works with investors., Commercial properties offer larger potential returns than residential properties. However, finding and investing in them is significantly more difficult and should only be done by experienced real estate investors. To purchase commercial real estate, you will need to evaluate the property based on cost and potential returns from renters. You'll also usually need at least a 30 percent down payment to qualify for a loan.


If possible, look for motivated sellers (those who need to make a sale quickly for various reasons). This is your opportunity to purchase a property for a lower-than-market price., Your main focus should be on your potential return on the property, which is the rent you receive minus any expenses. This will depend on the prevailing rent in the area and the specific qualities of the home that might allow you to charge more or less rent. Ask the current owner of the property for financial information regarding the property, particularly if they have been renting it out. Assess the following:


The mortgage payment you will be paying.
The current rent, rent charged for similar properties in the area, and any historical rent increases.
The strength of the rental history. Does it stay empty for long when tenants move out?
Average expenses for the property.
The current owner's profits or losses over the past few years.
Your ability to earn a return based on this information. Remember: rent - expenses = your return.Maintenance expenses can be estimated at 5 percent of gross rental income. Down-time expenses and larger repairs account for another 5 percent., The location is perhaps the most important feature of a rental home for renters. A good location can also allow you to more easily fill the property and can justify higher rent rates. Better tenants will seek out these properties and provide you with more reliable rent payments and fewer difficulties. Specifically, look for properties that:


Are near good schools.
Are in low-crime areas.
Are convenient to shopping and amenities., Look for those properties that are at, or near the bottom, and especially at homes selling below what it would cost to build them. If prices are low and interest rates are too, that combination makes buying ideal and probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. Talk to local real estate agents and hire an appraiser to ascertain whether or not you are getting a good value.


Many rental property experts swear by the 1 percent rule. The rule is that the property's monthly rent should be at least equal to 1 percent of the property's value.
In the longer term, you should look for properties that you can pay for in full in 10 to 15 years, based on your rental earnings., Work with your realtor or the selling agent to put in an offer when you've found a good property. Have a number in mind and come in lower than your number if possible. Make sure not to let emotion cloud your judgment and only buy a property if the price is right. You can always walk away if you and the seller cannot come to a beneficial agreement., With your offer accepted, you now have until the closing date to make sure that there is nothing wrong with the house and to get your financing in order. Have a home inspector look for any issues with the property. If there are serious problems, you may be able to renegotiate the selling price. Make sure that the current owner didn't just put off certain repairs that you will have to do later., Before you rent your property out to tenants, it is advisable that you get landlord's insurance. All of the major insurance providers offer this type of coverage under different names, but generally separate coverage into three categories, from the minimal DP-1 to the all-inclusive DP-3 (DP stands for ""dwelling policy""). Most insurance professional recommend that landlords get DP-3 coverage to protect themselves from unexpected tenant behavior.


This type of coverage generally provides replacement costs for losses, rather than cash value, which can be beneficial in the event of expensive damages.
You should make sure that your coverage also includes general liability coverage. This provides coverage for any injuries sustained on your property. Experts advise that you get $1 million in liability coverage.
The cost of landlord's policies depend on the location and size of the property. However, the average is about $800 to $1,200 per year., Talk with local real estate agents and research similar properties online in order to determine a reasonable rent amount. Make sure that, at minimum, your rent covers 110 percent of your mortgage payment on the property. The ten percent buffer can be used to cover maintenance, down time, and large repairs. Any amount you earn over that is profit., Start by listing your property on websites like Craigslist, Trulia, and Zillow. Make sure to include plenty of high-quality and well-lit pictures. Fill out the listing will as much information as you can. You can also purchase an advertisement in the newspaper, though this is expensive and may be ineffective. Finally, try placing a ""for rent"" sign in the front yard of the property. In all cases, provide a way for interested renters to contact you, either by phone or email., You will have to screen your potential tenants thoroughly for credit and criminal issues. It will cost you some money but will save you from potentially devastating losses. There are rental owners who don't do their due diligence and end up with scam artists who stop paying as soon as they have possession and do tremendous damage to the home. A bad tenant can end up costing you thousands in repairs, even if they do pay their rent on time.


Look for applicants who are employed and make at least three times as much as the monthly rent.
Reject any applicants with lengthy criminal records or those with credit scores under 650. Your specific requirements here depend on your risk tolerance and the strength of the market.Keep good tenants if you can by promising to keep rent steady or simply by providing excellent service., Find a rental agreement template online and use that to create your own with all of the relevant property details. You may also consider hiring a lawyer who has experience in the industry to make sure that your rental agreement doesn't leave anything out or include any strange provisions. The rental agreement should specify the rental period, the responsibilities of both you and the renters, and the security deposit. The security deposit is usually one month's rent, but may be subject to state or local limits., Every landlord will have to act as bill collector at some point. You'll have to call and stay on top of non-paying tenants until they pay, and evict them if they don't. Even good tenants may have trouble paying rent on time one month. In this case, consider giving them more time. Keeping a good tenant can be worth one or two late payments., As a landlord, you will be required to pay property taxes on your properties. However, you will also be required to keep up with properly filing income taxes on your returns or losses from the property. It is advisable to hire a tax preparer or another financial professional to help guide you through this process as it can be rather complicated.


For example, landlords can deduct property taxes and mortgage interest, as well as other operating expenses, from their tax burden.
In addition, losses can be written off as passive losses and later used to offset the tax burden resulting from positive returns., Make sure that you are comfortable performing minor repairs like fixing a leaking sink or repairing a hole in the wall. Being able to do these tasks yourself can save you a fortune on professional repairs. If you don't already have these skills, take the time to figure out how these repairs are done and get some practice in. Anything you can do yourself represents money you don't have to spend., Despite the value is doing things yourself, they are some circumstances in which you will need to hire a professional. Develop relationships with local electricians, plumbers, and other tradesmen so that you can get dependable work when you need it. In addition, you'll likely need to consult with a lawyer and an accountant at some point in your rental property investment. Having these people in your corner can be useful when issues arise., Remember that tenants are your customers and should be treated with respect. Respond quickly to repair requests and act fairly in your dealings with tenants. Maintain the property as agreed upon in the lease contract. Doing so will help you keep tenants, which will save you from expensive vacancies., A property manager or property management company can relieve the burden of your landlord duties. They collect rent, take care of maintenance, and find new tenants when needed, among other duties. However, hiring a property manager will generally cost you 5 to 10 percent of your rent revenue. So, if your profit margins are already thin, it may not make financial sense for you to hire one.


Hiring a property manager can be especially beneficial if you own a lot of rental properties or live far away from them.
The Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) and the National Association of Residential Property Managers (NARPM) both offer resources for finding reputable property management companies on their respective websites."

Learn how a letter of intent (LOI) can benefit you.,
Differentiate an LOI from a contingent offer.,
Address your letter to the seller.,
Indicate that you are interested in buying the house.,
List the price you would be willing to offer in the second sentence.,
Propose a deposit if applicable.,
Outline the finance period.,
Suggest a “due diligence” period.,
Close with a paragraph indicating that the letter of interest is not legally binding.,
Sign and date the letter.",How to Write a Letter of Interest for a House2," A letter of intent is completely different from a letter of interest. However, the two are sometimes confused. While letters of interest attempt to set you apart from other buyers in the market, you can think of a letter of intent more like a pre-contract on the house. It sets a basis for the details of the transaction around the house and acts as a starting point for negotiations. This allows the buyer and seller to make sets of offers and counteroffers before committing to a final contract.One of the most important aspects of an LOI is that it isn’t binding, meaning either party can walk away at any point in the process.Like letters of interests, letters of intent aren’t common when realtors are involved in the process. Realtors usually hash out the details on behalf of their clients with the implicit knowledge that nothing is binding until a final contract is agreed to and signed.

, You should also be aware of contingent offers and how they differ from LOIs. A contingent offers constitutes a very real offer on the house, but one for which contingencies must be met by the seller.If the seller accepts the contingent offer, he or she will have the specified amount of time to complete the work, inspection, or other contingent action before finalizing the house’s sale.You can include contingent items in your letter of intent, but the scope of an LOI is larger and less official than an actual contingent offer. You shouldn’t make any offer on the home—contingent or otherwise—until both parties have agreed upon all of the specifics of an LOI.

, Use the seller’s full personal or company name, main address, and contact information, and date the letter.

, Include the property address and any details about what will be included in the purchase, including furnishings, land, or other items.


Formal language is most common. You can write, ""This letter describes the intent of (your name) to purchase the real estate located at (location) owned by (seller's name)."" Ensure that the name and address of each party, as well as that of the property, are included.You may choose to begin this sentence in a semi-formal manner, such as, ""I, (your name name), am writing this letter to declare my interest to buy..""

, Use a phrase such as ""The proposed purchase price is...,"" or, ""The purchase price proposed is,"" or similar wording.Remember that as a basis for negotiation, the seller can choose to counter at a higher percentage of the full asking price than what you offer here.The offer should also indicate that the purchase price will be paid to the seller at the closing of the deal, when a binding Purchase Agreement is signed.If you are proposing to rent or lease, indicate whether you are proposing a weekly, monthly, yearly, or multi-year rent, and in what installments the rent will be made (e.g., every month, every year, etc.). Also include any pro-rated portions of rent if the home is to be inhabited in the middle of a month.

, To show that you’re serious about the intent to purchase the house (contingent upon good faith negotiations), you can choose to offer a deposit in your LOI. Rather than actually exchanging hands, this deposit is typically held in escrow for the duration of negotiations. Ensure that you clearly spell out the term under which the deposit will be returned to you, such as by a certain date or if no agreement on the house can be reached.


This amount may be approximately one to three percent of the purchase price. When a final agreement is signed, the money typically goes toward the down payment., Indicate the expected period of time you will require to secure the necessary funds. While you do not have to include any specific banking information, you should include the soonest you can expect to secure financing, as well as the soonest date you might be willing to close on the sale.


You can include other dates in this section, such as a date on which the negotiations automatically void. This can help push a buyer into making a decision more quickly if you place an expiration date in the LOI.
If you are represented by a broker, you can also clarify how the broker's fees will be paid., If you would like to take additional time to inspect the home, review property tax records, examine building permits, or anything else, you can also suggest a period for you to perform your due diligence on the house.Use this period to discover anything about the house on which your eventual offer might be contingent.


Be specific about the nature of your inspection: an independent tour, for example, or investigation of tax or other records.
You may also specify what types of information or disclosures you will require during an inspection., Make sure this clause is carefully worded and explicitly clarifies that neither party is legally bound to the letter of intent.Make sure there is a clause that states explicitly that ""this letter does not bind the buyer or seller to any offer, financial or otherwise,"" or use similar wording that clearly communicates that neither the buyer nor seller is legally bound to the letter of intent and may walk away at any time.A seller who is both a novice to the selling process and working without a realtor can interpret such as clause as a lack of seriousness about the property, but you don’t want to risk leaving the letter of intent otherwise worded in such a way that a court could find a legal, enforceable document.

, Use a formal sign-off, such as ""Sincerely,"" or similar wording. The letter should also include phrasing such as ""Agreed to and Accepted by,"" or similar wording, followed by the signatures of both the buyer and seller."

Contact your lender.,
Get all promises or agreements in writing.,
See if your lender will accept a reduced or late payment.,
Request a loan modification.,
Refinance your home.",How to Avoid Foreclosure2," Before you've fallen too far behind on your payments, your lender will probably be willing to work out some kind of plan with you. Once you do this there are a number of options.


Be persistent when contacting your lender. It may take some time to get the right department or person on the phone, but you need to stick with it to avoid foreclosure., Whatever you end up working out with your lender, never trust someone's verbal promise. Insist on having all agreements and details in writing. Notarize these documents to make them more legally binding., If you're afraid you won't be able to make a payment, don't let the deadline pass. Contact your lender and see if you can either pay a smaller amount by the deadline or defer the full payment to a later date.


Be sure to mention why you will be unable to make your payment. If you've experienced a pay cut or an unexpected expense, your lender may be more willing to work out a plan for you.Also say if you're expecting to receive money in the near future, like a bonus or raise. This will demonstrate to the lender that you'll be able to make the payment at a later date., Sometimes missing a payment is a one-time occurrence due to unexpected expenses. If your problems are more permanent and you will have trouble making payments in the future, however, you should see if your lender can adjust your loan. Most often this involves stretching out the loan over a longer period and lowering the monthly payments. This can make your monthly payments more affordable. This plan is helpful if you've faced a pay cut or recently lost your job., You may be having difficulty making your payments because you're paying more than your home is worth. If this is the case, you can talk with your lender about refinancing your home and obtaining a new loan. This could make your payments more affordable."
"
Obtain a partial claim.,
Seek government assistance.,
File for bankruptcy.,
Sell your home.,
Hand the deed back to your lender.",How to Avoid Foreclosure3," If you've missed a few payments, your lender may be able to work out a loan from the Federal Housing Administration. You can usually qualify if your payment is late by at least four months but less than twelve months. If you obtain a partial loan, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development will make a payment to your lender and make your loan current. These loans are typically interest-free., Several programs administered by the US Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are designed to help homeowners facing foreclosure. These programs can help you with refinancing, modifying your loans, and obtaining financial aid to avoid foreclosure.A list of government programs designed to help homeowners facing foreclosure is available here.


There are also companies that provide similar services for people facing foreclosure. Be sure to investigate counseling agencies or anyone offering you help with your foreclosure. You can call the Department of Housing and Urban Development at 1-800-569-4287 to see if a company has been federally approved to provide this service.You can also contact your state Attorney General, the State Real Estate Commission, or your local Consumer Fraud Unit to see if these people have had any complaints or legal action against them., While this may be an unappealing option, filing for bankruptcy can help save your home. Bankruptcy delays the process of foreclosure. This can help get you the time you need to pay off the loan or work out an arrangement with your lender.Remember that filing for bankruptcy won't protect you indefinitely. While bankruptcy usually stops the foreclosure process until your bankruptcy case closes, your lender can get court permission to reopen the case.

, If no other steps help, it's possible that you simply can't afford your home. In this case, you can sell your home before the lender begins foreclosure motions. You can use the earnings from selling the home to cover the rest of your mortgage. While this method won't keep you in your home, selling the property is far less damaging to your credit score and finances than facing foreclosure.Stay in contact with your lender during this process. You may be allowed to stop making payments while trying to sell your house. Your lender is more likely to accept this if you can demonstrate that your family has experienced some kind of hardship like an illness or job loss.
If the house sale won't cover the mortgage, ask your lender about a short sale. This means that your lender will accept the proceeds from the house, even if they are less than you owe. It is best to contact a real estate agent or attorney when proceeding with a short sale. Sometimes lenders will still come after you for the remainder of the loan if you don't specify that the short sale will cancel your debt., If you cannot find a buyer for your home within a given period- usually a few months- you can return the deed to the lender. This is essentially the same as a foreclosure, since the lender takes possession of the house and resells it. However, if you voluntarily hand the deed back, the lender won't file this as a foreclosure. This will save your credit rating and make it easier for you to get back on your feet afterwards."

Set a budget.,
Pay in cash.,
Buy a house in foreclosure.,
Buy a short sale or a real estate owned (REO) property.,
Target homes that no one seems to want.,
Consider new construction.",How to Purchase Homes at Discount Prices," Determine how much you are willing to spend, and how much of a discount is acceptable. For example, decide if a 20 percent discount off the list price is a victory, or whether you will max out at a $100,000 price.;
, Avoiding a mortgage will allow you to save a fortune when buying a house. In 2011, the National Association of Realtors reported that 30 percent of homebuyers were paying in cash to save money and avoid years of interest payments.


Calculate your savings to understand the discount you are actually getting. You will be giving up an annual deduction on mortgage interest, but if you are paying 4 to 6 percent interest on a loan of several thousand dollars over a 30 year period, you will end up spending more in interest than on your house.
Get a discount off the purchase price and closing costs. Negotiate a lower price in exchange for paying in cash and save on all the closing fees that mortgage lenders insist on, such as attorneys, title insurance, application fees and loan origination costs.

, On average, houses in foreclosure sell for about 28 percent less than houses that are not in foreclosure. The bank holding the mortgage often auctions a foreclosed home.


Attend the auction. Often, it is literally held on the courthouse steps. Sometimes, the auction is held at the property itself. Bring at least 5 to 10 percent of a down payment with you and be prepared to finance the rest of the house. Bid on the foreclosed home. If you have the highest bid, the home is yours.
Be aware that some banks put a minimum on the foreclosed homes that they auction, which is usually the amount that is owed on the loan. Your bid will have to be the minimum.
Prepare to bid on the house sight unseen. Some states will hold an open house before the auction, other states do not mandate this. You will get a foreclosed home for a discount, but you will not be able to negotiate any changes or repairs.

, These are homes that have not yet gone into foreclosure. You will be able to negotiate a price with the bank.


Make an offer. The bank might consider accepting a lower price for the home if the amount covers the remaining mortgage balance. Work with an agent or broker who specializes in short sales and REO homes. They will often know what the banks are looking for.
Stipulate that your offer is contingent upon appraisals, inspections and title searches. This is a benefit of buying a home before it reaches foreclosure. You get a discount as well as extra insurance as a buyer.

, If you want to buy a home at a deep discount, look at properties that have been on the market for a long time. The owner will be more likely to negotiate just to sell the house.


Look for homes that have been on the market for 6 months or more. Most sellers will grow impatient if the property does not sell after 6 months. Consider properties that need some work in order to negotiate further reductions in price.

, Housing developments started popping up during the real estate boom, and then when the market collapsed, they stopped selling. This has resulted in a flooded new construction market.


Talk to builders about what they are willing to sell their current properties for. In a development with more vacant homes than occupied properties, you should be able to negotiate a deep discount.
Look for creative opportunities for discounts. For example, if you can only get a builder to go so low on his price, ask for free upgrades in the unit such as finished basements, stainless steel appliances or no closing costs.

Decide if you need a land survey.,
Go over the components of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS).,
Review your map’s scale and the legend provided.,
Read the principal meridians and base lines.,
Use notations to find the township.,
Find the section.",How to Read a Land Survey," A land survey can be expensive. You need an experienced surveyor to complete the work. Make sure you’re clear about the need for a survey.A land survey is a certification of a piece of land’s exact location. The survey identifies the boundaries of the property.
If you’re buying or selling property, you need a land survey. The survey identifies the exact boundaries of the property in the transaction. Generally a title report will show a preliminary plat map with the lot on it if it is contained within a subdivision. This will show the boundaries of the lot. If the property is not located within a subdivision there may or may not be a survey on record and a title search report may be able to show this or you can check with the county, but not every survey is recorded. It is a good idea to record any survey made for future reference in case the report is lost or damaged.
A survey is also helpful if you’re building a fence near the edge of your property. If you’re involved in a property dispute with a neighbor, a survey can help you identify accurate property lines.
Keep in mind that when an investor gets title insurance for a property, they are not protected if there are boundary disputes with a standard policy. The only way to be protected over property boundary disputes is to purchase an extended title insurance policy and get a land survey. A land survey is required to get extended coverage, but it is not required to get standard title insurance that does not protect against boundary issues and disputes. For example, a garage was partially built over the property line. Had a survey been completed, the location of the property line would have been known, but without a survey it is not always possible to know these things.;
, The PLSS is a grid system used by land surveyors to provide an exact location of a piece of property. If you understand the grid system, you’ll know where your land is located.The grid was created using two sets of lines. The principal meridian is a set of north and south lines. East and west lines are called baselines. Your property will have a specific location based on the number and position of these lines.
The grid is segregated into squares that are 24 miles on each side. A square is then subdivided into townships. A township is 6 miles on each side.
Once the grid is separated into townships, it can be further divided into sections that are one square mile. The square mile sections are divided into quarters. If needed, the grid system can use grids that are smaller than one quarter.

, Your survey will display information based on a scale. A survey’s legend is typically presented on the right hand side of the survey, or along the bottom of the document.A map’s scale connects the distances listed on a map to their actual size. For example, your survey may state that every inch on the survey equals 20 yards. You need to understand this relationship to confirm the size of your property.
A legend is a listing of the symbols on the survey and what they mean. For example, a small circle on the survey might refer to a manhole cover.
The Bureau of Land Management has a standard set of symbols that are used on surveys. Your survey, however, may include additional symbols, or symbols that are defined differently.

, A PLSS map of the United States will show a grid of these intersecting lines. Though not exact lines of longitude and latitude, the system is based off thirty-seven north-south lines of principal meridian and their perpendicular east-west base lines.Longitude and latitude are precise measurements used for navigation. Land surveys use a different system to determine the location of land.The lines of principal meridian were often chosen arbitrarily rather than at equal intervals. When the system was created, it was not possible to coordinate all of the distances precisely.
Keep in mind that the distance between one pair of lines may be different than another pair. This impacts the location of your property., Based on the starting point of the survey, you can find a specific township based on the notation provided. You’ll need to understand the numbers and letters that indicate the position of a township.The notation will look like this: T32N, R18E. This notation refers to the 32nd township (T32) north of the starting point and the 18th range (R18) east of the starting point.
Range simply means a vertical column of townships.To find the correct township, you simply count the rows up and columns over from the starting point., Each township is divided into thirty-six equal sections, each comprising one square mile or 640 acres. Each section of the township is numbered starting in the top right corner going right to left before dropping to the next row down and going left to right—then right to left again in the third row, etc.The numbering system can be confusing. To understand it, consider that the right-most column of sections in a township numbered in descending order would be: 1, 12, 13, 24, 25, and 36.
Locate the quarter section. To further subdivide parcels of land, each one square mile section is divided into quarter section.
Find the quarter-quarter section. To subdivide the spaces even further, each quarter section can similarly be divided into quarter-quarter sections.
To understand why you might need these details, assume that you are considering buying land in another state. You’re not familiar with the region. To educate yourself, you first use the PLSS map to pin down the precise location of the land. Once you know the exact location, you decide to visit the property. You then use the scale and legend details to inspect the land in person.

Figure out how much you will need to borrow.,
Get organized.,
Begin shopping around for estimates.You will use the Good Faith Estimate when you are researching companies.,
Keep track of your quotes.,
Choose the title insurance company you want to use.Price is important but so is comfort and peace of mind.,
Watch for extra fees and double charges.,
Pay attention to fees that show up on one estimate, but not on other estimates.,
Be wary of significantly higher or lower estimates.If you receive a quote that has a third-party charge that is much higher or lower than the average charge, you should definitely inquire about it with the company.,
Avoid no closing cost schemes.,
Recognize what is negotiable.,
Look for closing cost discounts.,
Ask the seller to help pay part or all of the closing costs.",How to Save on Closing Costs," In order to do this, you will need to know how much the home costs. If you are refinancing, you will need to know the amount you are refinancing. You should ask for a Good Faith Estimate from your lender, which you can then use to begin shopping around.You might also try using a New House Calculator, which many banks offer online. This calculator allows you to enter all of your income and information on debt and bill payments in order to help you figure out how much money you are eligible to borrow., You should have all of your important documents related to buying the home in your possession. These documents might include:W-2 or 1099 forms for the last two years
Your most recent paycheck stub
Your last two tax returns
Information on assets including bank statements, mutual fund statements, automobile titles, records of investments, real estate titles, and brokerage statements
A complete list of debts including credit card debt, student loans, car loans, and child support payments
Documentation of credit and equity on hand

, Search Google for title insurance and closing costs. Get as many quotes from local lenders as you can.While the Good Faith Estimate will account for things like home inspections, surveys, and title insurance, you can often find these things cheaper by using a third-party service.The prices of these quotes can very greatly, so you need to make sure you are getting quotes for everything.
Some companies will give you a limited quote that ends up being more when you close.Try to verify that the quote they are giving you is what you will pay at closing. If they refuse to verify the quote, you should probably cross them off your list of potential lenders.

, Use an excel spreadsheet to keep track of the companies you have contacted and the amount that each company has quoted you. It would be best to get a minimum of 5 quotes so you have a solid data set to compare. Study each quote carefully. Make sure you read each item, and that you understand what every fee covers.You will want to make sure that you being overcharged or charged twice for the same thing.If you simply glance over the quote, you might miss an error.

, If you feel more comfortable with a company that charges a few dollars more than other companies, you may want to choose that company. Remember that you do not have to choose the settlement company that your real estate agent recommends.It's your right to choose who you use for title and closing.

, Sometimes lenders who are not reputable will pad your loan estimate to make more money off of you.This is where really studying your estimate is a good idea. Also, you should be on the look out for fees that have similar names, which might be an example of the company trying to double charge you for the same thing.If you see a fee that you don’t understand or which looks like a double charge, be sure to ask the company to explain it to you.


An example of a company trying to double charge you might come in the form of a “processing fee” and an “underwriting fee” existing on the same estimate. Essentially, they are fees for the exact same thing.

, Sometimes sneaky lenders will try to add an unnecessary fee to up their profit.This is why collecting multiple quotes is a good idea. You can compare the quotes with each other fee by fee. This not only helps you find the best rates, but it will also call attention to any bogus fees that a lender might have included in the quote.


Examples of junk fees include “warehousing fees,” “processing fees,” and “underwriting fees.”

, Be sure that you are satisfied with their answer before you choose to use them as your lender or title insurance provider.

, No closing cost mortgage seem like a great way to save money but in most cases the closing costs are simply added to the loan by increases to your interest rate.This means that you’re paying more for the closing costs in the long run because you’re paying interest on the loan that is covering them. This also means that your house will end up costing you more because of the higher interest rates.

, Title insurance and other title related costs make up about 70% of the total closing costs.Many first time homebuyers are unaware that they are able to negotiate these costs by allowing them to choose their title service provider, rather than simply taking the one that their realtor recommends.Different title service providers offer vastly different title insurance premiums and service fees, so it’s always a good idea to shop around and look for the best offer.

, The reissue rate discount can save you as much as 40% on your closing costs.The reissue rate allows you to save money on your title insurance costs when you are refinancing your home or when you are purchasing the house from a seller who purchased the house and insurance rate within the last decade.In order to use the reissue rate discount you will need to get a copy of the seller’s insurance policy., Negotiating the payment of the closing costs between the buyer and seller is an important part of the overall sale.This could save you thousands of dollars, if you can get the seller to agree to pay part or all of the closing costs. Be aware that your lender may have limits on the amount of money that the seller can contribute toward the cost of closing.For example, if you want the seller to pay all of your closing costs, you tell your realtor: “I’m ready to make an offer, but I want the seller to pay all of the closing costs.” Your realtor will likely inform you that the best way to do this is to offer to pay the full asking price and be upfront about your desire to have the seller pay all closing costs.Many sellers will be amenable to this arrangement.
If you only need some of your closing costs covered by the seller, you might tell the seller, “I have $5,000 of the $10,000 closing costs for this sale. I would like you to cover the other $5,000. In exchange for your help, I am willing to offer a quick closing and I am willing to accept the house ‘as-is.’”"

Walk the grounds.,
Look over the exterior of the house.,
Do a complete walkthrough of the interior.,
Go up in the attic.,
Listen to the water heater.,
Check the foundation for cracks.,
Examine the wiring.",How to Perform a House Inspection1," You can learn a lot about the condition of a house by walking around the land surrounding it. Check the quality of the lot and driveway as well as the condition of any exterior structures, such as a freestanding garage or storage unit.Try to come look at the house when it's raining. You can observe the lot's drainage and make sure water is flowing away from the house.
Be on the lookout for any standing water or debris. If there are any large trees near the house, they shouldn't have branches hanging over the house that could damage the roof.;
, You want to inspect the structure of the house both outside and inside. The sides of the house and the roof should be straight. Make sure nothing is bowed or sagging, and that the siding or paint is in good condition.Check any visible foundation and make sure there aren't any exterior cracks. If the house has siding, look for dents or damage.
Look at the roof from the ground. Take note of any missing or damaged shingles. Make sure the gutters are clean and in good repair.
Take note of anything you see so you can discuss it with the seller before you put in an offer on the home.

, Your personal inspection of the interior can give you a good idea of whether you want to place an offer on the home. Look at the condition of the flooring and walls and make note of any damages.If the house is dirty or contains old property from the sellers, and is not being sold ""as is,"" you may want to ask the sellers to clean it up first.
Some interior damages won't affect the selling price of the home, because they're simply considered part of moving into a new home. For example, you won't get very far demanding that the house be repainted, since most people repaint the interior of a home when they move in.
Make note of any damaged cabinetry, flooring, or other surfaces in the house, as well as any places where the floor creaks or appears uneven.

, In the attic of the home, look closely at the insulation and at the condition of the rafters. If you see long, pencil-like protrusions from the rafters, they may be signs of a termite infestation.You also want to make sure there aren't a lot of extra holes in the rafters, and that the boards all appear solid and even. There shouldn't be any signs of rot.
You don't have to have a lot of experience with home repair to recognize a potential problem. If something doesn't look right, make a note of it.

, A water heater that is gurgling or banging may need to be cleaned or need more extensive repairs. If you hear any irregular sounds coming from the water heater, ask the seller about it.Also check the area around the water heater. Make sure the exterior of the unit is solid and there isn't any water or sediment around the unit itself. A sagging floor around or under the water heater may indicate previous flooding.

, Depending on the age of the house, hairline cracks in the foundation typically aren't anything to worry about. However, wider cracks may be an indication of significant structural problems with the house.If you see larger cracks, ask the sellers about them. Try to find out how long the crack has been there and whether it has grown over time.

, At the electrical box, you want to be on the lookout for any spliced wires hanging outside the box, or any evidence of sloppy electrical work. Sloppy wires at the box typically are a good indication that there may be problems elsewhere.Find out from the seller when the last electrical repairs were made, and who did the work. If it was done by someone unlicensed or inexperienced, you may have a more significant electrical problem on your hands.

Ask the seller for disclosures.,
Talk to your real estate agent.,
Check the inspector's credentials.,
Attend the inspection.,
Line up additional inspections.",How to Perform a House Inspection2," Before you hire a professional home inspector, find out if the sellers have any disclosures they wish to make regarding the condition of the property. You can provide this information to your inspector.In some areas, sellers are required by law to disclose certain types of defects, such as termite problems.
Even if the seller doesn't have any disclosures, you still need to hire an inspector before buying the house. Sometimes sellers may not be aware of certain issues with the property, or may have been living with the problem for so long they don't even think about it.

, Typically, your real estate agent will have particular inspectors they use on a regular basis to conduct home inspections on behalf of their clients. They'll also know the reputations of local inspectors.If you noticed any potential problems in your personal walkthrough of the property, bring these up to your real estate agent before you place an offer on the house.
Your mortgage broker also may have a particular inspector they want to use. If that's the case, they'll usually let you know in advance.
Typically the buyer foots the bill for the inspection. Your real estate agent can give you a good idea of what to expect from the inspection and how much it will cost you.

, Before you hire an inspector, you need to make sure that their license is up to date and that they have experience inspecting homes such as the one you plan to purchase.Find out how long the inspector has been doing residential home inspections, and how many they've done. You also may want to find out if those houses are similar in size and location to yours.
Ask the inspector how long they expect the inspection to take, and what parts of the house will be covered. If there's anything that you want inspected that won't be covered, you may need to hire a different inspector to go over that part of the house.

, Schedule the inspection at a time you'll be available and make arrangements to be there. The sellers may want to be there as well. Walk through the house with the inspector and have them explain what they see.The inspector likely will notice things that you didn't realize were signs of a problem when you walked through the house on your own.
If the inspector points out anything that you don't understand, ask them to explain the damage and what would need to be done to repair it.

, A general licensed inspector doesn't always go into detail regarding specific systems or issues. If potential problems are found, you may need to have a specialist come in and assess that damage.For example, if the home has a septic system, you may want to arrange to have that system inspected separately by a septic system expert.
Most general home inspections don't inspect in-depth for termites. If your general inspector noticed termite damage, you should call in an expert on wood-destroying insects.
Licensed inspectors also may not look at certain parts of the property, such as separate buildings or pools.
Additionally, general inspectors only look at what is visible. Any evidence of visible damage could indicate a more significant problem inside the walls or underground.

Ask the seller for a credit for repairs.,
Avoid sharing your own thoughts.",How to Perform a House Inspection3," Once your inspector has finished going through the house, they'll produce a written report of their findings. Have the inspector talk about the report with you and explain each of the items they've listed.Seldom will a home inspection come out completely clean with no damages or potential problems at all. Talk with the home inspector about prioritizing any problems that have been found.

, In the worst case scenario, the inspector uncovers a significant problem that directly impacts your ability to move into the house after buying it.This is more likely to be the case if you're buying a home that has been unoccupied for a significant period of time, or if you're buying a foreclosed or abandoned house.
Even if the house is being sold ""as is,"" you still may be able to get a credit for some major structural repairs, such as to the foundation.

, Even if your home inspector provided a cost estimate in the inspection report, you still may want to get your own. An estimate from a specialist may differ greatly from what the inspector told you.Having more than one estimate also gives you a range of prices, so you can bargain with the seller better.
If your budget is tight, look for licensed repairmen and general contractors who are willing to provide a free estimate.

, If there are repairs that must be made before you move into the house, you can either ask the seller to complete those repairs or deduct the cost of repairs from the price of the house.Typically the seller has already seen the inspection report, so they'll have an expectation of what you might ask.
Start with your lowest offer – usually that the seller pays for all repairs listed in the report, no matter how minor. The seller then gives you a counter-offer. Go back and forth from there until you come to an agreement.

, When you're negotiating to get the seller to pay for repairs, you don't necessarily want them to know what your plans are for the property. How you feel about something could affect the amount the seller is willing to pay.For example, suppose the inspection revealed there are repairs that need to be made to the heating and air-conditioning system in the home. However, you plan on replacing that system with a more energy efficient model. Revealing to the seller that you plan on replacing the system anyway is a sure way to ensure they won't pay for even a portion of the repairs to the old system.

Obtain a Certificate of Eligibility.,
Talk to an approved VA mortgage lender.,
Find a real estate agent.,
Look at VA foreclosure properties.,
Determine if the VA loan will cover the cost of the house.,
Have the home appraised.",How to Purchase a Foreclosed Home With a VA Home Loan," The VA provides a specific eligibility document to veterans who may apply for a VA loan. Complete Form 26-1880 and send it to the VA at the address provided. You will not be able to apply for a mortgage under the VA loan program without this Certificate of Eligibility.;
, Even with VA loan eligibility, you will still need to meet acceptable income and credit standards. Fill out the application forms provided by the lender. You will be approved for a specific dollar amount. If your loan application is declined, the lender will tell you why.

, Use a local agent or broker in your area who has a good reputation. Make sure the agent understands you are looking for VA foreclosure homes. Share all the information you can with your agent, including features you would like in a home, the budget you can afford, and the areas you would like to live near.

, The Multi Listing System (MLS), used by real estate agents and brokers, has VA foreclosure homes listed in your area. You can also check out the website of the property management company that market the properties. Ocwen Federal Bank is the name of the company (see resources for website).

, The basic veteran's entitlement is $36,000. Lenders will multiply that amount by 4, to come up with a maximum loan amount of $144,000. This is the amount you may borrow without a down payment. If the home you want to buy costs more than $144,000, you may qualify for an additional entitlement of up to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit. That loan limit changes annually, so check with your lender on how much extra money you may be able to borrow.

, The VA will require an appraisal of the home you intend to buy. This is not an inspection, rather a determination of the property's value. You will be expected to pay for this appraisal.

Do you have accessibility needs? Determine how much these features might cost. Record your savings goals as well. Try to put 15-20% of your paycheck in your savings account when you receive it. If you cannot afford that, try to find an amount that works for you, no matter how small.Once you determine how much money you can spare a month, set that amount as your monthly savings goal.;
, In a financial planner or journal, write down everything you buy. Keep track of your bills, utilities, and rent. Try to find out how much you are spending each month on food, alcohol, and entertainment. This will make you aware of how much extra money you’re spending. Try to find ways to cut back, such as:


Fixing your appliances instead of buying new
Drinking one or two beers instead of three or four at the bar.
Carpooling to work

, Housing costs should account for 25% of your paycheck. You will need to pay a down payment, and instead of rent, you'll be paying a mortgage every month. To calculate what your can afford, write down your monthly earnings and your monthly spending (rent, utilities, etc.). Use an online calculator to find a rough estimate of what you can afford to pay.Mortgage rates generally range from 5 to 7% so plug in different numbers to see what range of houses you afford.


For example, a $225,000 home on a 30 year mortgage with 7% interest rates will cost roughly $1496 a month.This can vary, however based on your credit score and initial down payment.
Most banks will require a 15-20% down payment. Some government programs, however, offer down payments between 5-10%., Make a table with two columns. In the first column, write down how much you expect to spend during the next month on things such as food, drinks, clothing, entertainment, and gas. As you buy things, record in the second column how much you spent. Try to identify where you are spending more money than you would like.Make sure that you revisit your budget monthly so that you know if you are hitting your goals or if you need to adjust your spending.For example, if you decide to only spend $50 a month on gas, you might find out that you have spent $75 instead. This means that you are $25 over budget. The next month, you should drive less. Consider carpooling, biking, or taking the bus to reduce gas costs.
If you are spending too much in one area, cut back in another. For example, if you are spending too much money on food, cut back on the money you use on entertainment.
Factor your spending goals into your budget. Are you putting away as much as you would like each month?

, There are many loans and programs offered by the federal and state government to help people buy their first home. If you qualify for these, they may be a good option for you as they offer low down payments and competitive interest rates. These include:


Government-Owned Enterprises (GSE) such as The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Home Loan Bank SystemThe Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentVeteran Administration LoansThe Office of Native American Programs (ONAP)The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)Disability programs such as Maryland’s Homeownership for Individuals with Disabilities Programand Connecticut's Home of Your Own Program., Even if you are not ready to buy a house, you can sit down with a broker at your local bank for a consultation. A broker will be able to tell how much money you should save for a down payment and what interest rates you may be able to receive based on your credit. You should ask:


""What kind of interest rates can I expect with my current credit score?""
""How much are closing costs?""
""How big of a down payment will I need to pay?""
""What other fees are there?"", Good credit will give you a better mortgage with a lower down payment and lower interest rates. This means that you have to save less, and you will have to pay less overall. You want to aim to have a credit score of at least 580.If you don’t earn much, it can be tempting to put everything on your credit card, but try to only buy what you can afford to pay for at the end of the month.


Set up payment reminders
Pay all bills on time
Pay more than the minimum of your credit card payment each month
Use your credit card only for small purchases. Pay these off in full at the end of the month., You do not need to buy a new home that has just been constructed. There are may lower cost options available for buying homes, but you should be aware of both their benefits and their costs.


Find a “fixer upper.” You may find a house that you can renovate cheaply yourself. You can add better lighting or an updated kitchen and bathroom. These features will cost you in the long run, although they may be cheaper than buying a house that comes with them.
Consider buying a foreclosed house. You should be careful as you may be responsible for any unpaid debts on the property. Foreclosed houses also tend to have structural issues that you will need to fix.Buy a multi-unit building, such as conjoined town houses. Live in one side, and rent out the other to cover your mortgage payments. Remember that you will have to pay taxes on the income you earn from renters.

, The advertised price for a house is not a final number. When you make an offer on a house, you may be able to get away with a lower price. Don't be afraid to negotiate with the broker or owners. While there is a chance someone will outbid you, you may be able to get away with paying a few thousand less than you thought you would.


You can hire an appraiser to look at the house and estimate its true value. This will tell you if the house is worth as much as the owners say it is, and it will help you negotiate a good deal.

, Make a list of your monthly spending, and circle anything you buy that you can live without. Take the money you would spend on these things, and put it in your savings account each week. For example, if you spend $20 on buying lunch each week, bring your own lunch, and put the money in your account. $20 a week for a year will save you an extra $1040 a year. You can:


Cook instead of eating out
Choose generic products over brand name
Buy used clothing and furniture
If you are eligible, you can save money by applying for food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)., Try to increase your savings goal a little bit each month. Set a monthly savings goal. Setting short-term saving goals will make it easier for you to succeed.Instead of saying you will save $1000 dollars over a year, for example, say you will save $20 a week or $80 a month.

, Try to work as hard as you can at your current job. Work overtime if you will be paid for it. Ask your boss for a raise. If your current job doesn't pay well enough to allow you to save, try throwing out some applications at other companies. If you have a part-time job, try looking for an extra one. You also make some money on the side through small jobs such as dog walking, selling crafts online, or babysitting.

Be flexible on where you need to live. You can compare neighborhood prices on websites such as Trulia or by working with a real estate agent.


Consider moving an hour outside a city. Often, home prices are very competitive in these areas, and the commute won’t be unbearable.;
, When people are looking to sell their homes, they often update the kitchen. For $5,000, they can increase the purchase price by $10,000 or more. Because of this, you should look for homes that haven’t been remodeled. You can get the home for a cheaper price and pay for remodeling on your own., These are the types of cosmetic fixes that can be made cheaply and easily. However, many buyers will shy away from these types of homes. Identify one and you might be getting a great deal.

, A home with curb appeal will probably sell faster, so homeowners have no incentive to negotiate on price.However, if the home looks a little rundown, then you are more likely to be able to negotiate a better deal.

, A For Sale By Owner (FSBO) is often a great deal. The seller wants to save money but probably doesn’t know how much their home is worth. In this situation, you might be able to drive a hard bargain and get a great deal.


Drive through any neighborhood and look for sale signs. People also typically advertise on Craigslist or in the newspaper.

, The longer a home sits unsold, the more likely an owner is to negotiate. Look for homes that have been on the market for at least 30 days.Some homes might be sitting on the market because they are over-priced or because there are structural problems. You don’t want a home with a lot of problems, so you should still have an inspection done to check for major and minor problems.

, You can find foreclosure listings online. As you comb through them, pay attention to the agent listed. You can call the agent up and tell them you are interested in buying a foreclosed property.


Don’t give too much credit to the prices listed for foreclosed homes. Often, banks either underprice or overprice foreclosed properties. You’ll come up with your bid by looking at comparable homes nearby and considering how long the property has been on the market.
You can also buy foreclosed properties at an auction. As a first-time buyer, you might be uncomfortable doing this. However, you can attend auctions as an observer to get a feel for the bidding process. You should secure your funding ahead of time, or get preapproved for a mortgage at a minimum., To really save, purchase a smaller home than you can afford. You’ll save on monthly mortgage payments, and you’ll have lower upkeep expenses.Remember that your first home isn’t your last home, so find something well within your budget.

, You can find out if you qualify for the lowest interest rates by having a bank preapprove you. Being preapproved will also give you power when you negotiate with the seller., You should visit every home for a walkthrough before making an offer. Be pleasant, but keep your emotions in check. Never gush about a home, regardless of how you feel.A seller who knows you love the house will drive a harder bargain, so keep sellers off balance by remaining neutral. Speak honestly about the house only when alone with your agent.

, The inspection lets you find out everything that’s wrong with the home. You can then ask the seller for a credit, which should lower the purchase price even further.Order your inspection and then go over the report with the inspector.


If the home needs major repairs, then get an estimate from a contractor so you know how much it will cost to repair.

, Talk with your real estate agent about what you should offer, but if you want a deal, then you should offer less than the asking price. However, you don’t want to offer a price that is too low because you’ll risk offending the homeowner.Your offer will be driven by market conditions. In a buyer’s market, you should offer 5-10% less than you want to pay.For example, a home might be listed at $200,000 and you want to pay $180,000. Open negotiations with a bid for $165,000, which gives you room to go up.
By contrast, in a hot market, you might need to make your best offer first. If you only want to pay $180,000 for a house, then make that your first offer.

, One technique sellers use is to claim that there is another person interested in the house. Whether true or not, the purpose of telling you this is to induce you to increase your offer. To really save money, walk away from a home you can’t get cheaply.


Even if you fall in love with the home, realize that you might find a new home in a month that you also fall in love with.

, Your “closing costs” cover a variety of things, such as an appraisal, title report, title insurance, and loan origination fees. These costs can add up to 2-5% of the purchase price.Ask the seller to cover those costs.


Even if the seller won’t cover them, you can still reduce your closing costs. For example, you can choose your own title insurance provider, and probably get the insurance cheaper.

, You’ll need to pay mortgage interest, mortgage insurance, hazard insurance, taxes, and homeowners association (HOA) dues from the date you close. For this reason, try to close at the very end of the month, so you won’t have to pay them., However, you’ll save a lot of money over the life of the loan. If you can afford the monthly payments, then get a 15-year mortgage.

, Even if you must get a 30-year mortgage, you can save a considerable amount of money by paying more each month. You’ll pay off your mortgage faster and pay less in interest overall.For example, imagine you have a 30-year mortgage at 4% interest for $220,000. If you make an extra payment each quarter, you’ll pay off your loan 11 years early and save $65,000 in interest., With a fixed mortgage, your interest rate never changes. However, there’s another option: adjustable rate mortgages (ARM). These mortgages received a lot of bad press during the housing meltdown. Nevertheless, a hybrid ARM can save you money and carries less risk than older ARMS did.


With a hybrid ARM, the interest rate will be fixed for a certain amount of time (e.g., 5, 7, 10 years). At the end of the fixed period, the mortgage changes to an adjustable rate. Generally, the initial fixed rate is lower than what you can get with a fixed rate mortgage. For example, a 7/1 Hybrid ARM might be a full percentage point lower.At the end of the fixed period, your mortgage rate will probably increase. However, at that point you can refinance your mortgage.

, You typically must pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you borrow more than 80% of the value of your home. PMI can be quite expensive—up to 1% of the loan amount. If your loan is $200,000, you might pay as much as $2,000 for insurance.If you have excellent credit (700 or higher), you might be able to get an 80/10/10 mortgage. Essentially, you take out two mortgages, often from the same lender. Because neither mortgage is for more than 80% of the home’s value, you don’t pay PMI for either one.

, An FHA loan probably won’t save you money over the long haul. However, it’s a great option for buyers who don’t have a large down payment saved or maybe don’t have the greatest credit.Because of the low down payment, you’ll need to pay mortgage insurance, which comes out to about 0.8%--not cheap. FHA loans have made home ownership possible for many people, but don’t assume they are your cheapest option.
Always ask your lender to give you a comparison of an FHA loan versus a conventional mortgage. Compare the monthly mortgage payments and the total overall costs.

, You’ll qualify for the lowest interest rates if you have a credit score of 740 or higher. However, if your score is less than 620, you might struggle to get any mortgage.You can obtain your credit score in the following ways:


Use a free online service, such as Credit.com or Credit Karma.
Look on your credit card statements or check your online credit card account. Some credit card companies will share your credit score for free.
Talk to a HUD-certified housing counselor, who can obtain your credit score.
Pay for your FICO score at myfico.com.

, Pull your credit report at least 12 months before shopping for a mortgage.You can get one free annual report from each of the major national credit reporting agencies. Go through your report and look for common errors:


Accounts inaccurately listed as closed or in collections.
Accounts with the wrong balance or wrong credit limit listed.
Accounts that belong to your ex-spouse.
Someone else’s account listed on your credit report because they have a similar name or tax ID number., You want your score to be as high as possible when you apply for a mortgage. For this reason, you should pay down your debts, in particular your credit card debt.Create a budget and lower your discretionary spending as much as possible. Funnel all extra cash toward your debt payments.


Your debt payments shouldn’t be more than 43% of your income. For example, if your income is $5,000 a month, then your monthly debt payments shouldn’t exceed $2,150.
At the same time, don’t close credit card accounts. This will lower your overall available credit, which will push up your “utilization.” Your utilization is the amount of available credit you use.For example, you might have two credit cards with $5,000 limits on both and $4,000 in debt. If you close one card, your utilization rises to 80%.
Visit a credit counselor if you need help developing a budget. The counselor can also negotiate with your creditors to waive late fees and lower your interest rates.

, Don’t grab the first mortgage offer made to you. Instead, shop around. Visit multiple banks, credit unions, and online mortgage lenders.Find the lender that provides the lowest rate.


Work with a mortgage broker to make the process easier. They can obtain quotes from multiple lenders."

Read your title report.,
Contact the lienholder.,
Negotiate with the lienholder.,
Pay the lienholder.,
Get a release form.,
File the signed release form.",How to Resolve Property Title Problems1," Your title insurance company should send you a report on your property. They compile the report by scanning the records at the Recorder of Deeds office and finding anything that relates to your property. Go through the report and find any liens that have been placed on the property:Mechanic’s liens. These are put on your property when someone does work on the property but isn’t paid. Mechanic’s liens typically expire after a year unless the contractor brings a lawsuit.
Judgment liens. If you lost a lawsuit, then the person who won becomes a judgment creditor. He or she could put liens on your property.
Tax liens. If you didn’t pay the IRS, or if you haven’t paid all of your property tax bill, then the government can put a lien on your property.;
, In order to get the lien removed, you need the person who put the lien on the property to release it.This person is the “lienholder.” Find the lienholder’s contact number and call them up.

, If you don’t want to pay the full amount of your debt, then you should try to negotiate. The creditor might be willing to accept less than you owe. You probably can’t negotiate with the IRS or with your city tax authority, but you could try to negotiate the amount owed to a judgment creditor or a contractor.


Offer a lump sum payment.The lump sum might be less than the debt, but the creditor knows they will at least be getting something from you. So long as the lien sits on your property they don’t get any money.
Explain why you can’t pay the full amount. For example, you might have lost your job or been sick. By being upfront about why you can’t pay, you give the creditor incentive to settle for an amount less than you owe.

, You preferably shouldn’t pay in cash. Instead, pay with a credit card or with a check. If you have to use cash, then get a receipt from the lienholder.


If the lienholder is willing to settle for less than the full amount of the debt, make sure you get a receipt even if you pay with a check or credit card. The receipt should state that you have paid off the debt in full.
To get a tax lien released, you will have to pay the amount owed in full.

, Make sure to find the correct release form and give it to the lienholder when you make payment. Ideally, you could pay in person and have them fill out the release form while you wait.


Your state’s Contractor’s Board or equivalent agency should have waiver and release forms you can print off.You can use these to release a mechanic’s lien.
A judgment creditor usually has to file an “acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment” with the court.Your court probably has a printed, “fill in the blank” form you can pick up. Ask the court clerk or check the court’s website.

, Once the lienholder signs the release, you should make sure it gets filed with the appropriate office. Keep a copy for your records. The lien won’t be released until the form is filed.

Learn how property can be transferred to two people.,
Sign the deed in front of a notary public.,

Pay the transfer tax.,
Get your copy in the mail.",How to Transfer Property1," You will transfer real estate by deed. There are different deeds: warranty, grant, and quitclaim deeds. They differ in the amount of protection they afford the buyer. Accordingly, you should talk with the buyer about what kind of deed he or she wants:


Warranty deed. These provide the buyer with the most protection. You guarantee that you are the rightful owner and that the property is free of all liens or other claims. If someone comes forward to challenge the buyer’s title at a later date, then you must compensate the buyer.Grant deed. The seller promises that he or she hasn’t transferred title to the property to anyone else.
Quitclaim deed. With these deeds, you make no promises regarding the property. In fact, the seller might not even own the property being transferred with a quitclaim deed. These deeds are typically used to transfer property between family or close friends.;
, You need the current deed to the property because you need to get the legal description of property from it. You will need to include the legal description of property on the new deed.


Look through your papers and see if you have a copy of the current deed.
If you don’t, then go to the Recorder of Deeds office and get a copy. This is the office where deeds are stored. In your county, the office might go by a different name (Land Registry or Registrar of Deeds).

, You should be able to find form deeds which you can fill out. You can usually find them on the Internet. Look for form deeds created by your state’s bar association or your local county government.


Your Recorder of Deeds office might also have form deeds you can use. Stop in and ask the clerk.
You can also hire a lawyer to draft the deed for you. You should have a lawyer draft the deed if you are not transferring the entire parcel of property. For example, if you want to divide the property in half or want to retain an easement on the property (such as a “right of way”), then you should have a lawyer draft the deed.
To find a real estate lawyer, you can contact your state or local bar association and ask for a referral.

, Make sure you have the right deed form. If you are transferring property by warranty deed, then don’t use a quitclaim deed form. You should provide the following information on the deed form:the names of the sellers (“grantor”) and the buyers (grantees)
the date of the transfer
how much was paid for the land
the county and state where the property is located
the legal description of property (which you can get from the current deed)

, For added protection, you can take the deed to an attorney to review. Ask the attorney if you have left anything off the deed. You should certainly consult with a lawyer if you are transferring the property to two people as co-owners.

, Two people can take the real estate in different ways. The ownership form will determine what happens to the property when one owner dies. Generally, there are three ways in which two people can own real estate together:As tenants in common. Two people own a share of the property, though each has a right to use the entire property. Each owner can sell their share but not the share of the other person. When one owner dies, his or her share can be passed to a beneficiary through a will.
As joint tenants with right of survivorship. Both own the property and, when one owner dies, the other automatically gets the other person’s share.
As community property. A married couple can form a “tenancy by the entirety,” which is community property. This is like a “joint tenancy” except the couple must be married at the time that they take the property. If they subsequently divorce, then the property becomes a tenancy in common.
The type of tenancy the buyers want will determine how you grant the property to them. See Transfer Real Estate Property for more information.

, Once you have completed the deed, you should sign it in front of a notary public.Be sure to take sufficient personal identification to show the notary. Generally, a valid driver’s license or passport should be sufficient.


You can find notaries at the courthouse or at most large banks. Also, your Recorder of Deeds office usually will have a notary.
Check your state law to see if you need witnesses. Some states might require one or two people to witness you signing the deed. You can find your state law by searching “your state” and “land transfer witness” into your favorite search engine.

, The deed has to be recorded at the county Recorder of Deeds office in the county where the property is located. You should take the deed and ask to record it.


You will need to pay a fee to record the deed. The amount will differ depending on the office.

, Thirty-seven states require that you pay a transfer tax whenever property is transferred.In some states, the seller and buyer split the cost. In other states, the buyer alone is responsible. Check with the clerk at your local tax assessor’s office.


The amount of the tax is generally based on the amount of money the buyer paid for the property.

, It takes about one to two months for the deed to be recorded and for you to be sent a copy in the mail.If you don’t receive a copy by that point, then you should contact the Recorder of Deeds office.

Grant land by quitclaim deed.,
File a quiet title action instead.",How to Resolve Property Title Problems2," Boundary disputes could show up on your title report. You should try to resolve any boundary dispute with your neighbor voluntarily. It would be cheaper and easier if you came to an agreement.


For example, if your neighbor is encroaching on your property, then you could sell that portion of the land to them. Alternately, if you have encroached on your neighbor’s property, then you could purchase the land you are using.
Try to be as open and honest with your neighbor as possible. Share copies of your survey and title report.By being honest, you help build trust which could lead to a resolution.

, You might not know where the boundary line should be. In this situation, you should have a professional survey done. Contact a surveyor and check how much he or she charges. You can find a surveyor in the following ways:


Ask your realtor. Call up the realtor you used to buy the home and ask if he or she could refer you to a surveyor. Many realtors keep lists of surveyors they have used.Search the phone book. Look under “surveyor” or “land surveyor.”
Get a referral from a professional association. Many states have surveyor associations which offer referrals. You can find them online by searching “your state” and “surveyor.”

, You and your neighbor could resolve the boundary dispute by establishing a boundary and then granting by quitclaim deed the property on either side. Each owner signs a quitclaim deed to the other and grants any land they own on the other side of the fence to their neighbor.See Get a Quit Claim Deed for more information.

, You might not be able to reach resolution with your neighbor. In this situation, you may have to file a quiet title action and ask the judge to fix the boundary to the property."

Go to court.",How to Resolve Property Title Problems3," An action to “quiet title” asks the court to determine the legal rights in a piece of property. You can typically file a quiet title action in the following circumstances:Someone is using your property without your permission. For example, someone might have encroached on your property, or they could regularly trespass on your property to reach their own parcel of land. In these situations, a quiet title action can establish that these people do not have an “easement” or other rights in your property.
There is uncertainty about where the boundary should be located.
You are unsure if you own the land. If the title report shows a break in the title, then you don’t know if someone might have transferred the property without the legal right to do so. In this situation, a quiet title action can conclusively establish that you are the owner of the property.
You want to challenge a lien because you do not think it is valid.

, You would benefit by meeting for a consultation with an attorney to discuss whether you should bring a quiet title action and who you should join as defendants to the suit. A qualified attorney can listen to you explain your circumstances and offer tailored advice.


To find a qualified attorney, contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.Once you have a referral, you should call the attorney and ask to schedule a consultation. Ask how much he or she charges.

, Many courts have created “fill-in-the-blank” forms you can use.Stop into the court for the county where the property is located. Ask the clerk if there is a form.


You can also check on the court’s website.

, There might not be a form available. In this situation, you need to draft your own. Begin by opening a blank word processing document and setting the font to a size and style that is readable. Times New Roman or Arial 14 point is generally acceptable.


Also set one-inch margins and get a copy of your court’s local rules to see if there are other formatting requirements. You can get local rules from the court’s website.
In some courts, you need to print your petition on “pleading paper,” which is paper numbered down the left-hand margin. You should read your local rules to check., At the top of the motion, you need to insert the “caption”: the name of the court, the names of the parties (you and any defendants), and space for the case number.The court’s name goes at the top of the document, centered between the left- and right-hand margins.
Insert the names of the parties beneath the court name and on the left-hand side of the page.
Put “Case No.” and then a blank line to the right of the names. You will get the case number when you file your lawsuit.
Be sure to name as a defendant anyone with a potential interest in the property. You can also name “John Does 1-100” if you think there are unknown people who might have an interest in the property.

, You can insert the title beneath the caption. You can title the complaint “Action to Quiet Title” or “Verified Complaint to Quiet Title.”Center the title between the left and right-hand margins.

, In the introduction, you should identify yourself and the defendants. If you are representing yourself in the lawsuit, then you should identify that fact as well.


Sample language could read: “Comes now, Plaintiff, Lisa Jones, representing herself pro se, and files the Complaint to Quiet Title against the Defendants and states the following.”, You need to explain where the property is located. You should get your legal description of property. You can attach the legal description as an exhibit and refer to the property in your complaint by the street address.


For example, you could write: “This is an action to quiet title to real property owned by the Plaintiff in fee simple, which is located at 755 East Erie, Southern Town, Florida, and which is described more fully in Exhibit A.”Remember to number your paragraphs. The description of property would be number 1.

, One important fact is how you came into the property. You can briefly explain who you bought it from and the date that you took possession. In a series of numbered paragraphs, relate the following information:The date you took possession of the property and how. For example: “2. Plaintiff derived title by purchasing the property on or about June 12, 2003 and owned in fee simple.”
How the transfer was made: name the party who transferred the property to you, the type of deed (e.g., warranty deed, quitclaim deed, etc.) and state the volume and page number where the deed can be found in the Recorder of Deeds office.

, You should identify any named defendants who are claiming an interest in your property. If any defendants are businesses, then identify where they do business., Go into sufficient detail so that the judge understands what interest the defendants claim in your property. You should also explain why you own the entire property. Refer to any documents that help your case—emails, letters, photographs, surveys, etc. Attach them as exhibits.


For example, there may have been a gap in your chain of title. You should explain the gap and also point out that no one has come forward to claim ownership in the property.
If you are involved in a boundary dispute, then explain the dispute. Also explain why the disputed parcel actually falls on your side of the land.

, Repeat that you want the court to quiet the title to your property. If you can sue for attorney’s fees in your state, then mention that as well.Sample language could read: “Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court for an Order to Quiet Title of her residence at 755 East Erie, Southern Town, Florida.”

, You may have to verify that the statements in your petition are true and correct. Alternately, you could sign your own affidavit to this effect.You may also need to sign in front of a notary public. If so, insert an appropriate notary block and wait to sign until you appear before the notary.

, Once you have completed the petition, you should make several copies. Take your copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask to file.


You will probably have to pay a filing fee. The amount and methods of payment will differ depending on the court, so call ahead of time and check.
If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form and fill it out. You will have to provide information about your monthly income and expenses., You need to provide notice to anyone who might claim an interest in the land. This will include anyone who claims a lien, easement, or other interest in the property. You can serve notice by having someone 18 or older, who is not a party to the lawsuit, hand deliver notice.


Read your state law. In some states, you have to give notice to your neighbors and other people.
You might also have to post notice on the property itself and publish notice in a newspaper., If someone with an interest in the property wants to dispute the quiet title action, then they will probably file a response. You should receive a copy before your hearing date. If no one contests the quiet title action, then ask the judge to decide in your favor.

Get permission from any lienholder.,
Create a bill of sale.,
Get a copy of the certificate of title.,
Sign the transfer section.,
Give the certificate of title to the buyer.,
Take the paperwork to the DMV.",How to Transfer Property2," Each state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will set rules for how to transfer a vehicle. You should look for your state’s website or stop into the nearest office.


To find your state’s DMV website, search for “your state” and “motor vehicles” or “DMV” in an Internet search engine.
Your state’s website should tell you how to go about transferring title to a vehicle.

, You need to remove the license plates from the vehicle. In many states, you can’t transfer the plates with the car. However, you can keep the plates for your new car.


If you are not transferring your plates to your new car, then you should take them to the DMV and surrender them., You should get all documents lined up to make the transfer as painless as possible. For example, your state might require the following:the certificate of title (usually called the “pink slip”)
signatures of the seller and any lienholders
signatures of the buyers on the certificate of title
the number of miles on the odometer
other certificates as required by your state
transfer fee

, If you took out a loan to purchase the car, then the lender has a lien on your vehicle. You will need permission of any lienholder before you can transfer the car.


You should call the lienholder about the best way to proceed.For example, you can close the sale at the bank or credit union which holds the lien on the car. Once you receive payment, you can immediately pay off the lien. Then you will sign over title to the vehicle.

, The buyer needs to have an acceptable bill of sale which shows that the vehicle has been sold to him or her. Even if you received the vehicle as a gift, you generally need a bill of sale. Make sure the bill of sale includes the following:the vehicle’s year and make
the vehicle identification number (VIN)
the date of the sale
the purchase price (if a gift, then $0)
the names and signatures for both the buyer and the seller

, You might have lost the certificate of title. If so, you will need to fill out an application to get a duplicate. Your state’s DMV should tell you the process. Generally, you will need to provide the DMV with the following information:your name and address
your license number and state
the name and address of any lienholder
the vehicle’s year and make
vehicle license plate number
the VIN
your signature

, The seller should sign the transfer section on the certificate of title.This section can usually be found on the front of the certificate of title.The seller may also need to complete the odometer disclosure statement. If your vehicle is 10 years or older, you will have to fill out the “odometer disclosure” on the back of the certificate of title., Deliver physical possession of the vehicle to the buyer. At the same time, you can hand over the certificate of title and a copy of the bill of sale.


Keep a copy of the bill of sale for your own records. This will serve as proof that you sold the vehicle.

, The buyer should gather the paperwork and then go to the DMV and register the vehicle. In some states, you will face a penalty if you wait too long to register.


For example, New Jersey charges $25 if you wait longer than 10 working days from the day of the sale.Depending on your state, you will have to pay various fees and taxes. For example, you will probably have to pay a title transfer fee.In 45 states, you will also need to pay a sales tax. Both state governments and local governments can tax you. The tax will generally be calculated based on the total purchase price."
"
Identify personal property.,
Decide if you need a bill of sale.,
Draft a bill of sale.,
Hand over the property.",How to Transfer Property3," Personal property is anything other than real estate that is movable. Technically, an automobile is personal property. However, the transfer rules for automobiles are different than for other personal property. Examples of personal property include:


jewelry
paintings and art work
clothing
trophies and memorabilia

, You don’t need a bill of sale if you give someone personal property as a gift. Even if you sell goods in a store, your receipt is sufficient as a bill of sale.


However, sometimes personal property is so valuable that the buyer will want the added security of a bill of sale. If the personal property is expensive, then you should consider making a bill of sale to document the sale.
The seller should also tell you whether or not they want a bill of sale.

, If the seller wants a bill of sale, then you should draft one. In order to be effective, the bill of sale should have the following information:your name and address
the buyer’s name and address
the amount paid for the sale
a detailed description of the property
both the seller’s and the buyer’s signatures
the location, date, and time of the sale

, You can transfer the personal property at the same time that you transfer the bill of sale. If you are having something delivered to someone’s home or workplace, then get a signed receipt from whoever took possession of the goods.


This receipt will serve as proof that you transferred the property. Store it safely with your personal records in case any dispute later arises about whether you transferred the property.

You can find an appraiser in the following ways:


look in the Yellow Pages
ask for a referral from a mortgage company, bank, or realtor
contact your state’s licensing agency;
, A Residential Mortgage Loan Originator provides both the seller and lender with information so that they can make an educated lending decision. In this way, they can limit future disagreements by making the transaction as transparent as possible. The RMLO can help prepare a Safe Act and Dodd Frank Act compliant loan package in conjunction with the title company or closing attorney.


Make sure your RMLO is properly licensed by your state. Check with your state’s Department of Business Oversight or equivalent state office to check., Both parties should work closely with a real estate attorney.A real estate attorney can draft all of the necessary paperwork. The attorney can also protect your interests. For example, the buyer can include a protection clause just in case the property has to be sold in response to a life changing event, job relocation or loss, divorce or death.


You can get a referral to a real estate attorney by contacting your local or state bar association. Bar associations are organizations made up of attorneys, and they often provide referrals to their members or can help you find an attorney.
Visit the American Bar Association’s website at http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx and enter your zip code. Then call the nearest bar association.

, Owner financed sales work best when the owner has title free and clear or the owner can pay off the mortgage with the buyer’s down payment. However, if the seller still has a large mortgage, they need to get their lender’s approval.Check whether you can pay off the mortgage with the buyer’s down payment. If not, then contact your mortgage company and discuss that you want to sell the house.

, Both the seller and buyer should perform background checks on each other. Many owner financed sales are short-term, for five years or so. At the end of the term, the buyer is expected to refinance and then make a “balloon payment,” paying off the balance of the loan.As a seller, you will want assurance that a buyer can get a traditional loan at the end of the contract term, which means you definitely want to check their credit history and employment.


In fact, sellers should consider having buyers complete a loan application. You can verify references, employment history, and other financial information.Buyers also benefit from background checks. For example, they might discover that the seller has been financially irresponsible. If the seller still holds a mortgage on the home, there is a risk of default.

, One advantage of an owner financed sale is that the seller controls details about the financing. Because the seller is assuming a lot of risk, they should come up with terms that protect them. Talk with your attorney about what the terms of the loan should be. Consider the following:a substantial down payment (usually 10% or more)
an interest rate that is higher than usual (though less than your state’s maximum allowable interest rate)
a loan term you are comfortable with

, You want to protect yourself legally by making sure that you have all of the necessary legal documents prepared. Your real estate attorney can draft a purchase and sale agreement, which both seller and buyer will sign. This document provides information about the following:closing date
name of the title insurance company
final sale price
details about a down payment, if any
contingencies which must be met for the sale to proceed, such as an acceptable inspection and a clear title report

, The seller also needs the buyer to sign a promissory note or other financial instrument.Your lawyer or RMLO can draft this document for you. It should contain the following information:borrower’s name
property address
amount of the loan
interest rate
repayment schedule
terms for late or missed payments
consequences of default

, The mortgage provides security for the loan.Your lawyer should also draft this document for you. The mortgage is what allows you to repossess the house should the buyer default on the loan., Your RMLO partner will calculate the agreed upon amount based on a specific period of time and if you have agreed on a balloon payment. Remember that not every state allows balloon payments.For example, you can base monthly payment amount on a hypothetical 30-year mortgage, but schedule payment of the remaining amount in 5 years (balloon). The RMLO will also create required disclosures for the seller/lender.

, Both the buyer and seller should have independent attorneys who can review all paperwork to make sure that it is complete. You should schedule a closing to sign everything and make copies.

, The seller should talk to their lawyer about whether they want to hire a loan servicer. If they do, then their lawyer can recommend someone. A loan servicer provides many important services:collects the mortgage payments
sets up an escrow
handles tax statements and payments
makes insurance payments
processes payment changes
performs collection services, if necessary

, You can record it in the county land records office.Doing so will allow the buyer and the seller to take advantage of tax deductions. Making the deal official in this manner also proves that the sale took place.

, Owner financed sales are rare, and you shouldn’t jump into one until you have thoroughly considered your situation. Think about the following:You usually must own the house free and clear of any mortgage. Otherwise, you will need your lender to give you permission to sell.
Taxes can be complicated and you’ll want to hire a tax professional to help you.
You might have to go through the foreclosure process if the buyer stops making payments. This can be costly and time-consuming.
However, you may make much more money on an owner financed sale than if you sell the traditional way.

, Buyers usually like owner financed sales because a seller might be less choosy than a bank or mortgage lender. However, you should consider the following:You might have to come up with a larger down payment than you normally would. The owner-seller is taking a risk by financing your sale, and in return they might want a larger down payment or higher interest.
Owner financed sales often close faster than other sales.
You need to be sure you can make the balloon payment if one is written into the contract. If you break the contract, then you could lose the house and all of the payments you have made up to that point.

, In addition to working with a real estate lawyer, you might want to meet with a tax professional, such as a certified public accountant. Ask about the tax benefits of an owner financed sale compared to selling outright.If you are a buyer, then you should talk about how to raise your credit score so that you qualify for a traditional mortgage when the balloon payment comes due.

You will want to visit your city hall or town hall to get information. Your city or town probably has a set of rules known as the local zoning ordinances, zoning regulations, zoning code, or something similar. Speak with someone at town hall and get a copy of these regulations.Check online for many documents. As more and more communities have become tech-savvy, you may be able to search for your community’s zoning ordinances online. The City of Detroit, for example, posts everything including the latest Zoning Ordinance, application forms you will need, and copies of local zoning maps.;
, Applying for a zoning permit is not usually a very difficult process. Local zoning ordinances are usually written so that any resident of the community should be able to read and follow them. However, depending on the scale of the project you propose, you may need legal help. If your project is large or complicated and has several different parts to it, a lawyer can help you organize and understand all the requirements.

, Most cities or towns will have a department of public works that controls this sort of planning and building. It may help your building project to plan a meeting with the director. The director should be able to help you play your application, review the information that you need, and decide if there are better ways for you to proceed.


As an example, the city of Key Biscayne, Florida, has a website for the Department of Building, Planning, Zoning and Public Works. Contact information is provided for all the staff of that department. In particular, one person is identified as the Zoning Plan Reviewer.For simple, individual questions, you may be able to get answers you need with just a phone call. But if you need more help, or if you would like to review your overall project, the director of public works should be able to meet with you.

, After you review your town’s zoning plan, you will get an understanding for the way the zoning laws are arranged. This should help you figure out what permission you need for the project you anticipate. For example, building a permanent tool shed in your own backyard will require a different level of permission than establishing a business in a residential neighborhood. Compare your project to the various permissions that are granted, and figure out your need.


For example, the town of North Brunswick, New Jersey, has an application form that includes a long list of different projects. Each project has a separate fee identified, as well as a space for indicating whether the area is zoned residential, non-residential or commercial., Beyond understanding the zoning laws themselves, you will need to begin with a copy of the application form for the zoning relief that you need. In some communities, you will need a zoning permit for any type of building that you wish to do.Other areas will differentiate between the terms “zoning” and “building.” The term “zoning” refers to the use of buildings and land in certain geographical regions, while a “building” permit applies specifically to construction of various types. Determine which you need and request it through your City Hall’s zoning office.

, Usually, part of your zoning request is going to require you to demonstrate the impact that your proposal will have on the surrounding area. Part of doing this includes demonstrating how the area is zoned already. You will need to get copies of maps or ground plans from the city zoning office.The documents you need are usually part of the public record, so you should have free access to them. You may have to pay a copying fee, depending on what you need.

, Part of the application for a zoning variance usually requires that you submit details of the project that you propose. This usually must be very detailed. Make sure you read the application instructions very carefully and comply with the instructions meticulously. For example, the zoning variance instructions for the Town of Pittsford, NY, requires all of the following as part of the application:an instrument survey of the area
a scale drawing of any building additions that you propose, with marked measurements
architectural elevations
photographs
maps
landscape plans.

, If you are not the owner of the property for which you are requesting a variance or zoning permit, you will usually need to get the owner’s permission. If the owner is an individual, this may be as easy as speaking to that person. On the other hand, if you are proposing a project on a piece of public or commercial land, you may need to investigate the property’s ownership. You need to plan ahead and account for some extra time to be sure you have permission., Undoubtedly, the process for a zoning permit will begin with an application form. Be sure you have the right form for your project, and fill it out completely. Make sure that you have all the additional paperwork and materials that are supposed to accompany the application.


Many towns will provide a “checklist” so you can make sure you have everything you need for your application., When you have all the supporting material, including permissions and approvals of any required other individuals, gather your application together for filing.


Pay attention to which office to submit to. Sometimes you may just submit your application to the main clerk’s office at city hall, but sometimes you will be directed to submit the application directly to the zoning board or zoning director, or some other individual or office. To make sure your application does not get misplaced, send it to the correct office.
Make sure you know how many copies to submit. Sometimes you may just need to file the one application. But some communities will require additional copies. In Pittsfield, NY, for example, you need to file 12 copies of your application and all attachments., Find out as part of your application process whether the community requires the payment of a fee for a zoning permit. Check with the clerk or someone in the zoning office to find out how you can pay this, and to whom any check should be written.


Make sure you pay the appropriate fee for the type of proposal you are submitting. Different types of permits will often have different filing fees., If you are lucky, your application may simply be accepted, reviewed and approved without a hearing. But more often, you will probably need to attend a public hearing of the zoning board to address your application. When you file your application, you should check with the city clerk or someone in the zoning office to find out the procedure for such hearings. The scheduling of a meeting may be automatic, or it may be your responsibility to make sure that your application is scheduled for hearing.


For example, in Little Compton, Rhode Island, the Zoning Board meets the third Wednesday of each month to consider applications.The city of Neillsville, Wisconsin, contains space on its application form for the Zoning Board to meet and record its action on any proposal., When you attend a zoning hearing, you need to be thoroughly prepared. You should have extra copies of your application package and all supporting materials. It may help if you have enlarged exhibits of the area map and your proposed project, to explain your application. You can never be sure if the meeting is a mere formality, or if the members of the zoning board are going to ask you very detailed questions. Try to be prepared for anything.


If possible, depending on the area where you live, you may want to speak with individual members of the zoning board before the meeting. This can help you get a sense of the level of acceptance you can expect when you attend the hearing. Many communities list their zoning board members on their websites."

Consider writing a letter of interest.,
Submit your offer.",How to Make an Offer on a House," A seller will expect to sell for a price similar to what comparable homes (“comps”) have sold for in the same market. Their asking price should be based on these sales, but do your own research. Check websites such as Zillow for market comps.


A good comp should be a similar size and located in the same neighborhood.
Because the market always changes, your comps should have sold in the last three or four months. Don’t go past six months unless you absolutely have to.;
, No two homes are the same, so you should adjust your bid based on any unique features. For example, the home might have a swimming pool, which none of your comps have. Or the house might have a breathtaking view.

, If the market is hot, then the seller can probably get their asking price or a little more. However, if homes have been on the market a long time, you have more power as a buyer. Check how long homes are sitting on the market before selling. If most homes are sitting for four or more months, then the market is very slow.


Also find data about the average sale price year over year. In a cold market, the prices are probably falling or staying flat., There’s no reason to bid on a home if you can’t afford it. Pull together a monthly budget and check how much it costs for you to live. You can use online calculators to estimate how much your mortgage will cost., Some sellers might be particularly motivated to sell. When you walk through the home, ask the seller questions (if they are there). A real estate agent might be more tight-lipped, but still try to find out why the sellers are moving.


If the person is moving across the country or looking to buy another house, then they might be super motivated to unload the property quickly.However, someone selling simply because they are retiring or downsizing can probably take their time.

, You might not know where to start or how to come up with a bid amount. Meet with an agent who is experienced in the market where you want to buy a home. You can find agents in the phone book or online.

An agent can give you a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA), which is an expert analysis of comparable sales., You’ll be in a stronger bargaining position if you get pre-approved for a mortgage. For this reason, you should check your credit history to see if there’s any negative information that might trip you up. In the U.S., you are entitled to one free credit report a year from each of the three credit reporting agencies.Check for any errors and dispute them. Common errors include accounts that don’t belong to you, accounts with the wrong credit limit, or accounts inaccurately listed as past-due.

, Your credit score will affect whether you can get a mortgage and the interest rates you’ll pay. Generally, you’ll need a score of 620 to qualify for a conventional mortgage. A score above 740 will qualify you for the best interest rates.You can often find your credit score on a credit card statement.
Alternately, you can use a free service such as Credit.com or pay for your FICO score at myfico.com.

, You must give the lender quite a bit of personal information when you apply for pre-approval. Collect this information ahead of time:Recent pay stubs
Tax returns for the past two years
W-2 forms for the past two years
Proof of other income, such as alimony, child support, retirement income, etc.
Bank account statements for the past two months
Investment account information
Valid ID, such as a driver’s license or passport
Social Security number

, You can apply for pre-approval at a bank or credit union. You’ll have to complete an application and provide copies of your supporting documentation. Ask how long it will take for the lender to analyze your information.


Spend some time shopping around for the best rates before applying. If you want, you can consider online lenders, but you should thoroughly research them. Check with the Better Business Bureau and your state’s Attorney General to see if complaints have been filed.

, If you’re approved, then the lender should send you a letter stating the amount you have been approved for. This letter is not a mortgage commitment—the bank actually needs to appraise the house you intend to buy. However, the letter is solid proof you can financially qualify for a mortgage.


The letter is usually only good for 90 days, so don’t seek pre-approval until you are ready to seriously start house hunting., Every state and country has different laws that regulate how purchase offers are made. For example, in some U.S. states, only a lawyer can draft a legal offer.If you need to hire a lawyer, contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral to a real estate lawyer. You can find your nearest bar association at https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx.

, Your jurisdiction might have a form local real estate agents use. You can get a copy by contacting your state’s Department of Real Estate or by searching online.


Because the law often changes, any form you find might be slightly dated. For this reason, you might want to have a lawyer review your purchase offer before you submit it to the seller.

, A valid purchase offer should identify the address of the property and sometimes include the legal description, which you can find on a deed., A purchase offer must also include details about what you will pay for the house and how. Include the following information:Your proposed purchase price.
Whether it is an all-cash transaction or one that is subject to a mortgage.
The amount of your earnest money deposit. Generally, this is 1-3% of the purchase price. Also explain how it will be returned to you if the seller rejects your offer., Contingencies protect you. They are things that must happen for the contract to be legally binding. Include any of the following contingencies that apply to your situation:You might not be able to buy unless you get financing, so include that contingency if necessary.
You’ll definitely want a satisfactory home inspection soon after making your offer. You can back out if the inspection reveals problems.
You’ll want an appraisal and the right to back out if it comes in less than the purchase price.
You might need to sell your home before you can make the purchase. If so, include that contingency.

, An offer isn’t good forever. Instead, you get to decide how long it is good for. Talk with your agent and discuss what is typical for your area. For example, a bid might be good for a couple of days or only a few hours.In a hot market, a shorter deadline is best. This will prevent another buyer from sneaking in and making a competing offer.

, Purchase offers contain a lot of conditions meant to protect you in the sale. Make sure your purchase offer includes the following:Reserve the right to walk through the property before closing.
Request that the seller provide clear title.
Allocate who will pay for the survey, inspection, title insurance, etc.
State the type of deed the seller will grant you.
Divide up the real estate taxes, utility bills, fuel bills, etc. For example, if you close at the end of June, you might want the seller to pay half of the tax bill for the year.
Include any other provision required by your state law.

, If the seller accepts your offer, then the purchase offer becomes a binding contract (subject to your contingencies). Because of this, you need to thoroughly review all of the information you’ve included.Meet with a lawyer if you have questions., If your initial offer is lower than the asking price, consider explaining your reasoning. Draw up a list of comps and explain why you used them to set your bid. The seller’s agent must give the seller anything you submit., In a hot real estate market, you need to stand out. One way to do that is to tell the seller your story. Write a letter of interest in which you describe yourself, your family, and why you are interested in the house.

Try to form a connection with the seller. Perform basic Internet research and find out where they went to school or work. Social media accounts should tell you whether they have family.
Also explain what you loved about the house and the neighborhood. Sellers want to know that their buyers will love the home as much as they did., Gather together your earnest money, purchase offer, letter of interest, and any description of the comps you used. You’ll either submit the offer to the seller’s real estate agent or to your own agent.Submit with full knowledge that you may need to negotiate with the seller.

, Ask the seller to provide you with past records of home improvement. For example, there are chances that if the air conditioning system was repaired long time ago, it may break down at any time soon.

, If you think of remodeling the house, do examine the house closely. Perhaps remodeling the house may cost you a high price because the changes may not be as easy as you thought.

, If you see one or two houses torn down, there are chances of buildings coming up at a nearby location. A huge mall may arise blocking your view or some hospital or school may come up and cause inconvenience.

, Possibilities are that if the property value increases, your tax bills will show a steep rise.

, Confirm with the seller about the zoning in which the house is located and whether the house has any liens or restrictions.

, Check the recent newspapers to find out if there are any proposed projects in your area. It is better to find out sooner about upcoming projects than to have surprises later on.

Partner with an expert.,
Choose a real estate broker.",How to Invest in Cash Incentive Real Estate1," Research on the Internet at sites that focus on real estate education or get books from your local library or bookstore. Money magazine and Forbes also contain useful articles. Get up to speed on what is for sale in your local real estate market and visit all properties in your target price range., For your first few deals, it would be to your advantage to partner with someone with experience in the real estate market and who has successfully ""flipped"" houses. (Flipping is buying a property in disrepair, fixing it up and then selling it for a profit.) Finding a mentor willing to advise you would also be invaluable.

, As the seller usually pays the listing and selling real estate agents, it will cost you nothing to work with a real estate broker experienced in finding properties that are offering cash incentives. Ask others experienced in real estate investing for a referral, and choose someone based on ability to understand the investor's needs, availability to show the homes, likability, and knowing the markets.


You can find details about a particular real estate brokers at the real estate company's website.
You should also interview several brokers, just like an employer would interview job applicants and choose the one that meets your needs and criteria. You can prescreen beforehand to find out if they work with investors, what kinds of real estate they specialize in, what kind of availability per week they have, and anything else that is important to you.

Screen applicants.",How to Get Started in Real Estate Investing1," Investors should know how they intend to dispose of any property before they buy it. Do you want to flip the property and resell it? Or, do you want to rent the property? These options have different implications when it comes to financing and taxes; you’ll need to have a general idea of what direction you want to take at the outset and be ready for contingencies. 

You’ll need a realistic sense of your skills set, for one thing. Do you have the technical skills and knowledge to flip properties? You’ll need to a basic knowledge of property repairs and of the costs of typical and less typical repair work.

Having a reserve fund is also a MUST, whether you intend to rent or to flip the property. As a rule, an investor should have enough money in reserve to pay the mortgage for six months in case the property ends up vacant or is in a rehab-to-sell situation. When you rent, you also depend on timely payment to cover the mortgage. A reserve will help you cover the payment if your tenant’s rent happens to be late.   
;
,  Before diving into the purchase of a property, make sure it is going to be a profitable investment.  Evaluate your operating expenses and the amount of rent or income you expect to receive.  Consider the neighborhood where you want to buy to determine if properties retain their value in that location.Calculate the price-to-rent ratio in the neighborhood where you want to purchase. Keep in mind that information on rent prices is not always easy to obtain, so this number should only be considered a ballpark figure. Divide the median home price by the median annual rent.  For example, suppose the median home price is $180,000, and the median annual rent is about $12,000 ($1,000/month).  The price to rent ratio is $180,000/12,000=15{\displaystyle \$180,000/12,000=15}.  The lower the ratio, the better the investment is.  An area with a price to rent ratio over 20 is not a good investment.Calculate gross rental yield.  Divide the annual rent by the total purchase price of the property.  This helps you find the house with the highest rental income and the lowest purchase outlay.  For example, if you pay $100,000 for a house and you can collect $12,000 in rent per year ($1,000/month), the gross rental yield is 12 ($12,000/$100,000=.12){\displaystyle (\$12,000/\$100,000=.12)}.  Anything above 10% is a good investment.Some properties may require a significant amount of capital investment to make it livable (a new roof, replacing carpeting, etc.), but a high enough rental yield can still make a property that requires work a good investment.  

 Calculate the capitalization rate.  This tells you the rate of return on the property’s income. The capitalization rate is typically based on the property’s net income in the most recent year (if it is being rented) or on the projected rental income (if it is not currently being rented).  Divide the net operating income by the purchase price of the property. The net operating income is the total annual revenue minus operating costs (operating costs tend use up about 40% of the income).  Suppose you want to purchase a property for $500,000 and your net operating income would be $35,000.  Your capitalization rate would be 7% ($35,000/$500,000=.07){\displaystyle (\$35,000/\$500,000=.07)}.  This means that you would earn 7% of the value of the property as profit.  Use the capitalization rate to compare the profitability of different properties.If the operating costs are not clear, or you're just trying to get a very general idea of whether or not the property is a good investment,  take the purchase price divided by the total yearly rent to see how many years it will take to earn the money back. This can help you compare properties — if one property will take five years to earn back the investment and another property will take seven years, and capital improvements are equal, then you will likely want to pursue the property that will earn your money back faster. 



 Calculate cash flow.  Figure out if you will make enough income in rent to cover the mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.  Also, make sure you have enough in reserve to cover unexpected expenses like repairs.  If not, your cash flow will be negative, which means you would be in danger of defaulting on your mortgage.,  First, you will likely need to put down a large percentage as a down payment – many commercial loans require between 25% to 35% down payments. If you don’t have that much cash on hand, look into getting the money from a home equity line of credit, personal loan, credit cards or by cashing in a life insurance policy.  Lenders will determine your interest rate based on your credit score and the amount of financial reserves you have in the bank to cover expenses on the property.  Consider working with a neighborhood bank instead of a large, national bank.  Local banks often offer more flexibility in structuring a mortgage.A 20% down payment is not your only option. You may be able to get FHA owner-occupied financing with as little as a 3% down payment or a hard money loan at 10% down. Your best bet is to sit down with a professional broker to learn about your different financing options. There are numerous restrictions as well as limits on conventional loans for investors. You generally can only have on FHA loan at a time, for instance, and are legally required to take out commercial loans for buildings with 5 or more units. A broker can help you navigate your options and help you strategize to make sure all your funding needs are covered. 

Be upfront with lenders about the state of the property. Many banks will not fund on particular types of property, so to avoid having your funding fall through down the line, provide the lender with photos and information on any issues with the property. You don't want the deal falling apart when the lender does an appraisal and finds out there is extensive damage on the property or that it needs repairs.  

Note that mortgage insurance – which protects the lender in case of default – will not cover investment properties. 


,  Start by looking at the properties listed on the multiple listing service (MLS).  You can find the MLS listings on websites like Realtor.com, Trulia, or Zillow.  You will find all of the same listings on your own on the MLS that a real estate agent could find for you.  However, it’s still a good idea to work with a Realtor.  They may have more information about amenities or specific properties.  Also, they will know about available properties that are not listed on the MLS.One of the biggest advantages of working with a Realtor is that they will give you an edge when it comes to timing. They can set you up to get immediate emails for listings that meet your criteria as soon as they go on the market or back on the market, and before they appear on other websites. This is valuable service in a tight real estate market.  

Be aware that there are certain things a Realtor cannot legally comment on. Your Realtor could not, for instance, make a judgement about whether a neighborhood is ""good"" or ""bad."" Use a resource like RAIDS online to check crime in the area or floodsmart.gov to find out if flooding is common (requiring you to buy additional flood insurance for your property). 

Realtors are often paid by the seller at settlement, so it’s sometimes free for the buyer to work with one. But buyers may also pay a real estate commission to a buyer’s agent. This can be a negotiated item in a “For Sale by Owner” transaction and may open up other available properties for you to consider.


,  Work with your real estate agent to determine a fair price for the property.  Also, write in contingencies for inspection, financing, and any other contingencies that your Realtor or lawyer advise.  Choose a settlement date that works well for you and for the seller.  Some sellers will accept an offer with a lower price if the offered settlement date is convenient.Always have a property inspected to find any problems that may cost you money in the future.  If the inspector finds anything, you may be in a position to renegotiate. You may be able to lower your offer and make the needed repairs yourself, request the seller make the repairs, or a combination of both.Disclose everything about the inspection. Some lenders won’t finance a property if they are aware of a needed repair that is important to them, for instance. It’s best to resolve everything before closing or move on to other properties if problems arise and aren’t fixed to your satisfaction.

 You’ll usually want to be sure that the property passes inspection and all other requested contingencies. However, there are some circumstances when a buyer might waive contingencies and purchase a property anyway. For example, some investors are willing to do repairs and don’t need financing; they may buy a property that wouldn’t pass inspection. 


,  If you’re intending to rent the property you’ll need to find tenants, ideally ones who will pay their rent in full and on time, keep your property in good condition, and will follow the policies outlined in your lease.  Consider several factors in your search for tenants.  Advertise for tenants without discriminating against any groups.  Screen tenants thoroughly.Advertise your property by word of mouth, flyers, signs, print ads in local newspapers and online ads on real estate websites. Websites like Craigslist, Zillow, and others allow free posting of rentals. 

 Charge enough rent to cover your operating expenses, earn a reasonable profit and to be competitive with other rentals in the area. You must use the same criteria for everyone.

Provide applicants with a list of the rental criteria that they will be evaluated against.

 Have any applicants fill out an application that lists not only their contact information, but also their sources of income, previous addresses and names of references.  Also, get their permission to verify their income and check their credit.  Once you have permission, check with their employers to verify their income.  Once you have their Social Security number and permission, you can check their credit with any of the three credit reporting bureaus.  Contact previous landlords to check references.


, You are able to screen rental applicants according to disqualifying criteria. These can include credit score, gross income, criminal history, and rental history. A previous eviction could mean denial, for example, or owing money to an earlier landlord. Be sure to give applicants a complete list of the criteria you’re using to evaluate them – these criteria are up to you, so long as you don’t discriminate against any protected groups or violate state or federal law. 

 Understand any federal, state and local laws that protect certain classes of people from discrimination.  For example, the Civil Rights Act prevents discrimination on the basis of race.  The Fair Housing Act ensures fair treatment no matter someone’s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or if they have children.

 If you decide to approve an applicant with issues, you can insist on certain conditions like a larger deposit or a co-signer. However, if you deny or approve an applicant with extra conditions, they’ll need an adverse action letter explaining the reasons why.  

There are companies that can provide professional screening. Applicants usually pay for this service themselves, leaving you out of the investigative process. Then, once you get the results, you can evaluate further and decide on any extra conditions.

Look for ""distressed"" sellers.,
Try searching for non-owner occupied homes.",How to Invest in Cash Incentive Real Estate2," A good place to start is www.homepath.com, a resale marketing site. Fannie Mae, for example, lists thousands of properties they acquired through foreclosure. They occasionally offer cash incentives toward closing costs., Ask the listing real estate agent or look for incentives that are mentioned in the property's For Sale ads. Seek out properties that have been on the market for a long time, or have something so badly wrong with them that the bank or seller is willing to pay you to purchase the property. Or you can suggest incentives during the negotiation process. Cash incentives may include:


Cash-back offers. These could include offering to pay a year's worth of property taxes or mortgage payments. Other types of cash-back offers include credits for a down payment, repairs, landscaping, closing costs or mortgage points.Expensive gifts such as season tickets to sporting events, use of a vacation condo, gift certificates for high end purchases, golf club memberships and even mineral rights.Seller-financed carry-back loans which are mortgages or loans financed by the seller. Sometimes this is included with a zero down payment incentive. However, keep in mind that this can be a risky option if the seller does not transfer ownership or allow you to have the property recorded to your name. The property may not be transferred until a certain amount of money has been paid into it, so it is possible that the owner could foreclose on the property even if you are paying them every month.

, The best type of property to buy is one that has a good roof and foundation but has been mismanaged and not cared for. Look for properties that have old carpet, peeling paint, cracked tile, dirty grout, leaking faucets, burned light sockets and broken windows. You can pay a handyman to fix these at about $40.00 in labor for each defect.


You will save even more money if you learn to make some of the repairs yourself. Take an adult education class or get training from a friend or family member who has carpentry, plumbing or electrical skills. You can also check Youtube for skills training videos on just about anything.

, These people are desperate to sell for reasons such as divorce, bankruptcy, death, an out-of-town new job, poor condition of the property, behind on payments, etc. They will be more open to sell below the market value or provide a price reduction to account for repairs that are needed. Your local real estate broker can help provide information on who might be in this situation.

, You can search the county site for properties that have non-owner occupied homes. These may be good sources of inventory to check out. You can also drive through neighborhoods to find vacant properties. Or, you can ask your realtor to provide a list of all vacant properties.

Websites that offer “for sale by owner” listings and auction sites can be good places to check.

Ensure the property will appraise close to the price being offered.,
Ensure that the property will appraise or sell for more than you paid.,
Consider Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).,
Be aware of the risks.",How to Invest in Cash Incentive Real Estate3," Your lender will do its own appraisal of the property and if an appraisal is not high enough, the investor can opt to put in a higher down payment. It will cost the same amount whether you hire your own private appraiser or the bank does its own appraisal, but it is not necessary to do both.

, Before you make your repairs and updates to increase the equity, check the details of local real estate ads that are similar in size and location to your property, known as ""comps."" Evaluate what they are selling for and how many bedrooms and bathrooms there are, square footage, and if the kitchen and bathrooms have been updated.


This information will help you decide where to invest your money in updating your property. For example, if just about every property in the price range you expect for your property has an updated kitchen, you know you will have to do the same.
A real estate broker can provide this information and advise you on what repairs and updates you will need to make. Your realtor can also provide comps and advise you on resale value after repairs have been made.

, These are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate. They invest in a variety of commercial as well as residential properties and shares are bought and sold like a stock. The value of your investment increases when the value of the property goes up, and for properties that are leased by tenants, you get cash flow from the rent payments., Like any investment, investing in real estate is not risk-free. It is important to consider the potential risks before you invest in real estate. For example, you might find that a certain property is not worth the costs of maintaining it, or an unexpected disaster could strike and destroy the property. Take some time to consider the risks before you purchase a property."

Understand the meaning of real estate investment trust (REIT).,
Choose a type of REIT in which to invest.,
Purchase shares in an REIT.",How to Get Started in Real Estate Investing2,"  REITs are companies that own or manage commercial real estate.  They allow individuals to profit from real estate income without having to purchase commercial real estate.,  REITs are available in a number of different industries.  REITs in each industry have their own way of earning income from the real estate.  When choosing a type of REIT, evaluate the strength of the overall economy and how that industry is performing.Retail REITs include shopping malls and freestanding stores.  They make money from the rent they charge to tenants.  Choose to invest in retail REITs when the retail industry is strong and sales are high.  

 Residential REITs own multi-family apartment buildings.  They also make money from charging rent to tenants.  Residential REITs are most profitable in large urban areas where home prices re so high that many people are forced to rent.  This drives rent prices up and increases profitability for the REIT.  Job growth in the area affects the profitability of a residential REIT, as well as things like vacancy rate, number of building permits issued, and if there is rent control. 

 Healthcare REITs invest in hospitals, nursing homes, medical centers and retirement homes.  These are becoming more profitable as people are starting to live longer and need more of these services.  They make money from the healthcare system.  

 Office REITs own office buildings.  Their income comes from long-term leases in the office buildings.  Consider the state of the economy and the unemployment rate before investing in an office REIT.  Also, evaluate the economic status of the area where the REIT is.  Some cities are economically depressed, while others are experiencing economic growth.

 Mortgage REITs invest in mortgages and mortgage backed securities instead of in property.  


,  Contact a broker or financial planner to find the right REIT investment for you.  REIT investments can be purchased through a variety of different avenues.  Some are publicly traded on a stock exchange.  Others are not listed or are privately traded.  Another option is to purchase shares in an REIT mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF).Many REITs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and listed on major stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Public non-listed and private REITs are registered with the SEC, but they are not listed on a stock exchange.If you don’t want to worry about choosing a specific REIT in which to invest, choose to purchase shares in an REIT mutual fund or exchange traded fund.  These are available from investment companies such as Vanguard, Fidelity or JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The investment company researches the real estate market and builds a portfolio that will earn the highest return."

Understand the meaning of private money lending.,
Identify borrowers.,
Mitigate risk.,
Generate the proper loan documents.",How to Get Started in Real Estate Investing3,"  Private money lending means lending your own money to another investor or to a professionally-managed real estate fund.  This might appeal to you if you have already made some money with your other real estate investments, and you are looking for a way to re-invest some of those funds.  As a private money lender, you act as an alternative to a bank or other financial institution.  The loans you make are secured by real estate.Investors like to work with private money lenders because they can get money quickly without the strict regulations imposed by banks.  Also, the process is generally very transparent.

 Private money lenders – often called hard-money lenders – charge higher rates than banks and expect to be repaid in less time, usually around 5 years. They’re meant for investors who tend to flip properties rather than rent, unless you sell before the mortgage is due. However, they often take on higher-risk loans that a bank wouldn’t authorize, such as loans for properties the person plans to rehab and then sell or rent. 


,  Private money lending is becoming a significant source of financing in the real estate industry.  As banks and other lending institutions impose more strict regulations, investors are turning more frequently to private money lenders to get money quickly.  Borrowers come from different sectors in the real estate industry.People looking to flip houses, for instance, often seek these types of loans because the current condition of the property is not relevant. In these cases, will need to know the current value of the property and the expected value after it is rehabbed. Make sure you get a valuation from a licensed Realtor or an appraiser.

 Builders, developers and commercial investors turn to private money lenders to fund their development projects.  Banks tend to shy away from these kinds of speculative investments.


,  Evaluate potential loans to see whether they are going to be profitable investments.  Consider several factors when deciding whether or not to pursue an opportunity.  Failure to carefully weigh the risks against the potential profits can result in loss of capital.Most private money loans are between 60 and 70% of the market value of the property.  The ratio of the loan to the market value of the property is known as the loan-to-value ratio.

 In addition to evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower, research their equity.  Find out if they have enough equity in other properties to cover emergencies or unforeseen expenses.  

 Wherever possible, structure the loan so that you are in the first lien position.  This means that you are the first creditor to receive remuneration in the event of a default.  You can secure this lien priority if you offer a higher loan-to-value ratio. 


,  The paperwork involved in a private money loan is similar to that of a typical loan from a bank.  The borrower must sign a promissory note, which is a promise to repay the loan.  In addition, the borrower must put up collateral for the loan in the form of a mortgage.  Private money loans for residential real estate often require third-party appraisals, an in-person property inspection, and a geology report, among other things. Check with your lender to determine their requirements. You might also need the following documents:A letter of intent (LOI) outlines the agreement.

 A purchase and sale agreement state the final price and the terms of the purchase.

 A preliminary title report lists the history of the property’s ownership; title insurance is also required.  

 Proof of funds is a bank statement or other document produced by the borrower to ensure they have the funds available to repay the loan.

 A personal guarantee from the borrower states which assets the borrower can liquidate if the loan can’t be repaid.

 A deed of trust or mortgage pledges property to secure the loan.  

 An environmental indemnity agreement is an agreement by which the borrower agrees to compensate you for any losses from environmental contamination of the property.

, Your quitclaim deed should also contain the date of the transfer and the amount paid. Even if you paid no money for the land, the law usually requires that at least a dollar be listed.

For example, your quitclaim deed might read: “For full and valuable consideration in the sum of One and no/100 Dollars, Kristen T. Jones, an adult resident of Big County, Michigan on this the 3rd day of June, 2017, does hereby bargain, sell, release, remise, quit claim and convey unto Michael T. Jones, an adult resident of Big County, Michigan, all right, title, and interest in and to the following described real estate….”, This will be on the current deed, which you can find at the county land records office. Some quitclaim deeds will require a parcel number or the metes and bounds description, or both.You may also need to identify the county and state where the land is located.Double check the legal description of property and confirm you have entered it properly.If you make a mistake, then there could be a boundary dispute.

, Generally, the grantor must sign. However, some states also require that the grantee and witnesses sign the quitclaim deed. Include signature lines and lines for the date., Any template or form should have a notary block already typed onto it.If you’re typing up your own form, then find an appropriate block online and insert it at the bottom of the page. Include a line for the notary to sign., Take personal identification, such as a valid state-issued ID or passport. You will probably need to pay a small fee to have the quitclaim deed notarized.

, Depending on your location, you might need to complete other forms before filing the deed. Ask the clerk at the land records office for all forms. For example, in California, you must fill out a Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR). You can get this form from the Recorder of Deeds office., Take the completed deed to the Recorder of Deeds in the county where the land is located. You’ll have to pay a small fee to record, usually less than $100.


A deed is valid even if not recorded. However, recording the deed gives the public notice of the new owner of the property, and for that reason you should record it as soon as possible., The land records office might send a copy to the grantee, but you should go ahead and send it as well. Store your copy in a safe place with your other important papers.

Identify types of closing costs.,
Use a closing costs calculator.,
Talk to your real estate agent.,
Ask for a seller credit.,
Wrap the costs into the loan.,
Look into discount programs.,
Get a certified check or a cashier’s check.",How to Pay for Closing Costs," Closing costs are fees that you must pay in order to purchase real estate. These fees are in excess of the purchase price set by the seller. What fees you must pay will depend on the type of loan that you get. For example, the Federal Housing Authority allows the following closing costs to be charged to the buyer when taking out an FHA loan:lender’s origination fee
deposit verification fees
home inspection fees (up to $200)
attorney’s fees
fees for an appraisal and inspection
a credit report
a property survey
the costs of preparing the documents
government recording charges and transfer taxes;
, You can estimate your closing costs by using one of the many calculators on the Internet. The Bank of America calculator asks that you enter the following information:your zip code
the purchase price
down payment (as a percentage of the purchase price)
how long the loan term is (15/20/30 years)
the type of loan (whether fixed rate or an adjustable rate mortgage)

, If you have questions about closing costs, you should talk to your real estate agent. Your agent may also have tips for lowering your closing costs.


For example, you should probably try to close at the end of the month. If you close earlier in the month, then you will have to pay per diem interest on the remaining days in the month., Sellers can contribute up to six percent of the sales price. This is a “credit” which the seller can deduct as a tax expense.You can have your realtor ask the sellers if they are willing to extend the credit to cover the closing costs.


Whether you are successful will largely depend on whether the seller has multiple bids on the property. In a hot real estate market, you probably will not be successful.

, Another way to pay the closing costs is to take out a slightly larger loan so that you can cover the costs. The lender will probably charge you more if you choose to wrap the closing costs into the loan, but it may be your only option.Not every lender will allow you to roll in your closing costs with the loan. You should call your lender and ask.

, There are many programs that exist for certain groups which help with closing costs. For example, programs exist for union members or for bank members. Look into whether or not your bank offers a “loyalty program.” These programs can offer reduced origination fees for certain customers.You should contact your bank or union to ask if any program is available for you.

, If you can’t get the seller to give you credit or can’t get the costs wrapped into a loan, then you need to pay by check. Borrow the money from relatives if you need to. You can’t close on the property without paying for closing costs.


Typically, you cannot pay with a personal check. Instead you will need a cashier’s or certified check.To get a certified check, you need to go to your bank and ask the teller for one. The teller will then make sure that the amount of the check is made unavailable to you. For example, if you have $5,000 in your checking account and get a $4,000 certified check, then you will only have access to $1,000. A certified check, therefore, provides assurance to the title company that the money is in your account.You can get a cashier’s check from the bank as well. With a cashier’s check, the bank moves the money out of your account and into the bank’s own account. Then the teller will draw a check from the bank’s account."

Fix up your home.,

Don’t disclose your motivations to buyers.,
Uncover the buyer’s motivations.,

Stay on your guard.,
Start with a fair price.,
Use silence strategically.,
Focus on the main issues before the details.,
Remember to negotiate the other parts of the agreement.,
Compromise a little.,
Hire a lawyer to look over your agreement.,
Document the sale thoroughly.",How to Negotiate a Purchase and Sale Agreement1," Often, buyers will point to flaws in your home as a reason to negotiate the price down. You can try to prevent this by fixing your home up as best as you can before showing it to anybody.Look at the appliances that you are leaving with the home, such as refrigerators, stoves, etc. Are they old? Do they need to be replaced? The buyer might reduce the amount offered to account for having to replace these items.
If possible, you could replace them yourself. You might be able to get a good deal on new appliances. You should shop around and look for special offers.;
, You want to be confident in the amount that you are asking for your home. You should get an appraisal done. You can find an appraiser by looking in your phone book or by using the “Find an Appraiser” search at the Appraisal Institute website.If your housing market is hot right now, then you should feel comfortable pricing a little above the appraisal amount.
However, if your market is cooler, then you can price a little under the appraisal., A motivated seller is more likely to lower their price in order to sell the home. If you let buyers know that you are motivated, then you are giving them important information. They know that they can be more aggressive trying to get the price lowered because you are anxious to sell.


Try to play it cool. If a buyer or agent asks why you are selling, come up with something neutral, like “We’re looking to buy a bigger home.”Don’t say, “My husband has a new job across the country and we leave in three weeks.” That type of explanation signals that you are anxious to sell.

, At the same time that you hide your real motivations, you should try to discover the buyer’s.If they are eager to move, then you can be more aggressive with your price.

, One technique buyers use to negotiate is to make an offer and then claim a third party needs to review the house or the deal before signing the agreement. This third party then tries to negotiate down the price.This tactic works because the seller is excited at the prospect of making a sale. When the third party starts complaining about the price, the seller is so emotionally invested in making the sale come off that they start lowering the price so that the buyer doesn’t walk away.
You can avoid this tactic by making sure that all relevant parties are present before you begin negotiating.
Before you begin throwing numbers around, ask if there is anyone else who needs to see the house or needs to be involved in the negotiation. Wait until they are present to negotiate.

, Some buyers might throw out a number just to catch you off guard.This technique is used to try and figure out how motivated you are to sell your home. If this happens, then don’t show any emotion.


You could say, “I’ll consider any offer in writing” and leave it at that.

, The best way to make negotiations go smoothly is to have a fair starting price.Look at your appraisal or market research and price accordingly.


A fair price should warrant a fair counter-offer. If the counter-offer is ridiculously low, then look to see what reasoning is offered for such a low price.
It is usually better to walk away from someone who makes a very low initial offer than to argue with them that your home is worth more than they are offering.

, After stating your price, sit back and wait for a response. Fight the instinct to fill the silence by immediately justifying your price or immediately lowering it.The longer you are silent, the more uncomfortable the buyer and his or her agent will be. They will probably try to fill the void by immediately justifying their counteroffer.

, As you negotiate, try not to get sidetracked on minor issues such as how old the refrigerator is. You might not think the refrigerator is old because you replaced it last year. Remember that there is no reason to get into an argument about the refrigerator when big issues (like price) remain to be negotiated.


Once you focus on the main issues, then the details can be resolved much easier.Always try to maintain a “big picture” focus. Don’t get sidetracked.

, The purchase price is only one part of a purchase and sale agreement. Remember to negotiate the rest of the transaction. Keep track of who agrees to pay for what, because it impacts how much you will make on the sale. For example, someone will have to pay for the following:


title insurance
title search
survey
inspection
taxes
recording fees and other closing costs

, You might hold the upper-hand in negotiations. For example, you might uncover that the buyer is very motivated to buy. You use this information to your advantage to get the highest price possible. However, it is important to make sure that each side leaves the bargaining a little bit happy. This means compromising even if you don’t have to.


Nobody wants to feel that they have been taken advantage of. If you try to win every little point with the buyer, then he or she might get turned off and walk away from the deal.Make concessions on things that are relatively cheap but important to the buyer. For example, the buyer probably wants a home inspection done. You could volunteer to pay for the inspection.

, You might end up using a standard, printed purchase and sale agreement. However, you should have a lawyer look it over before signing so that you can make sure that the agreement is in your best interest.A real estate lawyer can also help you understand the tax consequences of your sale.
To find a real estate lawyer, see Select a Real Estate Attorney for a Closing.

, Some people don’t stop negotiating, even after you think you have reached a deal. They constantly raise issues and try to nibble the price down a little lower. You can avoid this situation by thoroughly documenting the sale.In particular, be sure to spell out in your purchase and sale agreement what fixtures are coming with the property and what repairs (if any) you are making. If you aren’t making repairs, then state that explicitly.
Tell the buyer to put their complaints in writing. Any written request to alter the purchaser and sale agreement can be treated as a counteroffer, which you don’t have to accept.

Anticipate sales costs.",How to Get Rich by Buying and Flipping Real Estate," Flipping properties is not usually a part-time gig. Searching for, renovating, and then selling properties require a lot of scheduling and working during the workweek to accomplish. If you can't make flipping a full-time job, you are probably not ready for it., The best flippers are able to complete basic renovation tasks, like fixing holes in walls or replacing a toilet, themselves. You will save a lot of money by not waiting on others to complete these tasks for you. In addition, there are some circumstances where things need to be fixed immediately, so not having to wait on others can be a valuable asset. Saving money in this way can only help your bottom line. In some cases, it may mean the difference between making a sale and having to wait for another buyer. Consider your own ability to perform these tasks before deciding if property flipping is right for you., Flipping real estate requires that you buy the property first and then pay your own way to renovate it, so you'll need the financing to do so. Banks are generally not willing to make unsecured loans for this purpose, so you'll need savings, collateral, or both to afford each flip project. If you have enough in savings, use that, but if not, you'll need to use a collateralized loan like a second mortgage or home equity line of credit (HELOC). Remember that you'll also need money to renovate and hold the property until sale in addition to the sale price of the property.


HELOCs and second mortgages carry the risk that you will lose your home if you default on the loan., You will need to know the real estate market very well to be a successful flipper. Not only will you need the skill to identify bargain properties, but you will also need to know when to buy and sell, and where to do so, so that you get the most return on your money in the smallest amount of time. Otherwise, you will be stuck with a loss from the sale or from holding the property for too long. Gain a deep knowledge of the real estate market in your area by studying local real estate listing, working in the industry, or by consulting with local real estate experts., You can look for cheap real estate in your local newspaper, through online listings, or by searching out delinquent mortgages online.The key to flipping real estate is finding a decent, repairable house at a low enough price to be worth your time, effort, and money.Common sources of cheap real estate include HUD foreclosures, regular foreclosure sales, and short sales. You can also try searching for death notices and divorce settlements, as these tend to precede quick housing sales., In addition to neighborhood research that will determine the average market value of area homes, it's also important to know about the area itself. You'll want to look at community factors like the quality of schools in the area, access to public transportation (if relevant to your community), and other aspects that will determine whether that property will be appealing to, say, a young family with kids versus a retired couple looking to settle down.The neighborhood helps set the market for your potential home, and you'll want to know whether the area already has rising prices, is in a transitional phase, or has relatively low prices. You can determine this by asking locals or talking to a real estate agent who knows the neighborhood.

, Before you finalize the purchase, you'll want to take a look around and have a contractor and/or building inspector come with you. A contractor can give you an estimate on how much the repairs and renovations will cost.A building inspector will know whether costly work like foundation repairs may be necessary, as these kinds of repairs can get incredibly expensive and will easily put you over your budget.Many properties listed at auctions are sold as ""sight-unseen,"" meaning you won't get to tour the property. These investments can be exceptionally risky, so you may want to avoid scenarios in which you cannot assess the property in person.
Find contractors and inspectors by searching online, or talk to someone who works in real estate. They may know a reliable contractor or inspector who does good work and will give you an honest appraisal.
Ask the inspector about the state of the property's major systems (electrical system, plumbing system, foundation and roof condition, etc.). These may be the most costly elements to repair, so it's best to find out in advance whether or not these major systems are in good shape.Ask the contractor what the total investment looks like. This will help give you a decent idea of what kind of repairs you would need if you purchased that home., Before you purchase any property, it's important to know your budget and be aware of the anticipated costs.To do this, you'll need to evaluate the property to assess how extensive the repairs will be. Then work backwards to compare the after-repair value (ARV) of that property with the estimated costs and repairs you'll need to put in.Search online or talk to a local realtor to learn the market value of other homes in the neighborhood you're thinking of buying in. This will give you an idea of the ARV, which will help you decide whether or not your investment will pay off.You can use an online remodeling calculator like the one at http://www.remodelingcalculator.org/. This tool will ask you for some basic information like the dimensions of the house and the extent of renovations you're willing to make, then give you a very rough estimate., In addition to the costs of equipment, labor, and, of course, the property itself, there are numerous other costs to factor in as you decide on a property. The costs associated with owning a property that you haven't sold are generally referred to as carrying costs. These may include property taxes, condo or association fees, insurance, and utilities like electric, gas, and water services. You'll also have to pay a realtor for his or her services, which can average around five to ten percent of the sale price of that property.Remember that the longer you hold a piece of property without successfully flipping it, the more your carrying costs will add up.Not all homes sell right away. Even an attractive home in a hot area may be on the market for a while, which can add up costs very quickly. You may want to have a backup plan, including renting the property or living there yourself, just in case the sale doesn't go through. Some real estate experts advise only going through with a purchase if you are willing/able to hold onto the home and live in it or rent it out for at least five years, in case selling it doesn't go as planned., This can be calculated by starting with the expected retail price after purchasing and remodeling. Then, add in all closing costs. Find your maximum offer price by taking this amount and then subtracting the costs of remodeling, interest on loans, and desired profit. This figure represents the most you would be willing to pay for property and can be used in negotiations.

, In addition to all the other costs involved in buying, rehabbing, and selling a home, you'll have to also consider the financing costs. Will you need to take out a loan to complete the purchase? If so, you'll have to shop around to find the best interest rate on a home loan.If you find a good loan offer or have secured enough capital to make the purchase, and if everything else checks out and fits within your budget, then you're ready to make an offer to that property's real estate agent.

, Your first step should be determining how much a remodeled kitchen would add to the sales price. If the remodel costs exceed the benefit, the renovation should not be done. Knowing how much value will be added can be deduced from studying other, similar homes in the area with or without remodeled kitchens and their recent sale prices.

, You can radically revamp a kitchen without going broke if you plan carefully and work with the kitchen you've purchased. The easiest way to maximize kitchen efficiency (and save your budget) is to remodel without changing the location of plumbing and gas lines. That way, you can change the look and feel of the kitchen without radically altering the layout., Wide walkways make a kitchen feel accessible and easy to work in. If you're planning a total kitchen revamp, plan your layout to accommodate for walking space and room for residents to cook.Paths throughout the main body of the kitchen should be at least 36 inches wide.Paths that pass the stove and counter should be 42 inches wide to accommodate one cook, or 48 inches wide to accommodate two cooks., Appliances and cabinets in corners can be tricky. You have to accommodate clearance for doors to swing open and shut, which can leave the corners of the kitchen feeling cluttered and busy. For a smooth, open kitchen, plan for adequate space to swing cabinet doors open, and keep appliances away from the corners entirely.Make sure that a cabinet door on one side of the corner will not slam into a cabinet door on the other side of the corner. This can generally be avoided by ensuring that cabinet doors open in the same direction and are properly spaced apart (depending on the size and clearance of each door)., Tiles make a great backsplash surface on the walls above/behind counter space and stove tops. You can customize your tiles with colors, patterns, and even materials.


Ceramic tiles are easy to clean and can withstand moisture and heat, but they tend to be more expensive than some other tiling options.Subway tiles tend to match easily with any kitchen style, and are often cheaper than other tiling options.Stainless steel makes an elegant backsplash material that's very easy to clean. It makes any kitchen look sleek and modern, but can be very expensive.You should also study renovation and housing publications to determine which backsplash materials are fashionable at the moment. This can help you make the right choice for making your kitchen appear ""current.""

, Islands allow for kitchens to feel more open and functional. An island can house a stove, counters, storage space, eating space, or any combination of the above.


Make sure the island mirrors the kitchen's dimensions. For example, if the kitchen is long and narrow, a long, narrow island will match the room best.If installing a multi-use island, look for an island that has multiple levels/tiers. That way your dining space is separate from where food will be prepared or stored.Cabinets below the island counter make an excellent storage space. You can easily tuck pots and pans or even dry goods under the island to free up counter space.If you're doing your own work and you don't have extensive building experience, you can buy a pre-made kitchen island from a building supply store, or find an old, sturdy wooden cabinet and refinish it. Scrape off old paint and customize the cabinet with a wood stain or paint scheme to match the rest of the kitchen.Or opt for a new, bold color to make the new island stand out., If the existing appliances in the kitchen are old, you may want to consider replacing them. Homebuyers expect the appliance quality to be on par with the quality of the home. Look at similarly-priced homes that have recently sold in the area. Do they have new appliances? If so, you may have difficulty selling the home without them.Appliances may include refrigerators, stove tops, ovens, and microwaves.

, As with kitchen renovations, bathroom renovations can add a significant boost to the home's value. However, this boost will be negated if the cost of the remodel is even greater. Study similar homes sold nearby to assess the amount gained by its having renovated bathrooms. Then, estimate your own renovation costs. If the costs are greater than the gain, reduce the extent of your renovations or abandon the bathroom remodel.

, White walls, counters, and tiles can make the bathroom feel more spacious and clean. It can also make an otherwise plain-looking room appear more elegant and appealing, as well as neutral - which is important, since you want potential buyers to be able to see themselves living there., If the bathroom has at least one window, you can make the room feel brighter and more inviting by making subtle changes to maximize the light. Try hanging side mirrors to reflect the window's natural light and allow for easy grooming., Ceramic tiling is much cheaper than more expensive materials like marble, but can be purchased with patterns that resemble marble. You can choose predominantly white faux-marble ceramic tiles for a clean, elegant look.However, you need to understand buyers' expectation to make right decision about materials. Higher-priced homes will have more discerning buyers who will require marble or stone tile.

, You can choose lower-cost ceramic tiles for the floor, but when it comes to re-tiling the shower or bath stall you may want to opt for a more elegant tile. Marble, though more expensive, can radically transform any shower stall and create a spa-like atmosphere.You also need to consider whether to separate tub and shower or eliminate one of the other. This, again, will depend upon the expectations of your buyers.

, When you paint your house, it's important to use neutral colors. Colors that are too bold, too dark, or too bland may work for one isolated room, but overall the majority of rooms should be a color that's right in the middle of the spectrum. Try a cream, tan, or khaki-colored paint to make the house neutral to the eye., In addition to the kitchen and bathroom, you'll probably need to make some repairs to the rest of the house. Patch up any holes, repaint every room (no matter the room's condition), replace old or worn-out carpeting, and replace light fixtures and cabinet hardware. The goal is to make the house look as close to new as possible, while still staying within your budget.You'll probably want to keep furniture out, but you'll still need to use something to draw a viewer's focus. Try putting a large plant (like a silk, artificial tree or shrub) in the most visible corner of the room.Consider ""staging"" (creating a lived-in look with furniture and decorations) to make the home more attractive.
In rooms that lack natural light, consider putting a free-standing lamp in a corner to brighten the space.
Add little splashes of color by placing brightly-colored accessories to contrast with the room's neutral color. Try arranging red or burgundy hand towels around the house, and leave a vase with red-colored flowers somewhere prominently visible.
Consider showing before and after pictures to highlight just how radical a transformation the house has undergone.

, An unkempt or otherwise messy yard can turn off buyers before they even tour the inside of the house. It's important to keep the yard well-groomed and watered, and to maintain the exterior of the house.Touch up any chipped paint.
Keep the yard looking pristine. You want the entire property to be appealing, not just the interior. If the exterior looks unkempt, many prospective buyers won't even want to see the interior.
Consider professional landscaping to maximize curb appeal.

, It's important not to hold onto a piece of property for too long, as you'll be saddled with taxes and carrying costs. But if you rush to get a flipped house on the market too quickly, you run the risk of it not being at its full potential. You'll need to decide what's right for you and your budget, but the key lies in balancing costs with renovations to make the house as appealing within your budget as possible., If you don't enlist the services of a mortgage broker, you run the risk of wasting a lot of time on unqualified buyers. Hiring a mortgage broker lets you know that anyone who pursues the property will be pre-qualified, which will help cut down on the time your property is on the market.Mortgage brokers act as a middleman to help facilitate transactions. They determine a potential buyer's eligibility for a loan and can also help that buyer find a loan, though mortgage brokers do not directly lend money themselves.Search for mortgage brokers online. You can compare rates and find a broker who will work within your budget by shopping around before you choose a broker.

, An agent will help you get a fair cost for your property and can facilitate all of the sales details. Choosing the right agent will help ensure that your sale goes smoothly and quickly. Even though you'll have to pay for an agent's services, it may pay off to reduce the carrying costs and taxes you'll accrue by keeping your house for an extended length of time.


Get listing presentations from at least three agents. That can help you set the best price for your property and compare the sales abilities of multiple agents.If an agent suggests he or she can get you an exceptionally high price for the property, it may be a red flag. Extremely high sales prices can turn off potential buyers before they even see the property.Look for an agent who works in real estate full time. That way you know that the agent is available to show the property any time of day, which can help maximize your chances of a fast sale.Look for a reasonable commission. Most sales commissions for real estate agents fall between five and seven percent of the sales price, which is split between your selling agent and the buyer's agent. But an exceptionally low commission may push potential buyers away, as the commission may not be worth the buying agent's effort to show the property. Choose a fair commission to ensure that your property attracts your potential buyers' agents., Selling a house can be very expensive. In addition to the costs of repairs and hiring a real estate agent, you'll need to pay closing costs and capital gains taxes. When all is said and done, the total costs associated with selling a home can add up to 10 percent of the property's sale price.Make sure you factor sales costs into your budget. All of your expenses will add up quickly, so it's important to be mindful of how much you're spending through every step of the house-flipping process.

Research sales of comparable homes.,
Know what you can afford.,
Try to uncover the seller’s motivation.,
Make a realistic first offer.,
Hide your enthusiasm.,
Make the time limit for acceptance short.,
Ask for concessions to close the deal.,
Be prepared to walk.,
Negotiate everything before drafting the agreement.,
Get a lawyer to coach you.",How to Negotiate a Purchase and Sale Agreement2," You should expect the seller to know how much comparable homes have sold for in the neighborhood. Likewise, you need to be prepared with this information as well.You can do this research on the Internet. Visit a website such as Trulia to research sales in your zip code. You can find out how much the home sold for. Remember not to go too far back in time since the market changes quickly. Only look at sales within the past three months.It may be difficult to define a “comparable” home since no two homes are exactly alike. However, you should compare square footage, the number of bedrooms and baths, as well as age.

, You can’t negotiate effectively if you don’t know the maximum amount you can afford to pay.Before going into negotiations, you should sit down and calculate how much you can spend on a new house.


Remember to calculate all of your monthly living expenses, such as car loans, credit card balances, student loans, and other non-negotiable obligations.Also try to calculate commuting costs. The farther away from work you are, the more you will spend on gas and maintenance for your car.
You should use one of the many mortgage calculators on the Internet to calculate how much you can spend., Successful negotiation will depend on each side’s willingness to bargain. Accordingly, you should try to figure out how motivated the seller is to sell.If the seller is anxious to sell, then you could get the home for a cheaper price.


Try to ask innocent questions. You could say, “I don’t know why anyone would leave this neighborhood” and wait for the seller to tell you why they are moving.
Another strategy is to ask bluntly whether they are anxious to sell and then gauge their reaction. Not everyone is a good actor and some people might signal by nervous laughter that they are anxious to sell.

, You want to show the seller that you are serious about the property. This means making a serious first offer. Don’t offer something ridiculously low, which will only insult the seller.As a baseline for your offer, use your market research to set an initial price you think is fair for the property. Then deduct from this price anything functional that needs to be replaced or repaired.
Remember that “functional” doesn’t mean “taste.” If you don’t like the color of the carpet, then you shouldn’t deduct for replacing the carpet because color is an individual preference. However, if the carpet is torn or stained with pet urine, then replacing it would be necessary.
A “functional” problem would be a refrigerator that is old and in need of being replaced. You can deduct $2,000 or so from the price. When you submit your offer, you can include an addendum in which you explain your reasoning., If you appear too enthusiastic, then the seller will know that they can try to hold out to increase the amount you will pay. You want to come across as professional and driven by facts and data., If you make an offer, then give the seller a short time limit for acceptance—24 hours or less. If you give a longer period of time, then you are inviting other competing offers. You don’t want the seller’s agent to find someone else to make a competing offer., It might be difficult to get a seller to come down off their price because they are emotionally invested in it. A seller who believes their home is worth $250,000 might be unwilling to go down to $240,000 to close the deal. If this is the case, get creative. You can try to sweeten the deal by asking for concessions which will lower the overall price you pay.


For example, ask that certain repairs be made to the home. Getting the seller to pay for the repairs will ultimately reduce the amount you have to spend on the home.
Alternately, you could ask that the seller cover some of the closing costs.This also would reduce the total amount you spend on the house.

, Before going into negotiations, you should have a walkaway point. This is the maximum you would be willing to pay for the property. To negotiate successfully, you need to be prepared to walk away if the seller can’t meet your walkaway point.


There are plenty of homes on the market, even when the market is tight. It is very common to find a home one week later., A purchase and sale agreement contains more than just the purchase price and down payment. You also should settle on a closing date that works for you. As a buyer, you can also negotiate the following:Whether the sale is contingent on an inspection. You want to understand the condition of the home and surrounding land before closing on the sale. For this reason, you should probably make the sale contingent on having an inspection done. You can negotiate as to who should pay for the inspection.
What happens if the inspection is negative. The home will probably have flaws. You should understand what your options are. For example, you can get a provision included in the purchase and sale agreement giving you the right to walk away from the purchase. Alternately, you could negotiate with the seller to fix the problem.
Whether the sale is contingent on you selling your home or getting financing.
Who pays taxes. You probably don’t want to pay all of the tax bill, unless you bought the property on January 1. Accordingly, you can negotiate to prorate the taxes with the seller. Explain in your purchase and sale agreement how taxes will be prorated.

, A qualified lawyer can guide you through the negotiation and closing process. You don’t need to hire the lawyer to actually handle the negotiations for you. Instead, you can find a lawyer who will offer advice and who can look over the purchase and sale agreement to make sure that it protects your interests.


To find a qualified attorney, contact your state or local bar association and ask for a referral."

Spend some time thinking through the various costs you'll incur and make sure you're able to handle them before you consider renting your home.Calculate the up-front costs of getting the house up to code and installing any updates you think it needs. New carpeting, paint, appliances, and so on should be factored in.
Calculate the costs of keeping the house in good working order when tenants move in. Calculate how much plumbing repairs, landscaping costs, and general upkeep is going to cost.
Think ahead to expensive problems you might encounter. At some point you might need to buy a new refrigerator or oven, replace the roof, replace carpeting, and so on.
Decide whether you'll be able to handle a few months of missed rent, which most landlords encounter from time to time.;
, Being a landlord can be pretty time intensive. You'll need to screen tenants, negotiate a rent price, facilitate a lease signing, collect rent, do home repairs, and be the point person whenever problems arise. If you want to rent your house but don't want all the responsibilities, hire a property manager to take care of all the nitty gritty parts of the job for you.


Property managers usually charge 50% of the first month's rent when new tenants move in, and 10% of each month's rent after that, so you'll need to figure out if you can afford one.You can also hire out some of the duties individually. For example, if you're comfortable screening tenants and handling leases, but you don't want to have to make plumbing repairs when the toilet breaks or mow the lawn, you can hire contractors to do these jobs for you.

, Factoring in the cost of your mortgage, the cost of keeping the house in shape and other foreseeable expenses, and the property manager's fee (if you're using one), figure out how much rent you'll need to charge to at least break even. Then conduct some market research to find out how much tenants will be willing to pay to rent your house. If you'll be able to make a decent profit, you're in good shape.Check sites like Craigslist.org to determine what people are paying for houses of similar size in your neighborhood. The rent you charge should be in the same ballpark.
Call other landlords, posing as a tenant, and ask questions about their properties to compare them to your own. You'll be able to find out what sorts of features might affect how much rent you can charge., Start thinking of your rental house as a small business. It's a good idea to keep rental-related finances separate from your personal finances. Use Quickbooks or another financial management system to record your expenses and keep track of payments.


If you don't want to invest in financial management software, set up a spreadsheet to track your expenses and payments.
Consider opening a bank account that you'll use for the sole purpose of managing rental finances.

, You can start by downloading a free lease agreement online or buying one from USLegalforms.comMake sure the lease you choose meets the requirements of the state where you live. Working from a standard lease is a good way to make sure your lease contains all the necessary information. From there, you can customize it to fit your needs. Have a lawyer look it over to make sure it's airtight and legal. The lease should cover these bases:


The full names of the tenants.
The address of your rental home.
The length of the lease, whether it's a year, month-to-month, or something in between. A year lease helps reduce turnover, while a month-to-month lease gives you greater flexibility.
The amount of rent you're charging, as well as the security deposit amount.
A description of what the penalty will be when rent is late.
A description of the condition of the house at the time when tenants move in.
Individual requirements regarding utilities, trash, smoking, pets, altering the house, and so on.

, Every state has landlord/tenant laws that dictate what rights landlords and tenants each hold. The laws address safety issues in the rental, who is responsible for paying for what, what happens when tenants fail to pay rent on time, and what circumstances give you the right to evict a tenant. Look up your state's laws on the matter and make sure you're comfortable following policies that apply to you.


Many states tend to favor tenants over landlords when it comes to disputes. In some cases it can be very difficult to evict a tenant, even when the tenant fails to pay rent. Get familiar with the steps you'd have to take if a problematic situation were to arise.
Make sure you know what responsibilities you have in terms of paying for utilities, garbage, and other bills.

, Before you rent your house, go through it room by room and determine what needs to be fixed. Make a list of essential repairs that need to be made in order for the house to be safe and functional. Making sure the house is up to code before tenants move in will be a good way to start your landlord/tenant relationship.


Make sure the plumbing is working properly. The toilets should all flush without a problem, the showers and sinks shouldn't be backed up, and so on.Check to see if the electrical outlets and light switches are working properly. Replace light bulbs that need replacing.
Make sure any staircases are safe to walk up and down. If there's a broken step, you'll need to fix it. Install a banister if you don't already have one next to steep stairways.
Fix broken doorknobs and other odds and ends so that the house is functional.
If you're offering use of large appliances like a washer and dryer, refrigerator, or dishwasher, make sure they're in working order.
The roof, gutters, and other outside features should also be in good repair.

, You'll be able to charge more rent if you provide some newer features that make the house more comfortable and durable. Look around to assess what upgrades might make a big difference at a low cost to you. Your house might already be in tip top shape, in which case you don't need to worry about installing upgrades.


How does the flooring and carpeting look? It might be worthwhile to get a sturdy new flooring or carpeting that can stand up to years of rotating tenants.
Assess the kitchen and decide whether to install new countertops or cabinets.
You might want to renovate the bathrooms if it has been awhile since they've been updated.
Decide whether the walls and ceilings could use a coat of fresh paint.
A little landscaping around the house's exterior also increases the value of the rental.

, While you want to make sure the house is comfortable and nice looking, it's not necessary to go all out with fancy light fixtures, cabinetry, new appliances, and so on. Rental houses tend to endure a lot of wear and tear, so it's not a good use of your money to install expensive items.


If you do decide to install new fixtures, choose sturdy, mid-range items instead of high-priced items made from expensive materials.
You might be able to get a good deal on fancy items at a salvage store. If you want to add interesting details like stained glass windows or a claw-foot tub to your home, look for used items instead of buying them new.

, Before you begin showing the house, empty it out of all of your possessions (unless you're renting your house furnished). Clean it from top to bottom so that it looks presentable when people come to view it. Even if your house has older features, cleaning everything thoroughly will help it seem like a comfortable place to live.


Have the carpets deep-cleaned and wax the floors.The bathrooms and kitchen should be sparkling. Get rid of mold spots, dust in the corners, etc.
Wash the windows both inside and out.
Sweep away leaves and other debris outside. Mow the lawn and trim the bushes.

, Write a description of your house that you'll use to advertise that it's for rent. You can post the ad on Craigslist.org, the classifieds section in your local newspaper, and other places where people might be looking for houses to rent. You can also put a ""For Rent"" sign in the window or yard of your property. You can even use innovative services like Register Signs that allow you to syndicate your property to several popular rental websites plus allow people to text your property sign and give instant information to their mobile phone. Your ad should include the following information:


The number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and a quick description of any enticing features.
A description of the neighborhood and nearby amenities.
A note on whether or not pets are allowed.
The price of rent.
The date the house is available to rent.
Contact information.
Make sure you have several pictures of each room, this helps your listing stand out and bring better informed renters to your showing.
Any other information you want to include about your rental.

, You'll probably receive loads of emails and phone calls in response to your ad. You can set up an ""open house"" date and have them all come by at once, or meet with the potential tenants individually. Everyone has a different strategy for interviewing and choosing tenants. Here are a few ideas you might want to consider to help you narrow down the pool of candidates:


Have them fill out a rental application. At minimum, it should ask for their names, addresses, income, employer name and contact information, and three references. You can automatically eliminate people whose gross monthly income is less than about 3 times the monthly rent, as well as those who are unemployed.
It's illegal to treat people differently based on factors like race and sex. Have a screening policy based on income, credit and meeting other general requirements, and apply it equally to all people.
Don't trust your gut and accept someone before conducting credit and reference checks. Many people make great first impressions but have trouble paying their rent.

, Narrow your list down to a few top candidates and ask for a processing fee of $25 - $35 to run a credit check to see whether they meet your requirements. Call all of the references your top candidates listed, and ask careful questions regarding their treatment of property and ability to pay rent on time. Finally, choose the person to whom you want to rent your home.


You can conduct a more thorough background check and find out whether the person has a criminal record, etc.
Figure out what you think should disqualify people. For example, if someone was previously evicted, you might not want to rent to them.

, The security deposit is often handed to the landlord upon a verbal agreement to rent the property. It usually amounts to one month's rent, or sometimes the first and last month's rent. When the tenant moves out, it can either be used to pay the last month's rent or be returned upon inspection of the home. Have the new tenant write you a check and make sure it clears before proceeding.

, Set up a time to meet the tenant and sign the lease together. Have two copies of the lease printed out for you both to sign. Go over the provisions in the lease so you can make sure you each understand what is required of you. When both parties are satisfied, sign the lease, and keep one copy each.


You should meet at the rental property to sign the lease, rather than at a different location, so you can give the tenant keys to the house and he or she can make sure they work properly.
If you wish, have the tenant initial next to particulars you want to stress, like your ""no smoking"" policy, to make sure this doesn't become an issue later.

, Tell the tenant how you want to receive rent - by mail, in person, or via another method. Each month, accept the rent and deposit it in you account promptly. If necessary, enforce the penalty you laid out for late rent payments.

, Tell the tenant to text, email or call if something comes up and they need help dealing with it. If it's an emergency situation, be prepared to go to the house and deal with it right away. Otherwise, set up an appointment to come over when it's convenient for both you and the tenant.


Plumbing issues and other issues that could become dangerous if they aren't addressed right away fall into the ""emergency situation"" category.
Remember that you can call a contractor to handle situations outside your realm of expertise.

, If the lease states that you're in charge of lawn maintenance, shoveling snow, and scheduling trash pickups, make sure you take care of your duties in a timely fashion. Keeping up good rapport with your tenants is beneficial to all involved.

, You own the house, but they're considering it home now. Respect that, and don't enter the house without calling first and letting them know you're coming. Never go through your tenants' private possessions.

, The laws regarding when you can evict a tenant vary from state to state. In any case, it's a good idea to get a lawyer involved so you use the correct process and obey the law to a T. Tenant/landlord conflicts can end up being extremely costly, so it's important to do everything you can to choose good tenants in the first place."

",How to Get a Down Payment Grant," Ever since the financial crisis, lenders have tightened lending standards. The days of bad credit, unverified income loans are gone. Before you shop for a home or go to the bank or credit union, try to get your finances in order and be sure your bills are up-to-date. Your credit can have some dings in its history, but it is important that the lender does not see any recent issues that will act as an alarm bell.;
, Picking the right lender for a home loan is important. Ask friends for referrals, check with your bank, local credit unions and search for online lenders as well.

, The loan terms are important, but the size of the down payment, interest rate, term and costs are negotiable. If a lender knows you are not shopping around, they do not have an incentive to give you the best deal.


At a minimum, speak with at least two lenders.
If you are working with a mortgage broker, they can often shop lenders and rates for you. But remember, they are often paid on how profitable the loan is so ask for lower rates and make them compete for your business as well.
You can have your credit report and score pulled once and then use that to shop around. While the credit bureaus are supposed to allow for multiple inquiries for the same reason, a home purchase or auto loan for example. However, it presents fewer potential problems if you provide this information.

, Some lenders do not work with down payment grant and assistance programs. If you plan on pursuing down payment grants, you need to ask the lender if that presents any problems. Lenders often need to facilitate the process, so you need one that is on board.

, It is much easier to search for a house with a pre-approved loan. The amount of the pre-approval also makes sure you show for homes within the right price range.

, Typically, the lender requires a down payment that is a percentage of the purchase or appraised price of the property. It can range from 5% - 20% based on factors including your credit score, location and interest rate as well as the type of loan., These grants are not just for low income buyers, but they are available to buyers earning from 120% - 140% of the median area income. These are no-strings attached grants available from various sources. Banks like Wells Fargo and state organizations both provide access to grants and assistance.

, Banks, credit unions, lenders and real estate agents are a good source for referrals. Also, a simple search for ""down payment grants"" plus your city and state on Google, Bing or another search engine should lead you to the right resources.You will encounter both grant and down payment assistance programs. A grant program is not repaid and the down payment assistance program is typically repaid at some point. There are fewer grant programs available today, but they still may exist in your area. Both programs can make buying your own home possible with a less money out of pocket up front.

, Each organization has different requirements. The Ohio Housing Finance Agency (OHFA) for example requires that you qualify for an OHFA home loan product. This requires you to choose an approved lender, supply paperwork (social security number, W2s, paycheck stubs, checking and savings account statements), and apply with a loan application. Other agencies require that that it is a Federal Housing Authority (FHA) approved loan, that you are a first-time home buyer, disabled or a recent college graduate. One example of a down payment assistance program is California's deferred payment program (CalDAP). Note that some other states have similar programsIt does create junior loan you have to repay, but the requirements are similar to grant programs.


Be a first-time homebuyer.
Occupy the property as their primary residence, non-occupant co-borrowers are not allowed
CalHFA borrowers must complete homebuyer education counseling and obtain a certificate of completion through an eligible homebuyer counseling organization.
Your income must be less than the allowable CHDAP income limits.
CHDAP Income Limits when using an FHA first mortgage
CHDAP Income Limits when using a VA, USDA or Conventional first mortgage
Meet the requirement of the lender and mortgage insurer / guarantor

, Many of the banks have other programs that reduce or eliminate a down payment for a property. The California program above is also not a grant since it creates a junior loan that is eventually repaid. Other organizations do have grants that are not repaid, confirm the type of assistance you could receive.

, The applications all vary but the process is generally simple. A lot of the same information used to apply for the loan is also needed to apply for a grant. You will need to at least show these documents to apply.


Pay stubs
Bank statements
Employment history
Previous tax returns

, The organization and your loan officer should also be able to lend a hand and provide some guidance with the paperwork. The loan officer wants to close your loan since that is part of how they are paid. They can be a great resource to help drive the down payment assistance process.

, In Ohio's you mush qualify for a OHFA loan product. You mush also complete a free home buyer education course offered by any HUD-approved housing counseling agency, or Use OHFA's Streamlined Home buyer Education.

, This number can vary by the granting organization, your income, assets, and other factors. Speak with the representative about the different factors that go into the final amount of the grant. It can help assure you that you are received all available assistance based on the correct information.

, Even if you were pre-approved for the loan, you will have to have the home you select inspected, appraised and approved for the final sale.

, This applies to all home loans and assistance grants. It is important to look at the total cost of the house and loan which includes origination fees, closing costs and the interest rate among others things. Do not be afraid to negotiate these or walk away if the cost is just too high. While you have a lot of time invested, so does the lender. They may work with you to get the deal closed.

, Buying a house is not something to take lightly. Make sure all the loan terms, grants and the house is the right decision for you. The rule of thumb is that any house you sell within five years of buying is a deal you lost money on, so think things through one last time.

, If the house is right and loan terms are fair, it is time to close and move in. The lender should co-ordinate with the grant assistance organization so you should not have to do more than sign paperwork.

So in addition to adding another mortgage to your monthly expenses, you'll also most likely have to come up with a down payment. Hopefully, your sale price will cover these expenses. Regardless, you'll need a large amount of cash on hand and a flexible monthly budget to get started flipping houses.


They are also other expenses, like utilities and taxes, that come into play. When you sell the house, you'll also have to pay capital gains tax on your profit.;
, Successful flippers don't simply buy and sell houses without doing any intermediate work or marketing efforts. Realize that you'll have to put in work and expense to make changes to the house in many cases. In others, you'll want to avoid realtor's fees and try to sell the house yourself, which requires some marketing and leg work. Be sure that you are willing to put in the work to do this right., This is not a weekend hobby, but a full-time job. In most cases, you'll have to schedule maintenance, oversee construction on additions or changes, and deal with other issues that arise with the house. You'll also have to show the house to potential buyers on your own if you don't plan to use a realtor. It would be difficult to schedule all of that around another full-time job., Chances are, you'll make at least a few missteps when getting started flipping houses. These mistakes can cost you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Additionally, accidents may occur that cost you thousands or set your current project back weeks or months. If you're the type of person who can't think and act rationally in these times of stress, house flipping may not be for you.

, If you've already done that, then you already know the process and it's second nature. If you've never purchased a home, then consult with a realtor. There are a few steps involved when purchasing a home that you need to be familiar with. Generally, this process includes placing an offer, getting a mortgage, removing conditions, and taking possession.


You can also skip the initial sale entirely buying your own lots and building your own homes on them to sell. In this process, you can either build the home yourself or hire a builder to do it for you. These two processes are known spec and custom construction, respectively., Talk to realtors about how much volume and home demand they are experiencing. You may also want to search in your local newspaper for housing reports.


The housing market is like the stock market in that it has both ""bull"" and ""bear"" cycles. The housing market can take years and years to switch from one cycle to another. This mean that real estate might either be in ""high demand"" or ""low demand"" at any given time.
If your area is currently experiencing ""low demand"" for homes, it will be much more challenging, or at least less profitable, to flip houses.
If you really want to get started with flipping, but find that your local housing market isn't ripe for it, consider moving to an area with a more active market. Research the hottest markets online. Some areas are currently experiencing dramatic price recoveries and are ready for flip investments., Once you've decided that the time is right to begin a new project, search for the right lot within your budget. There are several ways to go about doing this.


Some people look for distressed properties. These are ones that the seller is ""desperate to sell"", for reasons such as divorce, bankruptcy, death, poor condition of the property, or late on payments. The seller's desire to sell will allow you to negotiate a better price on the land.
Another way is to simply locate the areas of your city or town that are ""new neighborhoods"", where all the new construction is going on. Go there, and drive around. Look for signs placed by builders who want to sell their new home or available open lots.

, Do your research and figure out what house style, size, and specific features are fashionable or commonly sold in your area. Look at new houses being sold and try to emulate their successes. You may have to assemble a team with a designer and architect to get a realistic idea of what you can do with a given lot and budget.Try to plan for homes that sell in the middle to upper range. What that means is the amount where the average family would be able to afford it. Generally that means between about $200,000, and $500,000 depending on your area. You want that price range because these sell the fastest as there is the largest population density looking for these mid-range homes. It could be much less or much more but that's about the average.
In many cases, the home must have three or more bedrooms and at least two full bathrooms.

, Another way to find a house is simply by looking up a list of builders in your area. Call them all up and ask them if they have any ""spec homes"" for sale. That's what a new home with no actual owner is called (other than the builder).


The reason you want to consider finding a brand new home is simple. It’s brand new, there are no renovations needed. It shows way better and you’ll get more people coming to see it than you would an older home. And the margins are bigger. That means new homes command a “premium"". If a person wants to live in a brand new home, they have to pay a higher price tag. Almost like buying a new car off the lot, only that it’s not going to depreciate.
Additionally, the new neighborhoods generally offer more features and amenities such as parks, creeks, walking trails, etc. They’re nicer with more upgrades. Your home is surrounded by nice new homes. All these features combined add up and make it easier to flip your home.

, In time you'll narrow down your search to a few properties. At this point do some research on each builder you are considering to make sure they are reputable and will finish the home according to the standards that they claim, such as granite counter tops, 50 ounce carpet and other specs. Make sure they do quality work and even inspect some of their other homes they've built. If they have no other homes built to show you, then be very careful.


Be sure to use data from the multiple listings service (MLS) to see neighborhood trends and average values for similar houses. This should give you an idea of the market value for the house. Go to http://www.mls.com to use the service.

, Look at the costs of the lot, builder's fees, and construction costs. You'll also have to factor in commissions, property taxes, and insurance, as well as the cost of financing your investment. Total these numbers using figures from your builder and comparable projects. You can then use this total to compare to an estimated sale price to determine whether or not you can make a reasonable profit on the sale of the house., If you know, based on actual MLS comparisons in that area, that you could flip it for at least $25,000 more then, move fast! Immediately make an offer. If it's accepted then you will still give you time to do your research on the builder and the condition of the home.


In the offer, be sure to have multiple ways out of the contract, such as ""subject to financing"". If you have a problem and need to get out and don't include this type of clause, then you won't be able to get out if there is a problem. The most common is simply ""subject to financing by x date"". If you can't make the financing by then ask for an extension on the condition date.

, In order to actually purchase the property and begin or continue construction, you'll have to take out a loan. For flipping houses, you likely have to take out a loan with a high interest rate, due to the inherent risk involved in house flipping. In many cases, this could be as high as a 10 to 12 percent annual rate.Having a good credit history and score can help you get a better rate, but the loan will still be considered risky by many lenders., That means you have to take possession the date of the contract. This is happening as your home is being built. So now you can talk to the builder and choose your features and colors for the house's interior and exterior. If you have no experience with doing this, then find out if the builder has a professional who can consult with you.

, Be sure to monitor the work of the builder as they finish the home according to your specs. You might want to consult other books or experts in finishing the home, especially for your first few products. You'll want to add visible luxury finishes without sacrificing too much of your budget.


Choose ""all neutral colors"" textures, paints, and materials, and finishings that would suit just about any taste. Do not choose bright colors for anything. Remember you are ""flipping"" this home. You're making the interior for ""someone else"". It's not what you like, it's what the general population will like, which is ""neutral tones"" on the inside and out.
If you don't do anything else, make sure the kitchen is perfect. This is the most important room in the house for many buyers. If this is already good, look at the bathrooms next., Get rid of all your junk and any construction materials or equipment lying around. This home is going to be up for sale. That means is has to be ""100% clutter free"". A simple way to understand this is go to any ""show home"" in your area and see how they've done the interior. Your furniture, if you have any at all, doesn't have to be as good or as fancy as they might have in the show home.


Do not leave anything in plain sight. Put everything away in cupboards, closets, drawers, basement and garage. Leaving the main living area looking uncluttered. Do not use too much furniture either. You don't want the rooms to look to busy. Also do not mount too many photos or picture on the walls. You want everything to be pristine. Because your buyer wants a ""new home"" don't make it into a ""used home"" for them. Make it into a ""show home"" for them.

, You can sell it yourself to save money or list it on the MLS with a realtor. The reason you would want to sell through the MLS is that there are thousands of realtors in your area who will see that MLS (multiple listing service) listing and begin showing your home maybe even ""daily"". You'll have tons of realtors competing to sell your home. Compare that to ""just you"" trying to sell it. Yes, you'll give up a commission but that can be factored into the sale price.


List your home competitively within the area. However, when buying the home you should have gotten a deal, and had already anticipated that you could resell it for at least $50,000 more based on actual market conditions and research that you did.
Don't overprice it or it won't sell, and don't underprice it and leave money on the table. But it's better to underprice it and just not be flexible on your asking price during the negotiation, than to overprice it and have nobody come look at it.

, Never, under any circumstances, get into a negotiation where you're trading offers back and forth. If they give you an offer, you must always tell them, ""I'll think about it and get back to you in an hour"". Take some time to think about it. Do not start trading offers back and forth with a buyer without taking at least an hour. One thing you can do when you are with the buyer and they say ""how about this much..."", tell them, ""okay I'll take that offer and I'll go and have a coffee and I'll be back in one hour to let you know"".


This is so important because chances are they have not offered you enough, and now you want to counter the offer. What you can do is take that hour to structure your counter offer. For example, if their offer is almost what you want but not quite, come back and say something like ""okay, I'll accept your offer but I'm not leaving the appliances"". They might be fine with that, and that makes up your $5000 that you would have stood to lose had you gotten into a hasty negotiation.

, The buyer of your home is going to want to be given a time frame to ""remove conditions"". Generally if you have an offer the buyer will be ""serious"" about your home. If they need an extension only give it if there is little to no other activity. But if you're still getting lots of other offers on your home, or perhaps feel like you're not getting as good a deal as you initially thought, then don't extend the condition date, thus making the offer null and void. That will allow you to take your back up offer which might be better and stronger.


Generally though, you want to be accommodating at this point to make the deal go through successfully. So, if they want to bring their family by for the third time, just let them come see it.

, Now that the buyer has removed conditions, you can start to begin looking for a new property to purchase or to try to find another one to flip the same way as you just did. On the day they take possession, you have to be ""out"". Then shortly after they take possession, you will get a big fat paycheck from the profit you made off the sale. That is, unless you port that into the new home you end up buying. It's generally best to leave those proceeds you make in your home.


Don't cash out and go spend the money. It's better to compound the effect and allow your money to go to work for you're in the next purchase than to waste it on shopping and extravagance. Sure, buy yourself a vacation out of the deal for a few grand but let the rest of that profit go to work for you in the next home or another investment where it's making you even more money.

Therefore, you should always have an attorney either help you through the entire contract process or to review the completed contract. Real estate attorneys will be the most knowledgeable on the subject of rent-to-own contracts so you should look for that specialty when conducting your search.


If you know individuals that can give you recommendations and referrals, you should ask them. Referrals are a great way to find a competent attorney so long as you trust the person making them.
If you cannot get help from friends or family, use your state bar's lawyer referral service. In California, for example, you can call the state bar and they will ask you some general questions about your legal issue. After the conversation, the state bar will give you the names and contact information of multiple qualified attorneys in your area.;
, Not every agreement warrants the use of a legally binding contract. The purpose of a contract is in part to protect the individuals entering into it and to provide legal remedies in case of a breach. In the case of rent-to-own agreements, a contract is absolutely needed.


When you rent to own, the property owner rents the home to a renter with an option to have the renter purchase the home at the end of the rental period. This type of agreement can be particularly complex, which is one of the reasons a contract is necessary.
In addition, all contracts for real property are required to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds.The Statute of Frauds are specific state statutes laying out certain contractual requirements. Its purpose is to decrease the likelihood of fraudulent activity by requiring certain types of contracts to be in writing and signed.

, Every legal contract is created with an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutuality. Without these four elements, no contract exists. It is important you recognize these before writing and executing a contract.


An offer is a promise by you or the other party to do something in the future. In the case of a rent-to-own contract, the offer would be to rent the home with the option to purchase it.
Acceptance occurs when the other party accepts the offer. This can be done by signing the contract, saying ""I accept"", or by performing under the contract.
Consideration is the things of value each party gives up in order to enter into the agreement. Here, one party would give up possession (and potentially ownership) to their home and the other party would give money.
Mutuality occurs when you and the other party understand and agree to the basic terms of the agreement., Certain individuals cannot legally enter into contracts. Generally speaking, this includes minors and individuals with mental incapacity. Contracts entered into with improper individuals are either ""void"" or ""voidable."" This determination will depend on the facts of your case and the law applicable to those facts. If a contract is ""void"" it cannot be enforced by either party. It is as if the contract was never entered into. On the other hand, if a contract is ""voidable"", it is valid and one party can be bound by its terms. The unbound party (e.g., the minor) can choose whether to cancel or honor it.If you think the other party is unable to contract, ask questions and don't sign a contract if you have any doubts.


Minors include people under the age of 18. However, if a minor does enter into a contract, it will be considered ""voidable."" The minor can choose whether to honor the contract or cancel it.
Individuals lacking the mental capacity to contract can void, or have voided, the contract they enter into. In most states, a person lacks the requisite mental capacity if they do not understand the meaning and effect of the words making up the contract., Before you start drafting the rent-to-own contract, talk with the other party about their expectations. Doing this will allow you to understand what provisions should be included and which ones can be left out. This is a great time to have these discussions so you do not have to go back later and rewrite the contract.


For example, discuss the terms of the rental agreement, what the option to purchase fee will be, how the purchase will take place, and how disputes will be resolved.

, Every contract, regardless of its subject matter, should start with a preamble. The preamble needs to include the title of the agreement, the date of execution, and the parties involved. You should feel free to include any extra identifying information you feel is necessary (e.g., addresses, business names, and descriptive nouns).


For example, your preamble may state: ""This Rent-To-Own Agreement (""Agreement"") is entered into as of (""Effective Date"") between Ryan James (""Owner"") and Trevor Benjamin (""Renter"" or ""Purchaser""). The property at issue is located at ."", Recitals are optional and provide factual background to the agreement. They will usually lay out each party's understanding of the agreement and why it is being entered into. This section should not include any enforceable duties or obligations.


For example, your recitals may contain a series of 'whereas' sentences that look like this: ""Whereas, Owner wishes to rent his property located at . Whereas, Renter wishes to rent the property located at ."" You would then continue with these factual statements until you are comfortable with the background you laid out., Your contract must include an exchange of promises (i.e., the consideration), and that exchange should be clearly laid out near the top of your contract. This exchange of promises will be laid out further throughout the contract (i.e., when you promise to rent the property or when you promise to pay money to rent the property) but it is important to explicitly state your promises up front. You may promise to do something you are not legally obligated to do (e.g., provide an option to purchase your home) or you may promise not to do something you have the right to do (e.g., sell your home to someone else).This provision is usually relatively standard and needs to include certain language.


For example, your manifestation may state: ""Now, therefore, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows."", You need to define any terms that may be considered ambiguous or confusing in your agreement. If you fail to define these terms, you and the other party may think something means two different things and you may find yourself in a dispute. Be sure you and the other party discuss any terms you want to define and how they should be defined.


In the definitions section, bold each term and follow it up with your definition. Continue this until you have defined every important term., The first body paragraphs of your rent-to-own contract will be the rental provisions. With this type of agreement, you will create a tenancy before the contract turns into a purchase agreement. This section will include a description of your lease and its terms, which will stay in effect for a certain period of time or until the renter exercises the purchase option and buys the home.


Include terms about the duration of the lease. Usually, this will be between one and three years.
Include information about the amount of rent to be paid and how that rent will be allocated to the purchase price (if at all). For example, your contract might state that rent will be owed every month in the amount of $1,200. It may further state that 25% of your monthly rent will be credited to the purchase price you agreed on. If the lease term is three years, the buyer will earn $10,800 toward the purchase price of the home ($1,200 x .25 = $300; $300 x 36 months = $10,800) simply by paying rent. In this instance, the rent charged may be slightly above fair market value because part of it will be going towards the purchase of the home.

You do not need to have any of the rent payment go towards the purchase price if you don't want to. In that case, rent will usually be close to the fair market value in the area., This is the provision that gives the purchaser/renter the option to buy the home at some point in the future. In exchange for this option, the purchaser/renter will usually have to pay an option fee. This option fee will usually be paid up-front or in the form of increased rent. Some contracts give the potential buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase the home. In other contracts, the potential buyer will have the obligation to buy the home at the end of the rental period.


If the provision uses the words ""lease purchase"", without the word ""option"", the renter/purchaser may be required to purchase the home.
If the provision uses the word ""option"", the renter/purchaser will usually choose whether they want to purchase or not. If the renter/purchaser chooses not to purchase the home, the option will simply expire. No part of the option fee is refundable and the owner will get to keep it., Your contract will have to lay out when and how the purchase price of the home will be determined. In some situations, the purchase price will be decided before the contract is signed and it will be included directly in the contract. In other circumstances, you and the other party may choose to determine the purchase price after the lease ends.


If you are the potential purchaser, you may want to lock in the price ahead of time, especially if the housing market is rising.
If you are the owner, you may want to wait and determine the price at some point in the future., Each party will be required to fulfill certain duties laid out in these provisions. In a rent-to-own contract, you may include information about how rent will be paid and allocated, who is responsible for making repairs, and who should inspect the house and get an appraisal.


In maintenance provisions, the potential buyer will usually have the obligation to maintain the property and pay for repairs, property taxes, and insurance.
Just like a normal rental agreement, you need to lay out how rent will be paid, when it will be due, and how it can be delivered. In addition, if a portion of rent will go towards the purchase price, the renter will usually be required to keep that money separate in an escrow account. Make sure you lay out all of these requirements so there are no ambiguities.
Before the contract is signed, most renters/purchasers will want an inspection of the home and an appraisal of its value. This happens because they want to make sure the purchase price of the home is fair and deductions are made if any large repairs have to be made., While most agreements will be executed without problems, disputes can arise. If a dispute does arise, you will want to make sure you have a system in place for resolving them. Usually, you will want to lay out a series of events that will trigger certain dispute resolution processes.


For example, you may start with informal negotiations to try and resolve minor disputes.
If you cannot come to an agreement, your contract may state the need to hire a mediator to get involved.
If mediation doesn't work, you may state that both parties need to agree to non-binding arbitration.
Finally, if all else fails, you may state that a lawsuit can be brought or that binding arbitration take place.

, Boilerplate provisions are general provisions included in almost every contract. They usually set forth how the contract is governed and managed. Examples of these provisions include:Choice of law provisions, which covers which state's laws will govern the contract
Severability clauses, which state that if any other provision is found to be unlawful, the rest of the contract will remain effective
Entire agreement clauses, which states that the agreement is complete and entire and that no other agreement is valid unless it is validly incorporated.
Incorporation clauses, which tell the parties how amendments can be made and validated.

, At the end of the contract, you need to leave space for you and the other party to sign and execute the contract. It should include blank lines for each party and should define who each party is. This section should be at the end so each party is required to read the whole agreement before signing.

, Once the contract is complete, send it to the other party as an offer. The other party will look it over and get back to you. When you get a response, it will usually be in the form of an acceptance or rejection.


If you want a response within a certain time period, state that in your offer. If you do not, the other party will have a ""reasonable"" amount of time to respond.
Up until your offer is accepted, you may choose to revoke the offer. Ensure this revocation gets to the other party before they accept. Once your offer is accepted, an enforceable contract is created., If the other party rejects you offer, they may make a counter-offer. Go back and forth and change the contract terms as needed. Discuss the changes and negotiate with the other party. You can always ask for something in return for the promise to make changes in the other party's favor.


For example, if the other party wants to change the rental period from three to five years, you might ask for a reduced monthly rent amount or for more of your rent payment to go towards the cost of purchasing the home.

, When you and the other party agree to all of the terms included in your contract, sign the document and have the other party do the same. If you and the other party are not in the same room, you can have the document signed electronically using various e-signature services.


Keep a copy of the contract for your records. If there is ever a dispute, you will need the contract in order to resolve it.

For example, the most common size for a rental booth is 10 foot by 10 foot and the rate is $2-$3 per square foot, or $200 to $300 per month.Usually, a 2 to 8 percent cut is taken out of each transaction your merchandise receives to pay for bank fees and administration of the mall.
You may want to save up some capital before renting a booth so that you can afford a few monthly payments in case your merchandise doesn’t sell well at first.;
, Some antique malls have rules for how your booth should appear, such as how your merchandise is arranged and décor that can be used to enhance the aesthetic appeal to draw customers. For example, a mall might require that your booth fit a specific aesthetic or theme, such as looking like an interior designer took over, or that your booth must have a classic theme.


If you don’t feel you have the creativity to master an aesthetic that a mall requires, but you feel that this mall is your best option, you may want to consider hiring a designer or recruiting a relative who has a knack for design.
You may have to submit plans for your booth to the mall before opening, so be prepared by drawing up blueprints just in case an application requires it.

, Every antique mall has different rules for booth renters. Some malls allow you to in essence place your product and walk away, coming back only to collect your earnings or to pack up. Other malls require someone to be present a particular number of hours each week.


Decide how hands-off you want to be with your booth, and what the trade-off is for you. If you think a mall with strict rules about renter presence will have the best sales, it may be worth it to sit in your spot every week.
If you have strict time restraints and bringing in money isn’t your top priority, you may want to shop around until you find a mall that doesn’t require a booth sitter.
If you recruit others to preside over the booth, make sure you can trust them.

, Many cities have quite a few antique malls to choose from. To narrow it down and find a mall to suit your antique booth needs, make a list of things you are looking for. Knowing what you need will help you quickly choose a mall.


Decide your stance on things like booth presence, presentation requirements, rent price and transaction fees, customer volume, location, and so on.
A big thing to consider is how far you want to drive to maintain the booth. Figure gas cost into this consideration., Every antique mall is different. Some let you start off on a month-to-month rental basis, only requiring 30 days’ notice if you want to leave, while others require you to sign a 6-month contract promising to remain that long before going to a month-to-month policy.For example, some 30-day notices require that your last day be the last day of the next month., Before settling on an antique mall, you need to check out the market, i.e. see how many customers they get on average. In order to come up with this, you will need to spend time at the mall to determine their peak weekday and weekend hours. Notice how many people walk in, how long they spend in each booth, and where they tend to go first.


Observing customer behavior will tell you not only if you want this mall, but where you want your booth to be located.
You may be able to use analytics services like Euclid (which uses wifi), or ask the mall owner if they have Nomi, which counts foot traffic through a sensor box installed in the store., You also want to make sure that your booth is a good fit for a mall. If you sell Harley Davidson collectibles, for example, you might not get a lot of business at a mall where most of the booths sell 19th century antiques. Every mall is different, and not all of them sell antiques. Find one that fits your product.

, While doing your research, stop to talk to other booth dealers. Most of them will give you an honest review of the mall, which can help you decide if it is worth the money they will charge. Dealers can also tell you what kind of customers frequent the place, and how much money they tend to make.


This is also a good chance to size up your competition. Observe how much money other dealers transact by standing by the front counter, where all customers go to purchase items.
It is legal to shop around and watch how many customers go to specific booths., Ask the antique mall to show you their sales and advertising statistics so you can get a better idea of their market and the value of their costs versus profit. If the margin is too close, you may want to consider a different mall.


Another way to tell how the mall is doing financially is to observe booth discount signs. If you see a lot of 50% off signage, chances are the mall is struggling., Be aware that not all booths in antique malls sell antiques. Many of them sell other things, including hand crafted items, collectibles, junk from their houses (making the booth into a long-term yard sale), and as advertising space for small businesses (such as cabinet makers or flooring companies).


Consider what things you want to sell, recognizing that it doesn’t have to be antiques.

, Once you have selected a mall and signed a contract, you want to price your items so that you are able to pay the booth rent and still have some profit. But be careful not to inflate prices to cover your rent. Visit other booths to see what the average price is for your type of product.


If you are selling items that are popular in the internet, such as antiques and collectibles, you may want to research prices online first in order to price items so that they sell.

, Although some antique malls require a specific appearance for your booth, other malls give you complete freedom. No matter your requirements, decorate and lay out your booth to attract customers. Use Christmas lights to give it a comfortable feel or strips of burlap and linen to make it feel beachy and fun.


You will need to provide your own tables, shelves, merchandise, advertising, and store signage. However, glass cases with locks are usually available for rent at the antique mall should you wish to display your wares this way.There are as many ways to decorate a booth as there are a room. Get creative, centering your theme around your type of product. Is it antiques? Use old suitcases, door knobs, and classic items to decorate., You want to ensure that your booth always looks full so that customers feel like you are taking good care of your products. Starting off with a small booth is a good idea so that it is easier to cover every surface, but you don’t want it so full that customers are afraid of knocking something over.Keep the setup clean and inviting by making walkways through products and preserving the appearance your booth had on day one.

, Many antique malls will have glass display cases for rent, which is helpful if you have a lot of high-value inventory. In antique malls, where booths are largely left to themselves, you don’t want anything getting stolen. Lock the case when you are not there and customers will ask mall staff to open it for purchases.


You can also use glass cases as decoration, inserting lights and other attractive features.

",How to Rent out Your Vacation Home," Most don't cover damages done by a renter, so you'll have to purchase an additional policy to cover not only your home and any contents you leave, but also liability issues in the event the renter is injured on the property.;
, If not, you may need to obtain a variance to rent your home.

, Short term rentals, typically 4 months or less, are usually rented furnished. You'll want to make the renters feel at home, while protecting heirloom furniture and other treasured possessions. Storing them offsite is safer than simply warning tenants about fragile chairs or delicate fabrics. Consider purchasing inexpensive basic furnishings to use in place of irreplaceable family favorites.

, As much as you would like to trust your renters, things can disappear while owners are far away. Take family collectibles, special toys, electronics, cameras, and silver out of the house. Simply putting it out of the way in the attic or a closet is not sufficient protection for your valuables.

, It's easier for you to make needed repairs or replace them before you go than to try to arrange it from another state, or worse yet, come home to find that the tenant has tried make repairs on their own!

, The former has the advantage of saving you from a tenant who calls in an expensive service person for minor repairs, while the latter means you only pay or services actually used.

, This prevents disagreements when it come to security deposits.

, Even for a short term rental, you need protection against tenant damages or rent defaults.

, Basic background checks online cost anywhere from $7.95 to $150, but are well worth the money for the peace of mind they provide.

, Having mail forwarded is slow and often unreliable, and could result in late payments and penalties.

, Take them with you or board them while you are gone. Even if a neighbor offers to feed and water a pet, remember there will be strangers in your house and that could lead to bites and scratches.

, A renter who feels a part of the neighborhood is more likely to care for your home.

Determine comparable rents.,

Weight the costs and benefits of renting your house.,
List where people look.,
Use your house as advertising.,
Get creative.,
Don’t take chances.,
Carefully screen applicants.,
Obey the law.",How to Rent out Your Home Fast," Ideally, of course, you want to rent your house as quickly as possible for as much money as possible. Comparing your home to similar ones for rent in your area is one of the best ways to establish your home’s rental potential.Search for house rentals in your area on real estate websites as well as sites such as Craigslist. Find “comps” that appear similar in size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age and condition, and neighborhood location. If you are comfortable doing so, you can pose as a potential renter and tour a similar house in person for comparison’s sake.
Check back every few days to see which ads have disappeared, which probably indicates a successful rental. You can also call and ask if certain houses are still for rent. This will give you an even better idea of the price level that moves rental properties like yours.;
, Before trying to rent out your house, you may feel like you need to fix up every problem, major or minor. Try, however, to focus on repairs and improvements that will bring your house in line with its “comps” and add value in higher rents.Make any improvements that need to be made to “bring your home up to code” — that is, meet the requirements of your local building codes. This can save you from legal trouble down the road.
Otherwise, focus on short-term value additions like cleaning carpets, touching up paint, and replacing broken window blinds. Unless your roof is leaking, for instance, more long-term improvements like a new roof are unlikely to bring back sufficient value in increased rents.

, Before jumping into making any improvements or putting out your advertising, make a realistic appraisal of your likely rental income. Weigh this benefit against the potential costs — not only monetary ones, but also the possible headaches and hassles you may face as a landlord.Once you establish the prevailing rent for homes like yours in the area, consider closely whether this amount is sufficient to be worth your time and effort.
If you are new to renting out property, or are concerned with your time or ability to deal with tenants, make small repairs, and collect rental payments, you may want to consider hiring a property manager. You can let them do all the “dirty work” for you, often at the cost of half of the first month’s rent and ten percent thereafter. The money you lose may be worth your time (and sanity)., The way property rentals are advertised can vary depending upon where you live. While online listings are ubiquitous by now, the sites utilized and amount of alternative advertising done may differ widely.


Even if you don’t subscribe to a local newspaper, buy copies every so often and look at the classified ads. If you see numerous listings for comparable houses for rent, you may decide that this is a good approach for you as well.
List your house on the site(s) where you find the most nearby and similar house rentals. Utilize social media sites and video sites as well — for instance, linking to a video tour of your home posted on YouTube.Studies indicate that rental ads posted on Fridays are visited more often than those posted at other times, presumably because people tend to do their house-hunting on weekends., Some people prefer not to include an address with rental advertisements, so that they can ensure a proper showcase for potential tenants.However, there is no reason not to attract the interest of people passing by your house anyway.While a basic “For Rent” sign gets the message across, a professional-looking, easy-to-read, eye-catching sign can arouse much greater interest, especially if you are seeking a particular clientele. Spend time making attractive signage, or have signs printed up. Provide key information about the property (beds/baths, and perhaps one or two distinctive features like hardwood floors or a hot tub).
If you home is empty of valuables, consider leaving the blinds open and a light on in the evening so potential tenants can peek in, especially on a showcase room (kitchen, den, etc.).
Host an event that will draw people to your house. Hold, for instance, a yard sale and offer information and viewings to interested parties.

, If you’re lucky, placing an ad, putting out a sign, and waiting may be all you need to do. More likely, though, you will need to play a more active role in attracting the right tenant to your rental quickly.


While you may want to think twice about renting to family or close friends because it inserts a personal element into a business relationship,utilizing this network to seek out potential leads can prove helpful. Have them ask around at work or places they frequent. Ask to place flyers at local businesses you visit regularly. Utilize your social media presence, and that of friends and family.If you need to find a tenant quickly or you’ve been advertising with no success for a while, you may want to offer incentives beyond just reducing the rent a bit. Offer referral fees, a first-month rent discount, a share of utility costs for a period, or allow pets if you had not intended to (but can accept doing so). Draw people to at least take a look at your house, but still be selective in choosing the right tenant for your property., No matter how eager you are to rent out your house, having no tenant is almost always better than having a bad tenant, as they can cause you more headaches and costs than they are worth. Make the property more appealing to good tenants, by rent reductions or improvements, instead of loosening your tenant screening standards.Choosing someone to occupy your house, especially if you are going to resume living in it later (but also just to preserve its future sale or rental value), is a big decision that should not be entered into lightly.
Establish a rational, detailed, fair (and legal) screening process beforehand to find the best tenant for your house.

, Asking a couple questions and then handing over the keys is not sufficient and invites disaster. Use your instincts regarding potential clients, but also verify all the information they provide.


Create a standard application form, which includes spaces for name; date of birth; Social Security number; contact information; previous addresses for at least five years; current and previous employers; emergency contacts; a “release of information” statement (which permits you to follow up with past landlords and employers, etc.); and a signature. Templates are available online.Make sure the application is filled out completely. Charge an application fee if desired — see what is common in your area. Follow up on the information, verifying employment and income, and contacting all recent landlords.
Pay to do a background check (the application fee can cover this). Rely on an established company to verify information about your potential tenant. Smartmove, for instance, is operated by TransUnion and offers a straightforward process., Even if it is not your intention, there can be a fine line between being selective in your potential tenants and appearing to be discriminatory. The last thing you need to be facing while trying to rent out your house is a federal discrimination complaint. It is your responsibility to know and obey all applicable fair housing laws.In the U.S., federal code prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, religion, disability, or family status. It’s best to not even ask questions along these lines.Keep copies of all completed applications, and put your rejection notices in writing and keep a copy. Explain clearly why you have turned down a potential tenant (insufficient income, a recent eviction for damage to an apartment, etc.).
For the tenants you choose, provide a rental agreement that fulfills the legal requirements where you live. Templates can be found on sites like http://www.uslegalforms.com/ or https://www.ezlandlordforms.com/.
Conduct a walk-through inspection before handing over the keys, and have the tenant fill out a report that also adheres to local requirements. Take pictures for additional evidence of the condition of your house before move-in.

Take a quick inventory of your lifestyle, income and spatial requirements. Housing is everywhere, so narrowing down your expectations for the right apartment will save you considerable headache once it's time to choose a place., If there's a particular area where you would prefer to live, take a look at apartments there first and work your way outward. Think about what kind of commute you'll be making to your workplace or school. The apartment that's the best fit for you may not be in the immediate vicinity of these places, or there may be other factors, like distance from a major highway or interstate or access to public transportation, worth looking into.A good location will also be marked by a proximity to nearby restaurants and shopping centers, and any other businesses or conveniences that you make use of on a daily basis.

, Will you be living with a roommate, child or spouse? Do you work from home and require a home office setup? Are you a no-fuss, high efficiency single occupant? Apartments typically offer 1-4 rooms, and the size and style will vary depending on the complex. Get a general sense of how your belongings would fit in a given space. If you have a pet, you may also want to make sure that the apartment you choose has a dog park, courtyard or patios on the premises in case you need to take it out.Picture how your furniture and other belongings might work in the space you're renting. If the apartment you end up renting is on the smaller side, you may need to get rid of a few things or get creative with your arrangement.
Know the apartment's policy on pets. There will probably be an extra monthly fee or an addition to your deposit associated with pet ownership., Most rental properties have a section on their websites where current and previous tenants can share what they like and dislike about their apartments. Do a little digging to see what people are saying about the apartments you're interested in renting. Pay particular attention to what reviewers say about the condition of the units, living in the area and the quality of management. This could be just the push you need to sign a lease, or it might be a dealbreaker if there are too many significant issues.


Certain points of apartment reviews can also give you an idea of things to look out for once you get around to taking a walkthrough of the property.
Websites like apartments.com making it easy to quickly search apartment reviews in your area. Don't disregard negative reviews that make mention of peculiar problems or matters of dispute. You're trying to learn about the apartment, its general upkeep and the involvement of its managerial staff. Other tenants' opinions may reflect on that complex more than it first seems.

, It can be tempting to want to live in an apartment just beyond your financial reach, but resist the urge. Be realistic: remember that rent and utilities are due every month, and be certain you can afford them. Higher rent doesn't always equal better living, and vice versa. Don't hesitate to look at multiple properties in the same price range--it's likely that you'll find a well-rounded apartment that matches all your major criteria.It's probably better to err on the side of caution when it comes to knowing if a given rent quote is too high. If you're struggling to pay rent and unexpected circumstances arise, you might be in danger of failing to fulfill the terms of the lease.
Sometimes the reason rent at a particular apartment might be higher is due to on-site amenities or conveniences of the areas. Know how to spot these factors. If you can live without extra luxuries, you might be able to find a place just as nice for less expense.

, Refer to pay stubs, bank statements and tax documents to get an idea of how much you make over the course of a month or pay cycle. Deduct all known expenses, such as food and fuel costs and other bills. Be sure that you can pay your rent and other bills every month and keep a little left over as a safety net.Always set aside money for rent and utilities first. You can take care of your other bills later--having a place to live is the most important thing.

, If you have a spouse or adult roommate you'll be sharing your apartment with, discuss whether you can both contribute to the rent payment to make it easier. This will be especially useful for younger tenants who are juggling school and work or don't make as much money.Rent is customarily divided up equally based on number of bedrooms, but leases can be negotiated so that tenants can pay any amount as long as the rent total is being paid.
Having a cosigner (someone with an established line of credit who can subsidize your rent if necessary) in place can help alleviate the cost of rent.

, In some cases, an apartment complex might offer new tenants special deals as an incentive for living there. These incentives can be pretty sizable, like a reduced deposit fee or rent-free first month. As it gets quite expensive to find a new apartment and take the necessary steps to move in, it can pay to take advantage of these specials if the apartment you're looking at is advertising them., Call or visit the apartment's leasing office and request a walkthrough. Most properties give guided tours that allow potential lessees to take a closer look at the apartment and complex grounds. Take the time to view every apartment that might be the right fit for you. This can be time-consuming, but it should be a non-negotiable step, as you'll want a chance to survey each property firsthand.Come up with questions to ask the property manager about the apartment during the walkthrough. This can include questions about the unit itself, services offered by the complex, and the surrounding neighborhood, as well as any misgivings you may have about living there.

, Not all apartments are outfitted the same. With some apartments you're renting just the space itself; others might come completely furnished. Once again, consider your individual needs. It can be a great convenience to rent an apartment that comes with a dishwasher, microwave, refrigerator or washer/dryer included.Renting an apartment that comes equipped with the major appliances can save you money on having to purchase them yourself and can make other tasks such as cooking and doing laundry cheaper and more expedient.

, Inspect each apartment carefully and look for potential problems. The apartment will have been cleaned and fixed up to make it presentable for showings, so you'll have to have a thorough eye. Make a note of any structural defects, old or broken appliances, plumbing issues, etc. The leasing agent will likely downplay the severity of the problem or offer to have it repaired, but it may be a sign that you're better off looking elsewhere.New carpeting or a fresh coat of paint can hide signs of age. Scrutinize each feature of the apartment closely, testing appliances where you can.
Something as small as worn or incorrectly-installed weather stripping could drive up your cost of living in the winter by forcing you to keep the heat running at a higher temperature.

, Once you think you're ready to make a move on an apartment, check the lease agreement. The leasing paperwork will lay out all the bylaws set by the property owners as well as the legal obligations of the lessee, so make sure you understand what you're signing before you put your name on anything. Sometimes, certain passages of the lease will be negotiable or subject to change. Ask plenty of questions so that you know what you're getting and make the process of securing your ideal apartment as smooth as possible.If you're not sure about certain provisions in your lease, ask the leasing agent or apartment manager for help explaining it. Usually, these people are required by law to provide detailed information to prospective lessees, and they'll want to be just as sure that you understand the particulars of the agreement you're signing.

Research the Pet Policy.",How to Rent an Apartment in Los Angeles," LA is a huge city. Especially in a city as large as Los Angeles, your apartment’s proximity to your work or school needs to be taken into consideration. Assessing the amount of time you will regularly sit in traffic on your daily commute to and from work or school (or wherever you plan to go regularly) should be calculated. A good way of determining if a location is good for you is by doing a “trial run”, by simulating your commute. Drive from your prospective apartment to work as you would as if you had already moved in.


Make sure to simulate the situation as realistically as possible; driving at 8:45 AM is a completely different scenario than driving two hours later. This test-drive will give you a realistic idea of what your daily commute will be like, and how bearable or unbearable it will be. Everyone puts a different value on their time.
For some, it may make more sense to live closer to work, at the expense of higher monthly rent. For others, it is sensible to have a long commute and spend less money on rent every month. Paying more money for closer proximity to work, in order to avoid traffic is a clear illustration of the popular saying that “real estate is based on three things: location, location, location.”;
, Look at the common areas of the apartment building, such as the laundry area and the parking garage, and see how the apartment community members take care of their surroundings. This will show you not only about the building that you will be moving into, but also it will show you how the tenants (potentially your future neighbors) treat their homes.

, Look at your surrounding areas that are in comfortable walking distance. Check out the nearby restaurants and shops, as well as the parks and community centers in the area, to determine if you will enjoy the people and the environment in your new surrounding.

, Amenities may include gyms, pools, coffee shops, or various other service facilities. Note that amenities available to tenants are not necessarily free of charge.

, Who lives in the building? How many units are there in the complex? Do the neighboring people seem like the type you will get along with? Will their lifestyles interfere with yours? Are they child friendly? Are they pet friendly? Are they safe people to live next to? Remember that the people that you see when you look at an apartment are strangers today, but may become best friends or business partners in the future.

, You do not want to lease an apartment that has problems that your management team will not take care of.

, If you have children, choosing an area to live that is within the parameters of a good school is imperative. Consider the fact that your child will be going to school with other children in your school district.

, It is unreasonable to expect an old building to be as fit as a brand new building.

, Note that California Code of Regulations Title 25, Article 5, Section 42, dictates that if a residential building has 16 units or more, there must be an on-site manager. If the owner of the property violates this code, it speaks volumes for their respect for the law and to their tenants, which may foreshadow further violations that the owner may make in the future.

, If you have pets, you need to ensure that the apartment complex you are interested in allows your pet. Some apartment communities boast pet-friendly environments, while others do not allow pets at all. Some policies allow for only cats or dogs of certain sizes or breeds. Therefore, do not sign a lease without verifying that you are allowed to have your furry friend live with you.

Be a good landlord.",How to Rent Out a Home Office," You might not be able to rent a home office. For example, your rental agreement might prohibit you from subleasing space to someone else. You should check your lease.


Even if you own your home, zoning laws might prohibit business in your area. You need to check with your local zoning office to see if you can rent for business purposes. Stop into your city hall and ask.
The law might also limit which kind of business can be carried out in your area. You’ll want to know that information as well before you rent to someone.;
, You should look at how much office space rents for in the nearest business district. You can peg your rent to that amount. For example, if an office building charges $20 per square foot, then you should measure your home office space and charge a similar amount.


You might be in an ideal location, such as right next to a train station.In that case, you might want to charge a little bit more than commercial realtors.
If your home office is just a chair at your kitchen table, then you shouldn’t charge as much as you would if the office is an entire room.

, You can rent out a completely bare room as office space, or you can furnish it with a desk and chair. The more equipment you provide, the easier it will be to find tenants.


You also might want to furnish a computer and a phone, although many people will probably use their laptop and cell phone.
You could also let the tenant have mail sent to your home. If you do, then you probably can charge more rent., There are many websites you can use to reach potential renters. For example, consider using the following:Craigslist. You can advertise on your city’s “Office & Commercial” board.
Your community newspaper. You can also run a classified ad with your newspaper, whether online or in a print edition.
Sharedesk. This website is like Airbnb but for office space. Accordingly, you might not find a long-term renter. Instead, you might rent in weekly increments or whenever someone contacts you. Visit https://www.sharedesk.net/how-it-works/list-venue for more information. Sharedesk charges a 20% commission, but you won’t have to do any of the other paperwork described in this article.

, Ideally, you could rent the office space to someone you know and trust. If you are unsure about whether you are ready to be a landlord, then renting to someone you know could be ideal.


You can also rent to yourself. If you have incorporated, then your corporation could pay rent. Alternately, you could deduct the space as a business expense or as part of an “accountable plan” for employees.You should talk to a tax professional if any of these options interest you.

, Renting a home office might seem like an easy way to make money, but you should think seriously before going ahead and signing a lease agreement. For example, consider the following:


Will you be home when the renter needs to use the office? If not, you’ll need to give the renter a key, which means they will be in your home alone. If you aren’t comfortable with that, then you probably shouldn’t rent.
Does your renters or homeowners insurance cover someone else in your home? Accidents unfortunately happen. You should check whether they will be covered.How good are you at asking someone for money? A tenant might be short on cash and not pay you on time. You can try to weed out bad tenants by checking references, but you can’t guarantee that your tenant will be low maintenance., To draw the best potential renters, you should have a clean, uncluttered office to show.Many people use their spare rooms as storage spaces as well, so your office might be crammed with exercise equipment, old clothes, boxes of papers, etc. You should clean out the space as much as possible.


Transfer exercise equipment and stored items to the attic or basement. Alternately, if you never use them, then sell them on eBay or Craigslist.
Also vacuum carpets or wax hardwood floors and make sure that your windows are properly cleaned. Get rid of any dust accumulation.

, Promptly respond to emails or phone calls and ask the person if they want to see the space. Schedule a time for them to come look at it.


You might want to have someone with you at home when potential renters stop by. You don’t know these people and anyone can find an ad online. Inviting strangers into your home is risky.
Try to schedule showings on days when your partner is home. Alternately, ask a friend to visit during the showing.

, Even though you are renting a home office, you should treat the experience as if you were renting out commercial space in a business building. Ask every potential renter to fill out an application, which asks them to list the following:


personal information, such as name and contact information
Social Security Number
current business information, such as name, type of business, and web address
information about current business landlord (if applicable)
a business reference (name, phone number, email, and relationship to applicant)
another professional reference, such as a bank reference

, You should call the applicant’s references and check what kind of tenant or business person they are. The questions you ask will depend on who you are talking to as a reference:


Ask prior landlords if the person pays their rent on time and in full.Also ask landlords if the person took care of the property. Did they cause any damage beyond regular wear and tear?
Ask a business reference how busy they think the person is. A tenant with a thriving business is more likely to pay the rent.

, You can protect yourself from bad tenants by running a credit check. You will need the applicant’s name, Social Security Number, and address. You also need their permission. You should have applicants sign a Consent to Background Check form as part of the application.You can find sample consent forms online. Revise one to suit your needs.
You may also want to charge for the credit check. In most states, you can charge a reasonable fee, such as $30-50.
If you choose not to rent to someone because of information in their credit report, then you are required by federal law to tell them the name and address of the entity that reported the negative information. You should send the applicant a rejection letter explaining this information.

, A lease agreement is meant to protect you as the landlord. It explains the key terms of the agreement. If the tenant breaks the lease, then you can have them ejected and sue for owed rent. An ideal lease agreement will contain the following information:length of the lease
whether the tenant has the option to renew
the amount of rent
security deposit and the conditions for getting the deposit returned
whether the tenant can sublease the space or transfer the lease to someone else

, The deposit protects you in case the tenant skips out on you before the lease expires. You can also use the deposit to make any repairs for damage done to the property.You should set a security deposit you feel comfortable with. One or two months would be ideal.Generally, state law doesn’t limit how much you can ask for as a deposit for commercial space, so you can come to an agreement with the renter.
To make things easier, you can put the security deposit in an account separate from your own accounts. This way you’ll know not to accidentally spend the security deposit.

, If you aren’t sure that you’ll be home when the tenant needs to use the office, then you should have a key made. You certainly don’t want to lock out a tenant. You can have a key made by visiting a hardware store.

, Being a landlord means responding to complaints from your renter in a timely fashion and making sure that the office space is always habitable. Your home should always be properly heated and you should maintain a quiet environment for your tenant to enjoy.


Communication is key. If you’re having repairs made in your home, then let the tenant know.

Understand the key terms and principles of negative amortization.,
Understand how negative amortization occurs.,
Understand the implications of negative amortization.,
Consider the following example of negative amortization.",How to Understand Negative Amortization,"


Understand that the term negative amortization, also referred to as deferred interest or ""NegAm,"" is most often used within the context of home mortgages and student loans.
Note that the amount of time in which negative amortization is allowed by the lender is usually limited to an introductory period of 5 years or less.
Keep in mind that an amortization schedule will determine what percentage of a payment will go towards the interest and what percentage will go towards the principal.
Consider that the general concept of allowing negative amortization presumes that the borrower is anticipating the realization of an increase in revenue within the time frame allotted for negative amortization. Within the context of home mortgages, even when the equity of a given property is expected to exceed the amount borrowed, a period of negative amortization will significantly decrease any potential gains.;
,


Understand that negative amortization only can occur when an agreement allowing negative amortization has been made between the lender and the borrower. Otherwise, when the payments made are insufficient to reach full amortization within the allotted time frame as stated by the loan terms, the borrower falls into what is termed as default. Default occurs when the borrower fails to meet the agreed upon terms of the loan and can result in a variety of penalties, late charges and, in some cases, foreclosure.

,


Realize that a portion of each payment made on a standard loan agreement is split between the principal borrowed and the interest accrued. Negative amortization occurs when the payments made are less than the amount of interest charged.
Understand that the difference between the amount paid and the amount needed to fulfill the loan terms and reach full amortization within the given time frame is the amount that is added to the principal for each payment period.

,


Take into account that for a home loan of $250,000, given at an interest rate of 5% and scheduled to be repaid over a term of 30 years, the total amount paid will be slightly less than $600,000. The interest paid in order to reach full amortization will be approximately $350,000, or 140% of the principal originally borrowed.
Understand that the monthly mortgage payment, given these terms, would be slightly over $1650, a portion of which would be applied to the interest while the remainder would be applied to the loan principal. Negative amortization would occur should the amount of the payments made be insufficient to cover the amount of the periodic interest charged.
Remember that an interest only payment is agreed to, which reduces the amount of the monthly mortgage payment to $825 for the first 5 years. Negative amortization would be achieved if the amount of interest accrued each month exceeded $825. If the amount required to cover the monthly interest accrued was $900, the remaining $75 of unpaid interest would then be added to the principal, increasing the total amount owed on the property.

Talk to a lender before you start house hunting.,
Contact different types of lending institutions.,
Make appointments with several lenders.,
Research common terms and conditions.",How to Talk to Mortgage Lenders1," Mortgage paperwork can take a long time to process. You will want to start looking for lenders and rates before you decide on your house or else you might lose out on it.Having a mortgage preapproved will make the entire process smoother and faster. Furthermore, some real estate agents may reject offers from buyers without a mortgage preapproved.Since rate locks attach to a property and not an individual, you cannot lock an interest rate until you have a contract on the property.;
, Banks, credit unions, and online lenders, and brokers all offer mortgages. Consult different websites to find which ones may be willing to offer you a better deal. While you can visit banks and credit unions in person, you may have to call an online company.


Be careful with online lenders. While you may find a reputable one that offers a good deal, you are also likely to encounter more scams., The best way to get a good deal on your mortgage is to talk to several lenders. You can get a feel for their different personalities and your comfort level with each of them. This will let you compare rates, fees, and contracts., You may not know yet what kind of mortgage you need, but you can familiarize yourself with the terms and types of mortgages that your lender may talk to you about. These terms include:



Interest rate: the cost you pay to borrow the loan. The interest rate is a percentage of the loan. You pay this on top of the money you owe to repay the loan.

Annual Percentage Rate (APR): how much you will pay every year year for the loan. This includes fees and interest.Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM): a mortgage with interest rates that change over time. Rates may start low and then increase. This may be fine if you are planning to sell the house after a few years.

Fixed Rate Mortgage: a mortgage with interest rates that do not change over time. This is ideal if you want to stay in the same house for the full length of the mortgage.

Hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage: a mortgage that has fixed fees for the first year or two. After this point, the rates may change."

When you rent a home or apartment, it tends to be cheaper than buying a home and you have flexibility regarding where you live and how long you live there.However, when you buy a home you build equity, which means you will be building cash value in that piece of property.Also, when you own a home, you can take tax deductions for any mortgage interest you pay.For a lot of people, this is the biggest tax break people will ever receive., Before you can buy a home, you have to be able to afford a home down payment and the monthly mortgage payments you will incur. In order to do this, you will have to pay off some of your existing debt.As a general rule of thumb, you should try to pay off any debt that has an interest rate more than two times the prime rate.For example, if the prime rate is 6%, and you have a credit card with a 15% interest rate, you should try and pay that debt off or transfer the debt to a lower rate, such as via a credit card balance transfer.While it may seem counter-intuitive, you will save money in the long run by paying off debts with high interest rates. Although you will have to pay some money up front, you will be able to save more moving into the future.

, When you take care of your existing debt, your credit score will rise. Having a good credit score is important if you want to get approved for a mortgage.To request a free copy of your credit score, contact annualcreditreport.com, which is a service offered by the three major credit reporting companies. See https://www.wikihow.com/Check-Your-Credit-Score for more information about checking your credit score.

, To determine what type of mortgage you will qualify for, you will need to contact various mortgage lenders. Find three or four lenders and have them compete for your business.Get a copy of each company's ""good faith estimate,"" which is a form that lists the basic terms of the mortgage you applied for.You can then use these good faith estimates to choose which lender you will go with. For instance, you can compare each company's offer and you can get an idea of the real loan cost.

, Next, you will need to find a home. Shop for homes in your price range by looking online or by contacting a real estate company.


To determine how much home you can afford, think about your family's income as well as your debts.Then, estimate possible mortgage payments, which you can do by using online calculators.When finished, look at the amount of money your family has after expenses, and figure out how much of that you want to spend on a monthly mortgage payment. Be sure to leave enough money to pay for unexpected things (e.g., vacation, car repair, etc.).
For example, if your family brings home $3,500 per month after taxes, consider how much of that money you want to put towards a mortgage payment. If you estimate your mortgage will be $1,500 per month, understand that will leave only $2,000 per month on other expenses.

, The amount of your down payment will dictate your loan amount and whether you need to get purchase mortgage insurance (PMI). The more money you put down up front, the less principal you will owe on the loan. Generally, you will want to put down at least 20% of the home's price up front.


For example, if you are buying a home that costs $500,000, you should try and put down at least $100,000 up front. If you do this, you will only need to get a mortgage on the remaining $400,000 and you will avoid having to pay for PMI.

, Another consideration when formulating a mortgage loan is the type of loan you will get. In general, there are two types of mortgages.


First, there is a fixed-rate loan. With this type of mortgage, the interest rate does not change over the life of the loan.A lot of home buyers like this type of loan because their mortgage payment will remain constant.Second, there is an adjustable-rate loan. Adjustable-rate loans give home buyers a lower interest rate for a set period of time.Once that time period is up, your interest rate will increase every so often.With an adjustable-rate loan, the low interest rate will usually apply for the first seven years of the loan.Therefore, if you only plan on living in the home for seven years (or less), this type of loan may be a good option for you., All mortgage lenders generally use the same criteria when they approve you for a loan. When you find a lender you like, and when you find the home of your dreams, apply for the loan. After you apply, the lender will look at the following criteria:


Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. This is a measurement of your income to monthly liabilities.The lower your DTI, the more confident a lender will be in giving you money.Your loan-to-value (LTV). This is used to compare the difference between the outstanding loan amount and the property's value.The LTV is often used to determine whether you will be required to obtain PMI.For example, some loans require you to get PMI when the LTV is greater than 80%.That means, in order to avoid PMI, you will need to make at least a 20% down payment.Your credit. Credit scores are used by lenders to estimate the risk associated with you, the borrower.The lower your credit score, the riskier you are.

, After being approved for a mortgage, you will need to finalize the deal, which involves reading through and signing the loan document. Due to the complex nature of mortgage loans, some people like to hire an attorney to help them through this process. If you are going to hire an attorney, look for a real estate attorney with experience closing home purchases and mortgage deals.


While hiring an attorney may make your life easier, it is not required that you do so. If you have gone through the mortgage process before, or if you understand how loans work, you should be fine handling the process on your own.

, Lenders will often attach various fees to the loan with the hope the lender will simply pay them. However, these loans can often be negotiated down or even waived by the lender, depending on how interested they are in your business.Examples of fees include loan origination fees, processing fees, and underwriting fees., When you look at your loan documents, the two main dollar amounts you need to understand are principal and interest. Principal is the sum of money you are borrowing to buy the home.You can lower you principal amount by making a larger down payment.Interest is the amount of money the lender is charging you for borrowing the money.It is usually expressed as a percentage, called the interest rate.When you add the principal and interest amounts, that is what you will have to pay over the life of your loan.


For example, let's assume the house you buy costs $500,000. You make a 20% down payment and mortgage the rest. The mortgage has a 5% interest rate. If this is your scenario, the principal on your loan will be $400,000 (which is the total cost of the house minus your down payment) and your total interest is $20,000 (which is 5% of your principal).

, When you sign a mortgage, you are signing a legal document promising to pay a certain amount of money to a lender.In order to incentivize your repayment, the lender will use your home as collateral.If you fail to repay the loan, the lender has the legal right to take the property and sell it to cover the debt.This process is called foreclosure.

, In addition to the principal and interest on your loan, there will be various taxes you will have to pay as well.The main tax included will be your property taxes., Most lenders will not offer you a mortgage unless you have insurance on the home.In general, you will want to buy insurance covering your home and your personal property from fire, theft, bad weather, and other causes.Also, if you get a conventional loan and put down less than 20% of the home's price, your lender will require you to get PMI. PMI protects the lender from you defaulting on your loan.If you have to get PMI, you will have to pay the premiums for two years or until your mortgage balance shrinks below 80% of the home's original purchase price., After addressing all of the issues and language in a loan document, you will need to sign the agreement if you are satisfied. Once you sign the loan document, you will be required to make payments and satisfy all of the conditions in your loan.

, When you refinance your home mortgage, you are actually satisfying your old loan and creating a new one with different terms.In general, there are two types of refinances, one called a rate and term refinance and the other called a cash out refinance.With a rate and term refinance, you are creating a new loan with a lower interest rate and a shorter term.With a cash out refinance, you take out a new loan for more than what you owe on the home, and you use the extra cash for whatever you like.A refinance makes sense if you need to save money by lowering monthly payments or if you need the extra cash on-hand by doing a cash out refinance.

, When you refinance, there will be fees involved that may prohibit your ability to save money. Consider the following fees before refinancing your mortgage:


Fees associated with paying down your existing mortgage with your line of credit.In most mortgage contracts there is a provision allowing lenders to charge you a fee for doing this.Often, this fee can be thousands of dollars.New closing fees. When you refinance, you will have to pay similar closing fees as when you signed your existing mortgage.Try to refinance when these fees are low or when there are no fees., If you feel comfortable refinancing your home, contact your lender to start the process. If you do not want to use the same lender you currently have, you can always shop around for a new one.

, After you iron out all of the details as if you were finalizing your first mortgage, you will sign the document and execute the loan agreement.

, If your home is worth enough to cover your existing mortgage, it makes sense to sell the property. If you owe more on your property than it is worth, you can try negotiating a short-sale with your lender. In a short-sale the lender agrees to a sale of the property for less than the total debt, but it still releases you fully from that debt.

, A real estate agent will list the property for you. He or she will also assist you in negotiating with the buyer to an agreed upon purchase price. (Some people choose to sell the property themselves. This is called a “for sale by owner” sale.)

, The attorney can make sure the documentation is drafted properly. He or she will ensure you are no longer listed on the mortgage or the property records. Make sure you receive copies of these records to retain for your personal files.

Expect the lender to automatically terminate PMI payments according to federal law, in the following two situations:


Enough money has been applied to the principal to cause the loan value to reach 78 percent of the home value (or 77 percent of the home value for high-risk loans).",How to Understand Private Mortgage Insurance,"


The home value is based on the appraised value at the time of purchase. In the unlikely event that the home is purchased for more than the appraised value, the lower purchase price is used as the home value.
If the amount you are putting down is less than 20 percent of the value of the home, you will be required to pay PMI. For example, if you are paying $10,000 up front on a home that appraised for $200,000, you will have to pay PMI.;
, For example, putting less down might allow you to buy a home sooner, buy a more expensive home and/or invest more money in improvements. You should know what the estimated PMI payment will be to help you make the best decision. It is typically $50 to $100 a month.

, PMI is not normally handled as a separate payment to your lender.

You have reached the midpoint of your amortization schedule. For example, on a 30-year loan, your PMI would be dropped after 180 of the 360 payments are made.

State your budget.,
Ask questions about the loan.,
Determine what extra fees you will be paying.,
Compare offers before agreeing on a deal.,
Watch out for predatory loans.",How to Talk to Mortgage Lenders2," When you first meet with a lender, you will want to inform them of what you think your budget is. Tell them roughly what price range of house you are looking for. They will take this into consideration after you’ve made an application.


Say something along the lines of: “Right now, I am looking at houses in the $250,000 range, but I want to make sure that I qualify to borrow that much money first.”
Listen carefully to what they say. Ask questions about anything you are uncertain about or don’t know.

, You want to make sure that there are no hidden fees or rules in your contract, and you want to understand fully what the mortgage process will be like. You can ask:


""How much will the down payment be? How much are closing costs?""
""What is the APR? How much will I be paying every year, including fees, penalties, and interest?""
“How long does it take to process a mortgage?”
“Do you offer fixed-rate or adjustable rate mortgages?”
“What will happen if I fall behind on my payments?”
“Are there prepayment penalties?” In other words: “Will I be charged fees if I pay off my mortgage early?”“What documents and information do I need to provide you?”, There are many other fees that are tacked onto mortgages. While the bulk of your conversation will be about the interest rate and payment plan, be sure to ask your lender about what other charges they will incur. Ask directly: “In addition to my interest rate and monthly payment, what other fees am I responsible for?” Ask them to break down these fees and their purpose. These include:



Origination fees: these are the fees your lender will charge you for creating the loan.

Discount points: these are the difference in yield between your chosen rate and the par rate.

Closing costs: these are the fees you pay when the deed transfers to you.Note that this is the only stage of the process where the lender can legally negotiate with you. If you are haggling over actual rates, which are set 60 days in advance, you may be dealing with someone unsavory.

, Once they give you a rate, know that without locking the rate in, it can change at any time. You need a property to lock in the rate. Accepting this fluidity, inform them that you want to compare deals with other lenders and that you will get back to them shortly.


You can say, “I have a few more meetings set up with other banks, but I will let you know as soon as possible what my decision is.”
If the lender tries to pressure you into signing a loan right away, resist. They are using predatory tactics to coerce you into getting a bad loan.Simply state: “I do not feel comfortable signing onto a loan before I have explored my options.” If the lender pushes you, stand your ground. Say: “I am not going to sign this loan yet. While I appreciate the deal, I do not like being pressured into a loan.”

, You want to be absolutely aware of common scam tactics. Read all documents carefully, and go over the fine print. Ask a lawyer to help you. Some common predatory tactics include:


Blank spaces in documents. You should say: “I do not feel comfortable signing papers that have blank spots in them. Please fill in these spots, and resubmit the contract to me.”
Offering extremely low interest rates at the beginning and increasing them substantially after a certain point. This is known as ballooning. You should say: “I would rather pay slightly higher fees throughout the mortgage at a fixed rate. Can we negotiate this?”
A statement in the contract that prohibits you from suing them in the future. Say: “I do not feel comfortable with this clause. I will not waive my right to sue.”
If the lender will not budge on these points, walk away. They are not a reputable lender."
