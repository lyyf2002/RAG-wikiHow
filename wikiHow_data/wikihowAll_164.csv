Find an old shirt sleeve.,
Make the dress form.,
Create the elastic band at the top of the dress.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Make Barbie Clothes1," This will be the fabric of the dress, so choose whatever pattern/fabric you want. Cut the sleeve off of the shirt where it meets the body.






;
, Starting at the top where the diagonal cut has been made (because of the way the sleeve connected to the body of the shirt), turn the sleeve inside out and fold it on top of the rest of the sleeve so that there is approximately one inch of overlap on one side and 2-3 inches of overlap on the other side (because of the diagonal cut).








, Place a piece of elastic about 1/2 inch from the top of the dress. Pull it taut around the circumference of the dress and cut it at the desired length, gluing the two ends of the elastic together with fabric glue. Fold the extra fabric at the top over the elastic band and sew in a straight line below the elastic to create a casing for the elastic band.









You can also try shirringthe fabric on the top part of the dress for an added fashion statement.

, The diagonal cut of the dress (because of the original shape of the shirt sleeve) will create a hip maxi dress look with a diagonal overlay. Add a cute necklace to complete the outfit.

Make pants.,
Make a shirt or dress.,
Make a skirt.",How to Make Barbie Clothes2," These could work for both male and female barbie dolls, depending on the pattern of sock you use.









Find an old sock (mid-calf height socks work best) and cut the foot portion off. Discard the foot part and turn the remaining section inside out. Starting at the bottom, cut up the middle until about 1.5 inches from the top.
Sew up the two seams from the incision you just made. To keep the fabric from fraying or splitting, use the zigzag pattern of sewing called serging.This will make two separate pant legs. Turn the pants back inside out for nice, sewn pants for your barbie doll. There will be a natural elastic waist created by the band at the top of the sock.

, This method works for both articles of clothing (both shirts and dresses); the difference between the two is simply the length of the sock.









Choose your sock (use a child's sock instead of an adult sock) and cut it to fit your design. If you're making a dress, simply cut off the sock several inches above where the foot portion begins. If you're making a shirt, cut 3-4 inches from the top.
Make the arm holes by cutting a small V-shaped hole into each side of the sock, just under the elastic band of the sock.

, This activity is perfect for quickly and easily replacing missing barbie clothes in a pinch.









This is an incredibly simple method to make a quick skirt for your barbies when needed. Find an old child or toddler's sock and cut it to the desired length. The length will obviously depend on how long or short you want your skirt to be (anywhere from 2-4 inches). The elastic material in the sock will allow the skirt to fit snugly to your Barbie's body with no extra steps necessary.

Cut the fabric.,
Sew the fabric pieces together.,
Make the elastic band.Lay the piece of elastic down on the back side of the fabric about 1/2 inch from the top of the skirt.,
Sew the skirt's seam.,
Finished.








",How to Make Barbie Clothes3," Choose whether you want to use a single piece of fabric or two pieces for a more diverse look. All together, the fabric (one single piece or both pieces combined) should be between two and four inches for the height, depending on how long you ultimately want the skirt to be, and approximately 7-8 inches long (to go around the barbie). Measure the fabric around the barbie and cut off any excess. Here is an informative tutorial on how to complete these steps.







, If you chose to use two pieces of fabric, lay both pieces good side down and sew the pieces together. You can use a sewing machine or just sew a straight line with a needle and thread for this step.








, Fold the top of the fabric over the elastic band and sew it in place.This will make the elastic waistband of the skirt. Cut off any excess elastic from the sides.








, Turn your fabric good side down and fold it in half so that the skirt will appear inside out and you can sew the edge seam (use the serging method here). Then turn the skirt right side out and you will be finished!

Take an old pair of socks, use one to make an outfit for Barbie.,
Use the closed side of the sock to make three cuts, one for the head (the tip of the sock) and two for the hands (at the sides).

To give a neater look, sew the raw ends, using needle and thread ( or piko) or just leave it as it is, it would still look great.

Brush out your Barbie’s hair first.,
Braid Barbie’s hair for wavy curls.,
Create little rollers for ringlets.,
Secure with hair bands or bobby pins.",How to Curl Barbie's Hair Using the Freezer1," Make sure your Barbie’s hair is free of tangles before you curl it. Use a Barbie brush or a human hair brush to gently work through the doll hair.


Just like with human hair, detangling works best if you pull the brush downward with short strokes, starting from the bottom (ends) of the hair and working up toward the tops (roots).
If you are having trouble detangling Barbie hair that has become very matted or damaged by products, try first soaking the hair in a mug of warm water and about a tablespoon of fabric softener for 10-15 minutes.;
, Split your Barbie’s hair into several small sections to create braids all over her head. Split each section into three strands and do a standard braid all the way to the ends of the hair.


The number of sections you make in your Barbie’s hair is up to you. The fewer the sections, the more hair will be in each braid, resulting in larger, looser waves. The more sections, the less hair will be in each braid, resulting in smaller, tighter waves.
Choose this method for your Barbie’s hair if you want her to have a wavy, crimped-looking hairdo rather than round ringlet curls.

, Use pieces of drinking straws, pipe cleaner, or aluminum foil to create miniature hair rollers for your Barbie that will create round barrel or ringlet curls. Take a small section of hair and wrap or roll it around a curler, then do the same for each strand on the entire head of hair.


To use straws, cut them into pieces about an inch long. Place the straw at the bottom of a strand of hair and roll the hair up and around it. Keep rolling till you reach the top of the hair strand.To use aluminum foil, cut strips of foil about 4 inches wide. Fold each in half repeatedly until you have a small, thick strip. Twist the strip to make a strong rope shape. Then place a “rope” against your Barbie’s hair, in the same direction the hair falls. Twist a small strand of hair around the foil all the way to the bottom.To use pipe cleaners, cut them to a length a little longer than your Barbie’s hair and wrap small strands around the pipe cleaner in the same way as with a piece of foil. Or, you can fold a pipe cleaner in half, place the crook of the fold against the Barbie’s head, and weave the hair through the two ends of the pipe cleaner for tight “rotini” curls., Make sure your braids or little curlers don’t fall out during the next steps. Secure the hair with elastics or bobby pins to maintain the curls while they get wet, freeze, and dry out.


If you used aluminum foil or pipe cleaners, all you have to do is fold over the ends of each piece and wrap them around your spiral of hair to hold them in place.For braids, use small size elastics to secure the hair at the end of each of your braids.
For straws, use two bobby pins per straw piece. Push one onto each end of the straw piece to hold it, and the hair wrapped around it, in place."

Dip Barbie’s head into hot water.,
Place your Barbie into the freezer.,
Allow the hair to dry completely.,
Pull your braids/curlers out gently.",How to Curl Barbie's Hair Using the Freezer2," Pour water that has just boiled over your Barbie’s hair, or dip her head into boiled water for about 10 seconds. Be very careful when boiling and handling hot water, and avoid getting it on anything other than the Barbie’s hair.


Boiling water and handling boiled water should be performed by an adult. Children should get help from a parent, teacher, or guardian for this step.
If you cannot get adult supervision or you can’t or don’t want to boil water, you can simply use the warmest water from your sink. There’s a chance your Barbie’s curls won’t last quite as long, but it should achieve about the same effect.

, Let your Barbie cool for a few minutes after applying hot water to the hair. Then put her into your freezer to allow the hair to cool and set.


Leave your Barbie in the freezer for about 30-60 minutes, or until the hair is hardened/frozen, before removing it.
Ensure that the doll isn’t near open food items or anything else that could stick to it in the freezer.

, Set your Barbie on a bath towel or paper towel and allow the hair to thaw out and dry completely. Be prepared to wait several hours for this to happen, otherwise the curls will not hold.


Start this process before bed and leave your Barbie’s hair to dry overnight for an easy way to wait patiently before your final results.
To speed up the drying process, you can also blot at the hair periodically with an absorbent towel. Just make sure you don’t pull out any of the braids or curlers while doing so.

, When the Barbie’s hair is dry, carefully undo the braids or remove the straws, foil, or pipe cleaners you used as curlers. Do this gently without straightening out the resulting curls.


Remember to unfold the ends of pipe cleaners or aluminum foil, or remove the bobby pins from either end of a straw, before pulling them out.
Take out your first braid or curler slowly and check to see if the hair is still damp. If it is, redo the braid or curl as best you can, and leave the whole head of hair to dry for longer before taking everything out."
"
Brush out for a fuller, frizzy look.,
Separate hair gently for defined curls.,
Re-wet Barbie’s hair to undo curls.",How to Curl Barbie's Hair Using the Freezer3," Lightly brush or comb through your Barbie’s hair if you want a fuller, frizzier hairdo. Use fingers first, then a hairbrush if needed or desired, to separate the curls and create volume.


Note that this method may straighten out curls more than desired, or turn tight curls into more relaxed waves or crinkles.
Go slowly and start with a small section of hair to make sure you like the effect of the curls brushed out before you do the whole head of hair.

, Use just your fingers to adjust curls as they are when you first take out your braids or curlers. You can separate the curls gently for a fuller and more relaxed look, or leave them alone completely to keep tight, defined curls.


To keep tight, smooth curls, touch them as little as possible after you take the braids or curlers out very gently. Don’t run your fingers, a brush, or anything else through the curls and they will stay in place for quite awhile.
To create a little more volume and natural-looking curls, separate the curls just slightly by adjusting the hair with your fingers to pull apart the curls a little. Take it slow so you can make sure you like the look before you do the whole head of hair.

, When you’re ready to give your Barbie a new hairdo, undo the curls simply by rewetting the hair. Brush out the wet hair and let it dry again to return it back to its original straight style.


Avoid using any human hair products like hairspray to keep the curls in place on Barbie hair, as these will only gunk it up over time and make it much harder to create hairstyles in the future.
If your Barbie’s hair is tangled and difficult to return back to normal, try retreating it with a fabric softener and water mixture. Or you can dip it in warm or hot water again to help get it smooth."

Find a purpose for the finished doll.",How to Make Rag Dolls1," Choose a human or an animal. Start with the fabric color. Any plain fabric will do, but you might want to choose something approximately skin-colored. Decide on the color of the hair and eyes. If you’re making an animal, you should also decide on whisker color.


Traditionally, rag dolls were made from scraps of fabric (rags). Try to find enough fabric to recycle from a pillowcase, an old shirt, or clothes that don't fit.;
, To make things easier, download free templates from websites like AllFreeSewing.com, Pinterest, or AllCrafts.net. Then, trace the outline onto the fabric. Add some extra width (half an inch to 5/8"") all around the outside of your outline for a seam allowance.


Use tailor's chalk or washable pencil to mark the fabric if you don't want leftover marks showing through.

, Place the right sides of the fabric together. Cut out the pattern on the outermost line. Make sure you’re cutting both pieces of fabric at the same time.


This is step will be easier if you keep the template on the fabric.

, Pin the fabric. Stitch around most of the outline. Leave an opening for the stuffing.

, Position your scissors between the doll’s legs. Cut triangular notches in the seam allowance. Be careful to not cut into the seam itself.

, Do this by working the fabric through the opening. Use the eraser side of a pencil for smaller widths on the doll’s body.

, Feel free to use whatever kind of stuffing you want. Buy polyester fiberfill at any craft store. For a more natural approach, use cotton balls. If you really want to go green, use yarn or fabric scraps left over from your old projects.

, Stitch it closed. You may do this by hand or with a sewing machine.

, Use your marker or chalk to mark the point where the arms and legs meet the doll’s body. Stitch into these marks at all four points. Draw your needle through to the other side. When you’re finished, there should be a small dip between the body and the limbs.

, Sew on buttons for the eyes and nose. If you’re making the doll for a baby or young toddler, use embroidery floss to prevent a choking hazard. Use red yarn or embroidery floss for the mouth., Use yarn or string for this step. Choose black, brown, yellow, or red for natural hair colors. If you want to make a punk rocker doll, go for pink, purple, or other funky hair color. To complete the hairstyle:


Decide how long you want the doll’s hair to be. Cut the yarn to twice that length.
Place the middle of the yarn at the center of the head. Pin it in place.
Sew the middle of the hair to the head. This should form a part in the center of the hair.Glue or sew the rest of the hair to about where the ears would be.
Glue or sew additional hair to the back of the doll’s head, if desired.
For long-haired dolls, braid or tie the sides of the hair into pigtails.

, Download free templates from crafting websites or design your own template by sketching the outlines on newspaper. Trace the template on your choice of fabric. Cut out the design, and stitch everything together.You can also make an easy no-sew outfit for your doll using fabric glue.

, Give the doll to a child in your life. Add it to the décor of your living room or kitchen. Depending on the doll’s color scheme and clothing, you can also use it as part of our holiday decorating.

Take off any clothing and accessories.,
Wash her hair using shampoo or soap.,

Take some scissors (if you are young, you might need adult supervision) and cut Barbie's hair into a new hair style.,
Consider dyeing her hair.,
Make some clothing.,
Apply makeup if desired.",How to Give a Barbie a Makeover," Find a nice tub or sink which is deep enough for you to dip her into the water. If she's is filthy, wash her body with soap or washing up liquid.

Do not do this on wood floors.
, For a smooth finish, soak with fabric softener, rinse you could also brush shampoo and conditioner through her hair and wash out thoroughly, and let dry.

, A wide-toothed comb can help remove mats.

, Try doing something simple like short hair or bobs, or layers if you like. Don't hold the hair between the index and middle finger while cutting; it will stretch out and might come shorter than expected.

, If you want to be creative and funky, you can dye Barbie's hair using Kool-Aid. Massage some Kool-Aid powder into her hair (as well as enough water). Dry her hair and then wash out any remaining powder. It should wash off using hot water and soap. Washable markers work well too.


If you don't like the Kool-Aid idea, you could use a permanent marker such as a Sharpie to colour her hair. But remember, a permanent marker is permanent.






If you don't want to dye her hair at all, you can temporarily use a fluorescent highlighter to give Barbie some awesome highlights. The liquid in a highlighter most of the time is not permanent, so if you are not satisfied, you could try again.







, If you have experience sewing or you know how to, find some really neat fabric. Try designing a cool fashion for Barbie and sew it together. If you hate your current Barbie outfit, you can just alternate it to suit your liking (like sewing on beads etc).

, Use acrylic paint and a small paint brush. You can use black for eyeliner, red for lips, pink for cheeks, etc. You can soften the acrylic paint colors by adding water. After the paint has dried, go over the paint with a matte finish to make sure the paint stays on the Barbie. If you want to remove the makeup from the Barbie before you start painting her, you can remove the makeup by using acetone and a q-tip. You can finish off her lips with some Vaseline to provide lovely shine to those lips, or you can use a clear gloss acrylic paint.


Never, ever, ever use ink on a doll of any kind, especially a Barbie. The ink will expand on the vinyl and permanently change and damage your Barbie. So do not use a pen to create her makeup, unless you want to end up with a ruined doll.

Get out your favorite Barbie doll, along with your collection of Barbie clothing.,

By now you should have your Barbie's full ensemble laid out next to her.,
Add shoes and accessories last.",How to Dress a Barbie Doll," Remember, the clothes that initially came with the doll will probably fit her best, but Barbie clothing in general is pretty versatile. If you're a big Barbie fan, you've probably accumulated enough pieces to have no trouble picking out a fashionable outfit.;
, For example, a shirt and a skirt, or a sweater and a pair of jeans if you're dressing Barbie for cold weather. You'll find that some clothes will fit better on certain dolls, since bust, chest, and hip size can vary depending on when the doll was made. Additionally, you should factor in the different types of doll clothing brands when picking out your Barbie's outfit. If you're going for a really good fit, don't use anything from a Bratz or MyScene wardrobe!

, Are you trying to dress Olympic Barbie? Dig up some tennis shoes. Hipster Barbie? A miniature pair of Oxfords should do the trick. What about CEO Barbie? You can do no wrong with a pair of classic black heels. Remember, Barbie's shoes are one of her claims to fame, so your process of selection must be airtight!

, Again, match them to whatever identity you've chosen for her today. Doctor Barbie might have a stethoscope hanging around her neck; Editor Barbie might have a pair of reading glasses. Don't be afraid to mix and match! Your Barbie can have as many interests and occupations as you want, and her outfit should reflect that.

, Moment of truth: time to put it on. Most Barbie doll clothes have Velcro or clasps on the back, so simply unfasten that part and pull her arms and legs through. Dresses will be easier for Barbie to wear, but if you're looking for a challenge, go ahead and try out a three- or four-piece outfit. Once you've gotten her dressed, flip her over and press the Velcro or clasp back together.


Some sleeves may have very small cuffs. In order to get the hands through the cuff, you may need to squeeze the doll's hands while inserting them.






Gently twisting the sleeve left and right during the process may help.







, These should be simple enough to get on your Barbie, although they tend to fall off more easily than primary articles of clothing. If you want to preserve this perfect look of yours, snap a photo or two. If not, go ahead and send Barbie on her next adventure!

In addition to your Barbie doll, you will need pipe cleaners. If you don't have pipe cleaners, you can usually find them it at a local craft store.If you cannot find pipe cleaners, any thin, twistable device works. You could try gathering twist ties from bread bags, for example.
You will also need a pair of scissors.
If you're considering washing your doll's hair before or after curling it, you should have have a comb, gentle shampoo, and conditioner.;
, Cut the pipe cleaners or twist ties in half using the scissors. Then, fold the pipe cleaners or twist ties into a v-shape.Twist ties are generally shorter than pipe cleaners. You may not need to cut them in half, depending on their length.








, Once your supplies are prepared, you can begin working with Barbie's hair. Gather one small section of Barbie's hair. Then, take your pipe cleaner and place the bended end on the doll's scalp. Pull the hair in a straight line along the twist tie or pipe cleaner.








, Take the section of twirled hair and wrap it over and under each side of the pipe cleaner or twist tie. Do this until you reach the end of the strand of hair. Then, twist the ends of the pipe cleaner or twist tie together to prevent the hair from unraveling.







, Take another section of Barbie's hair and repeat the process above. Keep repeating until all of Barbie's hair is curled into pipe cleaners or twist ties.How many curls you have depends on how curly you want your Barbie's hair. Thinner strands will result in frizzier, tighter curls while thicker strands will result in wavier curls.








, Once all the pipe cleaners are in, boil a pot of water. Dunk Barbie's head in the water and hold for a count of ten.







, After counting to ten, remove Barbie's head from the water. Gently blot the doll's hair dry with a clean paper towel.








, For best results, leave the doll's hair alone overnight. This will give the hair time to fully dry, allowing the curls to set in completely., In the morning, unravel all of the twists in Barbie's hair. Work slowly as to not tangle the hair in the process. Separate the curls and gently fluff Barbie's hair, using your fingers or a small brush. If you notice any loose ends, gently snip them off with scissors.

Securing the arms will also form the chest and the waist.

, Gather the area below the waist into two equal parts. Twist each side once to make them thinner. Tie the bottom of each side to give the appearance of legs, ankles, and feet.

, Cut out small circles of blue, brown, or green fabric to make the eyes. Use a small piece of red yarn to make the mouth. Glue these to the face.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your supplies.,
Section off a piece of Barbie's hair.,
Twist and wrap the section of hair.,
Apply pipe cleaners or twist ties.,
Secure the spiral in place.,
Repeat.,
Dip Barbie's head in boiling water.,
Gently blot the hair dry.,
Leave overnight.,
Remove the twist ties or pipe cleaners.",How to Curl Barbie Hair2," If you would rather give Barbie an afro, you follow a similar process. Before beginning, gather the supplies you'll need.


You will need end papers, which are sold at beauty supplies shops.
In addition to end papers, you'll need pipe cleaners or twist ties, scissors, and boiling water., Get your supplies read before beginning the process. As with the above method, you'll need to cut the pipe cleaners or twist ties in half and fold them into a v-shape.Once again, as twist ties are shorter it may not be necessary to cut them in half before use.








, Before you begin, section off a piece of Barbie's hair. Use smaller sections of hair for tighter curls. The smaller your sections, the more Barbie's hair will resemble an afro.

, Once you've sectioned off a small section of hair, twist that hair into a tight spiral. Then, use your end papers to wrap up the spiral.








, Place the bended end of your pipe cleaner or twist tie on Barbie's scalp. Tightly zig-zag the doll's hair around the pipe cleaner or twist tie until you reach the end of the strand.







, Once you've zig-zagged the doll's hair to the end of the twist tie or spiral, you'll need to make sure it stays secure. This is important as you'll be leaving it in overnight. Twist the ends of the pipe cleaner or twist tie around the lock to secure.







, Repeat the above process until all of Barbie's hair is in twist ties or pipe cleaners. This can take a long time. To make an afro, the strands of hair you use will be smaller. The smaller the strands, the frizzier and bigger the afro.







, Once all the pipe cleaners or twist ties are in, dip Barbie's head in boiling water. Hold for 10 seconds.








, Try your best to get Barbie's hair as dry as possible. You should blot dry the exterior of the doll's hair with a towel. Try to get it dry enough that it's no longer dripping wet., You'll need to let the doll's hair dry overnight for best results. Set the doll aside and leave the twist ties or pipe cleaners in until the following morning.

, After letting Barbie's hair dry overnight, remove the pipe cleaners. Using your fingers, separate the curls. Comb the curls out, back combing as needed, to create fluffy, afro-style hair for Barbie.








If you notice any loose ends on Barbie's hair, simply snip these away with a pair of scissors."
"
Comb your Barbie's hair.,
Wet Barbie's hair.,
Apply shampoo and conditioner.,
Rinse the hair.,
Pat the hair dry.,
Spray a leave-in conditioner on Barbie's hair.",How to Curl Barbie Hair3," You should wash your Barbie's hair regularly to maintain it, especially if you frequently curl or otherwise tamper with the doll's hair. Before washing, gently brush Barbie's hair. Try to remove any snags or tangles prior to washing.







, Once Barbie's hair is brushed out, get it wet. Run lukewarm water over Barbie's hair until it's wet throughout. Then, you can start applying shampoo and conditioner.








, You should use a gentle brand of shampoo and conditioner on Barbie's hair. Consider baby shampoo. When you add shampoo, work it in gently to remove any dirt or grime.








, When you're done applying product, rinse out all shampoo and conditioner under running water. Make sure all products are removed completely. Leaving product in can cause damage to the doll's hair. Keep rinsing until you no longer notice suds or residue leaving Barbie's hair.







, Take a clean paper or bathroom towel. Gently pat the hair dry, removing as much excess water as you can.

, Put leave-in conditioner in a small spray bottle. Gently spritz Barbie's hair with the conditioner. This will prevent the hair from drying out.

Decide what material is right for you needs.,
Decide what length your doll hair will be.,
Decide what hairstyle your doll will have.,
Gather your materials.",How to Make Doll Hair1," Perhaps the most important decision is what material of doll hair you want. One factor to consider is the type of doll you are attaching it to. Is the doll made of fabric or plastic? Are you placing new hair onto the doll, or replacing hair? If you are replacing hair, you may want to replace the same type of hair that was removed.Yarn hair is often used on fabric and knitted dolls. It will match with the doll's appearance and will be easier to stick on the doll's head.
Synthetic hair is what you see on most collectible dolls, and plastic dolls like Barbie dolls. It looks like real human hair but is synthetic material.
You should be able to find synthetic hair and yarn at most craft stores. Synthetic hair may be slightly harder to find, however, so you may have to order it online.;
, Once you have a material chosen for your doll hair you need to decide what you want the hair to look like. Length is an important factor. Will your doll have short hair, medium length hair, or long hair?


Yarn hair is more often used for medium to long lengths but is sometimes used for short hair.Synthetic hair is versatile and comes in any type or length.
Think about the type of doll you're making, or the doll whose hair you're replacing. A baby doll may have shorter hair than a doll that's supposed to be an older age. If you're making a doll that's meant to look like a particular character, you should make sure your doll's hair matches the character. If you're making a Rapunzel doll, for example, you'll want your doll to have very long hair.

, The next question for your doll’s hair is style. Do you want to curl your doll hair, leave it wavy, or straight? Some doll hair material is easier to curl than others, and some doll hair looks better straight or wavy.


Yarn hair usually comes as a straight fabric but you can curl it by wrapping it around a small wooden dowel and setting it aside for a bit. When you unwrap the yarn, it should be curly.You can create almost any look with synthetic hair. You can buy synthetic hair that is already waved, curled, or braided from a craft store or online.

, To make the process easier it is a good idea to have all your materials purchased and ready to go when you make your doll hair. This way you will be well prepared. You can make your doll hair without interruption and admire your finished product. You will need:


A pair of scissors
A sewing needle or a sewing machine
Your desired doll hair material
Scotch tape
Flexible measuring tape
A hot glue gun (for yarn hair)
Tacky glue (for synthetic hair)
Tissue paper
A DVD case (for measuring yarn)

"
"
Wind the yarn around your DVD case.,
Tape off the yarn.,
Cut the yarn.,
Secure the yarn with tissue paper.,
Sew the yarn to the tissue paper.,
Remove the tissue paper.,
Repeat this process, but with less yarn.,
Glue the larger piece of hair to the doll’s head.,
Add a side part with the smaller strand.,
Style your doll hair.",How to Make Doll Hair2," Take your spool of yarn and your DVD case. You want to wrap the yarn around the DVD case width-wise. There are two sides to a DVD case: a notched side, where the case opens, and a smooth side. Begin winding at the notched side, slightly left of the center. Wind the yarn towards the center of the DVD.Wind the yarn fairly tight and make sure no yarn is overlapping. You should also wind the yarn close together, so there are no gaps in yarn.
Keep winding the yarn until you've moved 3 to 3.5 inches across the DVD. If there are any gaps in the yarn, push the yarn together to fill in these gaps.
If you have difficulty keeping the yarn in place with your fingers alone, you can tape down the end of the yarn with a piece of scotch tape.

, Once your yarn is wound around the DVD, take two long pieces of scotch tape. Use this tape on the smooth side of the DVD. On the front and back of the DVD, just underneath the smooth side, tape down the yarn. The yarn on the smooth side should be securely taped to the DVD., Take a pair of scissors and slip them underneath the notched edge of the DVD. Cut through the yarn on this side of the DVD. Then, un-tape the yarn on the smooth side, keeping the tape securely attached to the yarn. You should begin to see something of a wig forming. The tape marks a barrier where the doll's part will be. There should be strands of loose yarn coming off either side this part.If you're struggling to cut the yarn, get a sharper pair of scissors. You should be using sewing scissors rather than normal craft scissors. You do not want your doll's hair to look uneven.

, Cut off a thin piece of tissue paper roughly 4 by 8 inches. Lay the tissue paper on a flat surface. Place the taped portion of the yarn between each strand of tape on the tissue paper. Fold the tissue paper over this portion of the yarn, sandwiching the yarn between the tissue paper.You should have a long line of strands of yarn with the tissue resting on the halfway point between the strands. As you can see, hair is forming. The tissue paper represents where the doll's part will be located.

, Working through the middle of the tissue paper, sew all your strands of yarn together. Sew vertically up the middle so you have a straight line of thread going through all your layers in the center. You should have a grouping of hair on each side that meets in the middle, where your thread holds the strands together.If you are savvy with a needle you can sew them together manually. Otherwise, you can use a sewing machine to sew a straight line through them.
Use small, tight stitches. These should keep the hair secure.

, Now that your strands are sewn together you can remove the excess tissue paper at the sides of the line you sewed. Remove the tissue paper slowly and gently, being careful not to tear out any thread. Using tweezers might be helpful. All that should remain are the two strands of yarn doll hair, with the thread holding them together in the center.If you're struggling to remove the tissue paper, try trimming some of it off with a small pair of scissors. Just be careful not to snip any of the yarn by mistake.

, You will want to repeat this process one more time. However, stop winding the yarn after you've moved about an inch or two across the DVD case.Once again, secure the end of the yarn with a piece of scotch tape if you're having trouble keeping it in place with your fingers.
Remember, wind the yarn around the DVD case, secure the smooth edges with tape, and then cut the yarn by tucking your scissors under the notch in the case.
When you're done, secure the strands with tissue paper and sew down the center.

, Grab the larger piece of your sewn together bunch of yarn hair. Remember, the larger piece has a part that runs roughly three to three and a half inches in length. Get your hot glue gun. Once the glue is hot, put a line of glue down the seam you just made and press it to the top center of your doll’s head. Hold it there until the glue has dried. When it is dry you can flip the hair over and admire your finished doll hair.If glue is not holding the hair in place and your doll is fabric, you can sew the hair to the doll's head. Take an extra piece of yarn and use a long needle to backstitch the hair to the top of the doll’s head. It may be helpful to go over the seam twice.
If you're using yarn hair on a plastic doll, you will want to use tacky glue instead of hot glue. However, keep in mind synthetic hair tends to look better on plastic dolls.

, Now, take your smaller strand of hair. This is the strand of hair with the part running an inch to two inches in length. Follow the same process with gluing or stitching the hair to the doll's head. However, place the part slightly to the left or right of the center of your doll's scalp. This will create a side part, as well as add some layers to your doll's hair.If you can still see a lot of the doll's scalp at this point, consider adding another layer of hair. you can create another larger wig and secure it in the center of the doll's head so it overlaps with the existing hair.

, You can style the doll hair how you want. You can cut the hair, braid the hair, paint the hair, make a ponytail, or do anything else you want with it. If you don’t want to style it you can just leave it how it is. It is your doll hair; feel free to do what you want with it.

Remove synthetic hair from the bag.,
Cut the synthetic hair to your desired length.,
Apply glue to the center of the doll’s hair.,
Press a sewing needle to the glue.,
Remove the sewing needle.,
Glue the hair to the doll’s head.,
Style your doll hair.",How to Make Doll Hair3," To start, you'll want to remove the synthetic hair from the bag it came in. This can be difficult, as synthetic hair is fine and often somewhat tangled or bunched up when packaged. Slowly remove small bunches of hair at a time, smoothing them out as you go and removing any fuzzy bits.You may have to periodically use your fingers, or a doll comb, to comb through tangled bits of synthetic hair. It can get tangled easily.
Keep removing small bunches of hair and smoothing them out until you have a long line of synthetic hair.

, Once you've removed and sorted through the synthetic hair, you can now cut the hair to the length appropriate for your doll. Cut the doll hair to the length you desire. The hair will drape over the doll’s head so cut the hair to twice the length that the doll’s hair length will be.Synthetic hair can sometimes be difficult to cut, as it's often unwieldy to handle. Dampening the hair may help it stay together more, allowing you to better judge where to cut.

, Wrap the strands of hair tightly around your pointer and middle finger, with the center of the strands exposed. This means you should wrap the hair so the midpoint of the hair is resting on your index finger. Apply a thin layer of tacky glue vertically across the center of the strands. Make sure you are covering as many strands as possible.If you're struggling to move the glue in a straight line, ask a friend to do this part for you. It may be hard to hold the hair with one hand and maneuver the glue with the other.

, Before the tacky glue dries, place a sewing needle along the line of glue you just applied. It helps to pinch the hair together underneath the needle, as close to the needle as possible. This process is a means to force the glue to seep through the hair, gluing all the strands together at the center. Hold the needle there while the tacky glue dries.Once again, this may be difficult to do on your own. If you're struggling to hold the needle in one hand, and the hair in the other, ask a friend for help.

, Once the glue is dry, carefully remove the needle by sliding it out from the bundle of hair. When the needle has been removed you can flip the hair over. You should have hair with two distinctive halves and a dip in the center where your needle had been.As with the other steps, you can ask a friend for help here. It may be helpful to have a friend hold the hair in place as you slide the needle out.

, Now you need to apply the hair to the doll’s head. Use tacky glue for plastic dolls and hot glue for dolls made from fabric. Be careful not to use too much glue because it will seep through the synthetic hair and create knots in the hair. A small amount of glue is enough to hold the hair in place.Apply a thin line of tacky glue to the center of the doll’s head. Press the center strip of the hair (where your needle was) to this line of glue so the strip looks like the part in the hair. Keep it pressed there until the glue dries.
Lift one side of the hair up at the part and apply a thin line of glue, spreading it around the side of the head. Just a tiny bit of glue is enough. Lay the hair back down and let it dry. Repeat this on the other side.
Press all the hair down so the glue can bond to the hair.

, It's time to style the doll's hair however you want. You can curl it, braid it, put it in a ponytail, or cut it shorter. Since the hair is synthetic, be sure you test the style on a lock of extra hair to make sure it holds correctly and doesn't damage the hair. This is especially important if you're applying heat, as you don't want to melt the hair.

Have a crochet doll ready.,
Wrap the yarn tightly around a thin dowel.,
Soak the yarn with boiling water, then blot the excess.,
Place the dowel on a rimmed backing sheet.,
Bake the yarn in your oven until it is dry.,
Allow the yarn to cool before unwrapping it.,
Wrap yarn around base object.,
Cut the wrapped yarn along one edge.,
Attach the yarn to the doll's head with a slip stitch.,
Continue attaching the yarn to your doll's head.",How to Make Curly Doll Hair with Yarn1," This method works best on crochet amigurumi dolls. If your doll is made from cloth, or any other material, you will have to crochet a wig cap for the doll first, follow this method, then attach the wig cap.;
, The thinner the dowel, the tighter the curl will be. Something around 3/8-inch (0.95-centimeter) would be ideal, however. Make sure that you are only wrapping the yarn in a single layer; don't let the yarn overlap.You can also use a knitting needle instead. A size 4, or smaller, would be ideal.Loosen the first and last loops, then tuck the tails ends under them. Tug on the tail ends to tighten the loops. This will keep the yarn from unraveling., Boil some water in a pot or kettle first, then pour it over the yarn. Use a towel to gently blot any excess water. You want it to be soaked, but not dripping., Make sure that the ends of the dowels resting on the rim. Do not let the rest of the dowel or the yarn touch the actual baking sheet. If you let the yarn touch the sheet, it may not dry properly. The hot metal may also scorch the yarn., Preheat your oven to the lowest temperature possible, about 200 to 250°F (94 to 122°C) first. Once it reaches the right temperature, stick the yarn into the oven. Let it bake until it is completely dry, about minutes.Check on the every 15 minutes, especially if it is acrylic, so that it doesn't melt.If you are using a ""soft"" variety of yarn, raise the temperature to 300F, and bake it for 55 minutes instead., This will take about 10 minutes. Once the yarn has cooled, gently unravel it from the dowel.As you unwrap it, it should hold its curl.

, Choose a book, folder, CD case, or even a piece of cardboard that is about twice the length you want the hair to be. Wrap the curled yarn around the base object tightly, so that the strands become straight. Keep wrapping until you run out of yarn.

, When you wrapped your yarn around your base object, you will have two folded edges. Choose one, and cut along it. Slid the yarn off of the base object, but keep it folded. The fold will be your guide for the next step.


Consider separating the yarn into individual strands. You will get about 4 strands from each piece of yarn. Treat these four strands as a single strand for the rest of this method., Push your crochet hook through a stitch on your doll's hairline. Catch the curled strand by the middle. Pull a loop back through the stitch with your hook. Pull the tails through loop, then tug on them gently to tighten the loop.If you are using a crocheted wig cap, then push the hook through a stitch on the wig cap.

, Start around the outer edge, where the hairline is, and work your way towards the center in rings. You don't have to insert the yarn into every stitch, especially if your doll is very small.

Dress the doll.",How to Make Clay Dolls," You'll want a drawing or a photo of a doll body that you want to replicate. Clay dolls work best if making a Barbie-sized doll or smaller. You can draw the general shape that you want for your doll, or you can print out a picture of what you want. Don't take on anything too complicated as a beginner.;
, Cut all the fur off of a pipe cleaner. Trim the wires until they are just about a centimeter longer than each section of the body. You'll need wire pieces for the upper and lower arms, the upper and lower legs, the feet, the hands, the head, the chest and the hips. The final three pieces will need to be in a circle shape, with straight sections coming down where a connection will need to be made.


The head, if you want a good size neck, will need an extra long section of straight wire. It should be at least 2 centimeters (0.8 in) long.

, You don't want to make the doll too heavy and waste a bunch of clay, so pad the frame with a cheap material. Paper mache, aluminium foil, and tape are the most common materials. Place your material by wrapping it around the wire frame, making the ""muscles"" of the figure. Make sure to leave the extra wire uncovered, as this will be used to make the joints. When done, it should look a little like a snow man in its level of detail.

, Roughly cover all of the padded area with clay. Only worry about getting the major shapes at first. The finer details can be made later. If using an air-dry clay, work on only one body part at a time, since you don't want to lose the softness of the clay.


Study how muscle groups look and work if you want to get better at this. This will make for a more realistic looking doll. For example, real legs don't look like tubes: they're curved because under the skin there are actually lots and lots of different shapes that just get covered up.

, Start adding more clay and carving other parts away to create details like eyes, nose, mouth, fingers, etc. You can use all sorts of household tools to carve the clay, like toothpicks, utility knives, empty pens, and other items.









Generally, the areas where there should be a hole (like a mouth) should be cut away to make the rough shape. Areas that stick out (like a nose) should be shaped roughly as a separate piece and then added on. Use your finger or a tool to smooth the clay and make the additions and subtractions transition in a way that looks natural.
Any general changes in topography (like cheek bones) might be able to be created by shifting the existing material, but they may also require new material to be laid down. Just make the transition as smooth as you can.
If you use Sculpey clay, you can use liquid Sculpey to smooth transitions and create details, but realize that you'll have to deal with changes in the curing and coloring process.

, Cure the clay as described by the clay's manufacturer. It may need to be baked, air dry, or other curing method.


For air drying, 2 or more hours are often needed for the clay to cure completely.
A general rule of thumb with oven baking clay is to cook it for longer at a lower temperature than what is recommended by the manufacturer. This reduces the chance of burning.
Some clays will require a kiln in order to cure them. This is standard for traditional clays. You may be able to rent time with a local commercial kiln if you do not own one, but you should take this into account when you choose your clay.

, Using model enamel paints or nail polish (for polymer clay) or acrylic paints (if using other types of clay), you can paint details like the eyes and mouth, to get a more life-like appearance. Let the paint dry after you're done, before going on to anything else.









If you want to avoid the difficulty of painting the eyes, you can cheat and use plastic doll eyes, which are embedded in the clay of the head and then a clay ""eyelid"" placed over them to keep them in place and make them look realistic.
You can if you want to add just a little, faint color, you can use watercolor and sealant or you can even apply makeup to the doll.
Avoid using the color black for details like the mouth. Real faces don't have the color black at the line of the mouth, so your doll shouldn't either. Go for softer shades, like dark brown or pink.

, Take scraps of long-haired sheepskin or any real or faux fur with the ""skin"" still attached. Cut the skin part to form four pieces that recreate the shape of the head. Usually this will mean a square for the top and a rectangle for the back, with C-ish shaped pieces for the sides. Once you have the pieces cut, sew them together to create a wig that can be placed or glued onto your doll's head.








, Start wrapping the exposed wire ends to connect the body parts together. Doing the joints in this way should allow the joints to remain flexible. Cover the joints with a rubber band if they will show and you don't want to risk injury.

, Now that the doll is completely assembled, you can dress them as you see fit! Use premade doll clothes or make your own! If you want to use premade doll clothes, make sure your doll is the same size as standard dolls before you make her. Making your own may, in many ways, be easier.


Clothes that cover the joints are desirable, as this will hide cosmetic problems.

Cut the yarn and pull it through the last loop.,
Stitch down the last row of hair, if desired.",How to Make Curly Doll Hair with Yarn2," This method works best on crochet amigurumi dolls. If your doll is made from cloth, or any other material, you will have to crochet a wig cap for the doll first, follow this method, then attach the wig cap.

, Poke your crochet hook through a stitch on the back-right of the doll's head. Pull a loop of yarn back through the stitch with the hook. Leave behind a short tail of yarn.Where you start crocheting will be the edge of the hair line. Plan carefully!
Use a crochet hook that matches your yarn. When you buy your yarn, look at the label to find out what kind of hook you should use.

, Once you have the yarn attached to the doll's head, begin making your first chain stitch. Make it twice as long as you want the hair to be. Hair shortens as it curls. If you make it the right length at the start, it will end up too short in the end!, Insert your hook through the third chain from the hook. Pull a loop of yarn through the chain. Begin slip stitching down the length of the chain until you reach the base.If your doll is large, or if you want thicker curls, use a single crochet instead of a slip stitch., Insert your hook back into the starting stitch on the doll's head, and out the next one. If your doll has thick hair, your might want to poke the hook out a few stitches over instead., Before you make the first chain, place the tail end of the yarn over your work. Chain stitch right over the tail end, pinning it down., Keep making chains until your reach the left side of the doll's head. By now, the tail should be completely hidden. If it isn't, you can trim it down now.

, Poke your hook back into the stitch you just attached your last curl to. Instead of poking the hook out of the next stitch on the left, poke the hook out of the next stitch above.

, Keep working left to right, right to left, in zigzags until you reach the front hairline. Try to follow your doll's hairline—you can do this by making each row a little wider than the one below it. You can also lightly sketch out a hairline using a washable dressmaker's marker.


The chains will curl naturally on their own. You can help them curl further by wrapping them around your finger.

, When you finish your last curl, cut the yarn, leaving behind a tail. Use your hook to pull the tail back through the last loop of yarn. Gently tug on the tail to tighten the loop., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help the hair on your doll lay down better. Start by threading the tail through a yarn needle. Then:Pull the needle through a stitch between the last two rows of curls.

Buy supplies.,
Assemble the doll.,
Paint a face on the doll.,
Add the wig.,
Dress the doll.",How to Make a Doll1," Go to a hobby shop and buy a doll head, body, arms, and legs. Be sure everything is roughly matched size-wise. Some hobby shops may sell kits that take care of such considerations for you. You'll also need paint and thinner, a small paintbrush, and some doll clothes.


Doll heads range from pre-painted vinyl heads with synthetic hair to simple base elements that can be combined as you see fit. Be aware that if you buy a doll head, eyes, and a wig all separately, you'll need to do a bit more work to put the doll together.
Wigs can be made from any type of fabric you like. Specialty yarns like alpaca, mohair, and bouclé make great-looking hair, but Raggedy Ann-style colored yarn is fine, too.;
, Softer plastic doll parts can usually be pressed into pre-fitted holes on the body to make a doll with moving joints. Alternatively, use an appropriate type of glue (plastic cement or wood glue) to fix the doll's limbs in position, or to make a doll from simpler or harder parts.


If you use glue, wipe away excess glue from around the joint when you're finished.

, If your doll's head doesn't come pre-painted, it's time to paint makeup (and eyes, if needed) onto it. Acrylic paint should work for most materials. Use a small brush when painting, and start with the base colors first (for instance, white, then color, then a black pupil for the eyes). Let each layer dry before starting the next, and let the doll dry for a few more hours once you're finished.


Consider adding blush to your doll's cheeks by using pink paint thinned with some paint thinner.
If your doll's face is featureless, you may want to paint a nose onto it, in addition to the eyes and mouth. Use a U or sideways U shape to make one easily.

, If your doll requires a wig, now is the time to add it. You can make a simple and permanent wig by gluing pieces of yarn densely to the top of the doll's head with a strong adhesive, or you can make a switchable one by embroidering yarn into a piece of cloth cut to sit on the doll's head. Pre-made doll wigs are also available to purchase.

, Using whatever doll clothes you purchased, dress the doll however you like. If you weren't able to find any good doll clothes, set the doll aside for now and make it a project to find some. Once your doll is assembled, painted, and sitting in an outfit, it's done!

You can dry the corn husks off purchased corn. Alternatively, buy husks from an ethnic grocery store or farmer's markets (especially Hispanic ones). Some regular supermarkets might also stock them. During sweet corn season, many grocery stores allow customers to husk their corn in the store, and are more than happy to allow you to bring away some husks for free..but just ask the produce manager nicely first!;
, This will make them much more pliable and easier to work with.

, This tends to be a wet and messy project.

, If you have one or two that have holes or brown spots on them, put them on the outside.

, You could also use thick, strong rubber bands if you want.

Create your doll's features.,
Decide on your doll's skin type.,
Decide on your doll's size.,
Remember your own budget, experience, or taste.",How to Decide what Face up Would Look Good on your BJD," Consider what kind of personality makes up your doll and what colors you want to go with your doll's personality. For example, would you want it be a cute and shy doll? Take a more pale/laid back color that doesn't make your doll's face stand out too much, standing out would be the last thing a shy doll would want! If you have a jumpy and active doll, brighter colors would be good.;
, This is actually pretty logic too, if you love wearing leisure-wear, you probably won't be wearing any expensive make-up. If you are more elegant, show it! It helps to make your doll unique and the face-up more convincing. Always try to start the base with a tone you think is best for the style of clothing your doll wears. For example;


When your doll loves to wear elegant style dresses like beautiful gowns, her face-up could be done with a blush that is a very intense cardinal red.






For a Lolita doll a pale pink for a blush is mostly favorable.






For an Adventurous or historic doll use a peach blush mixed with a hint of any shade of brown. Another good thing to know is that peach can go with almost every girl style.







, Unless your doll truly enjoys cross playing(and there are ones like that)or if you want the mold to be more feminine or masculine, chose to either do a simple blushing session or go all the way with lip-gloss/setting eye-lashes etc.

, With this I mean their background;

Are they of royal background? Are they aristocrats? Were they born at the countryside? With a king or prince you can expect a more fancy face-up, and aristocrats used to wear very white make-up and fake moles in lots of different shapes.






Are they more from the city or the country-side? Think of things like tattoos, informal make-up like heart or star shaped things.






Also you could have a doll coming from environments varying from an enchanted forest to the top of a tree. Just brainstorm on everything that comes up in your mind, it will often help you try to figure out what look you are trying to create.







, How far are their eyes opened, how far are they apart, what is the shape of their eyes/nose/lips? This can be quite tricky sometimes and is really a matter of trying out either on a sheet of paper/photoshop or endlessly practicing face-up's. What you can also do is search the internet for face-up's on the same doll(mold) you have or something looking about the same. Or try to compare human models with the same features and try to look through that caked up make-up to find the basics.(Are the eyes lined out to stand out, are the lips accented or not, has there been a lot of dark or soft shading?)

, All tones and shades look different on each different type of skin tone. With a snow-white skin you will have to be careful not to use too much of darker colors, use really much lighter colors so it will blend in more easily with the skin type. Most of the time it is not pretty if the colors do not blend properly.

, Tiny, MSD, SD: The bigger the doll, the more mature the make-up most of the time. Keep this in mind when thinking of the concept.

, If you have a small budget at first, it is easier to start with a simple face-up(see material list), this means doing only blushing at first and not any eyelashes. This can still look awesome and it is a good way to practice to gain experience. And of course your taste counts; in the end it comes to what looks good on the doll you have, try to make the face-up to look like the image you want your doll to be.

Make the head.,
Make arms.,
Tie off the waist.",How to Make a Doll2," To make this rustic American-style doll, you'll need corn husks with the silk still on them. Around a dozen corn husks (one or two ears of corn at most) should be enough to make one doll. You'll also need a large bowl of water, scissors to cut the husks, and pins and twine to bind them into shape.

, Corn husk dolls are made with dried husks. Use a food drier, or set the husks out in the sun for a few days until they become dry and are no longer green. Sun drying the husks is the preferred method because it's more traditional (and corn husk dolls are steeped in both American Indian and colonial tradition), but as long as they're well-dried, the result will be more or less the same.

, Before the next step, pull the dried silk off of the husks and set it aside. You'll be using it soon, but it needs to stay dry while you soak the husks to keep it from getting soggy. Lay all the silk in generally the same direction rather than heaping or tangling it.

, When you're ready to make your doll, soak the dried husks in a bowl of water for about 10 minutes. Though it sounds counterintuitive, this won't actually rehydrate the husks you so carefully dried; rather, it will make them temporarily more flexible, so that you can bend them into shape without breaking them. Once the husks have soaked, blot them dry with paper towels and set them aside.


If the husks are significantly different in size from one another, now is a good time to tear or clip the largest ones so that they're all roughly the same size. This will help prevent a lopsided doll.

, Take a corn husk and lay it in front of you with the pointed end out, then lay a bunch of corn silk along its length. Next, lay two husks on top of the first husk and silk, also with their points away from you, and add more silk. Repeat everything one more time (for a total of six husks and hour sections of silk), and then tie the whole stack together about 1 ½ inches from the flat ends of the husks. Use scissors to round the flat ends of the husks.

, Pick up the husk and silk bundle and hold it firmly by the twined end, so that the pointed ends of the husks are pointing up. Peel back each husk in turn, pulling it in a different direction from the others so that each husk comes down on a different side. Once all the husks have been peeled, you'll have a shock of silk “hair” coming up from the center of a rounded shape. Tie twine snugly around the husks again to create a “head” roughly an inch high.

, There are two basic styles you can choose: braided or tube. To make tube arms, cut a 6 inch (15.2 cm) piece of husk and roll it lengthwise into a tube, then tie it off with twine near both ends. To make braided arms, cut 6 inches (15.2 cm) of husk into 3 strips (lengthwise) instead, and braid them together before tying them off. Make just one tube or braid, and then insert it through the husks below the head so that an equal length of arm sticks out either side.

, Using twine, wrap around the husks below the arms and cinch them in to create a waist. Double check to ensure that the arms are positioned at an appropriate height before you finish tying, so you can readjust them if necessary; the arms should typically be around 1 to 1 ½ inches from the waist. Once you're satisfied, Wrap a slender piece of husk over the twine on the doll's waist to create a belt or sash and hide the twine. Tie it in the back with a bow.

Gather supplies.,
Cut the fabric.,
Stitch the pieces.,
Add batting.,
Add hair and facial features.",How to Make a Doll3," The most important component for making a fabric doll is the pattern. There are many fabric doll patterns available for free online, as well as purchasable patterns at fabric and craft stores. Look at the image of the finished doll and choose one you like. Along with the pattern, purchase whatever cloth and/or fill, such as cotton batting, you might need.


A typical fabric doll will require a rectangular piece of natural-colored cloth (plus more for clothes), batting, colored thread, a sewing needle, and pins to hold pieces in place while you work. Read the pattern directions for specifics.

, Following the pattern you bought, cut out each piece of fabric with a pair of fabric scissors and set it aside, taking care not to fold or crumple any piece. Remember to allow a bit of extra fabric, generally about 1/8 of an inch, around each piece to account for seams.


Most doll patterns should provide clothing in a contrasting color, either in the form of a differently-colored body or a simple outfit; don't forget to cut those parts out, too.

, To allow your doll to fill out properly with the batting, you'll generally need to make stitches to help define curves. Again, follow the specific instructions on your pattern.

, Ball up your batting and insert it into each part of the doll that needs to be stuffed. Use thread that's the same color as the natural cloth you chose for the doll's body to tie off the open ends and prevent batting from escaping. Once every piece has been stuffed, stitch them together per the instructions on your pattern.


Batting tends to pull out from the bag in clumps or strips, but you can ball it evenly by laying out smaller pieces in a star or triangle pattern and rolling up each one in turn until you have the size you want.
Stuff the head most tightly, so it's firm. Stuff the body more loosely.

, All this requires is colored thread and a bit of patience. Use black, brown, blue, or green thread for the eyes, and red or black thread for the mouth. Sew each feature into the doll's face by using a needle threaded with a length of embroidery floss to help pull the colors through. Yarn hair can simply be stitched on.


To be sure your eyes and mouth are placed evenly, mark where you intend to stitch them with pins first. Take each pin out as you begin to work on that part.
If you looped the yarn when you stitched in the doll's hair, simply clip the loops to give it a full, messy head of hair.

Gather supplies.,
Paint the clothespin.,
Add details.,
Dress your doll.",How to Make a Doll4," To make this simple wooden doll, you'll need large craft clothespins (the kind with a rounded knob on the grip end), which can usually be found at craft stores. You'll also need acrylic paints, a fine-tipped felt marker, and some materials for making an outfit, such as felt, ribbons, or scrap cloth.

, The knob at the grip of the pin will serve as the head, and the split at the bottom will become the feet. Use acrylic paint to paint on whatever features you want, including shoes, which can be easily approximated by painting one color about ¼ of an inch up both “feet,” letting it dry, and then painting black or brown over that color up to about halfway. The black or brown becomes the shoe color; the first color is the sock color.


You can paint the clothespin with skin-colored paint if you want, but it's not strictly necessary. If you do, be sure to let it dry first before adding other details.
Paint the face so that it makes sense with the way the feet are split. Your doll will look very odd otherwise.

, Using your fine-tipped marker, draw any extra details you want to on the doll, such as pupils for the eyes or a smiling mouth.

, Using your scrap materials, scissors, and some craft glue, think of a fun outfit for your doll. Remember to pin things in place before you cut, to be sure they'll fit properly. Consider making a hat or wig of some type for your doll's bald head. Once you're satisfied, glue each item into place with a bit of craft glue.


Your clothespin doll won't hold up a lot under sustained play, but it does make a great family project or childhood keepsake. Don't worry if it falls apart just fix it.

For a pretty accent bow, you can use a different color piece of yarn., Tie a piece of string in a tight knot around where you'd like the neck of the doll to be. Don't worry if it ends up being too high or too low; you can adjust it later., Tie a string tightly around the middle of the looped strings where you'd like the waist to be., For a different look, braid the arms before tying them off., (You can also leave the ends looped if you prefer the look.) Alternatively, you can make legs by splitting the middle into 2 parts from the waist down and tying them off like you did the arms; don’t forget that you can braid these as well.

The dolls.,
To make a video you might want a video camera.,
Have an account on YouTube and make an interesting profile.",How to Make Bratz Videos1," Of course, you might need to actually have Bratz dolls. No, you don't need to have one hundred.About fifty would be recommended, just for extras and background characters and more variety. You would want to watch a show with the same doll as another? Another thing, find rare dolls. Most Goodwill stores are Bratz heavens and they aren't really expensive to buy! It would be cool if you had an articulated Cloe or Sheridan.;
, You don't need to have a fancy camera that they use to make real movies. Just a simple HD one.

, Use your images! You don't have to be a great photographer, but use your pictures. Take a picture of your favorite dolls and make a collage. For the icon, take a picture of your favorite doll. You may have to crop and edit it. This way, people know that it's you.

If there are sharp edges after cutting the stick, file off using a nail file.

, This should be about three quarters the length of the stick and a reasonable width in comparison to the size of the doll holding such a treat. This forms the base of the popsicle or ice lolly.

, Use a realistic color, one that would match a popsicle or ice lolly.

, Cut off any excess, then glue firmly onto the foam piece. Allow to dry.

, Keep the glued side of the paper facing onto the stick.

, This will protect the paper during play.

, Once the item has fully dried, it can be used with your doll.

Be creative!,
Plan.,
Have some good props, the place, the main character, and etc.,
Have a script.",How to Make Bratz Videos2," What is it about? Maybe: A nerdy girl becoming a popular teen, but she ends up betraying her friends. Or how about twin sisters with a dark secret. It can also be fiction, like about a vampire or mermaids. But of course you'd need fangs and fake blood and a mermaids tail.

, You need to plan! What is season one all about? Whoa- before we step there, let's talk about the title. Be creative. If it's about twins with a secret what about: Pretty Faces, Ugly Hearts or Identical Secrets.

, You may need a doll house with several rooms. It's fun to make the set's props, not buy them! Now the characters. Be sure to remember which doll plays who. You don't want to have a Cloe playing Heather, and then a Jade in the next episode. That only works if she changes looks or something.

, Yes, you can try improv, but it's better to have a game plan. This helps you remember, ""I'm on episode twenty, Hanna is about to bite her next victim and she says something funny..."". This is optional, but you can also include in the script camera angles, positions, what a character does (like an action), etc.

You have your doll, your camera, your script.,
Editing!,
Post.",How to Make Bratz Videos3," Great! A great tip to use while filming is to hold your doll by her feet if it's a close-up. You can use the ""pause"" button on your camera if it has one, but sometimes as you watch over, it makes a weird clicking noise. It's silent, but it can be really annoying. Accidents can happen though. Let's say you already have two minutes of filming down and your hand shows. You have to delete it. It sucks, but that's called perfection.

, If your doll throws a ball of fire, you want people to see it. Right? Windows Movie Maker is good, but not really professional. Sony Vegas Pro is great, but expensive. Amazon.com sells hundred of editors for thirty dollars. You want the best for your show. Everything can't be free.

, This is just short. You may post it like, Bratz: Identical Secrets (Season One) Eps. 1 ""Lies"". You edit it, and then you post it. Not hard. But sometimes, it can take an hour to upload that twelve minute video. Maybe even more. But remember-not everyone can get nine hundred subscribers. Get the word out!

Plan a time for the premiere.,
The premiere of episode one.",How to Create a Bratz Series on YouTube," You're going to have to decide what the plot of the story will be, as in what's it gonna be about? For example: Surviving high school, becoming a magical mermaid, getting lost on a deserted island, or two girls becoming famous. Kinda like how I choose a plot about the unpopular girls against popular girls.;
, What will be the name of your Bratz series? When you come up with a name make sure it fits in well with the plot.

, Make sure you choose your dolls wisely and make sure their look fits their character's personality. You don't want a sweet beautiful doll to play an ugly evil witch.

, Make sure that every character has a name. Also you're gonna have to write down the name of each character and which doll plays who because it would be a wreck to film an episode and keep forgetting each characters name.

, You're gonna need a camera to film your show so make sure you have one and it can be any kind as long as it works for the editing software you want to use. You're gonna need props and backgrounds too for different scenes.

, You will need this for an introduction to each episode just to make it unique but this is optional.

, You will need a script so you don't end up winging it and end up with very little views for each episode(learned that the hard way). Make sure you plan which days you will rehearse with your friends.

, Now that you have got all your things planned out, your script all read, and your equipment and dolls in place it is time to begin filming episode one.

, Once you have your first episode filmed, you won't upload it just yet because you're going to need to use clips from your first episode to create an exciting trailer to get the audience prepared and excited.

, After you have uploaded the trailer on YouTube it's now time to set a date for the premiere of your series.

, Yay congrats you have finally created your own Bratz series. Have fun!

Step back and admire your work.",How to Make Hina Matsuri Dolls1," Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a small head and body for doll from a sheet of white or ivory cardstock.


The head should be 0.8 inch (2 cm) in diameter. Trace the perimeter of a U.S. nickel if you need help sizing the head.
The body should be 1/8 inch (3 mm) wide and about 2 inches (5 cm) long.;
, Use your scissors to cut a 1-inch (2.5-cm) long piece of 0.6-inch (1.5-cm) wide chiyogami paper.


This strip of paper will become the collar of the doll.
Note that you will need to use the same type of paper to create the ""obi"" of the doll later on.
This paper should also coordinate with the other two pieces of chiyogami paper you'll be using, but it should not be the exact same pattern.

, Place the collar strip behind the body strip. Fold the ends of the collar diagonally down and over the front of the body.


Fold the collar strip in half before placing it around the body.
The body and collar should be perpendicular when you place the collar behind the body strip.
For the sake of accuracy, fold the collar so that the left end goes under the right. The opposite folding is only used for the deceased.
Use glue or tape to hold the collar in place.

, Take a 2.2-inch by 4.9-inch (5.5-cm by 12.5-cm) sheet of chiyogami paper and double fold the shorter end to create a ridge.


This sheet of paper will form the kimono, and this ridge or edge will become the collar of the kimono.






Flip the paper so that it is wrong-side up. Fold 0.4-inch (1-cm) of the short end up. If the paper pattern has a top and bottom, do this at the top of the paper.






Flip the paper back over to the front. Fold 0.2-inch (0.5-cm) from your previous fold back over to the front, creating a raised edge.

, Center the body paper over the top of the kimono paper. Tape or glue the pieces together.


Turn the kimono paper over so that the wrong side faces up.
The body paper should be centered along the raised edge of the kimono.
Position the body so that its attached collar just barely peeks out above the edge of the kimono.

, Bring the left corner of the kimono paper diagonally down, folding it over the inner collar and the body.


Only crease the kimono paper along the folded edge and just beneath the folded edge. Do not crease it along the entire fold.

, Fold the rest of the kimono's left edge toward the center and over the body paper. Crease down the entire left side fold.


The left side of the kimono paper should be folded into a vertical edge, creating a straight body.
If a corner of the kimono collar extends beyond the rest of the edge, use scissors to trim it off.

, Fold the right corner diagonally down over the front of the doll. Fold the entire right edge toward the center, over the front of the doll.


When folding the right corner, only crease the top of the folded edge.
The right side creased fold should be vertical, making the entire body straight. Trim any excess kimono collar sticking out from beneath this fold.
Make sure that the fold angles of the left and right sides are mirrored and equal.
The right edge should not cover the left edge completely. Leave 1/8-inch (3-mm) or so of the left side visible.
Glue or tape the folded right edge to the body to hold the kimono in place.

, Cut a strip of your 0.6-inch (1.5-cm) wide paper measuring roughly 1.6-inch (4-cm) long.


This strip of paper will become the obi.
Note that this strip should be cut from the same paper as the inner collar.

, Place the obi strip over the front of the kimono. Fold it so that the ends overlap behind the kimono and tape or glue it in place.


The length of the obi should be perpendicular to the body as you place it on top.
The top edge of the obi paper should land right around the angled corner of the kimono edge.
Trim any excess obi paper at the back of the doll before adhering it in place.

, Cut a 1.6-inch (4-cm) long strip of 0.4-inch (1-cm) wide chiyogami paper.


This paper will become the obijime that goes over the obi.
Choose a coordinating yet different pattern of paper for this strip.

, Center the obijime over the obi. Fold the ends so that they meet at the back of the doll, then glue or tape the ends in place.


Place the obijime around the body in the same way you placed the obi.
Note that the obijime should be centered over the obi.

, Glue or tape one side of the cardstock head to the visible top of the body strip.


Note that only a very small portion of the body strip should be visible after you do this. This small portion is the neck of the doll.

, Cut out bangs from the cardstock. Cut out a separate piece of black cardstock to form the back of the hair.


You can design a hairstyle to your liking. Just keep in mind that the bangs and back should both be a little wider than the width of the head.

, Position the bangs on top of the head and glue or tape them in place. Position the back hair piece at the back of the head and glue or tape in place.


Note that the back hair piece should also fall behind the kimono of the doll.

, The paper Hina Matsuri doll is now complete.

Glue the obi around the body of the doll.,
Put the finished doll on display.",How to Make Hina Matsuri Dolls2," Paint an even, solid layer of white paint over a small styrofoam ball.


The diameter of the ball should be about 1.5 inch (3.8-cm), or a little less than half the length of the clothespin you'll be using for the doll's body.
Let the paint dry before you proceed past this step.
If you don't want to paint the ball, you could wrap it in white organza or white nylons instead.

, Insert the pointed end of a wooden skewer into one side of the ball.


Choose a skewer that can slip securely into the gap of the clothespin you'll be using.
Only insert the skewer halfway into the ball. Do not poke through to the other side.
Make sure that the skewer goes into the ball at a straight angle.
The portion of the skewer sticking out of the ball should be about as long as the gap in the clothespin. If necessary, trim it down using heavy scissors or a small saw.

, Slip the exposed portion of the skewer down into the gap of the clothespin.


Leave 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the skewer exposed in between the top of the clothespin and the head to serve as a neck.
Ideally, pressure should be enough to hold the skewer in place. If it wants to move around inside of the gap, though, you can secure it in place with a little glue. Let the glue dry before continuing.

, You'll need to cut out one strip of paper for the bangs and a second strip for the back of the hair.


The bangs should be wide enough to wrap around half of the ball. They should be tall enough extend from the middle of the top of the head down to the middle front of the face.
The back of the hair should be wide enough to wrap around half of the ball. The length of this piece can be as long as you would like it to be.

, Cover the entire top half of the head with a thin coat of glue. Lay the back of the hair on first, followed by the bangs.


The back piece must begin at the top of the head. Press this piece of black crepe paper onto the glue at the back of the head. It should naturally crease and flow back, away from the body, as a result.
The bangs must also begin at the top of the head. Press them down over the glue at the front of the head and allow them to slightly overlap the edges of the back piece.
Let the glue dry before continuing.

, Stick the bottom of the clothespin body firmly into a matching clothespin base.


This base will allow the doll to stand upright.

, Cut a piece of thin cardboard into a strip and wrap this strip around the clothespin body of the doll. Glue the edges together and let them dry before continuing.


The strip of cardboard should be as tall as the total height of the clothespin and clothespin base.
The tube should have a diameter that matches the diameter of the base. You should be able to slip the tube over the body of the doll from below.

, Use your thumb and index finger to crease the top of the tube on either side of the clothespin.


These creased, flattened portions of the tube will form shoulders. They should be positioned below the sides of the head, not below the front and back of the head.
Only crease the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of the top. Do not crease down the entire side of the tube.

, Carefully cut out a small rectangular section of cardboard at the front of the tube.


The rectangle should extend down about as far as the creases in your cardboard.
The width of this rectangular portion should only be about as wide as the top of the clothespin.
Removing this portion of cardboard will make it easier to add a collar to the doll.

, Cut a long strip of washi paper. Add a solid line of colored origami paper to the top of this strip.


The strip of washi paper should be about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide and 5 inches (12.7 cm) long.
The strip of solid color origami paper should be about 1/4 inch (6 mm) wide and 5 inches (12.7 cm) long.
Glue the solid origami paper over the top edge of the washi paper. Let this dry before continuing.

, Wrap the collar around the skewer so that the two ends of the collar overlap at the front of the doll.


The left end should be folded beneath the right end of the collar for the sake of accuracy.
Slip the left end under the rectangular notch you cut from the front of the cardboard tube. This will help hold the collar in place. Leave the right end out and hold it in place with a little glue.

, Cut two rectangles from the same washi paper. Both should be twice as long as the length of the clothespin body. The width of both rectangles should approximately match the length of the clothespin.


Fold the long edge of both pieces in half. Crease well. The sleeves will be made from these double-thick pieces of paper.

, Round the bottom inside corner and cut a notch into the bottom outer corner.


Turn the paper so that the folded edge is either on the right or left side.
Locate the bottom corner of the folded edge. Round this off carefully with your scissors.
Cut a horizontal line into the open edge of the paper roughly one-third of the way down from the top. This line should only be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long.
Cut a diagonal line from the inner edge of the previous cut down to the bottom corner of the open edge. Remove and discard the paper that falls out when you connect the two cuts.
Complete this step for both of the sleeves.

, Glue the open edge of the sleeve to the center back of the doll. The top edge of the cardboard body should align to the top edge of the washi paper sleeve.


Position the sleeve paper so that it lies under the hair of the doll.
Glue enough of the sleeve over the side and front of the doll to meet the previously attached collar. Let the rest of the sleeve hang loose at the side.
Repeat this step for both sleeves.

, Cut another rectangle using the same washi paper. Make sure that it is long enough to wrap around the bottom of the cardboard tube.


The skirt only needs to be tall/wide enough to stretch from the bottom of the folded collar edge to the bottom of the doll.

, Wrap the skirt piece around the body. Glue the edges in place along the left side of the doll.


The exposed edge will mimic the edge of the kimono.
Do not worry if there is still a visible gap of cardboard showing from beneath the washi paper. The obi will cover it.

, Cut a strip of paper that is about 2 inches (5 cm) wide and long enough to wrap around the body of the doll.


The obi needs to be wide enough to cover the exposed part of the cardboard. If 2 inches (5 cm) is not quite wide enough, make it a little wider.
Do not use the same washi paper for the obi. You can use either solid color origami paper or a separate piece of washi paper with a different pattern.

, Wrap the obi strip around the midsection of the body, covering the previously exposed cardboard. Glue it in place and let the glue dry.


Note that the ends of the obi strip should be hidden at the back of the doll.

, Your wooden peg Hina Matsuri doll is now complete and ready to show off.

Decide which supermodel you'd like to turn into a paper doll.,

Make as many outfits for the supermodel as you like.",How to Make a Fashion Paper Supermodel," Look for images of the supermodel online, to help you copy her or his features. You also have the opportunity to print out any full length photo that you think could be used as the doll in its own right.


If cutting out an image of the whole supermodel, try to find one in bikini/beach wear/shorts, so that there aren't clothes in the way. If that's not possible, it's okay, just not as ideal.
Even if you're drawing the supermodel (see next step), it might be fun and easiest to cut out the supermodel's face from a magazine or print it off from online, as this will make it look real.;
, Following the prompts from the images you've searched online. Use plain card that is strong but not too thick, to form the basis of the doll. The doll should be drawn bare except for its undergarments.


If you're using a cut-out of a full-length image printed from the internet, cut around the design carefully. Glue this to the card, then cut around the card carefully. Although the doll will be clothed, you can cover this up with the clothes you design.
Use plain card; anything with patterns won't look realistic.

, You can draw the eyes, mouth, nose, etc. on the paper doll. Or, consider gluing on a printed picture of the supermodel's face and maybe even the hair, to make the doll seem more realistic.


Allow all glue to dry thoroughly before adding clothes, or the clothes might stick and will need to be ripped off.

, Be careful around areas such as the hands and feet; do not cut out individual fingers or toes, as this will make the paper doll too fragile and it's not needed anyway.

, Place the doll on a sheet of paper and trace around its outline.

, Put it to one side.

, Place tracing paper over the outline and draw trousers, tops, swimwear, dresses, skirts, shorts, etc.

, This paper should be thinner than the card used for the doll but thick enough so that it won't tear with use. Printer paper may be suitable, if of good quality.


Add tabs around the clothes at various points. These tabs will be folded onto the back of the doll to hold the clothes in place.

, It's might be easiest to color it in before cutting it out, as the surrounding paper makes it stronger until cut. However, if you're okay with coloring it while cut, that's okay too. When done, cut the clothes out, along with their tabs.

, You can update her or his wardrobe whenever you wish. Keep an eye on the latest catwalk fashions for inspiration.

Apply a thin layer of varnish to complete the doll.",How to Make a Despicable Me Minion from a Cardboard Roll," Cutting the roll in half is a good option but you may like the doll taller or shorter.;
,, In a large bowl, mix the strips with craft glue and water. Mix with your hands until they make a paper pulp.

, Create a slightly raised mound at one end to serve as the minion doll's head. The other end should be left flat, in line with the cardboard roll's base. Let the pulp dry inside the roll––it will dry fastest if left in direct sun for 5-6 hours. The finished roll forms the body of the minion doll.

, Poke holes in each side of the roll where arms should sit. Insert the arms into the holes.


The length that you cut the arms will depend on the size of the body you've created for your minion doll.

, Either cover the head with yellow paper (such as tissue paper or cellophane) or paint the head yellow. Alternatively, cut a ping pong ball in half, glue onto the head end of the doll and paint it yellow (if it's already yellow, don't paint it).

, Use a non-absorbent acrylic yellow paint.

, Use pen refills or toothpicks to create the minion doll's legs. Cut to size and glue the chosen leg materials to the bottom of your minion.

, This will help to make them thick. Make the feet base flat so that the minion doll won't fall when it is made to stand.

, Glue each item to the minion doll.

, Use yellow and blue colors. See the image for one idea.

, Use black permanent marker to create a mouth shape. Paint the hands and shoes black.

, For example, paint on goggles, a headband and any hair.

, Let it dry for a day. Your minion doll is now ready for action or display.

The box should be a small, square type not a long, rectangular one as shown in the pictures. Look for desktop tissue boxes, these are ideal.;
, This will create four small pieces of plastic, making an easy space to push the clothes in and out of.

, This can be done in the way that you find easiest, choosing from one of these suggestions:


Paste plain white butcher or printer paper all around the outside of the box. Cut it to fit the box shape. Allow it to dry before using. Or;
Paint the box white. Allow it to fully dry before using.

, These can be made from any small things rummaged out of the recycling box, such as toothpaste lids or bits of plastic. They can also be painted or drawn on, as wished. You might even use stickers.

Give them a little snack.,
Read them a story.,
Put them into bed!",How to Choose and Love a Cabbage Patch Kid," When buying Cabbage Patch Kids, Walmart and Zellers sell best in Canada. In United States, Target and K Mart also have great Cabbage Patch Kids.;
, He or she probably feels really distressed and would need a big hug from mommy or daddy (you!).

, Give him/her a name. Cute names are Sarah, Alice, Faith, Iris or Elizabeth for a girl. Cute names for boys are Michael, Clyde, Sammy or Daniel. Pick what you like just make sure you are both satisfied. Remember: If you got one from Babyland general, the website or a shop, your cutie probably already has a name and birth certificate. This step isn't necessary if you got one from there but it is if you got one from eBay or Amazon.

, Put something babyish on the TV. Good toddler programmes would be Winnie The Pooh, Chuggington or Teletubbies. If your cabbage patch starts crying, switch it off immediately! Don't let him/her watch scary or inappropriate movies.

, Make pretend food from coloured clay or paper. Feed it gently and if she/he is thirsty, get her/him a pretend bottle with milk.

, If you go to the playground make sure your cutie gets a turn on the swings! If you go on the slide hold him/her every second! Another good way of getting exercise is going for a walk in the woods.

, PRETEND to fill the bathtub with water and give it a fake wash. Try not to get soap in your cuties eyes!! When you're done wrap them in a fluffy towel and get them in their pajamas

, Sit in a chair with them on your lap and give them maybe a cookie and milk. Don't make it to big, just a little thing to fill their rumbling tummies!

, On their first night read a selection of books and see which one is their favourite. When you find out, try getting a series of those books and read a different one every night. When you run out of those sorts of books, try getting them to enjoy a different series.

, Tuck them up in a fake cot. If they are terrified of the dark, don't get mad with them, they are only little and who knows what is lurking about in their precious little minds. Just turn on a night light and all will be well! If they enjoy it, sing them a little song.

You can even make newspaper or recycled gift wrap clothes. It really depends on what you want. Just note that newspaper print can rub off on dolls, which might spoil the doll.

, Glue or staple them together along the edges, leaving the head hole, arm holes and base of the shirt or dress open; or the leg holes and torso hole open for pants.


It is often easier with paper clothes to attach the pieces while on the doll. It's only paper and you can rip it off when you're finished with and start a new one later. It depends how careful you want to be.
If you want to reuse the paper dress or top, consider making tabs that open along one side; these tabs should open to allow you to remove the clothing with ease.

, Glitter glue, paint, pencils, etc. are ideal for jazzing up the clothing.

, Experiment with different kinds of paper and different ways of producing the paper clothing; there are some good ideas in Japanese origami books for paper clothing that you might like to explore further.

Tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue.,

Move your fingers in a circular motion on your skin.,
Don't tickle yourself by putting something in your ear.,
Don't tickle yourself by pretending your hand doesn't belong to you.,
Don't rub your nails on your sides.",How to Tickle Yourself," Lightly rotate your tongue in a circle on the roof of your mouth to create a tickling sensation. No one is entirely sure why this method works, since the areas of our brain that process sensation are less active when self-tickling., You'll need an object that you can lightly run across a ticklish surface like the bottom of your foot, or your neck. This still won't feel like you're being tickled in as intense of a manner as when someone else tickles you, since you can't trick your brain!


Light touch stimulates the somatosensory cortex which is responsible for analyzing touch, and the anterior cingulate cortex which deals with pleasant feelings. Together these two ares of the brain govern tickling, but only when it is a light touch. As most people already know if tickling is too hard it gets painful!You could also try brushing the soles of your feet with a bristly hairbrush.
You can make a tickling device by taking a stick and gluing long feathers onto it. You can then use this device to tickle yourself.
If you use too much pressure, it won't work. Make sure you're using the object very lightly.

, This doesn't always work, but some people report a mildly ticklish sensation when they barely touch their skin with their fingertips and move them around in a circular motion.


The best places for this are the inside of your elbow, your neck, or the back of your knee.

, Not only is it a very bad idea to start putting things in your ear, as you might damage an eardrum, this also doesn't work. Your ear is no more able to be tickled than the rest of your body.;
, Scientists have done experiments where they tried to trick a person's brain into believing that a plastic hand on a table in front of them was their hand. Even when the person's brain was under the illusion that the plastic hand was theirs, they still couldn't tickle themselves.However, often people with schizophrenia can tickle themselves, possibly because their brains have difficulty predicting the sensory actions of their own movements.

, The problem with this idea is that it operates under the notion that the reason you can't tickle yourself is because of your brain registering that it's your own fingers doing the tickling, so if you use your fingernails, your fingers won't register the sensation.


This is wrong because it isn't the sensation, it's the brain already knowing what is about to happen. Tickling has to do with surprise and we can't surprise our own brains.

Finish the bed frame by painting it with acrylic paint.",How to Make a Doll Bed1," The easiest way to make a doll bed, no power tools required, is to use a wooden fruit crate or a cardboard shoe box. You can find a wooden fruit crate at the grocery store. They are often used to hold fruits like clementines, small oranges, or grapes and many grocery stores will give you empty fruit crates if you find one available in the produce section.Many fruit crates already have small “legs” on each corner made of wood. You will use these legs to help the crate stand up off the ground when you transform it into a doll bed.
Alternatively, you can use a standard cardboard shoe box to make the frame. Look for a cardboard box in good condition and made of stiff material that can hold some weight.;
, You find most of the supplies for this method at your local hardware store. You will need to following supplies for this method:A 4” x 4” fruit crate or a standard cardboard shoe box
16 wooden paint stirring sticks (12 short ones, 4 long ones)
Wood glue
Scissors
Large binder clips
Sandpaper or a sanding block
Gesso or primer
Acrylic paint in your desired color

, Measure the sticks and mark the 8 inch line on each with a pencil before you cut them. Then, score the sticks with the X-ACTO knife seven to eight times against a ruler and then cut them easily with the scissors or the X-ACTO knife., Lay one of the longer sticks next to each end so the bottom of the long stick extends 1 ½ inches past the bottom of the row of trimmed sticks. This is going to form your footboard., You can do this by laying one of the trimmed sticks across all the sticks so it is parallel and about ½ inch above the bottom of the five trimmed sticks. Drizzle the stick with wood glue and secure it over all the sticks so it holds them in place.Let the footboard dry for at least one hour with a heavy object, like a book, sitting on top of the sticks.

, Trim five of the short paint stirring sticks so they are 8 inches long using scissors and/or an X-ACTO knife. Then, place the five trimmed sticks side by side on a flat, clean surface.Take two of the longer sticks and place each on on either end of the five trimmed sticks so the long sticks extend 1 ½ inches past the bottom row of trimmed sticks.
Secure the headboard with wood glue by drizzling a trimmed stick with glue and laying it across all the sticks, parallel and ½ inch above the bottom. Let the headboard dry for at least one hour, placing a heavy flat object on top of the sticks.

, It should be balancing on one of the short ends of the crate or box. Take the footboard piece and drizzle glue across the short stick lying parallel on the sticks. Press the footboard on the short end of the crate or box.If the box has short wooden legs attached to the corners of the crate, line up the longer sticks with the wooden legs so the doll bed will sit evenly on the ground when it is done.

, Make sure the binder clips are secure over the sticks and the crate. Let this dry for at least one hour., Once the footboard side is dry, you can attach the headboard to the other short end of the crate or box following the same steps.Make sure you clamp the headboard into place with the binder clips and let it dry for one hour so it is secure.

, Use sandpaper to lightly sand the bed so there are no rough corners or patches. Make sure you sand the cut edges on the headboard and the footboard until they are smooth.If you are using a cardboard box for the bed section of the frame, you only need to sand the headboard and the footboard.

, You can finish the bed frame by painting one primer layer of gesso on the bed. You can then apply two to three coats of acrylic paint to the bed frame, sanding between each coat.Let the bed frame dry overnight and then add on other elements to the bed, like a mattress and pillows.

Understand how nettles sting.,

Look closely for the hairs.,

Considering protecting your hands.,
Harvest young nettles.,
Cook, freeze, or dry to remove the sting.",How to Touch Nettles Without Stinging Yourself," Nettles are covered with tiny hollow hairs, filled with irritating chemicals. When you brush against these hairs, the tip breaks off and releases these chemicals, causing the sting.To harvest nettles with bare hands, you'll need to learn to touch the plant without breaking the hairs.;
, Nettle plants vary greatly. Some have almost no hairs, while others are covered in them. There is one useful pattern you can use, however: plants in full shade tend to have many fewer hairs than plants grown in the sun., Typically, a nettle has stinging hairs mostly on the underside of the leaf, and little to none on the top surface. These should all lie along the leaf pointing from the central cleft to the outer edges.Don't assume your plant will match this description. Nettle plants have a high degree of variation, and the name ""stinging nettle"" actually describes at least two species.Look for the hairs with your own eyes.
The stem also has hairs. These angle down or up the stem on some plants, but poke out perpendicular to the stem on others. If your plant looks like the last type, it's best to avoid the stem completely.

, It's easy to get stung by another leaf when you're focused on the one you're grabbing. Stay near the top of the plant, where the leaves are smaller and less likely to brush against your hand from above.


Nettles often grow in dense patches, so keep an eye out for nearby plants swaying toward you.

, You're less likely to break the hairs if you grasp from the base of the hairs, rather than run your hand into the tips.


If the stem looks safe to grab (with angled hairs), aim for a spot just below the leaf. This will make it easier to pluck the leaf off the plant., A quick, firm grasp is your best bet to avoid breaking the hairs. If you're too gentle, you'll almost always snag a hair and break it. Once pinched, you can twist the leaf and pluck it off the plant.


There's no guarantee you won't get stung even with this method. Try this at your own risk.

, This will wash away any nettle hairs stuck in your skin, and relieve the pain slightly. If you don't have access to water, just brush your skin with a cloth or your shirt., If you end up falling onto a large number of hairs, peel them off with a piece of adhesive tape., The nettle's hairs contain many chemicals, and studies contradict each other about what causes the pain.However, histamine is a strong candidate, as are two other neurotransmitters called acetylcholine and serotonin. Spreading an antihistamine cream over the stung area can greatly reduce the effect of these chemicals., Some subspecies of nettle contain tartaric and oxalic acids, which may extend the duration of the pain.Since baking soda is a base, it's possible a paste of baking soda and water may help neutralize these acids.This remedy may have been invented when nettle stings were thought to contain formic acid. As it turns out, the concentration of formic is probably too low to cause an effect.

, To relieve itching, wrap a cold pack or bag of ice in a towel and press against the rash. Leave it there for up to 20 minutes.

, If you get a severe reaction, do your best to avoid touching it. Wear lightweight clothing and sleep under light blankets to minimize the irritation. Take lukewarm baths or showers, as heat can aggravate the itching., There is no good scientific evidence that these remedies would have a major effect, but they are unlikely to cause harm:Calamine lotion (which may have mild anti-itching properties)
Jewelweed (Impatiens species)
Dock leaves (Rumex species)
Plantain leaves

, Although experienced nettle harvesters often go bare-handed, this isn't just because they know how to avoid stings. Many of them have become resistant to the stings over years of exposure, while others enjoy the sensation. Consider wearing gloves, or plucking the nettles with tongs.Nettle is a traditional treatment for arthritis, and there's some scientific evidence that it works.So if you suffer from arthritis in the hands, getting stung may actually reduce your pain!

, Mature nettles may contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can trigger gout episodes or irritate the urinary tract.When picking nettles to eat, look for young plants that have not yet flowered.Look for these in early to mid spring in most areas.Burning nettle, a very similar plant often mistaken for stinging nettle, can germinate anywhere from late fall through early spring. In mild coastal climates, it may flower year round., Any of these processes will neutralize the nettle and make it safe to eat.The two most common uses for nettle are nettle soup and nettle tea.

Gather your materials.,
Roll the wooden dowels around the paper.,
Combine or cut the tubes based on the size of your doll.,
Lay out the design for the bed frame.,
Make holes in the tubes.,
Connect the tubes together.,
Create a headboard and a footboard for the frame.,
Paint if preferred.",How to Make a Doll Bed2," To make a bed frame for your doll out of paper, you will need the following materials:10-12 pieces of paper
10-12 wooden dowels
Toothpicks
Fabric glue
A glue stick

, To make the dowels more aesthetically pleasing and smooth, you can roll the paper around the dowels. To do this, you will take a wooden dowel and place it at one end of a piece of paper. Then, roll the paper around the dowel, stopping every one to two rolls to apply glue with the glue stick to the paper so the paper stays in place on the dowel.Do this for all ten to twelve dowels. Wrap each dowel in at least one sheet of paper, gluing the paper to the dowel as you roll them in the paper.
You can make the paper tube thicker by gluing another layer of paper onto the tube. You may decide to create thicker tubes for the longer tubes on the bed frame so they are more durable.

, If you are making the bed for a larger doll, you may need to make a larger frame so she can fit on the bed. You should lay your doll on a flat surface and place the wrapped dowels around the doll in the shape of a bed. You can then determine if you need to combine or trim down the tubes to fit the doll.Cut the tubes with scissors, making sure you cut the ends evenly and smoothly.
Combine the tubes using toothpicks and fabric glue. Put fabric glue in one end of the tube and then insert a toothpick ½ inch into the tube. Then, apply fabric glue into the end of another tube and gently push the tube onto the toothpick until the two tubes come together.

, Now that you have your wrapped wooden dowels in the appropriate lengths, you can lay them out to form the bed frame. You should have two long dowels on either end of the frame and two to three shorter dowels going across the frame. You may want to double up on the dowels, parallel and horizontal, to make the frame stronger.Use a pencil to mark where the tubes will connect to make the frame. This will make it easier for you to put the frame together.

, Use the sharp edge of the scissors to make small holes where you have marked on the tubes. The holes should be just big enough to fit toothpicks.


Then, slide a toothpick into each hole. Secure the toothpicks with a dab of glue.

, Put glue into one end of the tube and slide the toothpick into the tube until the two tubes connect. Continue to do this for the rest of the tubes until you have made the bed frame.You should have a frame that consists of at least five to seven tubes total, one to two long tubes running vertical and three to five tubes running horizontal.

, If you would like to add a headboard and a footboard to your bed frame, you can do so with the remaining dowels.Lay out the design for the headboard and the footboard before you attach the tubes together. Use the toothpicks and the glue to secure the tubes. Then, attach the headboard and the footboard to each end of the bed frame. You will need to stand the headboard and footboard right side up to attach to them to the bed frame.

, Let the bed frame dry overnight and then add on other elements to the bed, like a mattress and pillows.

Measure the base of the frame.,
Gather your materials.,
Cut off the hemmed edges of the dish towel.,
Stuff the mattress.,
Add a quilting effect to the mattress.,
Sew the pillows.,
Make a comforter, You can then hand sew the open side closed or use a sewing machine.,
Put the mattress and pillows on the frame.",How to Make a Doll Bed3," To ensure your mattress fits the bed frame properly, you will need to measure the base of the frame. Once you have the measurements, you can determine how much material you need to make a mattress and pillows.

, To make the mattress and the pillows, you will need the following supplies:A fat quarter of fabric
A dish towel
Loose stuffing
Buttons
Needle and coordinating thread
Doll needle
Buttons (optional)
Sewing machine (optional)

, Then, cut the towel in half. Place the right sides together and sew all the edges. Be sure to leave a 2-inch opening on one edge.Pull the corners into a triangle. Use the needle and thread to sew the box corners or use a sewing machine if you have access to one.

, Turn the dish towel right side out and use your hands to gently stuff the mattress until it is your desired thickness. Avoid overstuffing the mattress and make sure the stuffing is dispersed evenly. Then, sew the opening closed.


At this point you can add buttons to the mattress if you would like.

, As a finishing touch, you can add a quilting effect to the mattress to make it look more polished. Start by folding the fat quarter of fabric in half, with the right sides facing up. Then, sew along the two open edges, leaving the third edge open. Flip the fabric right side out and fill it with quilt batting that has been cut to fit the mattress.You can then hand sew the open side closed or use a sewing machine. Finish the quilt effect by sewing straight horizontal and vertical lines at even intervals across the quilt. This will also help to secure the batting in place.

, You can use scrap fabric and/or another dish towel to create pillows for the bed to finish it off. Measure the fabric or dish towel so it is small enough to make pillows that fit the bed. Then, cut out the fabric. Place the right sides together and sew all the edges, leaving a 2-inch opening on one edge.Flip the fabric right side out and stuff the pillow with stuffing. Then, sew the opening closed.

, Finish the quilt effect by sewing straight horizontal and vertical lines at even intervals across the quilt. This will also help to secure the batting in place.

, Lay the mattress and pillows on the bed frame. Test out the frame by placing your doll on it the next time she is ready to go to sleep.

Gather supplies.,
Paint the wooden bead.,
Choose your height.,
Create the lamp shade.",How to Make Miniature Furniture1," Whether you purchase your supplies at a dollar store or at your local craft store, you will need foam marshmallow, cardstock, a cotton swab, a wooden bead, glue and paint. Create a lampshade using foam marshmallow, use the wooden bead to create a detailed lamp base, cover the lampshade with the cardstock, and use the cotton swab as your lamp post.Foam marshmallow is a small piece of foam that looks exactly like marshmallow. Cardstock is similar to scrapbook paper but thicker. Choose your prefered colours as craft stores often carry a wide variety.Avoid using super glue on foam as it is strong enough to disintegrate it.;
, Choose a colour that fits the scheme of your furniture set. It will save you money if you are able to use your paint on multiple pieces of furniture. Use a fine tipped paint brush which can be purchased at your local crafts or art supply store., Using a pin or razor, poke a hole in the foam marshmallow at its center. Cut the cotton tips off of the cotton swab and use the remaining wood shaft as your lamp post by inserting it into the hole at the center of the foam marshmallow. Place the other end of the lamp post into the wooden bead and adjust to your prefered height.Use sharp scissors to cut the cotton swab as dull scissors may cause it to splinter. Cut in small increments to ensure that you don’t make your lamp too short.

, Place the cardstock around the foam marshmallow to measure the height and width of your lampshade. Be sure to add some extra leeway on the height so you can fully cover the foam. Once satisfied with your measurement, cut the cardstock and glue it onto the foam marshmallow for your lampshade. Add a drop of glue into the opening of the bead and stick the cotton swab in to complete the lamp.Center foam before gluing the cardstock. Make sure that there is a small space at the bottom and top of your lamp shade.
Allow each piece to dry completely.

Gather your supplies.,
Ready your container and lid.,
Attach the lid lip.,
Paint and seal.",How to Make Miniature Furniture2," You will need to obtain a fast food dipping sauce container that approximately 2.25 inches x 1.25 inches x 1 inch high. You will also need fun foam (3” x 2”), white card stock paper (10” x 3/16”), acrylic paint, glue, matte sealer, scissors, and a pencil.The fun foam can be any colour as you will be painting it. The paper needs to be card stock as regular paper will ripple when painted. Choose your prefered colour of acrylic paint and a matte sealer as glossy will provide too much shine., Wash the container and dry it completely. Smoothen the lip by trimming any extra plastic. Turn the container upside down and use a pencil to trace the face of the container onto the Fun Foam in order to make the lid. Cut out the lid being mindful not to create any jagged edges. Glue the container’s top to the fun foam.Make sure the glue has completely dried before you trim the edges. Cut the edges to ensure the top is smooth and to avoid any ripples.

, Starting at the short end of the container, wrap the strip of cardstock around the edge and create the lip for the top of the container. Slightly overlap the beginning and end of the cardstock as you continue around the entire edge of the container. Use tweezers or forceps to set the cardstock in place and glue where necessary.Let the glue dry and be mindful to only use a little bit of glue as any excess will create visible drops or marks.
Trim any excess cardstock to create a smooth even line all the way around the container.

, Choose your colour and paint several coats on both the tote and the lid. Dry before applying each coat and aim for at least 3 coats of paint. Once your final coat has dried, apply sealer it give it a plastic finish.Use a fine tipped paint brush or cut an angled piece of foam to apply the paint and sealer.

Consult a doctor for serious injuries.,
Apply heat (optional).,
Stand or sit with good posture.,
Tuck your chin down.,
Tilt your chin upward.,
Stretch to the right and left shoulder.,
Turn your head right and left.,
Try hanging your head to fix mild stiffness.,
Repeat the stretch daily.,
Track your progress.",How to Stretch Your Neck1," If you injured your neck in an accident, or if your symptoms extend to your arm, visit a doctor before stretching. If you have additional symptoms, check the Warnings section below for more advice.


For a less serious injury, gentle exercise is probably more effective than rest.As a general rule, stretching is a good idea as long as it doesn't hurt.;
, A warm compress or heating pad on the neck reduces stiffness and makes stretching easier.However, if the pain began in the last two or three days, avoid heat and wait until after the stretching to apply ice. During this early stage, you want to cool the area down to reduce swelling.One easy way to apply heat is to stretch under a stream of warm water in the shower., You may stretch in a standing position, with your feet at shoulder width apart. Alternatively, sit in a straight-backed chair with your knees bent 90 degrees and your hands on your thighs. Your back should not touch the back of the chair. In either position, align your shoulders over your hips, and your ears over your shoulders.

, Bring your chin down toward your chest to stretch the back of your neck. Hold the stretch for 20 seconds, then return to the neutral position.These stretches should be pain free. Do not push past the point of mild discomfort.
If you need more support, hold the back of your neck with your hands., Lift your chin toward the ceiling to stretch the front of your neck. Hold the stretch for 20 seconds, then relax and lower your chin.

, Keep your shoulders stable and tilt your right ear toward your right shoulder, looking straight ahead. Hold the stretch for up to 20 seconds, then tilt your left ear to your left shoulder and hold for another 20 seconds.

, Rotate your neck to the right, looking straight ahead over your right shoulder (or as close as you can comfortably get). Once again, hold this for 20 seconds. Relax, turn your head to the left, and hold for a final 20 second stretch.


If you reach the limit of your motion and the stretch feels comfortable, push your head gently with your hand to increase the stretch., This is a less common exercise, and not typically recommended for people with serious neck problems. A ""forward head bend"" can feel good for everyday aches and pains, though, since it gives your spine a break from holding up your head. Here's how to try it:


Keeping your back straight, hinge forward at the hips and reach for the floor. If reaching for the floor is uncomfortable, rest your hands on your thighs or shins.
With your head hanging down, try the chin-tilting exercises (up and down), and the rotation exercises (looking left and right).

, One or two stretching sessions a day are usually enough. If you want to stretch more often, ramp this up slowly or consult a doctor or physical therapist. In some cases, stretching too much can overtax your neck.


If the stretching felt good and did not increase pain, you can try holding each stretch for 30–60 seconds next time.

, Once your muscles no longer feel tight, stop stretching except when needed, typically two or three times a week.Most neck pains should improve rapidly with stretching. Visit a doctor if they last more than a week or two, or if symptoms get worse.


A burner, or stinging sensation along one side of the neck and shoulder, can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks."

Gather your supplies.,
Cut out and assemble a bed frame.,
Build the mattress.,
Paint the bed frame.,
Make a blanket and pillows.,
Stitch up a blanket cover and pillow cases.",How to Make Miniature Furniture3," You will need cardboard, glue, acrylic paint, and foam to use as stuffing for the bedding and mattress. You may find these items at a dollar store or your local arts and craft store.There are many types of foam but you want to go with something that isn’t very rigid as you may not be able to stuff it into the bedding and mattress. Polyurethane foam is low quality and, as such, the cheapest choice; however, it is used for regular bedding and packing filler, and will be easy to place inside your bedding and mattress. You do not want to spend a lot on your foam because it will be covered and you will only be using a small amount., Find a bed frame pattern online and measure to your preference. Your headboard and footboard should roughly be the same size or the headboard may be slightly larger. Once you're satisfied with the size, cut these two pieces from your cardboard. Measure and cut the base of the bed. This will be slightly larger than your mattress.The base of the bed will be comprised of 2 side pieces that will be long and skinny rectangles. These will connect to both the headboard and footboard to create your bed frame.
You should have 5 total pieces made from your cardboard: headboard, footboard, base, and 2 side pieces.
Glue all 5 pieces together to create the bed frame by gluing the headboard and footboard with the base and adding the side boards at the end. The side boards will be placed along the exposed edges of the bed.

, Cut and stuck some cardboard so that they fit snuggly in the bed frame without obstructing your headboard or warping the frame. Glue the pieces together and use wrapping foam around the cardboard once dry. Stitch the foam around the cardboard., Paint your bed frame with acrylic paint. Use a fine tipped brush that may be purchased at a dollar store or an arts and craft store. You may need up to 3 coats to depending on how dark and rich you want your color to be.You may add a design or stickers once the paint has dried.
Once painted, place the mattress into the bed frame and glue it into place.

, Hold a piece of foam against the mattress to measure the width of your blanket so that the edges come slightly past the bed. Cut 2 rectangle pieces of foam for your pillows. You may cut them to your prefered size or cut extras for throw pillows., Cut cloth for your pillows and blanket making sure that you leave enough excess fabric that it covers the foam and can be stitched closed. It is easiest to cut two pieces of fabric to cover each pillow and your blanket. Leave the detailed fabric, or part of the fabric with a design, facing inside as you stitch the pieces together.Leave a small opening before closing and turn the fabric right side out. Cover the foam and stitch the cover closed by folding the opening in and stitching the side.
You may also add embroidery or design if you have the time.

Stretch your chest and shoulder muscles.,
Exercise the scalene muscles.,
Focus on your traps to treat chronic headaches.,
Stretch your levator scapula after long periods of immobility.",How to Stretch Your Neck2," These muscles often become tight along with your neck, especially if the problem is related to bad posture. If these areas feel stiff, try this quick exercise to loosen up before the other stretches:Stand with your feet together about two feet (0.6 meters) from a corner.
Raise your elbows to shoulder height, with your forearms straight above them. Lean your forearms against the two walls.
Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your chest and shoulders, but do not feel pain. Support your weight mostly with your legs, not your arms.Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.

, These muscles extend along the side of your neck, down to your collarbone. Besides improving neck flexibility, strengthening these muscles can aid with breathing problems, since they lift the rib cage. Here's one exercise to target your scalene muscles:Sit up straight at the edge of a chair, with your chin pulled back to center your ears over your shoulders.
Grip the edge of the chair with your right hand to stabilize yourself. If you need to, place your left hand over your right collarbone to keep it flat.
Tilt your ear toward your left shoulder.
Optionally, stretch further by raising your chin slightly, and turning your head toward your left shoulder.
Hold for 30–60 seconds, then repeat with the other side.

, The trapezius muscles over your shoulder blades are important for controlling head movements. Constant tension here may cause headaches. You can stay right in your chair to exercise these:Grip the edge of the chair again with your right hand.
Rotate your head toward your left shoulder. (It's important to do this first.)Bring your chin down toward your chest.
Place your left hand on top of your head and gently press toward the left shoulder.
For a greater stretch, lean your torso slightly to the left as well.
Hold for up to a minute, and repeat for the other side.

, The name of this muscles sounds like ""levitate the scapula"" (shoulder blade) because that's exactly what it does. Tension here is often the cause of neck pain from sitting in one position, especially if you feel a tender spot at the top of your shoulder blade. Here's how to stretch it:Stand or sit with a wall on one side.
Bring the elbow nearest to the wall up above your shoulder. Rest it against the wall.
Turn your head away from the wall and tuck your chin down. You should feel the back of your neck stretch.
Use your free hand to pull your head slightly further in the same direction.
As always, stay here for 30–60 seconds before trying the other side.

Decide when to try these exercises.,
Stand with your spine against a wall.,
Gently lower your chin.,
Bring the back of your head against the wall.,
Repeat this motion.,
Exercise with head nods and head lifts.",How to Stretch Your Neck3," Weak or tight muscles can worsen your posture and fail to properly support your neck. Working on these may reduce the chance of the neck pain recurring. Once you can perform these exercises without pain, schedule them every other day. The day off is important to give your muscles time to rebuild., Stand against a wall or doorjamb. Place your feet about 3 inches (7.5 cm) out from the base of the wall.You may sit against a straight-backed chair instead, if it has a headrest.Take advantage of this when you have a moment during a long drive.

, Allow your chin to drop down toward your throat. This should stretch the back of your neck, and tighten the small muscles around your throat.


Feel the large muscles on the front of your neck. If they are tense, lift your head again and lower your chin more slowly. The large muscles should stay relaxed, while the small muscles between them should tighten., Without raising your chin, move your head back so it touches the wall.


If this causes pain, pull your head back as far as you can without pain. This is a sign of forward head posture, which you can correct with other exercise and lifestyle changes.

, Hold this position for ten seconds, then relax. Repeat this ten times, then stop. You can perform this exercise several times a day.


After you practice this exercise, you may not need to have a wall or headrest behind you.

, Here's one final set of exercise that can strengthen your neck and nearby muscles.While you can't try this one on the go, some people find it easier than the exercise above:


Lie down on a firm surface, with a rolled up towel supporting your neck.
Gently bring your chin down toward your throat. Keep the back of your head against the floor, and the back of your neck against the towel. Repeat several times.
If you can do so without pain, repeat this same nodding motion while lifting the back of your head off the floor. Do not lift your neck off the towel.

Be extremely hard to wake up.",How to Pretend to Sleepwalk1," Sleepwalkers are deeply asleep during an episode, but their eyes do remain completely open during the entire event.If you are trying to successfully pull off a fake sleepwalk, keeping your eyes open is a must.;
, Even though their eyes are open, sleepwalkers aren’t really “seeing” during an episode. Their expressions remain totally vacant and their eyes are unfocused and dim.


Practice keeping your face expressionless and your eyes unfocused before you attempt to fake sleepwalking. You’ll need to maintain that blank look in front of the person you are faking out.
If this person tries to wake you up during your “episode”, and they probably will, you’ll have to keep a straight face while this is going on.

, During an episode, sleepwalkers are so dazed that they normally don’t react or respond to anyone who attempts to communicate with them. When you attempt your fake out, ignore anyone who speaks to you and do not initiate a conversation with anyone.

, Sleepwalkers are extremely difficult to wake up during an episode. Don’t “wake up” unless the other person exerts a ton of effort trying to get you to do so. Keep your expression blank and maintain your glassy eyed gaze at all times.

Perform your fake sleepwalk at night.,
Sleepwalk for no longer than 30 minutes.",How to Pretend to Sleepwalk2," Because of this, they can usually only perform activities that are very simple or routine to them.


Getting dressed and brushing your teeth are two routine activities that you can do during your episode.You could also try getting up, walking to your closet, opening the door and staring blankly into it.

, A sleepwalker only performs simple actions during an event, and often they will do those simple things repeatedly. Think of it like a needle skipping on a record – when a needle skips, the same brief moments of the music will repeat over and over. Pick some sort of very simple activity and do it repeatedly, maintaining a demeanor that is completely dazed.


Prepare your routine ahead of time so that you can perform the activities without a lot of effort. A believable thing you can do is get up and make a snack in the kitchen. Make a sandwich, but set it aside. Then make another sandwich.
You could also try walking down the hall to the bathroom and back several times, or go downstairs and back upstairs a few times with no real purpose.
Sleepwalkers generally don’t communicate with others, but they do tend to talk in their sleep a bit, usually muttering incoherent phrases. Incoherent screaming has also been known to happen so if you’re trying to freak someone out, you’ll probably succeed by sleep screaming.You could also get up and starting cleaning the same area repeatedly, which is a common sleepwalking occurrence.

, Sleepwalking almost always takes place during the night, not during daytime naps.In addition, sleepwalking usually wouldn't occur in the very early hours of the morning.


You’ll want to keep this in mind when you plan your fake out, because you’ll probably be wearing your pajamas for the performance.
Sleepwalking is more likely to occur earlier in the night, within the first couple of hours after falling asleep, so a believable fake sleepwalk should occur pretty early in the night.

, A sleepwalking event can last as briefly as 30 seconds or go on for a maximum of about 30 minutes.The typical range for a sleepwalking episode is 1 to 5 minutes.For a believable sleepwalk, plan your nocturnal event to include the repetition of a few simple behaviors that will not go beyond the half hour mark.

Look disoriented and confused when you “wake up”.,
Act extremely startled once you’re “awake”.,
Go back to sleep quickly with little communication.,
Return to your bed if you aren’t “woken up”.",How to Pretend to Sleepwalk3," Upon waking, sleepwalkers experience extreme disorientation. When you ""wake up"" during your fake sleepwalk, make sure to appear very confused. Look around you as though you have no idea where you are or how you got there.

, When sleepwalkers are startled awake in the middle of an episode, they sometimes react by lashing out in fear and confusion. If you decide to allow yourself to be woken up during your routine, do it suddenly. Make your actions erratic and jerky immediately upon waking.

, Sleepwalkers are so confused if woken up during an episode that they generally communicate very little with the person that woke them. Any communication that does take place is usually incoherent and the sleepwalker goes back to sleep very quickly after the event.

, Because sleepwalkers are so hard to wake up, sometimes they are able to get through the entire episode asleep. When this happens, the sleepwalking event usually ends abruptly and spontaneously and the person goes back to bed."
"
Remember nothing if you’re “woken up”.It’s very common for a sleepwalker to recall nothing from the sleepwalking event, even immediately after it happens.,
Deny that the episode happened.,
Have no recollection of the event the next morning.Your sleepwalking episode will no doubt be the first topic of the morning, so be prepared to look completely confused and claim to have no recollection whatsoever about what transpired.,
Act out of sorts the next day.",How to Pretend to Sleepwalk4," Mutter phrases like, “What happened?” and “Where am I?” when you “wake up”.

, You’ll want to appear so disoriented that you're unable to recall the event, so denying that it happened would be a very believable response. Argue defensively a bit with the person that woke you up and claim that you’re certain you didn’t sleepwalk.

,


When pressed, continue to insist that you don’t remember. This is a very common side effect of sleepwalking and not remembering the episode is very authentic behavior.

, It’s common for sleepwalkers to feel disoriented and have problems functioning after a sleepwalking event all the way into the next day. If you’re going for the long con with your sleepwalking fake out, act edgy and confused the next day. Fumble with items and pretend that you’re having difficulty focusing.

Check for symptoms of dehydration.,
Determine how much water you need.,
Drink water throughout the day.,
Eat appropriately to stay hydrated.,
Continue to look for dehydration symptoms.",How to Prevent Foot Cramps1," Many people suffer from dehydration and don’t even know it. Foot cramps are one common symptom, but there are others. Learn to recognize the symptoms so that you can nip dehydration in the bud. Some common symptoms include:Little or no urine, urine that is dark in color
Fatigue
Severe thirst
Dry mouth
Headache
Dizziness;
, There’s no universal answer for how much water a person should drink each day. The amount you need depends on your weight, age, diet, and activity level. Though it’s possible to drink too much water, it’s fairly difficult. Err on the side of drinking a little too much, rather than not enough.A good rule of thumb is to drink six to eight 8oz glasses of water per day.
Drink more than that if you are physically active, live in a hot climate, consume excess sodium, or are pregnant or nursing.
When tracking your water intake, beverages such as soda, juice, coffee or tea can be counted. However, these drinks may contain sugar or caffeine, and so plain water is a better source for pure hydration.

, Don’t try to drink all of your recommended water right at breakfast. Instead, sip it throughout the day. Carry a refillable water bottle so that you always have water when you need it.Know how much water your bottle holds. That will help you keep track of how much water you drink during the day.
If you don’t like the taste of water, you can add sprigs of fresh mint, or cut up fresh ginger, citrus fruit, or mint and let them infuse your water with a subtle flavor.

, Some foods can dehydrate you, but some can actually help you stay hydrated. Fresh fruits and vegetables can be excellent sources of water.Processed foods often contain excess sodium, which can dehydrate you. If you’re trying to stay hydrated, avoid these.
Leafy greens, melons, cucumbers, and apples are great hydrating foods.

, If you’ve already become dehydrated it may take a little while for your body to return to a state of hydration. Track any symptoms you might have had and see if they improve. If they do, keep doing what you’re doing.It’s much easier to prevent dehydration than to recover from it. Stay on top of your water intake as much as possible.

Practice the lotus pose.,
Bring your feet to your chest.,
Keep at it.",How to Put Both of Your Legs Behind Your Head2," In the lotus pose, your legs are crossed with both of your feet resting on top of your legs. This is a difficult position, so you may need to build up to it over the course of days, weeks, or months. Once you can do this, you can do this, try it without using your hands., Use your hands to bring your right foot, then your left foot, up to your chest. Practice until you can do it without feeling anything., Bring your feet higher and higher each day until you can bring them behind your head. You may need to put one leg behind your head, to start."
"
Start by doing the ""candlestick"" position.,
Move one foot closer to your head.,
Try putting one foot behind your head.,
Try putting both legs up.",How to Put Both of Your Legs Behind Your Head3," First, lie supine on your back. Engage your core, and slowly raise your legs straight up into the air. Use your arms for support, if you have trouble.

, When you can do the candlestick position well, without needing support from your arms, try moving one foot closer to your head. You should be able to do this with one foot on the floor near your head, both with a bent knee and a straight knee. When you can do this well with each leg separately, try with both legs at the same time.


Make sure to bend your knees.

, While sitting up, try placing one foot behind your head or as close as you can manage. Doing this a couple of times every day, and it should become easier and easier. Remember to practice equally with each of your legs., Do the same as the previous step just with both legs at the same time and you should succeed! This can take up to 3 weeks to master and may take beyond that as well so don't worry if you don't seem to be getting anywhere.

Set a reasonable exercise goal.,
Stretch your legs and feet regularly.,
Avoid fatigue.,
Replace lost minerals.",How to Prevent Foot Cramps2," Even if you’re not very athletic, it’s important to get some exercise each day. This will help exercise the muscles in your feet to prevent cramping. It also helps improve poor circulation, which is another cause of foot cramps.Walking is a great way to exercise to prevent foot cramps.
Make sure your choice of exercise involves your legs and feet. For example, don’t simply choose weight lifting for your arms and shoulders.
If it’s difficult to support your weight while standing, try swimming or water aerobics.

, Cramps are muscles spasms, which means that the muscles are clenching involuntarily. Stretching the muscles out helps to ease and prevent this. Develop a simple stretching routine and practice it regularly.Incorporate yoga into your exercise regimen. Take a class or follow a video at home at least twice a week.
Do plantar flexion or calf raises. For this exercise, stand with your feet shoulder width apart and then rise up onto your toes. Hold for a few seconds and then slowly lower your heels back to the ground.
Include dorsi flexion or toe lifts. For this exercise, keep your legs straight and bring your toes up towards your calf. Hold in this position for about 30 seconds and then release.
Do ankle circles. Extend your leg and then begin rotating your foot around. After about 30 seconds, begin rotating your foot in the opposite direction.

, For some people, foot cramps signal that they need to up their activity level. However, if you’re extremely active, foot cramps may be a sign that you’re actually overdoing it. Make sure you’re exercising in a way that is healthy and safe, or you could develop an injury.If you’re new to exercise, increase the length of your workout by 10% per week.
Look for other signals that your body is fatigued. Do you feel lightheaded after a workout? Are you very sore the next day? Make sure to rest and take it easy when you need to.

, When you sweat, you don’t just lose water. You also sweat out important minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. A lack of these minerals can cause cramping. Make sure to get enough of them to make up for what you lost during a workout.You can take a supplement each day to help replace lost minerals. Drug stores, natural food stores, and nutrition centers often sell a variety of supplements.
Some sports drinks may contain the minerals you need. Read the nutrition label to make sure.
There are plenty of foods high in potassium and calcium (such as bananas and dairy). These can be great sources of these minerals as well.

Choose shoes with plenty of support.,
Make sure the shoes fit you properly.,
Switch shoes whenever necessary.",How to Prevent Foot Cramps3," When your feet and ankles are properly supported, the muscles in your feet have less work to do. Supportive shoes also keep your feet and ankles in proper alignment, which helps prevent fatigue and cramping.If your feet have high arches, you’ll want shoes that also have a strong arch.
If your shoes don’t provide arch support (or provide too much for your feet) you can replace the insoles with ones that are appropriate for the shape of your foot.

, Even if the shoes are technically your size, they still may not give your foot enough space. You should be able to stretch or wiggle your toes a bit inside your shoes.High heels and shoes with narrow spaces for the toes can squeeze the foot and cause discomfort and cramping.
Visit your local shoe store for a proper fitting. Even if your shoes are a good shape, it’s possible that you’re not wearing the right size.

, It’s okay to want to wear high heels or other dress shoes from time to time. However, remember that these shoes are not for everyday wear or the cramps will continue.Even if you wear comfortable shoes regularly, it can still be good to switch between pairs from time to time.
If a pair of shoes causes you pain after half a day of wear, they should be discarded.

Acquire four people.,
Make sure that all of the people can do a ""crab"" position.,
Make sure all people are comfortable doing this trick.",How to Make a Human Table1," This can be you and three friends, or four other people whom you are directing. It will be a lot easier if the people are of a similar height, though it will still work with people of varying heights.;
, This position is executed by sitting with hands placed directly under the shoulders. Move your feet out away from your bottom, far enough that your feet have plenty of room, but not so far your feet cannot be flat. Next, push up your hips so your chest, abdomen and thighs form a straight line, with a 90° angle from your calves to your thighs.

, While most people will be fine, some people may be uncomfortable placing their heads on other people, while others may be uncomfortable for other reasons. If someone is not feeling comfortable, don't push them, because if one person falters, the whole 'table' may go down.

To come down, ease everyone's hips down at the same time, and sit up when everyone's bottom is on the ground.",How to Make a Human Table2," Using the chair method, it is necessary to have another person to pull out the chairs. It is possible to do this without someone pulling out the chair, but it is extremely difficult, so if this is a first time, it is suggested that you find someone else.

, Find chairs that you can almost do the crab position in, with your hands touching the ground, but not quite. It also helps if all four chairs are identical, but this is not mandatory.

, Take the four chairs and move them so that the backrest is facing outward, away from the centre. If the people attempting this are short, you may want to have the corners of the chairs closer than if they are tall.

, Shift the chairs around so each person can place their shoulders on the next person's thighs. Once you are sure everyone is ready, proceed to the next step.

, You will need to use the same muscles as you use in a crab position. Push up your hips, and it will make it easier for everyone.

,, Congratulations, you have completed the human table.

Grip the card correctly.,
Curl the card back into your wrist.,
Flick your wrist forward.,
Release the card.,
Keep it in the wrist.,
Practice by aiming at a target.",How to Throw Playing Cards1," Hold the card parallel to the ground and grip the bottom of the short side of the card on the corner farthest away from you between your index and middle finger, or your middle and ring finger. This is sometimes called ""The Ferguson Grip,"" named after a famous card player. Alternate finger grips for the basic throw include:



For the Thurston grip, place the short side of a card between your middle and index finger so that the side runs parallel with the two fingers all the way through. This is perhaps the most common, if not the most accurate grip on the card.For the Hermann grip, hold the card between your thumb and your middle finger, letting the index finger reach all the way to the opposite corner.

For the Ricky Jay grip, place your index finger on a corner and place your thumb on top of the card with your three remaining fingers along the bottom of the long side of the card. Your thumb on top should be right around on top of your middle finger.;
, The opposite corner of the card (top corner, closest to you) from where you're gripping it should come back and touch the inside of your wrist to cock it for the throw. Most of the power comes from the flick of your wrist, not from arm strength, so it's important to curl it back like this.








, Unwind, keeping your arm as straight and level as possible relative to the ground to keep the card from wobbling side to side, and snap your wrist forward to throw the card.








, When your fingertips are pointing at the target you want to hit, let go.








, There should be almost no arm movement whatsoever when you first start out, to get the mechanics of the spin right. To practice, grab a hold of your arm and practice launching the cards with wrist movement alone.









After practicing and being able to throw cards without missing, you could try moving your arms for extra speed.

, Set up a potato or a banana and throw cards at it. Experienced card throwers can stick a playing card into a potato from several paces away. Practice tossing until you can get the corner to stick in firmly.








"
"
Grip the card correctly for an overhand toss.,
Curve your wrist and wind your arm up over your shoulder.,
Snap your wrist forward.,
Keep practicing.",How to Throw Playing Cards2," How you hold the card for an overhand toss is up to you: you can grip by card by the corner, Ferguson style as with the Frisbee toss, or you can hold the entire long side of a card between your middle and ring finger. Experiment some with different grips to see what works best for you.

, To get started, don't put your arm into it, but perform the same basic motion as the Frisbee toss, just having rotated your wrist up and down, rather than side-to-side. When you've gotten used to it, bring the card up beside your head to put more power into your tosses. It's all in the wrist.








, In one fast, smooth motion, swing your arm over shoulder and step into throw like throwing a baseball. At the end of that motion, curve your wrist out and spread your middle and ring finger slightly, releasing the card.








, Practice the motion, try to get it as smooth as possible, getting a clean release of the card. Keeping the motion as smooth as possible is the key to getting the card to spin and not cut through the air, rather than floating on it and moving everywhere.








"
"
Hold the entire deck parallel to the ground.,
Place your thumb on the top of the deck.,
Snap your thumb forward rapidly, launching the card.,
Go into rapid fire mode.",How to Throw Playing Cards3," If you want to throw cards straight off the deck, hustler-style, grip the deck firmly with the long side of the cards in the palm of your hand, the short sides perpendicular with your body.

, It can be helpful to lick your thumb to get a bit of grip on the top card and slide it off more easily.








, It'll take some practice to get the motion firm enough to send the card, but light enough not to launch off the top several cards. Your thumb should come up off the deck slightly, launching them out and away, rather than down. A bit of wetness on the pad of your thumb should help.








, Once the card is launched, draw thumb back quickly, being careful not to touch the top of the deck, so you can keep shooting off cards like mad. It's fun!

Grip the card correctly for an overhand toss.,
Hold your hand palm-side up.,
Curve your wrist and wind your arm up over your shoulder.,
Snap your wrist forward.,
Keep practicing.",How to Throw Cards Accurately1," The throwing style with the most power and potential for accuracy is an overhand toss, used by expert card throwers the world around. One of the earliest public practitioners was a stage magician named Howard Thurston, who used an overhand toss to put power and accuracy into his tosses, wowing audiences. Finding a grip that works for you and feels comfortable is the most important part of learning to throw accurately.Most grip variations are named after famous card throwers:


The Thurston grip involved pinching the short side of the card between your index and middle finger, so the bulk of the card faces in toward your palm. All the other fingers should be up and out of the way.
The Hermann grip, named after another magician, involves pinching the card between your thumb and your middle finger in the center of the card about a third of the way down, letting the index finger wrap all the way to the opposite edge at the corner to help control the spin. The bulk of the card should be facing your palm.;
, The basic toss with the most accuracy happens by bending the card up next to the side of your head and release it with a flick of your wrist. To do this and get the right kind of spin on the card, you need to turn your palm up and grip the card using the grip style of your choice.

, Curve your wrist in so the card tucks into your wrist, and bend your elbow, drawing your hand up next to your head to get your arm ready for the throw. Your pinkie finger should be just about even with your ear when your arm is cocked and ready.


To learn the appropriate motion and practice, just curve your wrist up without putting your whole arm into it and try tossing the card with enough spin. When you've gotten used to it practicing the toss, bring the card up beside your head to put more power into your tosses.

, In one fast, smooth motion, swing your arm forward from your shoulder and step into throw like throwing a baseball to get the most power and accuracy out of the card. At the end of that motion, unroll your wrist, spreading your middle and ring finger slightly to release the card., Practice the motion, try to get it as smooth as possible, getting a clean release of the card. Keeping the motion as smooth as possible is the key to getting the card to spin and cut through the air, rather than floating on it and moving everywhere with the breeze.


When you practice this motion, pay particular attention to how you're unrolling your wrist into a smooth line with the rest of your arm as you toss the card. Like many things, it's all in the wrist, but the power comes from your elbow.

Grip the card correctly.,
Curl the card back into your wrist.,
Keep it in the wrist.,
Flick your wrist forward.,
Release the card.",How to Throw Cards Accurately2," Another common and accurate throwing style pioneered by powerful card thrower Ricky Jay and others is the frisbee-style toss, which can be super-accurate and super-powerful when gripped and tossed correctly. While you can also frisbee-toss a card using the Ferguson or the Thurston grip, it's more common to use Ricky Jay's style of holding the card:


To learn the Ricky Jay grip, place your index finger on one corner of the card and place your thumb on top. Fold your three other fingers along the bottom of the long edge of the card.
This grip is a bit like a hybrid of the other two styles. Your thumb on top should be on the other side of the card as your middle finger, pinching the card, much like the Hermann grip.

, Curl the card back into your wrist, much as before, but hold your wrist parallel with the ground, your pinkie facing down as when you hold a frisbee. You can also wrap your arm around your body so the card is closer to your armpit on the opposite side of your body from the hand holding the card.Ricky Jay actually lifts his throwing hand up over his head, almost as if he's going to do an overhand throw, but the mechanics are more like a frisbee toss than an overhand throw, or some combination of the two. It looks as if the card is going to touch the ear on the opposite side of his head.

, There should be almost no arm movement whatsoever when you first start out, to get the mechanics of the spin right. To practice, grab a hold of your arm and practice launching the cards with wrist movement alone.


After practicing and being able to throw cards without missing, you could try moving your arms for extra speed.

, Unwind, keeping your arm as straight and level as possible relative to the ground to keep the card from wobbling side to side, and snap your wrist forward to throw the card.


In general, you can practice just using your wrist to toss the cards accurately, much as in the overhand throw. The mechanics are much the same, just oriented in a different direction. It's still all in the wrist, but the power comes from your elbow.

, When your fingertips are pointing at the target you want to hit, let the card go with a final vigorous flick of your wrist, extending your fingers quickly and straight to release the card and get it spinning in the direction you want. It'll take some practice to get the whole maneuver put together correctly, but learning to throw accurately involves a careful attention to the details.

"
"
Focus on spin.,
Aim at an appropriate target.,
Experiment with different grips.,
Build strength in your wrist.,
Use new cards.",How to Throw Cards Accurately3," A card thrown accurately moves on the motion of its spin. Cards don't fly through the air stock straight like when Gambit throws them in an X-Men comic. To get the most sticking power and accuracy out of your throws, spin the card as much as possible.


Practice extending your wrist and your fingers in one fluid motion, as quickly as possible. At the apex of your toss, speed up your motion just slightly, really putting some flick into your wrist. This'll be the difference between a lame duck and a cutting card.

, Popular targets for card-throwing involve a lot of Styrofoam and fruit. Experienced card throwers can stick a playing card into a potato from several paces away, and melons, apples, Styrofoam backing, cardboard, and other surfaces. Practice tossing until you can get the corner to stick in firmly.


Don't throw cards at anyone's face or body. Even if you're not throwing with much power yet, a card in the eye can be extremely dangerous. Be very careful and only practice by throwing cards at appropriate targets.

, There's no one correct way of throwing cards, so practicing will be a matter of experimenting with different grips and techniques and seeing what works right for you. Try picking your favorite parts of each technique and welding them together into your own hybrid style of throwing. Make it work for you.


Watch Ricky Jay throw cards on YouTube to watch closely the kind of motion he uses and the snap he gets into his cards. Go see a magician or card expert in action to learn more and pick up all the tricks of the trade you can.

, To get better at any sleight-of-hand tricks, especially card throwing, it's a good idea to spend some time building dexterity and strength in your wrists and forearms. The strong your wrists and hands, the better and more accurately you'll be able to throw cards.


It's a good idea to stretch out your wrists after you throw cards, and to loosen them up before. To do this, get down on your knees and put your palms flat on the ground, curling your wrists around so your fingers are pointing back at yourself. Stretch out your wrists by bringing your butt toward the ground and keeping your palms flat.

, It's much easier to throw new, stiff, crisp cards, than old ones that you've been playing rummy with for years. If you want to make it easy on yourself, get some new good-quality cards that'll stand up to throwing, and replace them regularly to get the most accuracy and power out of your throws.

Look at this hand placement with the hands on the same side of the deck is probably the best tearing method.,
Learn another method of tearing the deck.,
Know that this is yet another grip.,
Note that you will need strong thumbs, index fingers, and middle fingers to hold onto the cards as you are twisting, and strong enough wrists to twist and tear the deck.,
Sledgehammer levering – hold a sledgehammer out to your side and, using only your wrist, let the hammerhead slowly make its way down to your face and then back up again.,
Narrow pinching – Not everybody has a narrow pinch block to lift, but if you’ve got a block of wood less than 3/4” thick and can attach a chain and weights to it, then you’ve got a worthwhile homemade training tool for tearing a deck of cards.,
Know that if you’re a beginner, practice tearing your pre-determined number of cards, sledgehammer levering, and narrow pinching only a few times a week for a couple weeks.,
Narrow pinching – load up some weights on your apparatus and do 4-5 lifts with each hand.,
The Twist- This is the initial tear.,
Continue and as you can see that this step shows the deck mostly torn.",How to Tear up a Deck of Cards,";
, This tends to give less power at the beginning of the tear than the first image. You may feel that this is easier for you.

, With this method you will need a very powerful index and middle finger. Play around with the different grips during the different phases of the tear to find out where you are the most effective.

, Your ability to pinch relatively narrow objects firmly will come in really handy here. There are several exercises to do that will enable you to develop strong enough hands to tear a deck:


Tear with intensity to slowly rip through the deck rather than blast through it. It is much more satisfying to “feel” the deck tearing and then separating.






Your thumbs, index fingers, and middle fingers will play the biggest role in tearing the deck, so the whole time you are grasping the deck in your hands, squeeze very hard as if you were trying to fuse your fingers to the deck.






Imagine that you’ve a pair of vice grips for hands and clamp down on those cards. It seems that the heaviest burden of the deck tear lies with the thumb being strong enough to pinch the deck.







, Do this slowly and with a light weight (6-8lbs) at first just to get the feel of it and start adding weight to make it heavier. You can do this by either sliding the weight down the handle of the hammer or duct taping it to the end. If you’re already levering a 16lb sledge or heavier, stop reading this article and go tear some cards! You can also lever the sledge to the front of you and side to side., A narrow pinch block is valuable for your grip training anyway., Then start to do higher volume, more cards, and heavier weight gradually. The hands and wrists are remarkable in their ability to recover quickly, but you don’t want to overdo it at first. As you become an advanced grip enthusiast, you can make good gains training your hands hard 4-7 days a week. A typical day’s training would consist of:


25 card stack tear






Another 25 card stack tear






Sledgehammer levering – 6lb hammer held by end of handle, levered down to face 5-6 times with each hand






More levering – 6lb hammer held by end of handle, levered side to side 5 to 6 times.






NOTE: if you cannot completely lever the hammer down to your nose safely and under control, choke up on the handle so it becomes a little easier, then work your way towards the end of the handle as you get stronger.







, You can also do timed holds where you hold the weight in the air for 7-10 seconds. These are lots of fun and more and more pinch grip enthusiasts swear by them. Total time: Approximately 20-30 minutes with rest time between sets, Grip the cards and take a deep breath and begin the twist. Now you’ve worked up to thicker stacks of cards and are ready to tackle an entire deck. Take what you’ve learned, grip the cards,

, Keep twisting, and your deck will look like the one in the summary at the start of this article. Completely torn in half.

Send your assistant, who is also completely fluent in this trick, out of the room.,
Shuffle a standard deck of cards.

,
Deal out cards face up onto a table.,
Watch the cards very carefully as you are dealing, keeping an eye out for the numbered cards 4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10.,
Consider this random deal of cards: Say that, on the first deal, an Ace comes up -- place the card toward the top of the table in line with your left arm.,
Ask your mark, once the cards are laid out, to choose one card by touching the face of the card.

,
Direct your assistant to come back into the room.,
Ask your assistant what card was chosen using the following method: Touch one of the cards on the table (in the same manner as the card was chosen) and say ""Was this the card?"",
When you touch the ""control"" card, touch the pip on the card whose position indicates the chosen card.","How to Perform the Original ""Psychic Force""",";
,, Deal the first card to the top of the table in front of your left arm. Deal the second card to the top of the table in front of your right arm. Continue dealing down these columns, alternating left and right as described in step four.

, You will note that the design on all seven of these cards consists of two vertical columns of pips with optional center pips (the ten has two center pips, the odd-numbered cards have one center pip, the remaining cards have none.) Your goal is to deal out the shape of the pips on one of these cards, and to have that card be present on the table. Ideally, you would like the 10 card to be present, because that allows you to deal the largest number of cards onto the table -- however, unless you are able to pre-arrange the deck, you cannot be certain of this. See the example in the next step.

, On the next card, a Jack comes up -- place this card level with the Ace in line with your right hand. The next card to come up is a 7. Place this card directly below the Ace. Note that the 7 is one of your target cards. This means that you are safe to deal out at least four more cards. Using the 7 as a template, the fourth and sixth cards you deal would be placed underneath the the Jack, while the fifth card would be placed under the Ace and the 7. Your seventh card would be placed in the middle row, centered. In this manner, the cards you have dealt out will match the pips on the 7. If one of the cards after the 7 turned out to be an 8, 9 or 10, feel free to change your layout ""on the fly"" and go for the higher card.

,, Your assistant now looks at the cards on the table. First, she determines what card shape has been laid out. Next, she examines the cards in the order they were laid out, and finds the first card which matches the corresponding card shape. This card is now the ""control"" card. For example, the ""control"" card for step 4, above, would be the 7 card in the first column just below the Ace.

,

, In the example above, say that the mark selected the Jack at the top of the right hand column; you might use the following scenario: Touch the Ace and say ""Was this the card?"". Touch the 7 on the top right pip and say ""Was this the card?"". Touch the card in the center and ask. Now, touch the jack -- this time, your assistant will answer ""yes"".

, In this trick, for it to be convincing, it's a good idea to count out loud and gesture with your other hand. This is visually and aurally distracting from what you're actually doing.


Tap the pen against your left hand as if that somehow makes the pen disappear-able. The more of a routine you make it, the more impressive the trick will be.

, You need to be facing perpendicular to your spectator's line of sight. This way whoever is watching cannot see the pen as you hold it near your ear next to the side of your head.


This is mainly building up suspense. Once it's beside your head take it back to it's originally position, as if teasing your audience.

, You can keep count, saying one, two, and then make it vanish on the third go. It takes a lot of work to make a pen disappear – you've gotta rev up!

, Now comes the actual work. As you raise your hand for the third time, carefully and without losing a beat, place it behind your ear. You must do this smoothly and while focusing on your hand in front of you.


The counting is important to help you keep the timing exactly the same each time you raise your pen-holding hand. Try to perform every raising quickly to prevent detection.

, Bam! The pen is gone! Smugly show both sides of your hands and that the pen is nowhere to be found. Just be careful not to turn your head, showing the pen.

If you do want to make a show of it, hold your hands against your head as if this great psychic exertion pains you greatly. While clutching your head in agony, slide the pen into your hand and produce it from wherever you see fit.

For this technique you'll need a table, blanket, and your mirror. This trick will rely on lighting and positioning of the mirror. It won't be perfect on your first attempt. You're trying to create a foreground reflection of the ground underneath the table.

, You'll need a standard video camera and a tripod. If you don't own a tripod you can set one up on a study surface for your video camera. The idea is to not change your camera's the location.

, For a realistic effect, weave the vanishing effect into your video, so it appears seamless. For example, your video is about a futuristic society who teleport for transportation. In this scenario you'd script the dialogue in a way that the characters are talking about teleporting somewhere, or are preparing to teleport.


Shoot the footage up until the moment that you want the characters to disappear.
It might help if they countdown, 3-2-1 and then cut the scene.

, Have everyone in the shot leave the camera's eye. Check on the camera's display monitor to ensure that the shot is only the background.

, If you roll the film from exactly where you left off, it'll appear as though the characters disappeared from their location. If you want them to reappear: cut the scene and gather all the characters back into their original positions and continue filming.

Put on a long-sleeved shirt with open sleeves.,
Hold a pen with both hands.,
With your middle finger, snap the pen back to your wrist.,
Slide the pen into your sleeve.,
Pull your sleeves up for added effect.,
Practice this in a mirror until you get it down.",How to Make a Pen Magically Disappear2," For this method, you'll be using the ""sleeving"" technique – where the pen magically disappears...into your sleeve. For this, you want a darker-colored shirt with open sleeves that aren't too tight around your wrists but also not hanging down like you're a wizard. Aim for somewhere in between.


You want to stay in the color realm of your pen. If you're using a white pen, a white shirt may be fine. The darker your pen, though, the darker your shirt should be.

, Take the pen the long way and hold one end with your pointer finger and thumb and the other with your pointer finger and thumb. At this point, your fingers should be facing your audience. With whatever hand is your dominant hand, apply pressure on the pen with your middle finger, as if it wants to push it back into your palm.


The pen should be held out in front of you as if on display. A foot in front of you is good – you want your elbows relaxed as if it is all effortless.

, Practice this part plenty before you do this trick in front of your friends. You want your middle finger to essentially snap the pen backward to your palm where you will hold in there for just a split second. Do this part as quickly as possible so it looks like it disappears.


Rotate your thumbs upward once the pen is snapped. This allows the pen to be concealed by your fingers. Your fingers should now be facing inward as if you're about to give someone the ""thumbs up"" sign.
With the snap, do a slight up and down movement. This isn't necessarily to do the trick per se, but it looks good to your audience and makes it look as if you're actually doing something to make the pen disappear and your body has been slightly effected by it, producing the little up and down motion.

, With the pen clasped against your wrist, quickly (very, very quickly) thrust it into your sleeve. Once it's in there, open up your hands, showing your flabbergasted audience that the pen is nowhere to be found.


Rotate your hands, palms up, to show there is no pen. Then turn them over and wave them around a bit, proving that it's not concealed at a specific angle that you're audience just happens to not be seeing.

, After you've waved your arms around a bit, pull up both your sleeves to be even more convincing. To make sure the pen comes with your sleeve, pinch it as you push it up. It will be resting at the bottom of your sleeve due to gravity and won't be noticed by your audience underneath your arm.


If you'd like, once you get really good at this trick, tug at your sleeves a bit even before the trick. Don't move them too much, though – just enough to give the illusion that you've moved them up a bit. If you move them too far, you can wiggle around a bit to lower them before you vanish the pen.

, There will be many times when the pen misses your sleeve and shoots up behind you, or when you snap the pen back at an awkward angle and it hangs down your hand. To make sure you're doing it correctly, practice in a mirror until you can do it several times over convincingly.


Add some flare to your show, too. Start with showing the pen, adjusting your hands as if you have to get it perfect, concentrating really hard, maybe even blinking the pen into thin air. The grander your show, the more distracted your audience will be.

Choose a larger coin if you are just starting out.,
Buy palming coins from a magic store.,
Place the coin in the base of the dominant hand.,
Press the coin into the palm of your hand.,
Bring your thumb closer to the forefinger.,
Show the audience that your other hand is “empty.” All you have to do is show your other hand is empty, while keeping the concealed coin in your classic palm position.,
Practice a lot.",How to Palm a Coin," A larger coin may seem harder to hide, but it is actually easier to palm, especially for beginners.


Start with a half dollar. Smaller coins will be harder to palm and this will make your hand look more unnatural. Only use a quarter if your hands are very small.
Hold the coin with your thumb and pointer finger (in your dominant hand) touching its edges, so people can easily see it.
Show it to your audience. It’s possible to use the same trick to palm multiple coins at the same time, although that’s not a good idea when you’re first trying it.;
, Although you can use real coins in this trick, it will be easier if you purchase coins specifically used for palming from a magic store.


For example, palming coins often look like silver dollars, but they are thinner and lighter, which will make it easier to palm them.
In addition to magic stores, you can now buy many of these kinds of products through online magic sites. These palming coins also are designed so they are easier to grip.

, There is an area at the base of your palm that is able to grip and hold a coin in place when the hand muscles are flexed. This is key. Your muscles will contract in the palm, allowing your palm to clutch the coin.The coin that is to be palmed is usually resting on the fingertips, on the fore and middle finger of the hand. Keep your hand in a relaxed and natural position.This position is quite flexible and will allow the coin to be easily maneuvered as you curl the two fingers into your palm or turn your hand palm downwards after curling the fingers to make a clenched fist.

, Now, while holding your hand facing up, contract your thumb muscle by simply bringing your thumb closer to the center of your hand. You should see the coin being slightly pressed down onto your palm, thus holding the coin to your hand.


This is the basic principle of palming a coin. Now, if you bring your four other fingers inward, the coin will be even more secure. You should be able to hold your hand facing downwards without the possession of the coin being obvious. Practice over time will improve this skill to the point where it will be difficult to identify the location of the coin.Try and keep the thumb and forefinger touching as this will prevent your thumb from sticking out, which would make it obvious that you are concealing a coin in the hand., The muscles are then contracted when you bring your thumb a little closer to the forefinger.Notice how when the thumb comes in, the muscle will then go over the coin.From the front, this looks very, very natural. Over time as you practice this, you'll be able to place your hand down on a table and then pick it back up. You'll be able to then conceal coins without anyone knowing.

, You should even be able to wiggle your fingers while palming a coin.As you bring the right hand concealing the coin, over your left hand, you're going to drop this coin into your left hand as you turn over your left hand and give a tap with the right hand.
You can then give a snap, turn the left hand over, and then open to expose the coin. To do this, with the thumb and pointer finger of your other hand, reach over and act like you are grabbing the coin, but reach your fingers beyond the coin, allowing the coin to actually fall into the palm of your left hand.
As you bring your right hand away, press the coin into the palm of your left hand to hold it, and allow your fingers on your left to hang down naturally. You can turn sideways, placing the right side of your body towards the audience as you drop the coin into your pocket with your left hand (which is now hidden from people's line of view). Hold your right hand up and blow on it and then open it to show it is empty (or you can make like you are tossing it at the people).

, You won’t be able to do this trick as well the first time you attempt it, most likely. It’s basically working with muscles in your hand, so practicing it will help you perfect the trick.


Each time you perform the trick, you are creating what is called “muscle memory.” As your muscles get used to being in this new position, the trick will get easier and easier.
Try holding the coin in your palm for an extended period of time to create more of this muscle memory when you practice the trick. Some magicians will practice by trying to type with their fingers while a coin is palmed in their hands.

",How to Pull a Coin Out Of an Ear," Two of the best known performers of the present day, Penn and Teller, often use examples in their act to describe the seven principle components of sleight of hand. A few are directly relevant to this trick, and so are worthy of explanation here.The Steal. In this case, you must merely obtain the object (a coin) without giving the impression that you have done anything at all.



 


The Palm. This consists of holding an object in a hand without it being seen. For this trick, it is perhaps the most fundamental and mastering it is a prerequisite to its performance.






Misdirection. Though not all performers of the coin-from-the-ear trick employ elaborate forms of misdirection, it is a good idea to draw attention away from the palm hand. After all, it is carrying something.





;
, There are, of course, many methods for palming a coin, for instance. Here is a description of a few of the more common.The classic palm. This involves holding the object (the coin) between the muscles at the base of the thumb and the little finger. Do not apply too much pressure to hold the object in place; an appropriately sized object can remain in place with a fairly slight grip. While this is considered one of the most difficult palming methods to master, it is also one of the best. Few people imagine it possible to hold an object in this manner, and so it deceives audiences quite effectively.






The finger palm. Hold the object at the base of your middle and ring fingers, with you fingers held in a fairly natural arc. This is comparatively easy, and also a rather natural way in which to hold your hand.






The thumb palm. Hold the edge of the coin between your thumb and hand. Try to keep the thumb relatively relaxed. This may be the easiest of the palming techniques to employ, but it also one of the least effective at concealing the object.







, Keep in mind that a great many magic tricks are only effective at deceiving people because, quite simply, the mind of the observer is either inattentive (and makes assumptions about what is happening) or distracted (and fails to notice the important action). Experts on the performance of magic (and growing numbers in the scientific community) have begun to recognize the relationship between a successful illusion and the limits of human cognition. If you feel you have the fundamentals of the trick down but are not yet convincing to your audience, you may need to spend a little more time thinking about how the the mind processes complex information. As just one example, magicians have helped explain to scientists that arcing hand motions are better distractions than straight hand motions. When scientists began to examine the claim, they found that side-to-side tracking was natural for most people but following an object along a curved path required greater concentration.For those about to perform a trick, this information explains how to distract the audience or downplay certain actions.

, Inconspicuously take a coin (quarters, half-dollars, or subway tokens work best) out of your pocket and into your hand. Keep the gestures to a minimum, or it will be obvious that you have just grabbed an object.

, Using one of the methods described above, move the coin into a palmed position. Don't grab too tightly or everyone will see the straining muscles in your hand.

, Approach a specific audience member while maintaining the coin in the palmed position. Though difficult to describe in words, look for someone who appears willing to be entertained.


If you are going to employ some form of distraction, this is the moment. As one magician recommends, distract your subject and audience by using a larger motion to hide a smaller one. If the coin is in your right hand, for instance, any gestures with your left should be used to draw some attention away. Perhaps better yet, try non-physical distractions. Conversation can be nearly as effective at misdirecting your audience as motion can be. Keep eye contact with the subject individual. This will draw their eyes to your face while leaving only their peripheral vision to your hands.

, Begin to reach your hand behind your target's head.

,


For most palming methods, you will use your middle and ring fingers to extract the coin.
Move quickly, but with seamless motions. If you have perfected palming, you should be able to withdraw the coin with relative ease and without fumbling.

, Say something like ""He/She has got a coin in his/her ear!"" or ""Ta Da!""

Smooth out the aluminium.,
Place the coin on the aluminium on any side that you would like, front or back.

,
Trace the outline of the coin on the aluminium.

,
Put the aluminium on the edge and trim the extra foil with the toothpick.,
Trace the outline, the images, the letters, and all the detail on the aluminum.,
With the aluminium still on the quarter, fold the aluminum around the coin and on the edge smoothly.,
Take the real quarter out of the aluminium.

,
Perform the sleight of hand.,
Have fun with this magic trick!

",How to Vanish a Coin Using Aluminium," Make sure there aren't any lines or creases on it.;
,,, Be gentle while removing.

, Be extra careful if your audience is very precise and observant.

, Do not fold any aluminum on the back of the quarter. If this step is not done incorrectly, it makes the trick less believable.

,, When performing this trick:


First, show the fake quarter to your audience within a fine distance.
Then, place the rectangular piece on top of the fake quarter and snap your fingers.
Lastly, crumple the piece of paper and the fake quarter to a small size, showing the audience how a quarter which was supposedly made of metal is now crumpled and folded.

Stand a quarter up vertically on a flat, hard surface.,
Hold the quarter in place with one finger, preferably your index finger.,
Flick the edge of the coin with the very tip of your other index finger.",How to Spin a Coin2," Stand it up on its edge so that it is neither on the ""heads"" nor ""tails"" side.

, Face one full side towards you, so that you can either see the heads or tails of the coin.

, If you're spinning a quarter, flick George Washington's nose or the ""In God We Trust Text"". Don't flick it too hard or it will spin far away from you.


The trick to spinning a coin tightly by flicking is getting a good balance between speed and area. Try to flick the coin pretty quickly (using a good amount of force), but not so quickly that the coin flies too far away from you. On the other hand, when flicking with your index finger, try to only hit a small area of the actual coin; hit too much area and your coin will go flying.
Remember to keep your other hand on the coin even as you flick it. If you let go of the coin with your one hand, you won't get a tight spin.

Choose the right coin.,
Make a fist with your thumb facing up.,
Put your thumb under your index finger.,
Place the coin over the gap created by your thumb and index finger.,
Quickly pull your thumb up.,
Watch the coin in the air.,
Decide how the toss will end.,
Be the chooser.,
See which side is facing up.,
Keep your tosses soft.,
Practice your flipping.",How to Flip a Coin," There isn't really a ""best"" coin for tossing. It's really about personal preference and hand size. Newer coins with more defined markings can make it easier to call your toss. On newer coins you can feel the faces and edges a bit better.


If you are flipping the coin as part of a trick, it's good to have a specific coin in mind. Not necessarily because it will make any difference, but because it gives you something to talk about as part of your misdirection.;
, Your thumb is the finger will push the coin into the air. You'll want it facing up so that the coin will go up.

, You don't want it sticking all the way through between your first two fingers, just get the edge of your thumb under there. When you bring your thumb up for the toss, this will give you a little resistance, helping create a quick move to strike the coin.

, It should sit on top of both fingers, and not fall off when you don’t hold it in place. You won’t be holding the coin in place when you flip it, so it needs to sit there without help.

, This snap motion will push the coin into the air, causing it to flip over and over. You can also push your hand upwards as you do this. Gently doing so will give you a softer toss, meaning the coin will spin fewer times., This isn't to track the flips, just so you either can catch it or track it down if it rolls after hitting the floor. Flipping the coin won't do you any good if you can't find it to see what end came up.

, You need to know what you will be looking for when you toss the coin into the air. Will you catch it, or let it hit the ground? If you catch it, do you reveal the coin as is, or flip it over to place somewhere else (giving it one final flip)? If you are using it to make a decision with another person, making these decisions clear will prevent either of you from complaining about the result afterwards.


On the other hand, if you are comfortable with the steps below, and can set the coin and get the toss off quickly, you can put the other person off guard, and maybe get a more favorable result.

, If possible, make sure you are the one choosing heads or tails, so you can see the tossing conditions and make your guess accordingly.Alternatively, you can also make sure you are the one tossing the coin. That way you'll be able to control the conditions to give yourself an edge., While a coin toss is generally considered a 50-50 proposition, the different designs on each face actually make it more of a 51-49 possibility in favor of the side facing up. That may not seem like a big difference, but when you are trying to guess right, every little bit helps. This works best with new coins. The older a coin is, the more it has been scuffed up or otherwise gained imperfections, which changes the physics behind each toss.Take into account how the toss will end as well. If the tosser (you or the other person) is going to catch the coin and flip it over onto another surface (their hand, a table), then pick the side facing down. The extra flip after the coin lands will account for the difference.
If you are the tosser, and want a little extra degree of sneakiness, you can judge the side of the coin by the feel. The ""Tails"" side usually has a more ornate design, so should feel rougher on your finger than ""Heads."", A softer toss will cause the coin to flip fewer times, meaning you can track it's movement more easily., Like any skill, flipping a coin is something you can improve with practice. The more you do it, the more consistent you can make your tosses, which can make you a better judge of how many times the coin will flip in the air."

, When folding the bill, make sure you fold it backwards not forwards. Also make sure the folded edge is on the right side when placed in front of you.

, Then unfold to make creases.

, When finished with this step your bill will come to a point.

, Fold it toward the side with the point. Make sure you are left with a little triangle at the point.

, You should already have crease made from step 3.

, Fold the top and bottom edges towards the center. The folds should be easy considering you already made the crease previously.

, Hold the bottom layer in your left hand and hold the top layer in your right. Pull the top layer to the right. Once you open it up put your finger in the box part to open it up a bit.

, Your dime should fit in the box very snug. If you were to hold it upside down the dime should not fall out.

, Make sure you slide it in under the folds. You can adjust the size of the ring by forcing more of the long end into the shorter end. If it happens to not stay together for you, you might have to tape it to get it secure.

Ask a volunteer to say which hand the coin is in.,
Slowly reveal both hands, the original hand empty and the new hand with the coin.",How to Do a Simple Coin Magic Trick1," Allow them a moment of disbelief. Make it sound convincing, letting them know that you've been practicing the lost art of telekinesis for a while now. The more they doubt you, the more fun it becomes.


Magic tricks are all about confidence and distraction. The more you make it ""entertaining,"" the less they'll scrutinize your hands and the tricks you're actually employing. They'll be too busy having fun to be suspicious if you turn it into more of a show.;
, Take a look at the video above – do you see the small gap between his first two fingers? That's perfect.









The coin is going to fall through your hand without your hand opening up. It's easy to mess this up, so in the beginning, make sure the coin is placed just right to be able to access this opening.

, It's going to look like you're sort of just waving your fist over your other hand – what the audience doesn't see is that the coin drops into your other hand. As soon as you feel the coin drop, clench your other fist.









Widen the gap of the starting hand so the coin more easily falls into your hand; otherwise, it might just get stuck in the original hand.

, They will, hopefully, choose the original hand, since it never opened up to deposit the coin in the other hand.


If they choose the new hand, demand they explain to you how you could've possibly had the coin change hands if it weren't for your amazing telekinetic powers.

, If you managed to not move your fingers when the coin dropped and clenched your fist soon enough in catching the coin, your friends will be adequately wowed. Now, can you move that table over there?









If this trick is proving difficult to master, move to a smaller coin. It will more easily fall through any gap you create in your fingers.

Purchase a Coinvexed® assembly or kit.,
Unpack the contents of the package.,
Assemble the components.,
Place the pile in your left hand, with the slit in it facing towards the lid of the Sharpie pen, which should be positioned in your right hand.

Lean forward, with the coin on the left and secretly put pressure on the assembly.,
Put the Sharpie back in your pocket and place the bent coin in the spectator's hand.,
Tell them to squeeze their hand, and, sure enough, the coin is bent.

",How to Magically Bend a Coin Using a Coinvexed Kit," You actually need to purchase the the Coinvexed® trick. It can be bought from a magic shop or off the internet. The current version, Coinvexed 3® - The Third Generation - retails for £90 ($150 USD), but if you are a dedicated magician, you will be accustomed to this type of price tag. The looks of astonishment resulting from the trick are priceless and the coin bending implement can be expected to last a very long time, so, maybe, £90 is not such a high price tag.

You can likely find a cheaper price through judicious purchasing, that is, by shopping around.
You can choose to buy earlier versions of the magic apparatus which will probably have been used. There are two earlier models— Coinvexed 2® and the original version. Do know that the later versions are said to be incremental design improvements over the preceding generation.This means that the earlier versions will get the job done nearly as well.
It is probable that the earlier, used versions will come without the DVD that explains the showmanship and gives multiple angles of the actual trick being performed, so it is best to ask if the DVD is included before you buy a used product or assume that it will not be. It is not such a big deal not having the DVD (which is padded a bit with showmanship) because all you need to know will be provided in this article.

First and foremost, the DVD is a promotional tool to get you primed about the prospect of amazing and delighting your friends and neighbors. Still, use the fact (read line) that the trick comes without an essential (not really) part to leverage the price down. - Your parents would be so proud if they knew (or maybe not).;
, Once the package arrives, take everything out and examine the contents to make sure everything is included and has arrived undamaged.

, When you open the trick, you should get a Sharpie with a metal lid that looks like a Sharpie lid. The metal lid will have a slit in the top and you will also get a metal object that you can stick coins to. Stick the coins to the pile and place the false lid on a Sharpie pen, colour of your choice.

,,,, The coin shouldn't fall and, if you do it properly, the coin should bend.


While you are bending the coin, make sure the viewer is doing something else, like signing a card for an *upcoming trick*.

, At this point they should believe the coin isn't bent yet.

Flip the coin from your middle finger to your ring finger.,
Pinch the coin between your ring and pinky fingers.,
Let the coin slide through your fingers.,
Slide the coin back to your pointer finger.,Finished!",How to Roll a Coin on Your Knuckles," Depending on size of your hand and the agility of your fingers, you might want to use a smaller or bigger coin.For example, American quarters tend to work for a lot of people, but you can experiment with different sized and weighted coins to see what works best for you.Bigger and heavier coins may help beginners get better grip and control of the coin.
Keep in mind that this trick will require lots of practice. It will take time to coordinate the movements of your fingers while controlling the movement of the coin.;
, Hold the coin in your upturned hand, resting on your fingers. Place your thumb on top of the coin and slide the coin over to the side of the first phalanx of your pointer finger.This is the area right after the knuckle that connects your finger to your hand.









As you slide the coin up to your pointer finger, turn your hand over so your palm is facing down., All of your fingers should be curved downward into a relaxed fist.Your fingers should not be contacting your palm. The first phalanxes of your hand (where you will be rolling the coin) should all be leveled parallel to the floor.Your hand should look like you are holding onto an invisible microphone.

, While the coin is resting on the side of your finger, use your thumb to push the coin up, on top of your pointer finger. The coin should be resting flat on the phalanx of your pointer finger.








As the coin is resting flat on your pointer finger, slightly raise your middle finger above your index finger.Your raised middle finger will act as a barrier so the coin doesn’t fall off your fingers, but it will also be instrumental to flip the coin over to your next finger., With your middle finger slightly raised, simultaneously pull down your middle finger and push up your pointer finger.This opposing movement will cause the coin to grip onto the side of your middle finger, fall into the gap between your pointer and middle finger, and flip onto your middle finger phalanx.









When you push up with your pointer finger, you push the coin up and away so it can flip onto your middle finger. When you bring down your middle finger, you provide a lower platform for the coin to easily flip onto.
When the coin is resting on your middle finger phalanx, slightly raise your ring finger to get ready for the next flip., Once the coin is resting on your middle finger, you will perform the same action as you did with your previous fingers. With your ring finger already slightly raised, bring down your ring finger while simultaneously pushing up your middle finger.The coin will catch on the side of your ring finger, fall into the space between your two fingers, the then flip as you push up with your middle finger. The coin should flip and land on top of your ring finger phalanx.









When the coin is resting on top of your ring finger phalanx, slightly raise your pinky finger., With the coin resting on your ring finger phalanx, simultaneously push up your ring finger and lower your pinky finger. Try and grip as much of the coin as possible when you lower your pinky finger.








Instead of lifting your ring finger up high to flip the coin over, simply allow the coin to fall in the space between your two fingers. Pinch and hold the coin in the space between your two fingers., With a portion of the coin fallen through the space to the underside of your hand, loosen the pinch on the coin and let it slide through the space until the majority of the coin is on the underside of your hand.








Keep a small, top portion of the coin still pinched between your fingers.

, Reach your thumb underneath your palm, to the far side of the coin closest to your pinky.Loosen your pinch on the coin, and use your thumb to push the coin flat against your palm.While keeping your thumb on the coin, slide the coin over your fingers and back up to the side of your pointer finger so you can start again.









With enough practice, you will be able to balance the coin on the side your thumb and carry it back to your starting position, rather than sliding it across the underside of your fingers.Eventually, you may be able to roll the coin back to your pointer finger from your pinky finger position, rather than sliding it underneath your hand.,"

Set the trick up for your audience.,
Take the quarter and place it in your dominant hand.,
Start rubbing the quarter on your forearm, keeping it hidden in your hand.,
Pick the quarter up with the hand that was on your chin.,
Continue rubbing your elbow (though nothing is there).,
Make the quarter reappear.",How to Do a Simple Coin Magic Trick2," Tell them that you can make a quarter change color by rubbing it hard enough on your elbow. This isn't the actual trick, but they don't have to know that. This distracts them from your actual trick so they're not as suspicious of what you're about to do.


Or you could just tell them you're going to make a quarter disappear. That's fine, too, but they may be ready to look out for any sleight of hand.

, Put your other elbow on the table and your head resting on the same hand. Instead of changing colors, the quarter is going to mysteriously ""disappear."" The elbow on the table is the one you're going to rub the quarter into.









Yes, your hand does have to rest on your chin. It should be clenched into a fist and not palm open for the purposes of the latter part of this trick.

, After a couple rubs, accidentally drop it on the table in front of you. Whoops, silly you. At this point, you may want to distract them by saying something about how you should practice more, or how quarters are naturally slippery – something that diverts their attention away from your hands.








, However, you cannot be seen doing this. You can do it one of two ways:









Pretend to hand it back to the rubbing hand and resume rubbing. Just do a fake switch very, very quickly.
Scoop the quarter up with your dominant hand, but let it drop into your non-dominant hand underneath the table. This is more about timing and less about hiding, like the above method.

, This time your rubbing hand has nothing in it. Rub for a few seconds, telling your audience that something strange is happening. The quarter isn't changing colors...the quarter is...disappearing. You can then reveal your hand to be empty.


If people want to check the other hand for the quarter, you can drop it down your collar before showing them that that hand is also empty.

, The trick can end at the last step, or you can magically make the quarter reappear. You can do this any number of ways, from scratching your head with your non-dominant hand, acting as if it appears from underneath your hair, ""taking it"" from someone else's clothes, or simply ""coughing"" it up. Whatever you fancy.









If you want to be clever about it, wait a while until people have forgotten about the trick. Then mysteriously the quarter reappears. Oh, so that's where it went. Huh. You had no idea. Funny, that.

Find a coin that's not identical on both sides.,
Practice doing coin flips and predicting which side it lands on.,
Find a friend and take turns ""guessing"" how the coin will land.,
Manipulate the coin in your hand.",How to Do a Simple Coin Magic Trick3," A 10p coin is a good example of this. If you're not sure if any of your country's currency has qualifying coinage, sit down and study them. You may find one has thicker ridges on one side, or identifiable engraving. Make sure you can identify the sides with your eyes closed.









You may be able to get away with making a scratch on one side, but if the other person sees it, they may wind up suspicious and figure out your trick. It's better to use a coin with no obvious damage.

, Now that you know what each side feels like, you'll be able to predict how it lands when you do a coin flip. It's all in the manner of catching it and turning it over in your hands. You just have to make sure the coin goes across your fingertips before you make the ""prediction.""









Take some time to practice flipping it, sensing what side it's on, and exposing it in one swift, natural movement. That second you take to assess the coin shouldn't be visible to an unsuspecting audience.

, Let them toss it around a few times, showing them that it's not a special or trick coin. Then, ask them to guess which side it'll land on as you flip it. Throw the coin up and catch it, but don't put it on your wrist yet. Just before you put it on your wrist, do it slower than usual – feel the indentation on the side facing down (which you are currently able to feel with your thumb and nothing else as it's facing upwards if you opened you palm).









You are able to manipulate the coin in your hand to land on the side you want. So call it 5 minutes beforehand, 10 seconds beforehand, or right as you turn it over – and you'll always be right.

, Before you put it on your wrist, turn it to the side you want it to be and place it in such a way that it will be exposed facing the direction you guessed. You'll have to be quick, practice makes perfect. After you flip the coin (or evaluate that you don't have to) you know it's the side you wanted it to be and place it. That's it.









The beauty of this trick is that you can do it over and over and over – unlike many other tricks that require anonymous set-up.
However, you can't do it when someone else does it. Tell them that you need to get a good read on the coin and you can only do this when you have physical contact with the coin.

Get something cloth-like, a penny, and a piece of double-sided tape.,
Take your cloth and show it to the audience.,
Stick the penny in the center of the cloth, tape side up.,
Fold the corners in, starting with the taped corner.,
Reveal the empty cloth by unfolding the corners, making sure your finger is on the penny.",How to Do a Simple Coin Magic Trick4," In private, put a piece of double-sided tape on one corner of your cloth. Make sure the penny will stick onto it.









For the cloth, you can use a piece of paper, a rag, or a paper towel. It doesn't have to be a penny, but the penny is a good, average size.
The smaller the piece of tape, the better (it'll be less obvious should you not be skilled in sleight of hand) – however, you risk the penny not sticking to it when the trick is in full gear.

, Keep the double-sided tape bit concealed and facing you. For all your audience knows, it's just a regular paper towel (or whatever it is you're using).









Be careful putting your finger over the tape – you don't want to remove the adhesive from the tape with the oils from your fingers before the trick even begins.

, Show it to your audience. It's just a regular penny inside a paper towel, right? Right. Well, if you make sure your hand is blocking the piece of tape from view.









The flimsier the cloth, the better. This way when you show the center of the cloth with the penny, the sides naturally fall down, away from view.

, One by one, fold them all in. In this little pocket you've created, you're going to make the coin disappear. But first, ask a person in the audience to feel the coin is still there. It will be, arousing no suspicion.









Keep the corners folded in as the person touches it. However, encourage them to touch it on both sides. As long as they don't move the cloth, your trick should go off without a hitch.

, And then presto! Show the empty cloth, towel, or paper to your audience. Wiggle it around, holding it by the same taped corner. Where did it go?









Remember: if someone asks you how you did it, just say, ""A magician never reveals his secrets!""

Reverse the action.",How to Make a Coin Disappear1," For this trick, you'll need: two pieces of plain paper, a clear glass cup, a pen or pencil, scissors, clear tape, a coin, a table to perform the trick on, and a piece of cloth or fabric.


Make sure the cloth or fabric you choose is big enough to cover the glass completely when you lay it on top of the glass.;
, Place the glass top down on one of the pieces of paper. Use your pencil or pen to draw on the paper, around the top of the cup.

, Remove the glass from the paper, and then use your scissors to cut out the circle you drew in the paper. Go slowly and cut along the pencil guide as closely as possible.

, Stick small pieces of tape onto the cut out paper circle. Stick the shape onto the top of the cup, so the glass is covered with a piece of plain paper. Trim the edges with scissors so that when the glass is upside down on a bigger piece of the same plain paper, it is not noticeable.


You only need four small pieces of tape, around the edge of the circle.

, The upside down glass on the piece of paper should look like a normal glass, with nothing unusual able to be seen from a distance of a few feet.

, Have with you the other, unaltered sheet of paper, your cloth, your coin, and the glass. Put the sheet of paper on a table. Place the glass with the topside down on the paper.

, Now is when you gather your audience. Put a coin on the sheet of paper. Tell your audience you will make the coin disappear.

, Lay the cloth over the glass so that it's completely covered. The coin should still be visible somewhere else on the piece of paper.

, Grab the glass near the bottom of the upside down glass, with the fabric still covering it. Place it so that the glass lies over the coin.


This is an excellent time to distract the audience with some flourish. Try making an exaggerated gesture over the glass with your other hand as you move it.

, The paper on the bottom of the glass should have covered the coin. Your audience won't know because the paper looks the same. You have made a coin disappear!


Before you remove the cloth, you can increase the entertainment factor of the trick with some magical flourish. Use a wand, or say some made up magic words. It's up to you, so you can get creative here.

, You can do the same thing again to make the coin reappear. Just cover the glass, move it away from the coin, and remove the cloth. Now the coin has reappeared!]

,,,, For example: ""As you can see, there is nothing in this jar.""

, Then say: ""I am going to slap this coin into this jar.""

, Slap hard, making it seem as if you're attempting to push that coin right through the lid. You will need to slap hard enough that the coin falls off the Prestik and into the jar with a ping.

, Make sure to remove the coin from the lid fast enough so that the person can't see that you're also holding the original coin on the other side or that there is Prestik on that lid! Distract by shaking the jar, placing the lid in your pocket to lose the other coin and press it.


If someone wants to check the lid, be sure you've lost the other coin and peeled off the Prestic before handing the lid to them.

Make sure you know how to snap.,
Get a loose jacket or shirt.,
Start your performance.,
Pull one sleeve down.,
Turn your hand upwards.,
Place the coin.,
Snap the coin into your sleeve.,
Show how the coin has disappeared.",How to Make a Coin Disappear2," If you don't already know how to snap your fingers with one hand, you'll need to learn before learning this trick.

, Use an item of clothing with extra room in the wrist. Put the long-sleeve shirt, sweater, or jacket on.


Make sure whatever long-sleeved article of clothing you wear has long enough sleeves to partially cover your hand.

, Now is when you gather your audience. Ask your audience for a coin. In case they don't have one, make sure you have one handy.

, Discreetly pull or let fall one of your sleeves so that it is slightly covering your hand. Do this to the hand opposite of the one which you can snap best with.


It'd be wise to do some misdirection at this point, so that the audience doesn't see you purposely letting one of your sleeves cover your hand. Hold the coin in your other hand and wave it around while you talk to the audience, preparing them to see the coin disappear.

, Turn the hand with the sleeve partially covering it so that your palm faces upwards. This is the hand that will hold the coin.

, With your dominant hand, place the coin on your upturned hand. The coin should lie in the center of your palm.

, First, snap your hand above the coin a few times, close to the coin but never touching it. On your last snap, make your snapping finger hit the coin so that it flies into your sleeve.


You'll need to practice this trick a few times by yourself to make sure you can reliably flick the coin into your sleeve.

, Hold both of your hands with palms facing upward to show the audience how the coin can't be seen. Then turn both hands downwards. You can do this a few times and make a show of it, and the coin will rest in your sleeve as long as you don't tilt your arms too far downward."

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the trick.,
Start the performance.,
Place the coin on the cloth.,
Pull the coin off the cloth.,
Reveal the other coin.",How to Make a Coin Disappear3," For this trick, you'll need a piece of cloth or other fabric, two coins, and a table to perform the trick on.

, Place one of the coins on the table. Lay the cloth on top of the coin so that the coin is under the center of the cloth. The edge of the cloth needs to be flush with the edge of the table.


For this trick to work, you'll need to either have something under the table that will muffle the sound of a coin falling, like soft carpet, or a rug, or you'll need to be standing so that the hand not doing the trick can discreetly catch the coin.

, Now is the time to gather your audience. Ask the audience for a coin to borrow for the trick. If no one has one, use the other coin you brought.

, Put the coin down on the center of the cloth. Try to place it close to where the other coin beneath the cloth is, but don't worry if it's not exact.

, Start making a rubbing motion with your hand over the coin, so that your hand is making circles just above it. With each circular motion, touch the coin very gently so that your hand pulls it towards the edge of the table a few inches. Continue doing this until the coin falls of the edge.


If your table isn't over something that will muffle the sound of the coin falling, catch the coin with your other hand. You may need to practice this so that you can do it discreetly.
While you're pulling the coin off the table with each circular motion, do some misdirection with your other hand and voice to keep the audience from looking too closely at the place the coin originally was.

, Remove your hand from above the cloth to show how the coin has disappeared. Then pull the cloth off with your other hand to show the coin beneath the cloth. If you caught the coin as it fell with the other hand, do this quickly so that you can pull the cloth off with the coin still hidden in your hand."

Attach your shoes to your pants.,
Stand in front of a platform or chair.,

Land on the platform.,
Use a video camera or friend to get feedback.,
Misdirect your audience.",How to Levitate Like Criss Angel1," There are many ways to ""levitate"" a short distance off the ground, but Criss Angel's technique requires skilled misdirection techniques and practice, as well as advance preparation. There are other techniques described in their own section below, which are less impressive but easier to pull off.









Criss Angel has also ""levitated"" many feet up into the air, but in that trick he is most likely wearing a wire harness attached to a crane. The black clothing, bright sky, and carefully selected camera angles make the wires invisible.;
, Find a pair of shoes that easily slip on and off, with a little extra room in them. Use tape to attach a strong magnet inside each one. Arrange the magnets so your shoe heels stick together firmly when you bring your feet together.









You can use alternate methods of attaching the magnets, such as slitting a hole in the interior side of your shoes and inserting the magnets into the pocket.
Try asking for rare earth magnets or other strong magnets at a home improvement store or online.

, This works best with slightly baggy pants. Cut a slit starting well above the knee, and extending most of the way down your leg. You will need to be able to lift your foot out of your shoe and through this slit in order to perform this trick, without anyone behind you noticing.








Use dark pants to make the slit less obvious, and wear long underwear, tights, or tight pants underneath that blend in with the pants' color.
If the slit is very obvious, extend it further downward, then pinch the lower end of the slit and bring it over so the two halves of the pant leg overlap slightly. Sew this material together at the bottom of the slit.

, The shoes and pants should hang sturdily, even when you are not wearing them. This can be done with tape, but sewing the pants leg to the shoe may be less noticeable.









Use thread that blends in with the color of the pants.

, Although Criss Angel always seems to simply be standing in front of a chair, he's actually using it as a very important prop. Start practicing with low platforms, that you can easily step onto with minimal foot movements. When facing the platform, your back should be facing the audience.








, Once these preparations are complete, you are ready to levitate. You've probably guessed the basic movement by now, but here it is:









Face toward the platform (away from the audience), and bring your feet together so the magnets hold your shoes together.
Slip one foot out of its shoe and through the slit in the pants leg, and place it on the platform in front of you.
Lean forward and lift your other foot in the air behind you, so you are balancing on one leg.
Hover for a couple seconds. Move your ""levitating"" feet and your arms slightly to make this look like a great effort.

, After hovering for a couple seconds, bring both shoes (attached together) onto the platform. Lift the heel of the foot you were balancing on as you do this, then bring it back down onto the toe of the empty shoe. Bend your knees as you ""land"" to make it seem like more of an impact, as though you had jumped. Once on the platform, slip your free foot back through the pants slit and into its shoe.









You can instead land back on the ground, but this is harder to pull off convincingly.Also, if you don't land on the platform, the audience may wonder why it's there, and guess how you pulled off the trick.

, Only audience members directly behind you will be fooled by this trick. While practicing, set up a video camera or recruit a friend to watch you behind you and to the left or right. Do this many times, moving the camera or friend each time, so you get a better idea of where the audience needs to stand to be fooled.








, Once you're ready to perform in front of an audience, you'll need to distract them from your legs. As with many magic tricks, good misdirection skills will make this much easier to pull off without being caught. Keep up a stream of chatter before you ""lift off,"" arch your back, throw your head back, and lift your arms in motions as though you were pushing off of the air. All of these will make the audience less likely to look at your feet while you slip your leg through the pants slit.









It usually helps if you start doing this as you're walking towards the chair.
Stress that the audience needs to stay back. Some magicians claim they might fall onto them and injure someone nearby.

Prepare your trick.,
Trace a circle around the rim of a clear drinking glass.,
Cut out this circle from the paper.,
Stick four tiny pieces of clear, double-sided tape to the rim of the glass at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.,
Line up the paper as closely as you can with the rim of the glass.,
Place the rigged drinking glass upside down on another piece of the same colored paper.,
Begin the trick.,
Drape a scarf, handkerchief, or towel over the glass.,
Move the covered glass on top of the quarter, making sure the paper circle covers the quarter completely.,
Remove the scarf with a flourish to reveal that the quarter has disappeared.",How to Make a Quarter Disappear1," This trick involves a bit of preparation that you have to do before you perform it in front of your audience.


This magic trick works by covering the top of a glass with a circular piece of paper that’s the same color as the piece of paper you'll perform the trick on.;
, Work lightly in pencil and keep the line as close as you can to the rim.


You will use this circular piece of paper to cover the mouth of your glass. When you place the glass down during the trick, it will look like the glass is just upside down on top of your paper.

, Make the cut neat and stick as closely as you can to your outline. If you have a sloppy circle, it will be more obvious.


Once you’ve cut out the paper circle, erase the line you drew. This will help your circular cutout to look more natural.
Use an Exacto knife if you have one to cut the circle. Keep your glass over the circle while you cut to ensure you get a nice, even circle.
If you don’t have an Exacto knife, you can use a pair of scissors.

, Arrange each piece so that any excess extends toward the inside of the glass.


Use scissors to cut the pieces of tape as small as possible.
You don’t want any tape sticking out on the outside of the glass. This can ruin the illusion.

, Press your glass with the tape down onto the paper circle. Your circular cutout should cover the mouth of the glass completely.


If you have any excess tape on the outside of your cutout, cut it off with your scissors.
You also want to make sure that you don’t have a lot of extra paper on the outside of your glass now that it’s taped to the rim. If you do, cut it away as well.

, The mouth of the glass should look normal as if it’s simply upside down.


You shouldn't be able to tell that there is a piece of paper taped to the rim.

, Place a quarter on the paper next to the clear drinking glass. To lend the illusion authenticity, ask an audience member for the quarter or another coin.


If you like, read aloud the year on the quarter and emphasize that the quarter must be real since it came from the audience. Show it around, give it a flip, knock it against the table to prove that it is solid.
By directing your audience’s attention to the quarter, you direct focus toward an ordinary object and give it magical weight. This misdirect also keeps your audience engaged so there is less focus on the glass.
Your glass should be on another piece of paper which is the same color, or on one piece of paper which is large enough to fit the quarter and glass.

, The purpose of draping something over your glass is to cover up your cutout.


If you want to give your audience a reason as to why you’re putting a handkerchief or scarf over the glass, you can explain how this is a magic teleporting scarf. You will use the power of this scarf to make the quarter disappear.

, As you move your glass, hold it level and don't expose the cutout paper.


Wave a magic wand, tap the base of the glass three times, or say the magic words, whatever you prefer to add more of a show to the trick.
This sort of embellishment helps to show that the disappearance happens by magic.

, If you want, you can say that you will bring the quarter back. Place your scarf over your glass again and summon the quarter back.


Simply remove your covered glass to reveal the quarter.
If you didn’t read out the year of the quarter at the beginning of the trick, you can pull out another quarter from behind someone’s ear.

Stand away from the audience.,
Put your heels together and your toes apart.,
Pretend to make a great effort.,
Stand on your right toes only.,
Bend your knees as you land.",How to Levitate Like Criss Angel2," This levitation trick is much simpler, though less impressive. All you'll be doing is standing on your toes, from a carefully chosen angle. The audience should be at least 8–10 feet (2.5–3 meters) away, behind you at roughly a 45º angle.








Make sure the audience stays back. If they're antsy, demand space and make a big deal of ""searching for the right spot.""
This trick is unlikely to succeed without practicing first. Use a video camera or friend to help you figure out the right angle and control your movements.

, Arrange your feet so your audience can see our entire left foot and the heel of your right foot. The tip of your right foot should not be visible, due to the angle of your body and the left foot placed between you and the audience.








, Pump your arms up, grunt, or bend your knees. The more you get into your body motions, the more you help your audience convince itself.








, With a final effort, ""jump"" off the ground an inch or two and hover. In reality, all you're doing is bending your right foot and standing on the toes. Your left foot should stay flat and lift completely off the ground. If your angle is well-chosen, the audience will only see the parts of your feet that are ""hovering"" off the ground.








, After a few seconds, bring your feet down and bend your knees and ankles as you ""land,"" as though you dropped from a significant distance.

Dress it up a bit with by bending your knees slightly.",How to Levitate Like David Blaine," Make sure that your audience is at a 45-degree angle while watching you.This trick relies on you positioning yourself so that your audience can only see one of your feet.
The trick works because your audience will only be able to really see the foot nearest to the audience. With the right angle, the other foot is mostly blocked from view, except for maybe the heel.
This trick works best with a small audience. If there are too many people you might not be able to find a good angle.;
, You need to make sure that nothing in your area is going to expose the illusion of your levitation.


Make sure there are no reflective surfaces, like a mirror, that would show the side of your body you are hiding from the audience.
It’s best to stand a few feet away from a wall or corner. Or, outside in an open space.

, The closer your audience is to you, the harder it will be to hide your back foot.


Stand about 8-10 feet away from everyone to achieve the best illusion.
If the audience is too close, then someone might have a viewing angle that exposes the fact that your back foot is still on the ground.

, Place your feet together or leave about 2 centimetres (0.79 in) if space between.


Giving yourself a bit of space between your feet might help you with balancing.
Make sure to line up your toes and heels. You don’t want one foot more forward than the other.

, Slightly shift your weight to the foot hidden from the audience.You will be balancing on this leg, but the trick is to do so without being obvious. Otherwise, the illusion of floating will be ruined. As you shift your weight feel free to explain that you are about to perform a levitation. By talking to your audience, you can divert attention to your face and off of your feet.
You can be as creative as you want when explaining your levitation. Perhaps you spin a tale of studying Buddhism in a monastery in the mountains. Through your meditation, you learned the art of levitation.

, Don’t lift your foot just yet. Raising your arms will give you an upward motion that will make it look like you are about to float.


By raising your arms slowly before lifting your feet, you draw your audience’s focus up and away from your feet. You also start building suspense.
Move your arms slowly and feel free to go up and down as if you’re trying to draw air upward. Think of this motion like a bird flapping its wings in slow motion.
Let your upper body rise and fall with your arms for more effect.

, Slowly begin to raise the foot a little off the ground to begin floating. You can start to raise it and then put it back down for more suspense, or if you need to adjust your balance.
Raise your front foot about 1 inch (25 mm) off the ground. If you raise it too high you will expose your back foot and ruin the illusion.
As you raise your foot, angle the edge of it facing the audience down slightly to keep a cover over your back foot.
Even though you will be wearing shoes, extend and point your toes upward.

, As you balance and raise your audience facing foot a little higher, come off the heel of your back foot.


Try to balance on the outside edge of your back foot, near the ball.
Raise the toes of your back foot as well.
By raising your heel and toes you allow space underneath most of your back foot. This will help the illusion to be more convincing, especially if the audience has any view of both feet.

, Balancing on such a small part of your foot may cause you to wobble and the longer you hold the levitation, the more the illusion will fade.


This trick has the biggest effect when it’s over quickly. You want to show your audience that you can float, but you don’t want to give anyone enough time to get a really good look at what you’re doing.
Perform the trick for maybe 5-10 seconds before coming down.

, Begin lowering your arms before you put your foot down to divert your audience’s attention away from your feet.


Just as you did you when you were starting your levitation, move your arms down and up slightly as if you’re floating down.
Keeping your arms out will also help you keep your balance and not put your foot down too quickly.

, As you begin to lower your front foot you can also plant your back foot more firmly on the ground for support.


Keep your arms moving and don’t rush.
You want to slowly lower your foot rather than just stomping it down to keep the illusion up. Slowly lowering it will make you like you’re controlling your descent instead of just shifting your weight back.

, When you make contact with the ground you can then make bend your knees and give your landing some impact.


Hitting the ground with a tiny bit of force will give the illusion of landing back on the ground rather than just putting your foot down.
Giving your landing some weight will also help you disguise shifting your balance back.
Note that after you are done levitating and have both feet on the ground, slowly lower your toes while bringing down your arms.

Grab a quarter.,
Place the quarter in your hand.,
Hold out both your hands, palms up.,
Make the quarter disappear.,
Reveal that the quarter has vanished.",How to Make a Quarter Disappear2," You can either use one of your own quarters or ask your audience for one. Though because this trick is fast, it’s often easier to use your own quarter.


This is a great street magic trick, party trick, or quick opening trick to get your audience warmed up.

, It doesn’t matter which hand you place the quarter in. Put the quarter in your hand and position it so that it rests on the pad of your middle finger closest to your palm.


Placing the quarter where your middle finger and palm meet is an ideal place because you can easily hold the quarter in place with your thumb from this position.

, Hold both of your hands out to show your audience the quarter resting in one hand with the other hand empty.


At this point you want to be talking to the audience. This trick moves fast and the more you can do to distract your audience, the easier time you will have misdirecting as you make the quarter disappear.
You can grab the quarter and show it to the audience, explaining that it is an ordinary quarter. Just make sure to place it back in that spot on your middle finger before you move into the next part of the trick. You can continue to explain that the magic lies in your hands, not the object.

, This part will take some practice to make it look convincing and smooth. You will bring your empty hand under the hand holding your quarter. As you move your empty hand in, you will turn the quarter hand over as if to drop the quarter into your empty hand. However, you will keep the quarter in your original hand by holding it in place with your thumb. As you turn over the hand with the quarter, start to make a fist with your empty hand, as if you’re catching the quarter. To make it look more convincing, close your hand so your fingers extended to the bottom of your palm. Don’t make a small, tight fist, this won’t look as realistic.
Move your hands in opposite directions from one another after you “transfer” the coin. The coin is still in your original hand, but the audience will think it’s in your other hand. To keep the focus on your hand, bring it up toward your face or about eye level with the audience. Simultaneously palm the quarter in your original hand and move it down to your side. , As you bring up the hand that the audience thinks the quarter is in, you can do a number of little flourishes to show that you have disappeared the coin.


You can tap your knuckles a few times with a magic wand, or even a pen.
You can also squeeze your fist really tight. Rub your fingers together as you slowly open your hand, as if you dissolved the coin.
Another option is to blow into your fist and open your hand quickly.
As you are doing this, you can either hide the quarter in a pocket or palm it. If you palm it, you can pull it out of someone’s ear as a second part to the trick.
If you aren't going to make the quarter reappear, put it in your pocket. Then you can show that it's not in your other hand.

Focus the cosmic energy.,
Levitate!,
Hold the position for 2 or 3 seconds, then let yourself down.",How to Perform the Balducci Levitation," The key to making this work is to convince people ahead of time that you're going to levitate. Ask people to stand back, as there is an inherent risk of falling during levitation, especially if your concentration is broken. Say this with authority, and people will want to believe you!






;
, Obviously, you are not going to actually float in the air, but the key to any good magic is that you set the expectations of your audience. Ask for a volunteer to come look for wires or gimmicks of any kind—which, of course, they will not find!








, When the volunteer returns to the group, stand in front of your audience, facing away, with your body positioned at about a 45-degree angle from them. Turn so that they can see your left foot and heel, and the back of your right heel.









If they ask you to face them, tell them you can't, for fear of losing concentration.

, Levitating is hard work: you're defying physics and the laws of gravity! Show that you are concentrating, trying to focus your energy so that you can pull yourself up into the air.









You can put your arms out, palms down, like you're about to push something down.
Take a deep breath, as if you're filling yourself with lighter-than-air energy.

, As you feel the universal energy course through your body, push down with your hands as if you're trying hard to lift yourself. At the same time, use your hidden right toes to slowly push yourself up a few inches, keeping your heels together.









Remember to keep the heel of your free foot (the one facing the audience) level with the ground. This helps the illusion of level levitation.

, You can use a number of methods to de-levitate:









Reverse your hands so they're palms-up, and push against the sky to push yourself back down.
Snap your arms together, and ""fall"" back to earth, bending your knees as if you have fallen from a greater height.
If you're not using your arms as props, nod your head briefly and ""fall"" back to earth.
Exhale clearly, as if you're deflating yourself, and settling back down.

Gather your materials.,
Attach the string to the back of your ear.,
Prepare the other end of the string to be applied to your object.,
Discreetly place the other end of the string onto your object.,
Use your hand to move the string up and down, levitating your object.,
Discreetly detach the string from your object.",How to Levitate an Object1," This trick works best with a playing card or business card. But it can also be performed with a dollar. Get some wax or a similar adhesive like clear double-sided tape, and thin string. If you don’t have a lot of time to prepare for this trick, or are going to levitate something like a dollar, wax is better to use as tape is harder to remove from the object. The best type of string to use is an elastic string or thread which will easily stretch. You can find these threads in magic shops or online.
You are going to attach one end of the string to the back of your ear and the other to your object.
Make sure you cut the string so it’s long enough to easily stretch from behind your ear to your finger. ;
, Using your wax or a piece of tape, fix one end of the string to your adhesive. Then stick it behind your ear.


If you are using tape, place the tip of string on the tape, then wrap the string around the tape. Fold the tape over so that your string is firmly attached.

, Using the wax or a small piece of clear double-sided tape, connect it to the other end of the string. Attach this end of the string to one of your fingers so you can easily stick it to your object when you’re ready.


It’s easiest to use the hand that is on the opposite side of where you placed the string behind your ear. For example, if you placed the string behind your right ear, use your left hand, and vice versa.
Only apply the adhesive to one finger. Because you will be handling an object like a dollar or card, you want to keep most of your fingers free of wax. Doing this will allow you to hold the object without having it stick to your hand.

, If you are using a card, crumpled piece of paper, or a dollar you can transfer the string from your finger to the object as you explain that you can make the object levitate.


This part can be a little tricky as the end of your string is sticking to your finger currently. Transfer the string and adhesive from your finger to the object. Hold the object in place with your free hand as you pull away with the hand that had the string.
For example, if you are levitating a card, place the tip of the string with your tape or wax onto one side of your card. Slide your finger away to cause the string to stick to the card and not your finger.
If you are levitating a crumpled up object such as paper or a dollar, Crumple the object around the string and adhesive. Then remove your finger. Make sure the string is now sticking to the object and not your hand.

, With the hand which is on the same side of your body as your string, place the string between two of your fingers. Move your hand to catch the string making the object appear to float in the air between your hands.


You can use your hand which is touching the string to manipulate your object's movements. Think of it like directing a puppet on strings.
Place your other hand under your object to make it look like you are using the energy between your hands to make the object float.

, If someone gave you an object that you will return, such as a dollar, you need to detach it from the string.


Uncrumple the object such as the dollar and as you do so, either pull the tape off or pull the string away if you used wax.
If you did use wax, rub the area a bit to disperse the wax and wear down the adhesive property. Your audience will most likely not notice any leftover wax on the dollar.
If you used tape, you will have to quickly peel the tape off your object.

Get two quarters.,
Place your “empty” hand, the one with the palmed quarter face down on top the spectator’s hand.,
Place the coin on top of your hand.,
Transfer the coin.,
Reveal that the coin has passed through your hand.",How to Make a Quarter Disappear3," For this trick, you need to do a little bit of prep. You may also want to use a small piece of clear double sided tape or magician’s wax. In one hand, you will palm a quarter, hiding it. With your other hand, you will be showing your audience another quarter.


Before going in front of your audience, place your tape or a small bit of wax in the palm of the hand you will slap the quarter with. If you are skilled and quick enough you don't need to do this. The adhesive helps the quarter stick to your palm.
Explain to your audience that you will place the quarter on the top of your hand. You will then magically transfer it through your hand into a spectator's palm.
As you are explaining this, ask a spectator to hold a hand out palm up.

, As you do this, tell your spectator to really push up into your hand. If you place your hand on top of your spectator’s quickly and really press into it, your spectator won’t feel the coin that is there.


You can even grab the spectator’s hand and position it with your other hand to further distract.
Tell your audience that you can transfer the coin from the top of your hand into the spectator’s palm.
Tell your spectator to concentrate very hard and envision the quarter in your spectator’s palm.

, You will now take the coin that the audience has been aware of and place it on the top of your hand. The other coin is already in the spectator’s palm.


Explain that by slapping the top of your hand hard enough, you can magically transfer the quarter through your hand into your spectator’s.

, Slap the top of your hand quickly. You need to hit your hand hard enough that the coin will stick to the adhesive in your palm. Quickly palm the quarter and bring your hand away.


Hide the quarter in your pocket so you can reveal that your hand is empty. After you reveal that the coin traveled through your hand into your spectator’s palm, you can show your other hand is empty.
If you are skilled enough, you don’t have to use an adhesive. You can simply palm the quarter as you slap your hand down. However, this is much harder and requires plenty of practice.

, Slowly take your hand away from your spectator’s to reveal that the quarter has magically passed through your hand.


If you want, you can show that there’s nothing in your other hand as well.

Get an elastic string known as a loop.,
Grab a dollar or other small light object.,
Place the object in the same hand as your loop.,
Bring your free hand over and on top of the object.,
Position the object on top of your loop.,
Slowly separate your hands.,
Grab the object and release your loop.",How to Levitate an Object2," You can also use any thin elastic string and make it into a loop yourself. You can purchase pre-made loops or create your own. It’s essentially an elastic band. If you make your own, simply tie two ends together into a small knot to form a loop.
Start with your loop around your wrist like a bracelet. Or, if it feels more comfortable to you, position your loop around your index finger and the outside of your thumb.
This is a great method for doing up-close street magic on the spot.

, You can ask a spectator for a dollar and levitate it without much prep.


Because your loop is so thin and light, you will need a light object that won’t break the thread.

, This will allow you to hook the loop with your other hand while you wave it over the object, preparing it to levitate. Begin explaining that you’re going to levitate the object using the energy created from your hands.

, You can begin to rub your hands together around the object, and while you do so, get your finger under your loop.


You want to grab the loop with your other hand and begin to stretch it.
With the loop going around both hands you now have a small platform to balance the object on.

, As you hook your loop around your other finger, slide it forward so it’s stretching across your palm. Use your fingers from both hands to get the object on top of the string.


This will allow you to quickly balance the object on top of your loop, making it look like it's levitating.

, Begin to slowly move your hands apart. You can show the object levitating in the space between your hands.


Be careful to move your hands slowly so as not to break the loop or cause your object to fall.

, You don’t want to levitate the object for too long and give the audience a chance to see the loop. So as you grab the object, release the loop from your hand. It will snap back to the hand you had it wrapped it around. You can now let your audience inspect the object to see that it is ordinary.

Lay the person you're going to lift flat on the ground, with their arms crossed over their chest.,
Make one of the lifters the leader.,
Clasp your hands together.,
Perform a test lift.",How to Play Light as a Feather1," You may want to put blankets or pillows underneath them, both for their comfort and their protection in case they are dropped.The lifters should kneel or sit beside the liftee, preferably with one person at each shoulder and one person at each knee. If you have a fifth person, they should kneel at the liftee’s head.;
, This is usually the party host, but it can be anyone who knows the game well. They are in charge of guiding the group through the trick, so they must know how to do the trick from start to finish.


It helps if the leader is a bit theatrical. The leader has to tell the group about the spooky, supernatural origins of the game, and it's much more fun if they really sell it!

, Release your two pointer fingers, which will be the only fingers you use to lift. The lifters should then place both fingers underneath the liftee’s shoulders or knees, depending on where they are seated. If there is a fifth lifter at the head, they can place one finger beneath either shoulder.

, The leader should instruct everyone to give it a trybut there should be no countdown or special set-up. Simply attempt to lift. You probably won’t be able to move the lift very high, if at all. They will feel too heavy to lift with just two fingers.At this point, the leader should tell the group that it isn't working because the liftee hasn't become ""possessed"" yet. Because the group hasn't performed they mystical chant yet, the spirits have not been summoned. Now, it's time to get serious.

Find the magic spot on your palm.,
Turn your hand palm down.,
Practice popping the coin out of your hand with the muscle pass.,
Adjust the coin's placement.,
Perform the muscle pass.",How to Levitate a Coin1," The muscle pass is one of the most impressive sleights and one of the few ways to make a coin look like it’s levitating. This is because it involves developing the muscles in your palm. The trick is done by using the pads on your palm near your thumb to shoot the coin up into the air. Open your dominant hand and study your palm. Notice the padded area at the base of your thumb. This is the magic spot where you will place the coin.
Grab a larger coin like a half-dollar or even a poker chip. A quarter will be too small in most cases.
Push the coin into your palm with your other hand. Then move your thumb over the coin. Notice how the muscle and padded part of your hand below your thumb begins to cover the coin. Play around with the position of the coin in your palm until you feel comfortable with the coin being held in place by the padding on your palm.;
, With the coin in your hand, turn it over. See if the coin falls out or stays in your palm. Spread your fingers out slowly until the coin falls.


Adjust the coin in your palm until you can turn your hand over with your fingers uncurled slightly so your hand looks natural.
This is known as palming a coin and is the basic ability you will build on to perform a muscle pass. Likewise, practice picking up your coin off a table by palming it. This will probably be very difficult at first. But it’s a great way to develop your muscles in your palm.

, This will probably take weeks to get the hang of. The muscle pass is a very advanced trick, and practicing it can hurt. With the coin placed in the sweet spot of your palm, push it down. You can either use the fingers on your other hand to push the coin into your palm or use your middle and ring finger on your hand to push the coin in. Using the fingers on the hand that is holding the coin will make this process look more natural.
Bring your thumb over the coin. Here you are moving your thumb so the padded, muscled area below your thumb goes over the coin. Try to keep you fingers from curling over. If your fingers are curled over the coin, it will hit your fingers and not pop up.
Snap your thumb back and down. This motion is what will eventually cause the coin to fly upward.

, Reposition the coin if you feel like you’re not getting enough grip on the coin as you move your thumb back. It will take some time to find the best place to put the coin.


The muscle pass will take a lot of practice to accomplish. But don’t practice too much. Once your hand starts to hurt or gets red, stop trying to pop up the coin and take a break. If you keep at it, you’ll eventually get the coin to fly up.

, To perform the muscle pass trick, you will produce a coin and explain that you can magically float it up out of your one hand into the other. Don’t explain the mechanics of the trick as that will hurt the illusion. Don’t say that you will perform a muscle pass. Instead, say that you can float or levitate the coin upward.
Hold your other hand over the hand with the coin and wiggle your fingers for effect.
As you do this, make sure the coin is pressed into your palm in the right spot with your middle fingers.
If you want, you can say some magic words. Then, flip your thumb back and perform the muscle pass.
Catch the coin in your other hand.

Ask for three volunteers.,
Give each volunteer a slip of paper.,
Tell each person to write down a name.,
Announce that you will draw the name of the dead person.,
Draw the name.",How to Read Minds (As a Magic Trick)1," This is a good trick to perform in front of a crowd, since you'll need three volunteers to do it correctly. Be sure to get exactly three; the trick won't resonate as well with two, and it simply won't work with four. It's best to choose people you don't know well, so the audience won't think you planned the trick together before the show., This part of the trick is very important. Take a sheet of paper and tear it into thirds. Give the first third, which will have one straight side and one jagged side, to the first person. Give the second piece, which will have two jagged sides, to the second person. Give the third piece, which will also have one straight side and one jagged side, to the third person.


This trick can't be conducted properly unless you rip one piece of paper into thirds, so make sure you prepare for it by having a large sheet of paper on hand.
Pay attention to the person who has the piece that is ripped on both sides. This piece of paper is the key to the trick.

, The first person should write down the name of a person who is alive. The second person (with the double-ripped paper) should write down the name of a person who is dead. The third person should write down the name of a person who is alive.

, Make a show of leaving the room or turning your back while the volunteers write the names on their slips of paper. Without your touching them, the volunteers should place their slips of paper in a hat or box.

, Tell the volunteers to concentrate hard on the name they wrote down. Hold the hat or box above your head, or have someone else hold it, so it's clear that you can't see inside. Tell the audience that you already know what the name of the dead person is, and look knowingly at the volunteer who wrote it down, as though you're reading his or her mind. Finally, put your hand in the hat and feel around for the slip of paper that has two rough edges. Draw it out with a flourish and read the name to everyone's amazement.

Grab two straws.,
Place the ends of both straws between your teeth, not touching the actual plastic.,
Slide the paper sleeves up and down a few times, then quickly slide the paper off each straw.,
Grab the straws in each hand.,
Pick up your dollar.,
Slowly move your hands apart.",How to Levitate an Object3," This trick requires you to do a little bit of prep, but can be performed easily at a restaurant or bar. This trick is less of an illusion where your audience won't see you prep. Because you won't have much time in between prep and actually performing the trick, it's more of a science trick.
You need two straws that are still in the paper wrappers.
Tear the wrapper toward one end of the straw, but don’t remove the wrapper. Your straws will still be in the wrappers, but you will have separated a long portion of the sleeve. This longer sleeve will be used to create friction. The small bit of paper left on the other end stays in place to prevent you from touching the plastic straw before you need to.

, You will have a long sleeve of paper wrapper which you can now slide up and down on the straw to create a static charge.


Pinch the ends of the straws between your teeth, making sure that you don’t get the paper wet.
Slide the long sleeves of paper up and down on the straws several times to build a charge.
Make sure to pinch the end of the straws firmly, using the tip of the wrapper as a barrier between your teeth and the plastic.

, You will now have two straws that are holding a static charge. These straws will act like rods which you will grab to transfer the current of energy to your hands. With the straws still pinched between your teeth, slide the long sleeves up and down on the straws a few times before sliding the paper off completely. The up and down motion of the paper on the plastic creates the charge.
You will now have two straws which have a static charge.

, With the straws full of static charge, you want to grab each straw and close your fists around the plastic.


Doing this will transfer the static charge from the straws to your hands.
Hold the straws for about three seconds. Then let go and drop both straws.
Make sure to not touch anything except the dollar you will levitate.

, It’s best to already have your dollar placed on the table so that it is hanging off the edge of the table slightly. Pick the dollar up by pinching it between your two middle fingers.


You need to grab the dollar so one finger is on the top and one on the bottom.
Raise your hands up, making sure not to touch anything other than the dollar.

, Your hands will still be charged so when you slowly move your fingers away from one another the dollar will levitate in the air.


Keep your hands close to the dollar with one hand above it and the other below.
The dollar will levitate because of the transfer of static electricity moving between your hands.
It will only last for a few seconds before the charge dissipates.

Prepare to lift again.,
Place your hands over the head of the person being lifted.,
Repeat in unison, ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board.” You may have also heard the variation, “Light as a feather, strong as an ox.” Together, repeat this over and over again.,
Lift the person while continuing to chant.",How to Play Light as a Feather2," Once you’ve established how difficult it is to lift the person, it’s time to employ some simple ""mind over matter"" tricks to increase your strength- or at least, increase the mystical nature of the game! This is also a good time for the leader to explain the concept behind the game.


The leader can be creative with the explanation. For example, the leader can explain that the person’s body will be overtaken by the spirit of a deceased person, turning corpse-like and levitating.Make it as creepy or funny as you’d like!
Dimming the lights and adding candles can add to the supernatural quality of the trick.

, Hands should alternate so that each persons hands are separated by another persons. Press down on the liftee’s head- lightly, of course! The leader should tell the group that they are opening the liftee's body to supernatural influences with this step, and at this time the outside spirits are entering the body and making it light.Remove your hands from the stack and place them again under the liftee.

, The liftee should be perfectly still, with their eyes closed. As you chant, slowly start to lift.

, This time around, they should lift with ease. Then, slowly lower them back to the ground as you continue to recite the words. The leader should command the “spirits” to exit their body and voila- you’ve completed the trick!"

Make the coin “vanish”.,
Pick up the invisible coin to levitate it.,
Grab the invisible coin.,
Make the coin reappear.",How to Levitate a Coin2," This trick isn’t as much about levitating an actual coin as it is about the illusion of making the coin invisible, then making it reappear.


To begin the trick, you will need to make the coin disappear from your hand. It’s easier to learn with a larger coin like a half-dollar, but you can use a quarter or other similarly large coin.
Using a finger palm vanish, pretend to transfer the coin from one hand to the other. The finger palm works like a regular palm, except you keep the coin in place with your two middle fingers. Hold the coin in place between your fingers and the first joints closest to your palm. This part of the trick is similar to a French Drop where you pretend to transfer the coin from one hand to the other while palming the coin in your original hand.
While finger palming the coin, bring your empty hand up toward your eye level while you lower the hand with the coin. Rub your fingers together with your empty hand to make it look like you’ve made the coin “vanish”.
However, describe to your audience that you’ve simply made the coin invisible. Open your hand to reveal the invisible coin.

, Here, you can explain how in order to levitate the coin, you have to make it invisible so that it no longer weighs too much to float.


Pretend to pick up the coin as if it were there. The next few parts of this trick will require you to be convincing with your space object work.
Also note that you are picking up the invisible coin with the hand that is actually holding the coin. Keep your coin in finger palm position, and always angle your hand so the audience can’t see the actual coin.
Before doing this trick, practice actually picking up your real coin. Notice how the weight feels in your hand, how your fingers are positioned, and how your hand moves.
Pretend as though you were picking up a coin now. Remember what it looked like when you actually picked up a coin. Don’t pinch your fingers together. Even though a coin is thin, there would still be a tiny amount of space in between your fingers when holding one. Remember the weight of the coin as well.
Place the invisible coin in the air and let go. Describe that you can simply put the invisible coin in the air where it will hang until you need it.
Keep in mind when you do this that you will be finger palming the actual coin. As you place the coin to hang in the air, angle your hand so your audience can see the open palm, but keep the coin covered by holding it in between your fingers.

, Once you’ve let the invisible hanging coin part of the trick settle in, grab the coin out of the air with your empty hand.


Take the invisible coin, paying attention to your space object work, with the hand that you’re not palming the coin in.
Raise the hand with the real coin in it up to meet your empty hand.
As you do this, keep the coin in your finger palm but tilt your hand just enough so the audience can see that your palm is empty.
Describe that whenever you need the coin back, all you have to do is make it reappear.

, As you place the invisible coin into the palm of the hand that is holding the actual coin, begin to curl your fingers over. As you begin to make a fist, let the coin drop out of the finger palm. It will fall over the index finger of your other hand.
With your thumb, pinch the coin in between your thumb and forefinger as your other hand curls around into a fist.
You will now be holding the coin in the same hand that you used to grab the invisible coin out of the air with.
Open your hand to reveal that the coin has become visible again.

Grab a novelty sized coin.,
Place your thumbs and fingers at the edges of the coin.,
Extend your arms.,
Practice the levitating coin effect until you can achieve it without fumbling.",How to Levitate a Coin3," This trick employs an oversized novelty coin. You will make it appear that the coin is levitating within the space made between your hands when the hands are loosely cupped together. This trick is harder to pull off when close to your audience as you will be touching the coin at all times.


The size of the coin is important, as it must be sufficiently large to still be visible behind the fingers.
To perform the effect, pick up the coin with either hand.
Bring the other hand to the coin and hold it with both hands, thumbs facing you.

, Make sure the pads of your thumbs are resting on the left and right edges of the coin.


Your thumbs should be pressing inwards against the coin, holding it up.
Your fingers should be curled, with the fingertips merely resting lightly against the front of the coin.
Make sure that only your thumbs are actually holding the coin up.

, You can help the illusion by extending your arms slightly and then pulling back toward you. The constant movement will help to distract the audience.


Slowly straighten your fingers. Extend your fingers toward each other. The right and left fingertips should be about 1 inch (2.54 cm) away from each other.
Keep your fingers as close together as possible. You want to use your fingers as a sort of barrier so that the spectator can't see your thumbs holding the coin.
As you straighten your fingers, also move your thumbs up and down in very small movements. It will appear as though the coin is hovering in the air between your fingers.

, This might take some time to make look as real as possible.


Once you have the handling of the coin down, observe yourself performing it in front of a mirror. Check to make sure that you're considering the spectator's perspective.
Ensure that the coin can be properly seen. Also, practice it under the conditions that you will display it. If you plan to sit at a table, practice it at a table as you will be closer to your audience.
Practice holding the coin with the pads of your thumbs so that it doesn’t look quite like you’re holding the coin in between each one.
See if you can get the coin to spin or rotate without dropping it to enhance the illusion. This will take some practice. Use your fingers to block the view of your thumbs.

Study posture.,
Identify positive body language.,
Identify negative body language.,
Spot fake smiles.,
Read a person's eyes.,
Read a person's hands.,
Read gestures and touch.,
Read ears.",How to Read a Person1," Posture can provide many clues about what a person is really thinking. How they sit and how they lean tells a story. Between 70 and 90 percent of communication can be non-verbal. If a person leans away from you, they are probably feeling stress.
If they are leaning back as if they are relaxed, it can be an indicator that they feel powerful and in control. Poor posture can mean that a person lacks self esteem or harbors negative feelings. ;
, Experts divide body language into positive and negative movement categories. You can identify whether a person feels positively toward you by spotting positive body language moves. Not crossing arms or legs indicates positive feelings.
Looking away, as if shy, is a sign of positive emotion toward you.
Leaning toward you is a positive body language movement.

, Certain cues should indicate to you that the person may harbor negative feelings toward you or themselves.


Crossing arms or legs is a movement that shows wariness.
Pointing feet away or toward an exit means a person may have negative feelings.
Looking to the side or leaning away is a sign of negative body language.
When a person touches their nose, eyes or back of neck, it can indicate negative feelings.

, There are signs that indicate a person's smile is not genuine. In a genuine smile, you will see the wrinkles around a person's eyes. In a fake smile, you often won't. Smiling authentically uses more facial muscles. The laugh lines or wrinkles around the eye are caused by the orbicularis oculi, and are muscles activated in genuine smiles. Fast smiles are less likely to be genuine. Fake smiles are sometimes bigger because the person is trying to stretch their face.

, The eyes are very expressive, and it's possible to tell a lot about a person if you know what to look for in them.


Dilated pupils indicate interest. Power gazing means a person only looks into the triangle from your eyes to your forehead, meaning they are avoiding intimacy. If they look from your eyes to your mouth and down, that indicates a desire for intimacy. Looking from the eyes to the mouth only is called social gazing and shows comfort and friendship. Sustained eye contact can indicate an attempt to dominate or can give away that a person is lying.
Eye contact for two to three seconds before looking away connotes confidence. Eye contact for 1 second or less indicates evasion or insecurity. Fast blinking can be a sign a person is interested in you.
Liars will often look to the right when thinking. Some experts believe this is because they are concocting a story. Closing the eyes for a sustained period of time means a person needs time to think. , As with the eyes, the hands can give you clues about a person's personality or what they are thinking.


When a person keeps their palms down, it indicates they feel powerful. A downward palm can also be a sign that something is being rejected or stopped.
When a person keeps their palms up, it can indicate submissiveness. Upward palms also indicate giving and an offering. , What people do with their hands can give you clues about what they are thinking. Gestures are defined as physical movements that reveal emotion or opinion. When someone touches your hand briefly, it shows they want a connection to you. When a person rubs their nose, they might be lying.
If a person hides their hands, they might be hiding something from you. When a person rests their chin on their hand, they're making a decision.
Scratching the back of the neck means a person has unanswered questions.
Watch out for mirroring gestures. When a person starts to copy your expressions and gestures, it usually means they want to sell you something. Moving into personal space can be a sign of intimidation.
Raising the eyebrows means a person thinks positively about you and wants to communicate better. , Many people overlook the ears, but sophisticated face readers believe that they can give clues to personality.Small ears indicate an attention to detail and determination.
People with large ears can be objective and spiritual.
People with ears that stick out may be adventurous types who are open to trying new things.
When people have ears that are high on their head, it can indicate they are intellectual and big thinkers.

Ask audience members to call out their names.,
Write down the same name on each card.,
Write your prediction on a chalkboard or slate.,
Have a volunteer draw a name from the hat.",How to Read Minds (As a Magic Trick)2," Announce that you're writing down each name on a notecard and placing them all in a hat. At the end of the trick, you'll predict which audience member is the luckiest one in the audience, and you'll write your prediction on a chalkboard or slate. The name of the luckiest person will then by drawn from a hat by a volunteer, and it will match your prediction. If you have a large audience, you can pick the first ten people to volunteer their names; for a smaller audience, everyone can participate., When the first person calls out his or her name, write it down on a card. Write the same name when the second person calls out his or her name. Keep writing the same name on every card even though people are calling out a different name each time. Put all the cards in a hat as you finish writing on them.


Make sure no volunteers are too close to you while you're writing down the names, or they'll see what you're up to.
If you're doing the trick at a birthday party or an event to honor someone, you could also simply write down the name of the honored person on every card, to ensure that he or she is named the ""luckiest"" person there.
Instead of saying you're predicting who is the luckiest person, you could say you're predicting who will get married next, who's the most mysterious person, or who's the unluckiest person. Tailor it to the event and the people.

, After everyone is finished speaking and the cards are in the hat, write the special person's name down in large letters and show it to the audience. Announce that you know without a doubt that this person is the luckiest one in the room.

, Hold the hat above the volunteer's head and ask him or her to draw a name and announce it to the audience. People will gasp when they hear the name. Make sure you put the remaining cards away immediately so people won't see how you did the trick.

Cut a peephole in a box of cards.,
Ask an audience member to pick a card.,
Make a show of reading the volunteer's mind.,
Confirm your reading by showing the card.",How to Read Minds (As a Magic Trick)3," You just need a standard deck of cards that comes in a cardboard box. Remove the cards from the box and use a scissors to snip a small hole in one of the corners of the back of the box. Put the cards back in the box and take a look at the hole. You should be able to see the upper corner of the last card in the deck, revealing which card it is.


Come to your show with the card box already prepared. Keep the side with the hole away from the audience as you prepare to perform the trick.
If you can find a box that has a picture of a playing card printed on it, as many standard decks do, all the better - the hole will barely be visible.

, Start by having the person shuffle the cards a few times. Tell him or her to pick a card and show it to the audience while your back is turned, then place it at the bottom of the deck of cards. Hold out the box of cards, hole side facing your palm, and tell the person to put the cards into the box.


He or she will almost certainly place the cards into the box face down so that you won't be able to see the chosen card. If not, tell him or her to start over and pick a new card.

, Hold up the deck of cards, with the hole facing you, and announce that you're reading the volunteer's mind to determine what he or she picked. Look through the hole to see what the card is, then close your eyes and tilt your head toward the ceiling. Announce, I've got it! State the name of the card.

, Pull the deck of cards from the box, taking care not to show the side with the hole, and hold it up to the audience so that they can see the bottom card.

Before you perform this trick, look up the 9th word on page 108 in your dictionary.,
When you arrive at your show, ask for two volunteers.,
Ask the volunteer with the calculator to pick any three digit number.,
Ask them to reverse the number (e.g.,
Ask them to add the last two number together.,
Now ask them what the first three digits of the number are.,
Now ask the other volunteer what the last digit of the number was.,
Ask the volunteer with dictionary to stare at the ninth word down.",How to Read Minds (As a Magic Trick)4," Write this word on a slip of paper and slip it into an envelope. Put the envelope in your pocket.


Note that this is the most important part of the trick. Without carrying out this step, you will not be able to perform the trick.

, Give one the dictionary, and the other a calculator.

, The only stipulation is that no two digits can repeat. For example, he or she might choose the number 365. The digits must be different - you cannot have a number like 222.

, 563). Then, ask them to take away the bigger number from the smaller number (e.g. 563- 365= 198) Finally, ask them to reverse that number (e.g. 891).

, In our example, 198+891= 1,089. The result will always be 1,089 no matter what number you choose in the first place.

, These will always be 108. Ask the volunteer with the dictionary to turn to page 108.

, This will always be 9.

, Stare at the volunteer and make a show as if you are reading their mind, then, when you think you are ready, pull out the envelope and reveal the strip of paper. The audience will be astonished as you show the same word as the volunteer called out!

Tell the spectator to think of a number between 1 and 5.,
Ask the volunteer to multiply the number by nine, then add the two digits of the answer.,
Ask the volunteer to subtract 5 from their number.,
Tell the volunteer to find the letter in the alphabet that corresponds to that number.,
Tell the volunteer to pick a country that starts with that letter.,
Ask the volunteer to think of an animal that starts with the last letter of the country's name.,
Ask the volunteer to think of a color that starts with the last letter of the animal's name.,
Pretend to read your subject's mind.,
Act puzzled and tell your subject that you're seeing an Orange Kangaroo in Denmark.",How to Read Minds (As a Magic Trick)5," This awesome trick exploits certain common quirks in human psychology. Though you give your spectator choices that seem like they have many different possible answers, most people will guess exactly the same thing, which, at the end of the trick, you'll guess, to the likely amazement of your volunteer. Start by asking the volunteer to think of any number between 1 and 5, but not to reveal it.

, For example, if your volunteer picked the number 5, 9 × 5 = 45, so s/he will add 4 + 5 to get 9. This should be done mentally, not out loud.

, 9 - 5 = 4, so, at this point, your volunteer will have the number 4 in his or her head.

, For example, the number 1 corresponds to A, 2 to B, etc. At this point, they will have the number 4, regardless of what number they initially picked, so they will pick the letter D.

, Most of the time, people will think of the country Denmark.

, The last letter in ""Denmark"" is ""K"", and most people will associate the letter K with kangaroos.

, The last letter in ""Kangaroo"" is ""O"". Orange is the only common color that starts with O.

, Make a big show of squinting and pressing your fingers to your temples. Tell your spectator that you are searching deep in the depths of his or her psyche.

, Nine times out of ten, your volunteer will react with amazement, though occasionally you'll get someone who picks ""Koala"" or ""Djibouti"" or another answer.

Find a willing participant.,
Explain the rules of the game.,
On a piece of paper, write the word ""Carrot."",
Ask the volunteer to say the number ""six"" 10 times.,
Ask the volunteer to solve 10 math problems with the answer ""six."",
Say “Name any vegetable."",
Flip the paper over.",How to Make Someone Say Carrot," One of the most important parts of making this trick a success is finding the right person to play it on. This can be a friend, a casual acquaintance, or even a stranger. Ideally, however, you want someone who will go along with the trick, follow your directions, and generally be a ""good sport"" about things. This person should also be able to give you his/her full attention — try not to pick someone who's busy or distracted by something else."";
, Say something along the lines of the following: ""In this trick, I will show that I can see the future and predict your responses before you even think of them. In a few moments, I am going to ask you a series of questions. Answer each question as quickly as possible. I am not trying to trick you with these questions — the answer to each should be clear and straightforward. Pay attention to me only. Don't look for help from the audience. Are you ready to begin?""


Here, it's a good idea to ""ham things up"" a little. For instance, you can make a big show for the audience by saying something like: ""Ladies and gentleman, I confess that I've been deceiving you this evening. My real name is not (your name here). In fact, I am the Great Zambini, master illusionist and psychic. In a few moments, you will join me as we journey into the strange world of the paranormal...""

, Pull out a small, blank notepad, index card, or scrap of paper. Show the audience that it is a normal, ordinary object. Say to the audience something like, ""I will now use my psychic powers to predict the brave volunteer's behavior."" Write ""carrot"" on the paper but don't let anyone see what you're writing. Lay the paper face-down in front of you.


Ensure the paper is in full view your volunteer and the rest of your audience for the entire trick. You don't want to be accused of cheating after pulling off the trick.

, The volunteer should go as fast as possible while still saying ""six"" clearly. Have him/her maintain eye contact with you while counting. If your volunteer loses concentration or starts to giggle, calmly direct him/her to start over. You can even use a showy line like ""The psychic bond between us has broken. Start again.""


This trick works best if the volunteer is focusing on you completely. Ideally, you want to get the volunteer into a trance-like state from the repetitive action of saying ""six"" while staring into your eyes.

, Ask simple math problems so that your volunteer can answer them almost instantly. For example, you might ask, ""What's 1 + 5? 2 + 4? 3 + 3? 12 - 6? 6 + 0? 10 - 4..."" and so on. The important thing is that the volunteer must be able to answer the questions quickly, saying ""six"" each time.

, Don't give this question any extra importance. Just ask it quickly after the final math problem in the same tone of voice you've been using. Most of the time, the volunteer will respond with ""carrot.""It's not clear why this works. It may be that the repetition of ""six"" causes the volunteer to think of a six-letter answer, or it may simply be that carrots are the most ""obvious"" vegetable to most people, so it's the first one they think of when they are in a hypnosis-like state.

, If you predicted ""carrot"" correctly, your audience will be wowed. For an impressive effect, you can try saying something mysterious like, ""Ah, my child, your mind is like an open book to me."" Congratulations! Your trick is complete. Remember: magicians never reveal their secrets.


If your volunteer said a different vegetable, you have two options. The first is to simply drop the act and say something like, ""Ahhh, shoot!"" as you turn over the paper. If you do this, be a good sport and laugh along with the audience. Your other option is to maintain your act by saying something like, ""Your mind is cloudy today."" You can either turn over the card or tear it up, but be ready for some light-hearted jeers from the audience!

Do magic tricks.,
Read How to Read Someone's Mind With Math (Math Trick).,
Read How to Appear to Read Someone's Mind with Numbers.",How to Make People Think You Can Read Minds," You know how magicians, comedians, and performers in general sometimes bring up a person or two from the audience to interact with? This person isn't chosen at random – the entertainer is doing a scan of the audience from minute one for just the right individual. Some people are too closed off and not receptive while others are too all over the place and flighty. To use the following techniques, you need an individual who's balanced but engaged, and seems adequately expressive.


Of your group of friends, someone who is comfortable with you is best. You also need someone that reacts to ideas and events openly and that is fairly easy to read in general. Someone who is quiet, subdued, and hard to interact with won't do you any favors.;
, People, whether we like it or not, all run or sort of the same program. When prompted, we often come up with the same responses. Having the knowledge of what most people would say in a situation can make it seem like you're telepathic to those who don't know. Here are a few basics:If asked to choose a number between 1 and 10, most people will go for 7
If asked to think of a color quickly (in 3 seconds or less), most people choose red
If given more time (4 seconds or so), they will say blue

, To get people to open up to you and be honest, it's a good idea to mirror them. That is, take on their body positioning and aspects of their personality. If their hands are in their pockets and they're a little timid, put your hand in your pocket and be a little timid. If they're loud and all over the place, be loud and over the place. This puts the two of you on the same wavelength.


If the person you're working with is someone you know, this is less of an issue. However, some people, when you tell them you're going to ""read their mind"" clam up. This loosens them and gives them a sense of security, making the job easier for you.

, An easy way to turn lying into mind-reading is to ask a person a series of questions in which you know only one is a lie. Let's say you're asking your friend what number they're thinking of, but you instruct to always tell you ""no."" If you can detect their lie, you can amaze them with your mind-reading powers.


Let's say your friend is giving you a chorus of no's in answering your question about the number they're thinking of. All the responses seem the same except on 6 – that ""no"" seemed tenser, his eyes flitted about, he seemed a little too adamant, and he fidgeted a little. Odds are 6 was his number.

, Just like the body can give away a lie, the body can give away a thought, too. Place your hand lightly on their back or shoulder (tell them it helps the connection, if you must) and begin your trick. When the thought you're trying to get at comes up, you'll likely feel their body tense up slightly or adjust.


Let's say you told your friend to think of a letter in the alphabet. You're going to sing the alphabet song to help channel his thinking. When you get to his letter, you'll notice that change in his body. Afterward, tell him his letter, watching him be flabbergasted – his mind didn't register that automatic reaction in his body.

, Many people that mind-reading is all about priming. In order to get them to say the answer you want them to say, you plant the ideas in their mind, saying it beforehand. Here's an example:


You want your friend to say ""red"" when you ask him what his favorite color is. Before you ask that question, you say four other things: ""Hey,what's up? How is your family? Oh really? I just saw my new favourite movie. I like that colour on you. I might be getting a new *red* car.""

, There are a few tricks out their that if your friends don't know, you can wow them with your magical, mind-reading prowess. Try the Grey Elephant from Denmark trick. Tell your friend to do the following:


Pick a number between 1 and 10.
Multiply that number by 9.
Add the 2 digits together. (If it's a single digit, don't worry about it.)
Subtract 5 from that number.
Give that number a corresponding letter: A=1, B=2 and so on.
Tell them to think of a country that begins with that letter.
Take the second letter of the country and think of an animal that begins with that letter.
Finally, tell them to think of the color of that animal. Ask them if they're thinking of a Grey Elephant from Denmark!
Most, but not all, people will be. It's just math. You will end up with 4, which gives you ""D."" From there, you have very few options, and most people will go with ""elephant.""

, A convincing magic trick can make your friends think you have some sort of supernatural power. It can be with cards, small objects, or nothing at all. Learn a few to wow your friends with and maybe they'll think you can read minds!


There are magic tricks about reading people's minds, too. Just read the article on it!


, If you've got a flair for math, mind-reading math tricks may be right up your alley. You don't even need a piece of paper or a calculator. All you need to do is memorize a couple of equations!


This article alone has three different methods you can try out. If you're not a fan of one, you have two more to give a whirl. That being said, some are more difficult than others. Do whichever level speaks to you.

, This is very similar to the above article and offers another equation to try out on your friends. Between all these puzzles, there's bound to be one you can give a shot!


Try to modify them yourself, too. Add colors or animals that correlate to numbers (like in the Grey Elephant trick) to make it your own. That makes the trick a little more deceptive, too.

Study word choice.,
Spot lying.,
Pay attention to tone and speed of voice.,
Understanding sentence length.",How to Read a Person2," Words people use can give clues to their behavior. For example, if a person tells you they won ""another"" award, this provides a clue that they are insecure because they wanted to ensure you knew they'd won before. This tells you it would be effective to offer praise for accomplishments. It pinpoints an area of vulnerability.
Study whether a person's word choice matches their body language. Inconsistency can be telling. , It's possible to spot whether a person might be lying based on what they say. Consider their comments in context though, and always be aware that reading verbal cues is not foolproof.


Using a question to answer a question gives them more time to make up a story.
When people add qualifiers like ""to the best of my knowledge"" they might be lying. When people are lying, they will sometimes remove references to themselves, avoiding use of the word ""I."" When lying, people sometimes use the present tense to refer to past events.
Some studies have found that people who use more formal speech might be lying. For example, they might not use contractions or will use titles.
People who are guilty of something will sometimes use words that soften the act. For example, instead of a word like steal, they might use a word like borrow.

, The sounds people give off when they talk can be very revealing about their personalities.


People who talk too fast and too much are usually insecure or anxious. Sighing indicates sadness and frustration.
If a person speaks too slowly, they may be depressed or lack spontaneity.
If a person's voice changes pitch suddenly, they might be lying.
A repetitive tone of voice indicates insincerity. Men may vary their tone of voice more when they are attracted to a woman. , The average sentence contains between 10 to 15 words. This is known as the ""mean length of utterance."" Longer or shorter sentences than average is an indication of stress.
Some experts believe you can tell a person is lying if they deviate from the mean length of utterance significantly. They will single out those sentences to study more closely.

Shake hands.,
Use your intuition.,
Read their eyes.,
Read a person's energy type.",How to Read a Person3," When you shake a person's hands, what's your sense of their energy? Pay careful attention to what you feel. Do you feel warmth or coldness? Chinese medicine has a word for the energy a person gives off: Chi.
Another word for emotional energy is a person's ""vibe.""
To assess a person's energy, you may need to touch them, through a hug or handshake or just by touching their hand.

, Don't overthink it. Does the person make you feel good or not? Sometimes you just have a ""gut feeling"" you should pay attention to.


Goose bumps can be a physical sign the body gives you that tells you something is not right. Or they might just indicate a sense of deja vu. Does a person make you feel drained or energized? This gives you clues to their emotional vibe.
Pay attention to flashes of insight that interrupt your thinking.
What's your sense of a person's overall energy? Not a gesture or tone here or there, but the overall atmosphere they create and feeling they give off?

, Emotional energy shines through in the eyes and gaze. The cliche ""the eyes are the window to the soul"" was created for a reason.


Is their gaze hard and angry or soft and welcoming?
Intimacy can be created through a simple gaze. Pay careful attention to the body language around the eyes. , Ancient thinkers developed five elements to describe a person's overall energy. They believed understanding these elements could help you read people and even spot illness. People with fire energy are flamboyant, hysterical, and exciting.
A person who has wood energy is vital, new, and energetic.
People with earth energy are practical and methodical.
People with metal energy are depressed and withdrawn.
Water energy is an indicator of peacefulness and objectivity.

Gather a small audience.,
Reveal that a levitation will be performed.This will immediately get people's attention and set their expectations high.,
Make a show of choosing the right spot to levitate.,
Shake out your legs and arms to get ready.,
Announce that there are no wires or strings.,
Take your position.,
Lift your front foot and rear heel.,
Do a crash ""landing."",
Work from different angles.,
Act as if the levitation is difficult and intense.",How to Levitate," In order for the levitation illusion to work correctly, you'll need a small audience sitting in front of you. They should all be viewing you from roughly the same angle.


If people are scattered about the room, ask them to move to the same area. Make sure they don't spread out in a semicircle, or stand behind you, since they'll be able to see how you performed the trick.
If you have a small stage, position yourself upon it. You may also want to dim the lights a bit to give yourself more leeway when you perform the levitation.;
, Audiences look forward to levitation as one of the most intriguing magic tricks. Notifying them that you're about to do it will have them on the edge of their seats, which is essential to successfully performing the trick.


Consider building suspense throughout the magic show, so that the audience looks forward to the levitation the entire time.
To make the event seem even more mysterious, have an assistant come out and announce that you will be levitating before you walk onto the stage or into the room.

, This continues building up the audience's suspense. Search for a place that has ""good vibes"" or ""feels like a portal to the other side."" Use whatever language would be most convincing to your particular audience.

, You could also stretch, do a few jumping jacks, or do a yoga move or two. The point is to act as though levitation is going to be physically strenuous. Announce that you've been preparing for this moment for weeks.

, Ask an audience member to come up and walk around you, wave his or her arms over your head, and declare to the others that there are indeed no wires or strings waiting to lift you from the ground.

, Stand a fair distance away from the audience at a 45-degree angle, with your back to the crowd. You should be standing so that the foot closest to the crowd is mostly visible. The heel of the rear foot is visible, but the toe area of that foot is hidden by the closer foot.


The angle and positioning of your feet must be correct, or the audience will be able to clearly see that you aren't levitating. Practice in front of a mirror or with a friend who knows what you're up to before your performance.
If the audience asks you to move closer or turn around, tell them that this exact spot on the floor has the best vibes, or that you'll break your concentration if you move.

, Simultaneously lift your front foot and your rear heel a few inches from the ground. Your entire body's weight should be balanced on the toe of your rear foot, which is obscured from the audience's view. To them, it will look as though both feet are a few inches from the floor.


Hold the position for five to ten seconds. Any longer, and your audience might try to peek behind your front foot.
You might want to experiment with different pairs of pants to figure out which ones best obscure your rear toe without getting in the way.

, End the levitation by heavily thumping both feet on the ground and bending your knees, as though you feel from a great height. This gives the audience the feeling that you levitated much higher than you actually did., Try performing on a stage that is raised above the audience, or turning at a 45-degree angle in the opposite direction. Figure out which angle is most convincing given your particular skills and body type.


You can also control the angle by controlling where the audience sits. Try positioning them at different distances from the stage.
You can also deliberately block the audience's view as is done in the Superman or King levitation, where you place a jacket in front of your feet while setting up the illusion.

, Mimic the expressions you would use when lifting a heavy object with your muscles. Have a look of concentration on your face. Use body language to further convince them that the levitation is both a mental and physical exertion on your part.


Widely known magician David Blaine even pretends to be sick after performing the levitation, further convincing the audience that he exerted tremendous energy during the trick.
Pretending to be surprised or shocked that the levitation worked can also be convincing.

Firstly, find your subject.,
Get them to put their arms out straight yet relaxed (kind of like a stereotypical zombie.),
Tell them to imagine, that in their left hand, they are holding a bucket.,
While that's going on, tell them that in their other hand, around their wrist to be precise is a string.,
Watch their left arm.,
Have them look at their arms.",How to Perform an Interesting Mental Trick," It helps if they know you in some way. Siblings or friends are easy to perform on. Say 'Do you want to see a great trick?' or something like that. They should be interested because you have just said that, so they should say that they do want to see the trick. If they say they don't want to see it, just find another subject who does.;
, Their hands must be limp. Tell them to close their eyes.

, Tell them that not only is the bucket very heavy on its own but they are also holding it under a running tap. Tell them that the bucket is filling up with water and it's getting heavier ('and heavier and heavier.' It's because to say it like that because it emphasizes how heavy the bucket is actually getting for the subject.)

, Then tell them that attached to that string is a helium balloon (you can tell them what colour it is if you want to help them imagine it) and it's trying to float away and pulling their hand up with it. Tell them that the heavier the bucket gets from all the water going into it, the more the balloon will try to float away and pull their hand up with it.

, If this person has a good imagination, and you have done this trick correctly, you should see their left arm droop downwards from the weight of the bucket and their right arm drift upwards from the 'balloon' trying to float away.

, If they haven't noticed the effect of this (most people notice the effect while their eyes are closed,) tell them to open their eyes and look at their arms. They should be amazed, or even freaked out by this trick.

Ask your friend to pick a number.,
Have your friend double the number.,
Show him 10 fingers.,
Divide the answer by 2.,
Subtract the original number.,
Announce that the answer is 5.,
Know why this works.",How to Appear to Read Someone's Mind with Numbers1," He should keep this number secret from you. Tell him not to forget, since he'll have to remember it later.


We'll go through an example where your friend picks the number 6.
Even kids can do the math in this trick, as long as they can multiply and divide by 2. A young kid might need to whisper the number to another person, so she can remind him later.;
, Say ""Now double the number you chose, but don't tell me the answer.""


In our example, 6 x 2 = 12.

, Ask him to add 10 to his last answer.


12 + 10 = 22.

, Tell your friend you're trying to read his mind, but the number is too big right now. Ask him to divide the answer by 2 to make it smaller.


22 ÷ 2 = 11.

, Ask him to take the last answer and subtract the original number he picked.


The person in our example picked 6, so he would calculate 11 - 6 = 5.

, No matter what number your friend chose, he will end up with 5 as his final answer. Announce that you have read his mind, and the last number your friend wrote down is 5. If there are other people in the room, have your friend show them the piece of paper to prove it.

, Most of these steps are there just to make it hard for people to follow the problem. After you double the chosen number, divide it by two, and subtract the number, you've cancelled out the original number completely. Now it doesn't matter what your friend chose. The answer only depends on the extra numbers and instructions you gave him, which happen to lead to 5 in this trick.

Have someone write down the same digit 3 times.,
Instruct her to add all three digits together.,
Divide the larger number by the smaller one.,
Announce that she's thinking of the number 37.,
Learn why this works.",How to Appear to Read Someone's Mind with Numbers2," She should keep the paper hidden from you at all times. A calculator will come in handy for this trick.


For example, she could write down 555.

, Ask the subject of the ""mind reading"" to separate the three digits and add them together.


In this example, 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

, Confirm that the subject now has two numbers written down, a three-digit number and a smaller one. Ask her to take the three digit number and divide it by the smaller one.


555 ÷ 15 = 37.

, Whether she chose 111, or 999, or one of the options in between, your volunteer will always end up with 37 as her answer!

, There's no deep trick here; these are just properties of the numbers involved. 37 x 3 = 111. Each ""jump"" up (111 → 222 → 333, etc.) adds another 111, so you're adding 37 multiplied by three each time. Looking at the sum of the digits (1+1+1 → 2+2+2 → 3 + 3 + 3, etc.), you also happen to be adding three each time. By putting this in a division problem, each jump up means dividing by another three each time. These two effects cancel each other out and you get back to 37.

Hand a calculator, pencil, and paper to a volunteer.,
Instruct a volunteer to write down three positive, consecutive numbers.,
Ask him to multiply the three numbers together.,
Tell the volunteer to repeat this for three other consecutive numbers.,
Have him multiply the two products together.,
Tell the volunteer to shuffle all but one digit.,
Add the shuffled digits as he reads them aloud.,
Find the secret digit.,
Know what to do if the shuffled digits add up to 9.,
Understand why this works.",How to Appear to Read Someone's Mind with Numbers3," This trick involves large numbers, so a calculator that has plenty of space will come in handy. Tell him that you'll be reading his mind, so he should keep everything on the paper and calculator hidden from you.


This trick also requires some quick thinking on your part. It's nothing harder than addition, but you'll need to be fast and error-free.

, These can be any whole numbers, but they must be consecutive. (There can be no whole numbers between them.)


For example, your volunteer could pick 19, 20, and 21.
If the calculator only has room to display eight digits, the numbers must all be between 1 and 21. If it only has room to display six digits, make it 1 to 9.

, After he finds the answer on the calculator, have him write it down on the piece of paper.


In our example, 19 x 20 x 21 = 7980.

, Next, the person you're ""mind reading"" secretly picks three more consecutive numbers. He multiplies them together and writes them down next to his first answer.


Let's say he picks 12, 13, 14. He multiplies 12 x 13 x 14 = 2184.

, Now the volunteer multiplies his two answers together and writes down the result.



7980 x 2184 = 17428320.

, Explain that you only have enough power to read one of the digits from his mind. Ask him to pick one secret digit in the number, then write down the other digits after shuffling them in any order.


For example, if he picks 4 as the secret digit, he could shuffle the rest of the digits as 2287013.

, Remind him that he must keep one digit secret. Have him read the other digits slowly and clearly while you add them in your head.


For example, he would read ""2... 2... 8... 7... 0... 1... 3."" You add these together as he goes, getting a total of 23.

, All of the digits in his answer, including the secret one, will add up to a multiple of 9. Once you know this, there are two ways to find the secret digit. Here they are, using our example:


The non-secret digits add up to 23, and you know the next multiple of 9 is 27. Think 27 - 23 = 4, so the last digit must be 4.
If you're not sure what the next multiple of 9 is, add the digits in your sum and repeat. For example, 23 → 2 + 3 = 5. Now the next multiple of 9 is 9, and 9 - 5 = 4.

, If you add the digits he spoke out loud and you already have a multiple of 9, there are two possibilities. Either the secret digit is 0, or the secret digit is 9. Make a guess at one of them. If you get it wrong, make a joke (""I knew I should have studied harder in telepathy school""), then guess again with the second possibility.

, Any three consecutive numbers includes a multiple of 3, so the product of the trio will also be a multiple of 3. Since you repeat this and multiply the two answers together, you are finding the product of two multiples of three. This product is always a multiple of 9 (since 3 x 3 = 9). All multiples of 9 have the property described above, where all of their digits sum to another multiple of 9.

Attach one end of this strand of string to some sticky tape and place high up on the magician's body such as a shirt button while the other end can be placed at the right moment to a solid object (in David Blaine's case, the tree).,
Stand at the correct distance so that the string is tight and the object (a bill or a leaf) is wrapped around the thread which is above your hand.,
Tighten the thread by using very small movements of the head or body, causing the note to rise.,
The object can then be made to return to the palm and be examined by the spectator.

,
Walk away casually, the thread breaking, which is not a problem as it is reasonably priced.

Identify a piece of clothing that identifies a person’s occupation.,
Look for wrinkles.,
Try to spot affluence.,
Find signs of fastidiousness.,
Move on to the person’s body language.",How to Read a Person Like a Book1," A lab coat, tool belt, paint-spattered overalls, suit or uniform can tell you what a person does professionally. Use that information to determine whether they are young (too young for a job), a professional, a skilled worker, or are retired.;
, Lines near the eyes, mouth or neck will tell you how old the person is likely to be. Age spots on hands can be a good indication of their decade as well. Some people who have had a lot of sun exposure or who have smoked, may display more wrinkles, while those living in cooler and moister climates may have smoother skin.

, Sometimes wealth or the desire to be wealthy is shown in the quality of garments, shoes and even a haircut. Look for a wristwatch, diamond earrings or designer bags. However, be wary - many educated people shun such articles, and wear more casual clothing. Some may even sport dishevelled hairdo's and have facial hair (beards or moustaches in men.) Alternatively, look for signs of thriftiness. Faded clothes, discount clothing labels or worn shoes might tell you if a person has less money, although many principled people shun the pressure dictated by fashion and make a point of wearing simple clothes made of natural fabrics which naturally fade faster. In addition certain very good shoe brands outlast cheaper brands by far, and although they may start to look worn with time, they are made to last for more than a decade, and therefore will cost many times over what a cheaper shoe in a similar style would cost.
While these signals may tell you what economic decisions the person has made, they do not translate into behavior.

, If the person has their hair in place, their clothing pressed and an attention to style, they may be very detail oriented. Someone with a more casual wardrobe or “bed head” might be creative or messy, although a detail orientated person may have made the choice to focus on detail in their work and not to spend too much time and financial resources on their personal appearance

, Just as the saying goes, “you can’t judge a book by its cover"", clothing is the least accurate way to read a personality.

Count the blinks.,
Give your gut some credit.",How to Read a Person Like a Book2," This can be a clue that they are feeling stressed. Rubbing the hands against the thighs or the head will also indicate stress., Suddenly crossing arms and legs or looking away is seen as negative body language as well.

, Avoiding eye contact and staring too long into someone’s eyes can be a sign of anxiety and of lying. Eye contact is hard to fake, so if you aren’t noticing darting eyes or prolonged stares, the person is more likely to be relaxed.

, Looking toward a clock, a watch or a phone can mean the person is nervous or bored or they may be used to habitually checking their phone or email frequently. Starting a new task when they are talking to you is a better judge if they are paying attention., An increased blink rate will indicate a nervous feeling. This can be a positive thing, such as physical attraction, or an unconscious manifestation of stress from being the center of attention., People often have micro-expressions that may convey more accurately what they are thinking; however, they flash by so fast, it may only be your subconscious that registers it. Micro-expressions tell more than most body language cues."

They may be trying to lie or they may be uncomfortable, or anxious., If someone keeps their arms and legs crossed and starts opening them or reaching out, that is a sign they are more comfortable with you. Also, if someone you are close to starts using a lot of new postures or expressions, they may be going through an emotional or physical change.

, This type of person will search for awards and leadership positions. They aim to win arguments and seek to manage or influence others.


Watching behavior can show you a person’s motivation and helps to predict future actions.

, This type of person seeks acceptance from others.

, If a person sets high standards, likes to work individually and seeks a challenge, they are most likely motivated by a sense of personal achievement rather than power or affiliation.

Find a job where you can use your skills.",How to Be a Mentalist," Part of being a mentalist is about trusting your judgment. Unfortunately, most people have turned their observation skills off. General and non-overt assessment of an individual provides good background information that is normally missed. For example, are the person's hands soft or calloused? Is his musculature toned or not? Is the person dressed to stand out or to hide? Take yourself right now -- what might someone learn about you just from looking at you?


There are dozens of general assessment information items that will help you to profile the individual. Think of Sherlock Holmes -- he didn't have ESP, he just noticed things. That's all. A slight tan line on the left ring finger. A pen mark on the left hand. He would now trust that this person is either divorced or separated and right-handed. Trust those snap judgments!;
, A mentalist's work lies in stirring memories and causing the ""tells"" to appear, even if the person cannot bring to mind the information. “Tells” will help you to observe what the mind knows but the memory cannot call forth. Remember that although someone may say they do not remember something, the brain records everything. As such, the information is there, but just not accessible to that person at that time. ""Tells"" include:


Dilation or constriction of the pupil of the eye (dilation is associated with positive emotion; constriction with negative)
Where the person gazes
Rate of respiration
Heart rate
Relative perspiration of the body

, Knowing what tells to look for isn't helpful if you don't know what they mean. While each person is a bit different, tells are called as such because they're usually consistent. So get in front of a mirror and start studying your own face. Here's a few things to look for:


When you think of a positive memory, your pupils should dilate. When you think of a negative experience, they should constrict. Imagine both of these scenarios and see what happens.
Think of an answer to this question: What do you like about going to the beach? Once you've come up with your answer, note where you looked. If you said something like fire, you probably visualized it and looked up. If you said something like the sounds and the smells, you probably remained at eye level. If you said the sand in your hands, you may have looked down. Visual answers generally go up, aural stays level, and hands-on memories draw gaze downward.
Make yourself nervous. How does it manifest in your body? What is your heart doing? Your breathing? What are you doing with your hands? Now run through other emotions too -- sadness, happiness, stress, etc.

, Much of detecting lies is seeing the tells we just covered. In fact, that's what a polygraph does -- it measures blood pressure, pulse, and perspiration. The higher these numbers, the more likely the person is lying. But you can also do things a polygraph can't do -- like see when people aren't looking you in the eye, twiddling their thumbs, or being inconsistent in their verbal and non-verbal behavior.


A good thing to master is detecting micro-expressions. These are little flashes of how the person actually feels before they consciously cover it up. They're often feelings of distress or negative feelings they don't want other people to see for one reason or another.
Pay attention to their entire body -- how much they're gulping, if they're touching their nose or mouth, what they're doing with their hands, fingers, and feet, and how they're standing in relation to you. Are they angled toward the door? They probably subconsciously want to get away!

, Persuading people is a huge part of being a mentalist. At the very least, you're persuading them you are a mentalist! If a person is given some evidence that one can “read their mind,"" they are easily confused between telepathy and observation/persuasion. A simple way to do this is to ask leading questions.


John Edward and other TV personalities are great at this. They start with, ""I'm seeing a 19. Does that mean anything to anyone?"" They start out vague until someone latches on. Then, once someone does, he'll ask questions like, ""You were very close to him, weren't you?"" and the person answers, feeling like they're understood. He's just asking very vague questions and the person is filling in the gaps for him!

, Look for all detail in the environment. Observe all human interaction, from the one-on-one to how the room is grouped. Often just a ten second look into a room can tell you how each person is feeling.


If you see one or two people near the door, they may be socially anxious. See a person whose body language is clearly focused on someone else? They're interested in that person, probably sexually. And if everyone is aligned toward one person in the room, you've found your alpha. And that's just three examples.
If you can, record something. Start with small segments, observe, record, then view again several times to find what information you missed the first time.

, This means how a person normally acts in any given circumstance. Since people are different, you'll be a lot more effective in your readings if you have a baseline first. And you'll know how receptive they're feeling toward you!


An easy example is think of naturally flirty people. When they're comfortable, they may be touching, laughing, and poking away at someone they find attractive. Other people, while comfortable, might consider that a violation of a person's bubble. Both people are feeling the same way, they just show it in very different ways.

, 99% of getting people to believe/agree with you is confidence (statistic yet to be verified). How do politicians get elected? What makes a salesman effective? Who gets the ladies? We may think it has something to do with smarts or with looks (and those definitely don't hurt), but what it really boils down to is confidence. When you're confident enough, it doesn't even occur to other people to question your judgment.


If you're nervous about professing your mentalist ways, you gotta kick that nasty habit! What you're really selling here is yourself. People are looking to you to be convinced -- they're not looking for the most accurate or logical information. When you realize it's not what you say, it's how you say it, a lot of the pressure falls away.

, The fact of the matter is that people tell us things way more often than we realize. If we were better listeners, a whole new world would open up to us. Our memories would improve and we would make connections we didn't see before. That's what mentalists do!


An important part of listening and being an effective mentalist is reading between the lines. Seeing what people really mean when they're talking. If your friend walked up to you and said, ""Oh my gosh, I worked out soooooo hard today,"" they're actually saying, ""Please give me a pat on the back. I need to be told I'm fit."" It's this underlying text that will clue you in when people don't realize you're any the wiser.

, What it boils down to is that you're really putting on a show. So instead of pretending to be someone you're not and making this dramatic scene about it, just be yourself! The genuine you is a lot more convincing than anything else.


If anything, be slightly amused. Think of those actors giving interviews that constantly have a slight smile on their faces and are prone to little bouts of subdued laughter. They're totally relaxed and they just seem, well, cool. Be that guy!

, And you thought Inception was just an awesome Leonardo DiCaprio movie. While you can't plant dreams yet, you can plant ideas. Let's say you want to get someone to think of a word and the word you want them to think of is ""watch."" You would insert that word into your conversation beforehand, glance at yours casually (albeit briefly), and then ask them to think of something like an accessory. Boom. Mind read.


Start experimenting with this on small levels, like the example above. Grab a friend or two and see if you can come up with a few scenarios on your own where they don't know they're getting ideas planted in their brains. Once you come up with half a dozen or so words you can easily plant, you can impress anyone at a moment's notice.

, If you've ever asked a magician to tell you how he does one of his tricks, if he's any good he never spills! He shouldn't even explain a trick that any other magician does (or the union will kick him out). You should be the same! If someone asks you how you do something, simply shrug your shoulders and equate it to your awesomeness.


Don't accidentally give it away, either. ""Ah, I see you looked up and to the left,"" gives away that you're monitoring their eyes, even if you don't tell them what it signifies. You want them to think there's something extra-sensory about you, something that other people don't have. So be mysterious. You'll only increase their intrigue.

, There are many books on interviewing people and interpreting even the slightest facial movements, body tells, and mind-manipulation. Annemann’s Practical Mental Effects and Corinda’s 13 Steps to Mentalism are two good places to start. As is T.A. Waters’ Mind, Myth and Magick. No one better to learn from than the pros!

, To give yourself more cred -- and just because you may also find it interesting -- venture into other related realms. Think of reading up on dream interpretation, tarot cards, astrology, and telepathy and telekinesis, just to name a few. Might as well make yourself well-rounded!


Consider learning new skills, too. Look into hypnosis, palm reading, and other people-reading skills. Then when you're being your mentalist self, you could always truthfully say, ""I could hypnotize you, but I shouldn't have to do that.""

, It's a muscle, really. If you don't use it, you'll lose it. So start playing chess, doing Sudoku, and solving riddles. Do crossword puzzles. Spend your free time reading and doing DIY projects. Paint (that's a good one for noticing details). Take an acting class (also good for detail and emotion). All of these are things that can help you increase your mental power.


Use the Internet! Visit sites like Lumosity, Khan Academy, Coursera, and Memrise and make sure you train your mind regularly. Deductive reasoning and critical thinking are two skills that aren't necessarily used while being a mentalist, but they get the skills you do use going a lot faster! Sherlock may be able to notice that lack of a wedding ring, but if it takes him a day and a half to put it together, Watson's dead by then. So keep mentally agile and stay on top of your game.

, Whether you're looking to be a magician or a criminal profiler or a TV star, why not make a little moolah off of your mad observational skills and people-reading prowess? You'll hone your methods and learn even more tricks of the trade.


If you haven't thought about it before, start! Get to reading How to Be a Magician, How to Be an FBI Profiler, How to Be a Detective, or even How to Get on TV. To learn from real professional mentalists, read about Master Mentalism. If Honey Boo Boo can do it, you certainly can!

A general course in psychology will give you good ammunition for your ""mind-reading."" Many mentalists, who construct performances around mind-reading people, spend a considerable amount of time studying human psychology.The easiest way, perhaps, for you to get a basic understanding of psychology will be to take a course in the subject. These may be available for an affordable cost at a local community college or community center.
Engage in daily psychological study by noting patterns you see in the behavior of those around you. You can collect these observations in a notebook for personal reference. This will also sharpen your observational abilities.;
, Though psychology looks into human thought patterns and behavior, you'll want to take an in-depth look at trends and percentages concerning human behavior. For example, if you know that when offered four choices, a person is 92% likely to choose the third without any prodding on your part, this will give you a high percentage chance of predicting what the person is thinking in that situation.A newly emerging study of human truthfulness, sometimes referred to as lie-spotting, might also help you ""read"" the mind of someone. All you need to do is catch that person in a lie, point it out, and when he asks, ""How did you know?"" simply reply, ""I can read your mind."", This has a dual purpose. When the person whose mind you are trying to ""read"" is at ease, they will be less guarded. This means that you'll likely have more information available to you for making predictions about that person. Additionally, if your subject feels like you are of a similar mind, it will engage brain cells that sync him up with you, which will make your mind-reading easier as well.Put people at ease while reading their mind by mirroring their motions. You don't have to do exactly the same things they are, but by reusing the gestures of the person you are trying to mind-read, you'll make them feel like they can trust you.
You might also want to use similar words and expressions to gain a person's trust while mind-reading. If the person you are trying to read is timid, start off talking to them in a timid way. If the person is bold and brash, joke around and be more daring., Deductive reasoning is where you apply generally true rules to your observations about your mind-reading subject. In this way you can figure out or predict unknown information. For example, if you know that all people eat food, that lunch is usually eaten around midday, that your mind-reading subject has a small yellow stain on his shirt, and that it's shortly after noon, you might deduce that your subject had a hot dog for lunch, as hot dogs are a food that frequently comes with mustard.


By logically connecting and making sense of generally true statements about people with regard to specific observations about your subject, you improve your odds of making a correct prediction. These predictions, in turn, will make it seem like you can read minds., Micro-expressions are honest emotional expressions that cross your face whether you realize it or not.These expressions are separated into seven universal emotions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, contempt, and surprise. By teaching yourself to recognize these reflexive facial expressions, you can gain a better understanding of how people really feel about what you are talking about, and you can use this to your advantage when pretending to read minds.


Micro-expressions happen very quickly. Even if you know what you're looking for, they can be difficult to spot. You may want to begin by finding YouTube videos online that show these expressions in slow motion to help develop your ability to see these emotions when attempting to ""read"" minds.

, Broad statements will act as the net with which you will catch micro-expressions. The subject of your ""mind-reading"" won't be able to help himself from responding to what you say with micro-expressions, so use whatever general information you have to make these statements in a conversational way. You might make observations about clothing, posture, accessories, or even word choice.


You may want to start off by telling your subject, ""First let me ask you a few simple questions so I can harmonize my mind with yours to get a better reading."" This way, you can acclimate yourself to your subject's body language while narrowing down what you know about him or her.
To give yourself a little wiggle room, you may want to tell people watching that, ""Reading minds is very difficult. Sometimes I pick up information from other people and get information wrong. But I assure you if you are patient, I will prove to you I can read your mind.""
As an example, you might notice your subject is disheveled, but otherwise well groomed, you might say, ""Today's been a rough day for you. Or has it been a rough week? I sense that you've been struggling in your personal life lately. Is this true?"" The micro-expressions responding to these questions and statements will help you determine whether you've predicted correctly.
You might also tell a story or make several rapid fire statements and read micro-expressions that occur as you tell it to your subject. Try to keep it as broad as possible. Use topics like work, girlfriends, boyfriends, animals, exercise, family, and so on., Disgust is most easily recognized by the wrinkled nose that accompanies it. You should also see raised upper eyelids, lower lip, and cheeks. With this expression, most lines will fall below the lower eyelid. It will be similar to the face you associate with a bad smell.


Things that disgust your subject are generally things he will avoid. For example, if you notice the disgust micro-expression when you mention a child or baby while talking to your subject, you could be reasonably safe in the assumption, ""You've never wanted to have children."", Anger is characterized by bulging or hard staring eyes. You should also find tension in the lower eyelid and lips, which will compress into a square shape. Vertical lines should appear between the brows, which should be low and pulled together. It is also common for the lower jaw to jut out with this expression.


Anger in your mind-reading subject can ruin your performance, even if all your predictions are correct. An angry subject is one that might decide to deny your correct predictions out of spite.
You may want to take steps to calm your subject to prevent a hot temper from ruining your fake mind-reading. To do this, you might say, ""I try to respect people's boundaries when I'm mind-reading; if I've overstepped those bounds, you have my apologies. Shall we change the topic?"", Fear, you will notice, has raised, flat, centered lines in the brow that usually pull together. A person expressing fear will have raised upper eyelids, but the lower one should be tense and upward oriented also. You should see the upper white of the eye but not the lower, and the mouth should be slightly opened and tense.


Your situation will dictate how you respond, but in many cases, if you see the fear micro-expression you should change the topic or your approach. Fear can make your subject more guarded, which will make it harder for you to glean information from him.
In some cases, fear may mean you have guessed an intimate or personal detail. If you don't want to embarrass your subject in front of other onlookers, you may want to shift your predictions to new topics., Sadness can be noticed by the upside down triangle it forms below the eyebrow. The corners of the lip will be oriented downward but the jaw should come upward a bit. You may also notice some pouting in the lower lip.


Sadness can sometimes point to recent loss. Some people may be less receptive to you ""reading"" their mind about this kind of thing. You'll have to use your best judgement for each situation., Happiness is marked by an uplifted appearance. Cheeks and the corners of the mouth will be up-raised and pulled back and up. You should look for a wrinkle running from the outside of the nose to the outside of your lip. Crow's feet generally appear near the eyes.


This micro-expression can be a sign that you're on the right track in your deductions. When you see the happiness micro-expression in your subject, you may want to apply your more in depth deductive reasoning to the topic.
People who are happy will also be more willing to cooperate with you. Cooperation is important for your pretend mind-reading. For you to make correct predictions, you need your subject to unwittingly provide you with information., Contempt is best noticed by its lack of symmetry. Generally, with contempt and hatred, you'll find one side of the mouth raised, creating a skewed shape. You might also notice features similar to a scowl, represented by central, hard lines between the brows and glaring eyes.Contempt can be a kind of self-excluding emotion, which can make it difficult for you draw information out of your subject. When you see contempt in the face of someone you're plying your mind-reading tricks, you should take measures to make that person feel included., Surprise is marked by eyebrows that are raised and curved. You should notice that the skin under the brow is somewhat stretched, the wrinkles on the forehead should be oriented left to right, and the jaw should drop at least slightly but without tension. The eyelids will be normally opened, revealing the whites of the eye all the way around the pupil and iris.


Surprise can indicate that you've struck upon something meaningful to the subject of your mind-reading. When you notice surprise in response to one of your broad statements or during your conversation with the subject, you may want to delve deeper into that topic., Not everyone is going to be ideal for your pretend mind-reading activities. Some individuals will offer you plenty of information at a glance. Others may be unreadable even for an expert. By maintaining control of your choice of subject, you'll ensure a higher rate of success in your mind-reading.


You may want to avoid choosing individuals who are overeager to volunteer to have their mind read. These people are often more interested in being the center of attention, and will likely be less interested in interacting with you and more interested in 15 minutes of fame.
Individuals who are a little reserved but respond favorably to your humor and conversation should be prioritized. These people are, in most cases, focused on you and what you are saying, making them ideal for cold reading and micro-expression reading., If you know you're walking into a situation where your mind-reading will be tested, prepare yourself. Knowing the kind of people you'll be mind-reading, their backgrounds, beliefs, and attitudes will all help you to puzzle out what they are thinking.


For example, you might learn beforehand a crowd you'll be mind-reading comes from a rural area. So when you pull a person at random out of a crowd, note his slightly dirty cowboy boots and Chevy truck key fob, and then proclaim he's a farmer (or does a job related to agriculture), everyone will think you really can read minds.
If your research reveals a large portion of the community you're mind-reading participates in religion, you might say, ""I'm sensing you've been influenced heavily by religion in your life."", In particular, you might rest your hand on your subject's shoulder to read his muscular response to what you're saying. While some people can hide the facial expressions of their emotions, very few can control their reflex muscular responses to things that are said. This is the same principle that lie detectors use to work.Another trick you might use to read someone's muscular response to the what you say is by holding your subject's hand. You might explain this need for contact by saying something like, ""A physical connection improves the psychic link.""

, Even expert level mentalists, who make a living off performing mind-reading tricks, sometimes misread the signs in their subject. The best thing to do in these situations is to offer an explanation, maintain positive, and try again.When you make a mistake, you might claim there was ""psychic interference."" You could also claim that you were picking up a psychic signal from someone close by.
You may have to fail many times before you develop a knack for reading the appearance and responses of your subject well enough to appear to be mind-reading. As you train your abilities, you'll become better able to read the signs.

Tell your victim to divide the number by 10.,
Tell your victim to subtract 10 from this number.",How to Perform a Math Trick2," Let's say the victim thinks of the number 3. Of course, your victim shouldn't share the number with you.

, Now, your victim will add 1 to his number 3 to get 4. (1 + 3 = 4).

, Now, 4 x 10 = 40.

, 90 + 40 = 130, so that should be the new number your victim has in his or her head.

, 130/10 = 13. The way this trick works, the number your victim divides by 10 will always be divisible by 10, because he multiplied it by 10 earlier.

, Now, 13 - 10 = 3. No matter what, the victim should always end up with the number he or she started with! Pretty cool, huh?

Instruct her to add 1 to her number.,
Tell your friend to double the new number.,
Have her add 4 more.,
Divide by 2.,
Subtract the original number.,
Show her your prediction.",How to Do a Simple Number Mind Trick1," Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.;
, Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.

, She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper.


We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4.
This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.

, Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers.


For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.

, Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2.


5 x 2 = 10.

, Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer.


10 + 4 = 14.

, Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier.


14 ÷ 2 = 7.

, Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number.


7 - 4 = 3.

, Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.

Have him add the second digit of his age.,
Ask for his last answer.,
Subtract 8 and tell him his real age.,
Try some variations.",How to Do a Simple Number Mind Trick2," Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head.


This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age.
Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.

, Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you.


For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.

, Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found.


In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.

, Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him ""Are you sure?"" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step.


19 x 2 = 38.

, Next, the person you're ""mind reading"" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do.


Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.

, Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.

, Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room.


In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.

, If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:


Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps.
To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).

, Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times.


For example, he could write 222.

, Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum.


For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

, He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the smaller one. Give him some time to work this out.



222 / 6 = 37,

, As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.

, Tell him to hold the answer in his head. He does not need to say it out loud.

, At this point, your friend should be thinking of 2040.

, Give your commands slowly. Allow your friend plenty of time to do the addition.

, We're up to 3070 now, assuming your friend hasn't made a mistake.

, Tell your friend to add 20, still keeping the number to himself.

, Say that you'll add 1000 one last time, and that you're nearly done. Your friend should now be thinking of 4090.

, Say ""Now add 10 and tell me the answer."" If your friend hesitates, encourage him by saying, ""you know the answer, what is it?""

, Most people will answer ""5000"" but this is not the right answer! 4090 + 10 actually equals 4100. It's an easy mistake to make when speaking aloud, since the trick makes you think you're counting up to a big even number. You might need to write it on a piece of paper for your friend to believe it.

Ask a volunteer to write down her age.,
Have her multiply it by 5.,
Write a zero at the end of the answer.,
Add today's date.,
Double the answer.,
Add the volunteer's shoe size.,
Subtract twice today's date.,
Reveal the magic.",How to Do a Math Magic Trick1," Give her a piece of paper and instruct her not to show you what she's writing.


This trick won't work on someone 100 years old or above, but that's almost never a problem!;
, Ask her to follow your instructions as you tell her what calculations to solve. Start by asking her to multiply her age by 5.


For example, if someone is 42 years old, she would write down 42 x 5 = 210.
Let her use a calculator if she'd prefer to.

, This is the same as multiplying by 10, but phrasing it this way makes it more difficult for the volunteer to follow the trick.


In our example, adding a zero to 210 makes 2100.

, It doesn't actually matter what she adds here — we'll undo it later — but today's date is an easy small number to add. Mention the date aloud to make sure she knows it.


For example, if today is March 15th, the volunteer in our example would sum 2100 + 15 = 2115.
Tell her to ignore the month and year.

, The volunteer should multiply her answer by two. (This is where a calculator comes in handy.)


2115 x 2 = 4230.

, Ask the volunteer to write down her shoe size, and to round up if it's not a whole number. She should add this to her last answer.


If her shoe size is 7, she'll add 4230 + 7 = 4237.

, It's best to calculate this in your head, then tell her to subtract the number you come up with.


For example, it's March 15th in our example, so multiply 15 x 2 = 30 in your head. Say ""Subtract 30 from your answer"" and the volunteer will calculate 4237 - 30 = 4207.

, Tell her to read her answer out loud. The first part of the number is her age, and the last two digits are her shoe size.

Ask your friend to choose a number between two and ten.,
Multiply the given number by two.,
Add five to the answer.,
Multiply that number by 50.,
Ask your friend if they’ve already celebrated their birthday for this year.,
Subtract the year that they were born.,
Look at your final answer.",How to Do a Number Trick to Guess Someone's Age1," To make the game more fun, you might ask them how many times per week they would like to have ice cream, go out to eat, or something similar. Once they have a number in mind, ask them to announce it.Say that they choose the number 6. This will be the example used throughout this method.;
, You can do this math by hand or your friend can use a calculator for the rest of the trick. Explain to your friend that they must hit the equal (=) button after each instruction you give.


Example: 6 x 2 = 12.

,


Example: 12 + 5 = 17.

,


Example: 17 x 50 = 850.

, If their birthday has passed already, then tell them to add 1767 to the prior result. If their birthday is coming up, then ask them to add 1766 to the prior result.


Example 1: (with prior birthday): 850 + 1767 = 2617.
Example 2: (with upcoming birthday): 850 + 1766 = 2616.
Be aware that the numbers are for the year 2017. If you are performing these calculations in a later year, then you would use the numbers 1768 and 1767 for 2018, 1769 and 1768 for 2019, and so on.

,


Example 1: 2617 - 1981 (year of birth) = 636
Example 2: 2616 – 1981 (year of birth) = 635

, The first digit, the one in the hundred’s place, will be the original one chosen. The remaining two numbers will reveal your friend’s age.


Example 1: The answer is 636. 6 was the original number chosen. 36 is the current age.
Example 2: The answer is 635. 6 was the original number chosen. 35 is the current age.

If the number is only two digits, add a zero at the beginning.,
Reverse this number as well.,
Add the last number and its reverse together.,
Show everyone your prediction.",How to Do a Math Magic Trick2," This trick only involves addition and subtraction, but some people get confused by the instructions. It works best on a friend who will pay close attention, and who is unlikely to make a math mistake.

, Announce that you'll write down a ""magic number"" on a piece of paper. Write down 1089 without showing anyone, then fold the paper in half.

, Tell him not to show you the number or tell you what it is. Make sure he understands that none of the three digits can be the same.


For example, he could pick 481.
He might need a simple calculator as well.

, On the next line underneath the number, he should write down the same digits in reverse order.


For example, 481 backwards is 184.

, Now that your volunteer has two numbers, have him subtract the smaller one from the larger one.


481 - 184 = 297.

, Now ask him if his number is two or three digits long, without telling you the actual number. If it is only two digits long, have him place a 0 at the beginning.


In our example, 297 has three digits, so you can skip this step. Sometimes your friend will end up at 99, and this step will turn that into ""099.""

, Ask him to take his answer and reverse the digit order again. If he added the zero the beginning, remind him to include it as part of the number.


For example, the reverse of 297 is 792.

, As the final calculation, your friend adds the last two numbers he wrote down.


In our example, 792 + 297 = 1089.

, Announce that you know the last number he wrote down. Unfold the piece of paper and reveal the 1089 you wrote down earlier.

The answer is always 1089. If your friend has a different answer, he did not follow instructions, or he made a mistake.

Take safety precautions.,
Ball up one hand, leaving a gap between your pinkie and your palm.,
Insert the end of the lighter into your fist.,
Hold the button down for about 5 seconds.,
Remove the lighter from your fist and light it.,
Bring the flame toward the opening in your fist at your pinkie and open your fist.",How to Create a Fire in Your Hand1," If you're going to do this trick, you need to take steps to ensure that you won't set the house on fire and burn yourself. Go outside to do this trick, and find a clear area, without any brush around or anything else that's a fire risk. You need to have a bucket of water handy, in case you need to extinguish flames quickly, and you need to have adult supervision.


If you use gloves, use an old leather glove or lined garden glove that's tight-fitting with a hard palm surface. While wearing bulky flame-retardant gloves is an excellent safety precaution to protect yourself from being burned, cloth gloves in general mostly keep the trick from working at all, and can actually make the trick more dangerous. Bulky flame-resistant gloves will often extinguish the flame before it lights, while a regular glove can absorb the lighter fluid, increasing the possibility that you may light the glove on fire and burn yourself.;
, Make a fist, but leave enough space to insert the end of the lighter into it comfortably. Your fingers need to be relatively tight, so the butane won't escape when you release it into your palm. Use your thumb to cover up the gap on the top of your fist, where you index finger meets your palm.


Try to imagine you were holding water in your palm and keeping as much of it as possible from escaping. The trick basically involves filling your fist with butane, then lighting it as you open your hand.

, Put the flame-end of the lighter into your hand, far enough to push the butane into the pocket your fist creates. It won't work if you're holding the lighter just at the edge of your palm, you need to really get it in there.

, To start the trick, hold down the red button on the lighter, releasing the gas. Do not strike the flint by rolling the thumb-roller, but instead just depress the red button.


Different performers of this trick will hold down the button for longer, or shorter, depending on the gas flow of the lighter, and the size of fireball you want to make. To be on the safe side, it's better to hold it down for around five seconds–long enough to get enough light-able gas, but short enough for the resulting fireball to be relatively brief.
If you get more comfortable handling the lighter, you could then Try to create a bigger one if you want, holding it down for 10 seconds, or slightly longer. But when you're first starting out, go small. This is a dangerous trick, and you don't want to get in over your head.

, After you've counted to five, you need to move quickly, so the butane won't evaporate. Hold the lighter about a foot away from your fist, then strike the flint by rolling your thumb over the roller and holding down the gas button again.


Under no circumstances should you strike the flint while the lighter is still inserted into your fist, having released butane into it. This is extremely dangerous.

, Quickly bring the lit lighter toward your fist, while simultaneously opening your palm, one finger at a time, starting with the pinkie. Do it quickly. The butane will ignite, burning up quickly, and you'll be able to ""control"" the fireball by quickly opening your hand to display it.


The timing takes some practice. You want to ""fan"" your fingers away from the lighter, raising your pinkie first, then your ring finger, and so on to open your fist. If you open all your fingers at once, the butane may not ignite, while if you don't open your fist at all, you risk burning yourself. Under no circumstances should you leave your fist closed.

Be extremely careful.,
Buy a flammable variety of hand sanitizer.,
Take the proper safety precautions.,
Spread a thin layer of alcohol-based sanitizer on the concrete and ignite it.,
Run one finger quickly through the sanitizer.,
Put the flame out by snapping your wrist forcefully.",How to Create a Fire in Your Hand2," This method describes a somewhat-common party trick and YouTube phenomenon, but is not something that should be attempted without extreme care and adult supervision. It's a good way to really hurt yourself if you don't do it quickly and safely.

, This version of the trick involves lighting some hand sanitizer and rubbing your hand through it very quickly, then putting it out immediately. To do this trick, you'll need to make sure you get the right kind of alcohol-based sanitizer: look on the label for ""ethyl"" or ""isopropyl"" alcohol.


There will likely be lots of ingredients in some sanitizers, and only one or two in others, but the presence of one or the other of these varieties of alcohol will make the sanitizer flammable, whatever else is included. Increasingly, hand sanitizers are alcohol-free, though, meaning that they won't work for this trick. Make sure you read the label on the hand sanitizer, or the trick might not work.

, The idea of the trick is to spread a small patch of sanitizer on the surface and light it, creating a small layer of blue flame, which you can very quickly run your finger through, putting it out immediately. Using gloves for this trick is best, and it's also important to have a bucket of water on hand, in case you need to put out fire.


Find a suitable flameproof surface on which to work. You need to go outside to do this trick, preferably on a patch of concrete far away from anything flammable. The flatter, the better. Clear the space of anything flammable–small twigs, sod, bits of paper. You need to be very careful that nothing will catch on fire but the sanitizer.

, Squirt a small amount of sanitizer on the concrete and thin it out, evenly, using your finger. Wipe the sanitizer off your finger, to make sure that there's no chance your fingers will light prematurely. Before the alcohol evaporates, use a lighter and ignite the goo. It should glow with a gentle blue flame that might be somewhat difficult to see.


It's best to do this trick at night, so that you can see the glow better. Make sure you can still see well enough that you what you're doing though. Maybe try it in the evening, when there's soft light and the glow of the flame will be visible.

Under no circumstances should you cover your hands with sanitizer and then light it. The trick only works because of the speed at which you do it, not because the hand sanitizer is safe. This will burn you severely and would be extremely dangerous. Don't do this.

, If you do it quickly, you can scoop up a bit of the sanitizer that's on fire, and it will look momentarily like your fingers are a-flame. As soon as you do this, though, you don't have much time to admire it, because you'll burn yourself if you leave it on for more than a second or two.


You should feel some heat, or a strange sensation, like hot and cold. Hand sanitizer usually has a cooling feeling, which may trick you into thinking it's hot. Either way, you won't have enough time to really feel anything, because you will only swipe your finger through, look at it for a second, and put the flame out.

, The best way to kill the flame is by snuffing it. Blowing on it with a sharp gust can just move around the sanitizer, making it possibly dangerous. It can't be stressed enough: you need to put the flame out as soon as you touch it or you'll burn yourself.


Keep water close by and dunk your hand in it, if necessary. Do not let the fire burn up all the alcohol, or you risk serious injury.

Find a suitable jar.,
Find a head.,
Or, scan your own face.,
Print it out.,
Slash your face.,
Bottle your head.,
Not gross enough yet?,
Seal the jar.,
Display your dead head proudly.",How to Make a Head in a Jar1," It should be about head sized—about 5 gallons (or 5 liters). Jars that size are often used for storage containers or water-cooler bottles. You can find them new in most retail stores that have kitchen supplies, or try Goodwill or Salvation Army.


Aside from not being leaky, quality is not important: the cheaper it looks, the better! The imperfections in the glass or plastic will distort features and be extra creepy looking.;
, You could try grave robbing, for that perfectly rotten look. However, that's generally frowned upon in civilized society, and it smells pretty bad, too.


Look for a picture of a corpse head. Do a search on Google for ""face texture"" or ""zombie texture"" and take your pick. If you start with a regular face texture, you can use a photo editor such as Photoshop to make it truly horrific. Give the skin and lips a bluish tint, add gashes and rot, and other signs of decay. Be creative!

, First determine the direction your scanner scans. Most go from right to left. If so, place your right ear on the scanner bed, and start the scan. As the scan light moves across the bed, rotate your head so that it stays illuminated.


Here's a tip: if you scan at a higher resolution, the scan will be much slower, making it easier to track the scanner as it moves.

, Once you've got your face texture ready, edited, and prepped for pickling, scale the face to a realistic size and then print it out.


Measure your eye-to-eye distance, then scale the drawing to the same approximate size. Eyes are somewhere between one and two inches apart, for most people.

, With deadly sharp scissors, cut your face out. You may laminate the paper to make it a little more rigid, or simply print it out on cardstock or a heavy paper.


For extra creepiness, get some fake eyeballs, and put them into the eye sockets...or let them float freely.

, Roll the face up and drop it into the jar. Stuff the jar with paper so that the picture is flattened against the inner surfaces of the glass.

, Add the hair. You can use theatrical hair like the kind you'll find in a Halloween store, but it may look too fake. You can also use real hair that you can probably get for free, right from the floor of your local barber shop or beauty salon.


Stuff the hair into the jar so that it looks messy and rotten. Work it around with a screwdriver to get the desired amount of grossness.

, You do not what that head getting out, terrorizing you and your family in the middle of the night.

, For a final touch place it somewhere visible so that it will creep people out.

Understand the legal ramifications.,
Know that you must go alone.,
Understand what you're running from.,
Get rid of certain possessions.,
Disconnect yourself.,
Get rid of the plastic.,
Lie.,
Gather your resources.,
Leave town.,
Cultivate new habits.",How to Disappear Completely," Be aware that, depending on the circumstances of your disappearance, you could be held legally accountable in a variety of ways if you're ever found. There are many good reasons and good ways to disappear, but there are more bad reasons and bad ways to do so.


For instance, if a large search party is sent to look for you, you might have to pay back the agency that incurred the costs of the search. Therefore, do not pack your suitcase and start walking.
If you're disappearing to escape debts or substantiate an insurance claim, you could be charged with fraud and imprisoned. Know that staging your own death or disappearance is a serious and potentially illegal act before you proceed.
If you want to disappear to escape a gang or if you're being blackmailed or stalked, contact law enforcement immediately. There are legal ways to change your identity and stay safe in these situations.

If you are the victim of domestic abuse, the number of the National Domestic Violence Hotline is 1-800-799-7233. It is confidential and safe. If you have a child with you, call 1-800-4ACHILD for immediate assistance for the both of you.;
, Your odds of being discovered increase dramatically if you intend to disappear with another person, especially a child.


Further, disappearing with a child could get you charged with kidnapping or child endangerment if you're discovered. Even if you have good intentions, you're on a paved road to hell.
If you have any reason for disappearance that incriminates another person, take legal action before vanishing to protect yourself from allegations that could be made in the future.

, After all, you're not staging a vanishing act for no reason. When they say ""keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer,"" this is a situation they were referring to. Know what you're up against to decrease your chance of being found.


If you're running from a spouse or family member, think about their resources. How far would they go to find you? How much money do they have to spend?
If you're running from the police, the IRS, or immigration officers, you have your work cut out for you. These are men and women who have decades of experience and have no personal investment in your struggle. Familiarize yourself with their tactics to prolong your escape.

, You want to make sure whoever might follow up on you has absolutely zero leads. It's best to tie up loose ends and not fake your own kidnapping. Make sure it's clear that you vanished under voluntary circumstances.


Destroy as many pictures of you as possible. This keeps family and friends from going around town asking others if they've seen you.
Abandon your car. Leave the pink slip in the glove box, the door unlocked, the window down, and park it in a bad area. A thief's lucky day.
Don't be tempted to take mementos with you. This will connect you to your old life, making you want to go back home, and be a resource for your opposition later on. Your favorite hat, water bottle, and cowboy boots will have to go.

, In today's world, this step is one of the most imperative. Slowly decrease your activity until none is the norm. When you delete your Facebook and Twitter profiles, no one will be any wiser. Investigators will be hard-pressed to find traces of you and online friends can't be tapped for information.


This step takes preparation. You cannot pack your bags and walk out the door tomorrow; if you do, you will fail at disappearing. Start disposing of your old personality one bit at a time.
Leave early in the morning, when your parents are in bed, or after school, but only if they work late or do night shifts. If leaving at night, be cautious. Stay calm; don't panic.
Tell your friends and family that you're taking a break from the bombardment of stimuli forced upon you by the internet. If you cannot do this, you're not ready to disappear.

, From now on, you'll be using cash. Credit cards are the easiest way to track a person; cut them up into tiny, unrecognisable pieces and throw them away, or burn them and dispose of the ash. You may want to dispose of the trash yourself if you're concerned someone will go through it.


Do not think of keeping them for an emergency. Get rid of them to avoid the temptation. Your old identity is not a crutch to be used when you're tired and hungry.
Ditch anything plastic tied to your name. Is it a video rental card? Gone. American Eagle membership? Adios! Delta Airlines SkyMiles Premiere Flyer? Au revoir, mon petit chou. You cannot use a coupon code, a PIN, or anything that could be tied to your former name. Cash, cash, cash.
Consider riding a bike, traveling by train or bus, and walking, as these modes of transport don't require you to possess a driver's license. But if you do choose to travel by public transport, be aware that others are able to see you, security footage may be taken, and you could get yourself caught if you aren't careful. And don't hitchhike or take taxis/minicabs, as the drivers could foil your plans and report you to the police.
Flying anywhere is probably out of the question. There's no way to buy a plane ticket at most airlines without putting forth a lot of personal information, including a credit/debit card. Doing so under your real identity is certainly impossible. You will be tracked whether it's interstate or international (where you will also have to pass through customs). Of all consumer businesses Airlines have the closest visible connection to NSA, FBI, and other security organizations. You could try to use a fake identity and passport, but the scrutiny is increasingly intensive and deceptive. You may not be flat out denied boarding your flight but you might be in for a surprise at your destination where someone is waiting to arrest you.

, There's no right way around it--you're going to have to lie to those around you. It's an unfortunate truth, but hopefully worth it in the end.


Create false leads to companies. Change your address, ""correct"" the spelling of your name, book a flight to Chile with no intention of ever getting on. Create a backstory that will confuse anyone who starts to sniff out your trail. Stick to one fake identity; having several will be confusing, and people may get suspicious.
You're going to have to lie to friends and family. As you start coming around less and less, it's inevitable that you'll have to field their questions. If you are unwilling to cut ties completely with them, establish ways in advance of staying in contact. Superfluous email accounts used on public computers, prepaid phones--there are ways to do this if you think it through. They may not be able to find you, but you can find them.
Tell no one, if possible and necessary. Even your closest friend in the entire world cannot know. Circumstances may change and they'll feel new obligations to inform those concerned about your whereabouts.
Create a ruse. Make a long-term plan. You have cash for now and a plan for the next 4 weeks, but what about after that? How will you maintain this identity as you sip from a coconut you had chopped down personally while sunbathing on the coast of Belize?






A good disappearing act takes work. If you've the means, start a ""corporation"" that pays for all your bills. It should only be loosely tied to you by ""name"" and handles all your expenses.
Spend the months before you vanish slowly withdrawing cash and setting up a way to maintain the flow. You do not want to end up doing anything quickly and haphazardly, causing eyebrows to raise.
It's best not to pay for (or steal) a false social security number or a passport. You could be sporting the identity of a convict or a deceased person and/or the passport could be bogus (as you're in line at the airport, being looked at heavily by a customs officer). Keep the looming jail time to a minimum.

, Before you disappear, make sure you'll have what you need to survive. Slowly move your assets to cash and store your money in a secure location until you're ready to leave. Purchase any supplies, before or after your disappearance, with cash.


If you're going rogue, potentially necessary items include a large backpack, warm clothes, waterproofs, sturdy shoes, a tent, a lightweight sleeping bag, maps, a compass, and a pocket knife.
If you're taking a more luxurious way out, gather your cash, necessary papers, and a few basic items of clothing. Don't take valuable or sentimental items with you; expensive things may be stolen or used to track you down, and if someone notices a favored memento of yours missing along with you, they'll catch onto your plan.

, Now that you're all set, where will you go? Take time to decide. The world is your oyster. The only thing stopping you is customs.


If you're considering going international, research any visas or government regulations you'll need to adhere to. Many cheaper countries make it easy to live for long periods of time, but if you want to do it legally, you'll need residency cards and a current identity to show them.
If you're staying in your country, weigh your chances of being found. Make sure you know no one within 100 miles (160 km) of the area and, of course, never frequent a vacation spot you used to visit.
Commit. Not taking time to plan out your disappearance, buying false papers on the deep web or from one-eyed Fred, and hitching a ride to Tijuana is a recipe for a disaster and an even bigger headache than the one you're running away from. Commit yourself to this idea and allow time to plan it successfully.






This vanishing act will take its toll on you physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Take some time to weigh up the pros and cons of disappearing, and determine whether or not you're up for the challenge.

, If you don't develop a completely new persona, you'll fall into the same patterns that made you want to flee in the first place.


People can often be recognised by their movements, so if you usually dawdle, walk quickly, or vice versa.
Buy clothes you normally wouldn't wear. If you're a t-shirt and jeans kind of guy, become Mr. Businessman. If you're that girl who's into hipster glasses and combat boots, opt for the polo. A new sense of fashion will make it easier to think of yourself as a different person.
Cut and dye your hair a natural colour that won't attract attention.
Eat different foods. If you're addicted to the Baconator™, it's gonna have to be cold turkey. Ditch your old eating habits and hit the grocery store with your wad o' cash. Avoiding restaurants (especially ones you used to visit regularly) and familiar patterns makes it harder to trace you and easier to forget yourself.
Make it impossible to trace you. Even after you're gone, you won't know who could be looking for you. It'll take constant diligence, but the peace of mind is priceless.






Wear a hat indoors. Most public places have security cameras and if they're on your scent, they'll monitor these.
Clean up after yourself. Leaving hotel rooms trashed with evidence of fingerprints and bodily fluids is asking for a police report. Wherever you go, make it so you were barely ever there.
Stay away from snail mail. If it's known you're in a particular area, this can quickly narrow down your opposition's search. Only use snail mail to disorganize and confuse the ones you're running from.

Set up the envelope beforehand.,
Get a willing participant.,
Ask the first two questions.,
Ask the last two questions.,
Tally up the numbers.,
Reveal the envelope’s contents.",How to Do a Cool Magic Trick2," Take the current year, for example, 2016, and multiple it by two. For 2016, the doubled number would come out to be 4032. This is the ‘’magic’’ number that you will get your audience members to come up with. Write the ‘’magic’’ number on a sheet of paper and seal it in an envelope.


Seal the envelope using its sealant or with tape for a more dramatic effect., Try practicing this trick on somebody in your home, like a parent, before taking it out to the classroom or work. Ask the participant if they’re willing to answer a series of question and do a little math.


You should also have a pen and paper with you when you talk to the participant.

, Eventually the participant will write down four numbers that adds up to the number you sealed in the envelope. First, ask them to write down what year they were born. Then ask them to write down what age they will be turning or turned this current year.


For the year, they should write something like 1995. The age they’ll be turning, for 2016, is 21. In this example they should have “1995 + 21” written down on a piece of paper.

, The next two questions are a bit trickier, but with enough practice you can make them sound natural. Ask them if they have an anniversary coming up this year. This can be their 10th year since graduating, 1st year with a significant other, or their grandparents 55th wedding anniversary. Take down the numbers as followed:


First, ask them to write down the year that the anniversary first took place, like 1961.
Then ask them to jot down how many years they’ll be celebrating since that date. For this example above it’d be 55., Once you’ve gotten your participant to answer the questions you’ve asked, tell them to total up all the numbers. If you follow the example above for the year, 2016, the numbers would look like: 1995 + 21 + 1961 + 55.


Once you see their totaled numbers, make sure that this number matches the one you wrote down in the envelope.
You should use a calculator if you aren't confident in your math skills.

, Once they’ve added up the numbers from the series of questions, you’re ready to open the envelope. You can say a magic word or phrase at this point to create the magical environment. Open the envelope and show the results to your participant.


It creates an even better effect if you have the participant open the envelope and read the number first.

Snap the bill.,
Perform the act in public.",How to Do a Cool Magic Trick3," Take a spare dollar from your wallet and fold it accordion style into thirds. Accordion style fold means to fold one part and then fold another part on top of that fold. Do not fold each part in the same direction. Switch directions of the fold each fold.Imagine or research how an accordion opens and closes. This is where the term, accordion fold, gets its name.

, Place the first paper clip on top of the folded bill with the shorter end facing you. This paper clip will go over the outer layer of the folded bill (facing you), and into the middle of the folded bill. Position the first paper clip so it is near the right edge of the bill.

, Attach the second paper clip to the back of the folded bill with shorter side facing away from you. The large section of the second paper clip should be through the middle part of the bill. Position the second clip to the left edge of the bill.


Position the second paper clip in the opposite position as the first one.

, Take one end of the bill in each hand. In one smooth motion, snap your hands apart, unraveling the dollar bill. In this motion the paper clips will fly into the air. Once the paper clips land, they will be attached.If the paper clips aren't attached, reconnect the clips and see if you initially set up the paper clips in the correct order.

, You should practice setting up this trick quickly before showcasing it to the public. Have the dollar bill already folded up in your pocket to make it appear as though it is a normal crinkled dollar. Show your audience the two separated paper clips and then quickly attach them to the dollar bill.

This trick works best on smaller children who won’t suspect what you’re doing.

, Ask your audience for a number between 1 and 10. Once they give you a number, write the number into the sugar cube. Trace over the number several times with your pencil to make sure the number is bold., Pick up the sugar cube so that the side with the number is facing your thumb. Apply pressure so that the pencil mark transfers onto your thumb. Then, drop the sugar cube into the glass of water.


You will need to apply a lot of pressure, so push your thumb into the cube with force.

Loosen your grip gradually.",How to Bend a Spoon2," This technique can look good on camera, but you won’t fool a live audience, particularly not up close. It could conceivably work live if done at a distance, but as there is no simple way to produce an unbroken spoon, it would be difficult to end well., If you have a hacksaw you can use it to cut the bowl of the spoon off the handle. If not, manually bending the spoon back and forth a few times should do the trick just as well. Sand down any sharp edges when you are done.







, You hand should be positioned almost like you are making the hand signal for “okay,” but with your middle, ring, and little fingers relaxed instead of extended. Grip the two parts of the spoon in such a way that it creates the illusion you are holding a whole spoon., Both sides of the spoon will droop downward, creating the illusion that it is bending.

, Hold it with the front of the spoon facing up, and bend the handle down to make a 90-degree angle. With the handle perpendicular to the floor, the bowl of the spoon should face skyward.








, If you are right handed, the bowl should point to your right; if you are left handed, it should point to your left. The handle should lie flat against your palm, and be angled so that it is concealed behind your wrist, rather than jutting out visibly under your hand. The rest of your fingers will form a visual shield, blocking the handle of the bent spoon from view. Make sure they are held together, with no cracks showing between them., The idea is to create the illusion that the broken handle is attached to the bowl of the bent spoon. Try to grip it more with the tips of your fingers, so that you will be able to roll back your grip on the broken handle, loosening it while still holding on to the bent spoon firmly.







, It will droop downward, creating the illusion that it is bending. Make sure not to loosen your grip so much that you drop the broken handle.







, With a quick flourish, “bend” the broken handle all the way into your palm—making sure the two handles don’t clunk together audibly—and slide the bent spoon up out of your fist with your other hand.








, Hold it up for them to see, tap it against the table a few times, or invite a member of the audience to examine it. While their attention is on the bent spoon, slip the broken handle into your pocket.

Say your right and follow the following steps:
Explain ""some cards are back to face"" --- split the lower part of the deck and show them that the bottom half is back to face.
Explain ""some cards are face to back"" ---split the top part of the deck and show them that the top is face to back.
Explain ""some cards are even back to back"" and find the point in the deck that is back to back. (there should only be one back to back spot)

Determine if your wood sample is oak.,
Decide if it’s cherry.,
Determine if it is walnut.,
Decide if a light-colored wood is maple.",How to Identify Wood1," Look at an end piece. If it doesn’t exhibit rings or grain, it is likely a piece of plywood and it won’t be able to be identified.;
, Most woods take on a blue or grayish color as they weather in wind, sun and rain. Stained woods may be made to look like another type of wood, and you can tell if the color is very uneven or there is a varnish on it, that it may be stained.


If either of these colorations describes your wood, you may need to move on to the third method, since visual identification is extremely hard. A laboratory can look at the wood under a microscope and determine what it is.

, This is essential to identifying it based on color and grain.

, This is an extremely common furniture wood. It is usually a light brown, but can look slightly red or blonde. Slightly dark lines, or ""grain,"" run through the wood.

, If the wood is reddish in appearance but has a darker, browner grain, it is likely cherry. Keep in mind that stained poplar can be virtually impossible to distinguish from cherry.

, This is the most common of the darker woods. It tends to have larger rays in the grain and take on a rich, chocolate brown.

, This is the most common of the blond colored woods and is often used in trim, flooring and in countertops. It has a wide grain.


Keep in mind that a blond colored wood can also be pine. However, pine is characterized by a more distinctive grain. It is also much lighter and softer than maple.
A yellow type of light-colored wood is poplar. It is a common, inexpensive hardwood that can be stained to look like cherry, walnut or other colors."

Look out for cracks and holes.",How to Get Gorgeous Wood Cheaply," There are essentially two types of wood to choose from for a project: hardwoods and softwoods. Each have benefits and drawbacks depending on your needs.Hardwoods are made from trees that lose their leaves in the fall. Hardwoods are generally denser than softwoods, but they have larger pores making for a rougher appearance. If you're making high-quality furniture, desks, flooring, or any type of construction work that needs to last longterm, go for hardwoods.
Softwoods are from evergreen trees, which do not lose their leaves in the winter. Soft woods have smaller pours, making them look somewhat smoother. Lighter types of projects, such as windows and doors, are made from softwoods. If you're not making a heavy-duty wood project, you can go for softwoods.;
, If possible, you should know what grade your wood is to assess its quality. When buying cheaper wood, or salvaging free wood, this may not be possible. In situations where you can get the wood's grade, make sure to do so. This can help you determine if you're getting a good deal.Hardwoods are graded on the amount of usable material in the wood, as well as the number of defects. Lower grades may be acceptable for smaller projects, or for foundational materials. Wood graded as ""First and Second"" or ""Select"" is higher grade material. These products have 83% usable material. Wood grade as ""#1 Common"" and ""#2 Common"" is of lower quality. These products have between 66% and 50% usable material.
Softwoods are graded based on strength and appearance. Woods with a lower grade tend to have more defects. C Select and D Select softwoods have the least defects, while 2 Common and 3 Common have the most defects. If you're using wood for something like shelves, you can probably get by with a lower graded softwood.

, Softwoods comes in many types. If you require softwood for your project, figure out what type you want. Keep in mind, however, when going for cheap wood, you may not get your first choice. Have an idea of a few different types of softwood you would be okay with using.Cedar has a reddish color and is very soft. It's frequently used for things like decks, furniture, and building exteriors. Douglas Fir also has a reddish tint, and is relatively inexpensive. It can be a great alternative to cedar. It can also be used for furniture making.
Pine is very soft and easy to work with, and has a very light color. One downside is that pine stains very easily.
Redwood is typically used for outdoor projects. It has a reddish tint to it. It tends to be moderately priced, but you may be able to find cheaper redwood when looking in the right places.

, If your project requires hardwood, figure out what type of hardwood you need. As with softwood, you may not get your first choice when seeking out cheap wood, so have a few different types you would be willing to use.Ash has a pale-brown appearance and is easier to work with than most hardwoods, but is somewhat difficult to find. Ash is probably not the best option when seeking cheap wood, as it's presence in the market is limited. If you want a pale wood, go for birch over ash. It also a pale appearance and tends to be less expensive than other hardwoods.
Cherry wood has a reddish-brown color and is very popular as it's easy to work with. However, it can be very expensive, so it may be difficult to find it cheap. Mahogany also has a reddish tint, and may be cheaper.
Maple is among the cheapest varieties of hardwood. Cheap maple can often be found at lumberyards. Poplar is another fairly inexpensive hardwood, that has a lighter color.

, Commercial woodworking firms are businesses that make wood products like furniture. These can include furniture factories, milling companies, and companies that install wood floors. Such companies almost always have leftover scraps from a given project that end up discarded.You can buy scraps for fairly cheap. You will have to go to a local woodworking firm and ask to speak to the manager. If there is any leftover wood from a recent project, the manager may be willing to sell this wood to you for cheap. As this wood is being used in projects like furniture and floors, it should be fairly attractive in appearance.
One major downside is the wood you obtain will be small and fairly irregular in size. The wood pieces may be difficult to use for certain projects.

, Lumber mills and yards often have an abundance of scrap material. You can talk to the yard manager. He or she may be willing to sell you scrap material at a low price.With lumber yards and mills, bugs are a major disadvantage. You will have to inspect wood for bugs, and may have to discard infected pieces. Often, you are only able to use a small amount of a large pile of wood.

, Cheap wood materials can often be found online. Postings on websites like Craiglist list may sell wood for cheap, or old furniture you can scrap for wood. Also, check out Facebook community pages. A woodworking community page may include posts by users selling cheap wood or other furniture that can be scraped.Use common sense when buying online. You should always see a product and examine it before making a purchase. You should also meet the seller in public to assure your own safety.
If you're part of a Facebook community, you can also make a post letting people know what you need. Specify the type of wood and your price range. Someone may be able to give you a lead on a cheap source of wood.

, Old furniture can often be broken down and the wood can be reused in another project. With a little hunting, you can often find cheap and gorgeous sources of wood at places like junk stores, yard sales, and flea markets.Pay attention to any item that contains wood. An old sofa that's falling apart may be set on a wood frame that's still high quality. You may be able to buy this item for very cheap, given it's not really usable, and obtain attractive wood in the process.
One downside is that you need to break down such products, which takes extra time and labor. You may also end up with irregular pieces that are not quite shaped for your needs.

, If a business has just opened, many materials are often shipped in pallets or crates. Businesses may want to discard of this material quickly and efficiently, so they may be willing to give it away for free on request.Stop by new businesses and talk to a manager. Oftentimes, managers are eager to discard waste to get the store running. The manager may be enthusiastic about unloading unwanted shipping crates on you.
However, you may not get the wood you desire in this process. You're limited to the materials used in crates. You may want to ask to see the crates before deciding to take them, as you may dislike the color, texture, or grain.

, Construction sites and burn sites generate a huge amount of waste. A large amount of wood may be found in dumpsters of these areas.Always ask permission before going through dumpsters. You want to make sure you're legally allowed to salvage wood from such places.
One major downside is you have to dig through a dumpster. You'll have to do things like wear gloves for your own safety.

, Oftentimes, furniture is abandoned on the side of the road. People moving quickly may not have time to bring furniture with them, and simply leave it on the roadside. If you find roadside furniture made of quality wood material, you can salvage the wood for free.If you live near a college town, you could take a drive through the neighborhoods there. Roadside furniture is very common in college towns.
One major downside is that you have to breakdown the furniture yourself. This adds labor, and there may be extra costs for materials.

, If you're part of a woodworking community, people may sometimes have scrap wood they're willing to give away for free. The site Freecycle was actually specifically made to give away wood for free. You will have to be vigilant about monitoring such websites to find wood that meets your needs.On some woodworking forums, people may request a small favor in exchange for wood. If you're willing to put a small amount of labor into the process, you can get wood for more or less free.

, Old furniture may have been tossed due to a bedbug infestation. Bedbugs are difficult to remove and tend to breed quickly. You do not want to bring bedbug infested furniture into your home.There may be rusty red stains on the furniture, particularly near cracks and crevices.
Tiny pale yellowish flakes may be eggs or discarded skins.
There may be tiny dark spots, which are droppings of bedbugs.

, Cheap wood may be cheap for a reason. When making a purchase, you want to check wood for common defects and imperfections. Some products, even if they are priced very low, may not be worth your time and money.A board may be curved from end-to-end, which can make it difficult to work with.
Wood can also have crooks or uneven patterns. Wood may have a indent, known as a cup, running through the shorter side.

, Cheap wood may be cracked or filled with knotholes. While you may be able to work with cheap wood despite these flaws, an abundance of cracks and knot holes can make wood unstable.Knotholes are generally less of a problem than cracks. They can usually be worked around in a project, but some people dislike the appearance.
There may be small cracks between grains of woods. Some pieces of wood may have a crack running all the way through the piece. These can be more difficult to work around when using cheap wood.

Essential tools for these tasks are a tape measure, a carpenter's pencil, and a combination square.;
, Of course, making cuts in wood is the backbone of woodworking. A handheld circular saw is an essential power tool for making straight cuts, while a jigsaw is ideal for making rounded cuts. A handheld backsaw provides a cheap and quiet alternative to these power tools.

, To create woodworking projects with elegant, finished appearances, you'll often want to shape the wood by creating beveled edges or intricate molding. Crucial tools for shaping wood include a block plane, which will allow you to create basic beveled edges, and a router, which can be fitted with a variety of bits allowing for more intricate patterns.

, Screws, nails, and glue are the go-to choices for assembling your woodworking projects. A cordless drill is essential for drilling holes, while a screwdriver, hammer, and clamps are also very useful.

Use clean cloths to remove any type of residue left on the surface after the product has been sanded or handled as part of the construction of the counter, cabinet or table. The idea is to remove any dust or other residue that would cause a bubbling or crackling appearance to the finish once it is applied;
, Typically, this involves considering what type of finish will allow the piece to blend into the room where it will be positioned. In some instances, painting will make it possible to pick up 1 or more of the colors in the space and incorporate the piece into the room with greater ease. For rooms with a lot of exposed and varnished wood, the application of a wood stain to the MDF may be a better option.

, If painting, apply a coat of primer to the surface of the MDF, as this will help the paint to adhere. Once the primer is dry, begin the painting. For staining, dip a clean cloth into the stain and wipe it over the surface of the MDF, taking care to follow the pattern of the compressed wood product. In both cases, make sure the top coat is even and the appearance is uniform.

, Once the stain or paint has dried, use a clear sealant or lacquer to protect the appearance of the finished MDF. Doing so will help inhibit scratching that would damage the look of the piece. Make sure the sealant is applied evenly across the surface and allow it to dry before moving the piece into position.

Learn to create a glued or screwed butt joint.,
Use a biscuit joiner for strong, attractive joints.,
Create grooved joints for extra surface area.,
Explore traditional woodworking joints for extra beauty.",How to Get Started in Woodworking2," When joining wood, the most straightforward approach is the butt joint, in which you simply butt the end grain of one panel against the side of another. This joint can be secured with glue for a clean appearance, or with screws for a sturdier, if less attractive finish.

, A biscuit joiner is a power tool that cuts a narrow groove into the end of each piece of wood to be joined. You can then fit small wood chips called ""biscuits"" into these grooves, which gives you extra stability for a glued joint.

, Another way to increase the surface area for the glue to adhere to is by cutting a groove into one piece of wood. These grooves allow the second piece of wood to contact the first piece along multiple surfaces. Rabbits, dadoes, and grooves are 3 types of this joint, so named based on the orientation of the cut to the wood's grain.

, Of course, the 2 quintessential woodworking joints are the dovetail and the mortise and tenon, in which the 2 wood pieces interlock with each other. These joints take much more careful cutting to create, but are unrivaled in their elegance and strength.

Learn the basic oil and wax finish.,
Seal woodworking projects with polyurethane for durability.,
Experiment with other wood finishes as desired.",How to Get Started in Woodworking3," The most error-proof way to finish wood projects is by applying boiled linseed oil and furniture wax. These finishes can be applied with cotton rags, and thus eliminate any danger of leaving brush strokes or other defects.

, For surfaces that take more abuse, like a dining room table, you'll want a finish that cures to a hard, protective layer. Polyurethane is the standard product for this type of finish, and can be applied using a foam brush or a high-quality bristle brush.

, Of course, there are plenty of other ways to finish wood, each with their own advantages, drawbacks, and appearances. Wood stains, paints, lacquers, varnishes, teak oil, and Danish oil are all common options for creating durable, attractive finishes in your woodworking projects.

How building class is determined:
All buildings must be classified into one of six construction classes (see number 3).,
What to ask:
To determine the ISO class of the building, we must therefore know the following composition of the building elements:


Structural frame
Bearing walls (interior and exterior)
Floor construction
Roof construction
What the fire rating of the materials

,
Building classes:
All construction types must be classified into the following (all of which are explained extensively below):



Frame Construction (ISO Class I, IBC Type V)

Joisted Masonry (ISO Class 2, IBC Type III, IBC Type IV)

Light Noncombustible (ISO Class 3, IBC Type IIB)

Masonry Noncombustible (ISO Class 4, IBC Type IIA)

Modified Fire Resistive (ISO Class 5, IBC Type IB)

Fire Resistive (ISO Class 6, IBC Type IA)

,
International Building Code (IBC) versus Insurance Services Office (ISO):
These are two major sources identifying construction types, both of which will be addressed in the construction types outlined below.",How to Determine a Building's Construction Type1," Classification of a building class is based on two factors: building elements and fire-resistance rating. These factors may not be included in the submission/documentation, in which case additional information will need to be requested.



Building elements: The building materials used in the construction of the following elements are the foundation for classification, be they wood, steel, or masonry.

Structural frame
Exterior bearing walls
Interior bearing walls
Exterior nonbearing walls and partitions
Interior non-bearing walls and partitions
Floor construction, including supporting beams and joists
Roof construction, including supporting beams and joists, are comprised of



Fire-resistance rating: This is the other factor in determining construction class. The building materials used in the construction of the building elements above will have a fire-resistance rating. Fire-resistance rating typically means the duration for which a passive fire protection system can withstand a standard fire resistance test. This can be quantified simply as a measure of time (ex. 0 hours, 1 hour, or 2 hours), or it may entail a host of other criteria involving other evidence of functionality or fitness for purpose.


“Minimum” rule: It is important to remember when selecting the construction class that the building is only as strong as its weakest element. For example, a masonry building may have an unprotected wood roof. The wood roof is the weakest member such that it has no fire-resistance. Thus, the construction class would be Joisted Masonry (see below). Now imagine this same building with a metal deck roof. So long as the supporting members of the building do not contain wood then this building would be Masonry Noncombustible (see below).

;
,,, ISO is traditionally what insurance companies use to denote type, whereas IBC is what architects and builders use. While one company may use ISO classifications, many submission documents may reference IBC classifications and it is important to be able to convert this to an ISO classification. (There have been situations where a frame building has been incorrectly classified as fire resistive because the submittal was read incorrectly!) The following explains what is expected under both:



International Building Code (IBC): This is a model building code developed by the International Code Council (ICC). It has been adopted throughout most of the United States. A large portion of the International Building Code deals with fire prevention. It differs from the related International Fire Code in that the IBC handles fire prevention in regards to construction and design and the fire code handles fire prevention in an ongoing basis. Parts of the code reference other codes including the International Plumbing Code, the International Mechanical Code, the National Electric Code, and various National Fire Protection Association Standards. IBC is more descriptive and also includes A or B types of construction for each class.


A is protected, meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have an additional fire rated coating or cover by means of sheetrock, spray on, or other approved method. The additional fire rated coating or cover extends the fire resistance of the structural members by at least 1 hour.

B is unprotected, meaning that all structural members of a building or structure have no additional fire rated coating or cover. Exposed members are only fire resistant according to their natural ability, characteristics, and fire rating.



Insurance Services Office (ISO): This is a provider of data, underwriting, risk management, and legal/regulatory services to property-casualty insurers and other clients.

Choose the right kind of blade.,
Set the saw blade to the right depth.,
Support the whole piece of wood.,
Cut with the good side down.,
Mark your cutting line.,
Use a guide to cut.,
Make your cut.",How to Cut Plywood1," To get a smooth cut on a sheet of plywood, you'll need to have the right blade. Look for a carbide-tipped blade with a high tooth count.You can find blades labeled for plywood or ""finished cuts,"" but make sure to check the tooth count.Blades come in various sizes, so be sure you get one that will fit your circular saw.If you stick with the blade that came with your saw, you'll likely end up with splintered ends, also known as tear-outs.;
, Before cutting your plywood, adjust your saw blade to the right depth. If your blade is set too deep, you'll be dragging a lot of excess blade through the sheet. If you have your blade set too shallow, you run the risk of not cutting all the way through the sheet.You want your saw to be about .25 inches (0.6 cm) below the sheet. If you're cutting a sheet of plywood that is .75 inches (1.9 cm) thick, set your blade to 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep., When cutting a sheet of plywood, it's important that you support the sheet on both sides of the cut.








A few long 2x4s laid across two sawhorses will keep the sheet steady as you cut. Keep the 2x4s handy just for this task, as you'll be cutting into the tops of them with your circular saw.If you don't have access to 2x4s or sawhorses, you can use a piece of rigid foam insulation instead. Lay the foam on the ground, and lay the sheet of plywood on top. Make sure the wood doesn't slide around on top of the foam board.If you use the foam board method, you can crawl across the board as you cut, and you don't have to worry about the board snapping off at the end of the cut., When using a circular saw, place your plywood on the cutting surface with the good face down. The teeth of the blade enter the sheet from underneath, and exit at the top. When the teeth exit, they may cause some chipping. Placing the sheet with the good face down will ensure a smooth surface., Use a straight edge to mark your line. Measure carefully and make sure you have the cutting line square with the edge of your plywood.For a smoother cut, score your line. Use a utility knife to score your line before you cut. You may have to run your knife over the line a few times to get it to score completely.A good rule to follow is ""measure twice, cut once."" If you cut the wood wrong, you can't do much to fix it other than start over with a new piece of wood.

, Find a piece of plywood that still has its factory edge and attach it to your cutting surface using clamps.Take into consideration the width of the saw's base plate, or shoe. Adjust your guide so that the shoe fits firmly against the guide, and the blade is in line with your cut mark.
If you are planning on cutting a lot of plywood, you might consider investing in a saw guide that attaches to your circular saw. Look online or in your local hardware store to find one that suits your needs., Line your saw up with your guide, and make sure the blade is over your cut mark. Turn your saw on, and run the shoe of the saw along your guide. Take care to make your cut as straight as possible.








Using a saw is dangerous. Wear safety goggles at all times, and keep your fingers clear of the blade.
Watch out for the power cord as you cut. Keep your work area clean.

Blunt the point of the nail with your hammer.,
Lubricate your nail.,
Avoid nailing very near the edge or end of the board.,
Use the smallest diameter nail which will do the job, or hold the workpieces securely.,
Pre-drill a hole slightly smaller than the nail's shank diameter.,
Use wood with sufficient moisture if possible.,
Use softwoods where they are suitable for your purposes, rather than hardwoods.,
Avoid nailing through, or very near knots in the lumber.,
Back any nail out if a crack begins to appear while driving it.,
Finished.

",How to Drive a Nail Without Splitting the Wood," This is done by placing the nail on a hard surface with the point facing up, and tapping the sharp end with your hammer. The nail will then cut its way through the wood grain, rather than wedging a pathway. Though this puts all the material displacement along a single plain, rather than dispersing it all around the point of the nail.;
, For especially hard woods like oak or maple, you may have better luck if you dip the nail in petroleum jelly, which reduces the friction of the driving process, and can decrease the probability of the wood splitting.

, Where end nailing is necessary, angle the nail so that it can be started farther away from the end, but the nail will still get a bite into the other board it is being nailed to.

, Obviously, a 16d or 20d nail, with its larger diameter, will exert more force on the wood's grain, making the wood more likely to split.

, For a 12d nail, about 3⁄32 inch (0.2 cm) will reduce the pressure of the nail penetration without decreasing the nail's grip on the board.

, Very dry wood is more likely to split, since the drier the wood is, the less flexible it will be.

, Douglas Fir, Southern Yellow Pine, or Lodge pole Pine are less likely to split than are Oak, Birch, or Maple.

, Knots are usually formed by heartwood, which is harder and less flexible than sapwood.

, A tiny crack is a sure indication the wood will split if you continue, possibly ruining a board if it is being used for trim work. You may have to look at choosing another location for your nail, further from the end or edge of the board, or pre-drill a hole for a wood screw or other fastening method.

Mix borate and water.,
Spray the mixture over the wood.,
Protect the wood from water.,
Seal the wood with a penetrating water repellant.,
Heat or freeze wood.",How to Fumigate Wood1," Find a borate chemical wherever pest control products are sold. Look for Timbor, Boracare, or a similar product. Follow the directions on their label for use. Typically, these products are a powder that you must combine with an equal amount of water in a handheld sprayer.Borate works best in wood that won’t be exposed to water. It is a chemical that is not a threat to your health, unlike gas fumigants.;
, Use the handheld sprayer or brush to apply the chemical. Cover any sides of the wood you can reach. This is difficult in homes, where most of the wood will be covered, so it’s best to apply borate when the house is framed.If your wood furniture has varnish, you’ll need to strip the varnish so the borate can soak into the wood. Scrape off the varnish or apply a chemical stripper.
Any stains left by the borate should be wiped up with warm water before the finish is reapplied.

, Water washes the borate off the wood. To ensure it soaks in, cover the wood with a tarp. Move furniture to a safe storage area. Make sure there’s no dampness or leaks in the area., Get a product such as Thompson’s or Rainguard. Spray or brush it onto the wood. Read the directions on the label to find out how often the repellant needs to be reapplied. The repellent will keep the borate inside the wood even when exposed to water., If borate isn’t enough, or you don’t want to strip the finish on the wood, extreme temperatures can help. You will have to treat the wood in a kiln, heating chamber, or freezer. The object would have to be heated for one and a half hours at 150℉ (66℃) or frozen at -4℉ (-20℃) for a week. Search your area for commercial treatment areas if you don’t have the space or tools to do it yourself.The wood must sealed in a bag before freezing to protect it from moisture.
Extreme temperatures can warp and otherwise damage wood.

Install a Forstner or Brad-point bit on your drill press.,
Set the plunge depth for the drill.,
Set up a fence guide for the wood you’re cutting.,
Mark endpoints for the slot on the board.,
Drill the endpoints first.,
Drill overlapping holes along the length of the slot.,
Use a sharp chisel to shave off the nubs between drill holes.,
Use a flat file to smooth the bumps.,
Smooth the slot completely with sandpaper.",How to Cut Slots in Wood," If your drill press currently has a bit in it that’s not one of these, take the bit out. Choose a bit that’s about ⅛ inch (3.2 mm) smaller than the width of the slot you want to make.For example, if you want the finished slot to be about one inch (25 mm) wide, choose a ⅞ inch (22 mm) drill bit.;
, One way to do this is to make a mark on the end of the board at the depth you want the drill to go. Then, position the drill bit against the end of the board, and lower the plunge depth until it lines up with the line you drew.The thickness of wood you’re using and the depth of the slot you want determine the plunge depth.
If your drill press does not allow you to set a specific plunge depth, you’ll have to judge for yourself when you lower the drill each time.

, Leave the drill off and set the board under it so the drill hits the board where you need it to. Make a fence guide by clamping a board to the table. A fence guide is a fixed straight edge that ensures you drill a straight slot on the board.If you already have a fence guide attached to the drill press table, set that to the proper position.
When you drill the holes, you’ll slide the board along the table. For this reason, it’s important to set up a fence that keeps the board moving in a straight line.

, Before you start drilling, measure out the length of the slot on the board. Mark both ends of the slot with a pencil. Then punch a hole in the board with with an awl or a hammer and nail. This will help you make sure to hit the right spots., Set the board on the table so that the drill bit is lined up over one of the endpoints. Turn the drill press on, and lower it into the board at the endpoint. After you drill one, lift the press. Carefully move the board so the other endpoint is lined up. Drill that hole, as well.If you set the plunge depth, lower the press until it stops. If you didn’t set a plunge depth, lower the drill press as deep as you want the slot to be.

, Position the board so the bit is toward the inside edge of one of the endpoints. Lower the drill to make a hole. Move the board into position to drill another overlapping hole. Repeat this until you’ve drilled enough holes to cut out a rough slot from endpoint to endpoint.You don’t need to overlap the holes so much that you’re only drilling half of a new hole. Just make sure that each hole overlaps enough so a continual line is drilled.

, When you drill, you’ll leave ridges between holes. Make sure your chisel is sharp before you start this step. Push the chisel against the wood at the top of a ridge between two holes. Shave off the excess along the slot so the edges are almost flat.When you start this part of the process, you can pull the slotted board off of the drill press and work with it on another table.

, A chisel removes the large ridges left by the holes, but the walls of the slot won’t be smooth yet. Slide a file up and down against each side of the slot until the walls appear to be almost completely smooth., To get a slot with perfectly smooth walls, sandpaper is the best way to buff out the remaining roughness. Wrap a piece of sandpaper around a drill bit. Put the bit into the slot and move it up and down along the walls of the slot until you’re satisfied with the smoothness."

Classification:
Frame construction is ISO Class 1.,
Building elements:


Frame buildings are buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs with combustible construction — or buildings with exterior walls of noncombustible or slow-burning construction with combustible floors and roofs.,
Advantages:


easy to erect and alter
economical
versatile
performs well in Earthquake areas – can move

,
Disadvantages:


fire can spread rapidly
highly damageable
may become unstable in a fire
may include enclosed spaces where fire can spread undetected

",How to Determine a Building's Construction Type2," ISO Class 1 encompasses IBC Type VA and IBC Type VB. Regardless of whether the IBC classification is A (protected) or B (unprotected) the ISO Class is 1.

,
Frame buildings generally have roof, floor, and supports of combustible material, usually wood, and combustible interior walls.
Two variations on frame construction don't change the construction class:

Masonry veneer (brick veneer)- Masonry veneer is thin layers of brick, stone, or stucco, used for appearance purposes rather than structural support.
Metal clad - A building with a metal exterior wall may not look like frame construction, but when the metal skin is attached to wood studs and joists, ISO classifies the building as frame.


Other conditions that lead to classification as frame construction include:

Metal walls or floors sheathed with combustible materials
Metal floors or roofs with combustible insulation or ceiling material attached to the underside or within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of horizontal supports
Composite assemblies of noncombustible materials with combustible materials



,,"

Classification:
Joisted Masonry construction is ISO Class 2.,
Building elements:
Joisted Masonry buildings are buildings with exterior walls of masonry or fire-resistive construction rated for not less than one hour and with combustible floors and roofs.,
Variations:
There's one variation on joisted masonry construction that doesn't change the construction class — heavy timber or mill construction.,
Advantages:


harder to ignite
consumed more slowly by fire
more structural stability
greater salvage value
lack of concealed spaces (Heavy Timber)

,
Disadvantages:


floors and roofs of combustible materials subject to damage by fire
presence of concealed spaces

",How to Determine a Building's Construction Type3," ISO Class 2 encompasses IBC Type IIIA and IBC Type IIIB. Regardless of whether the IBC classification is A (protected) or B (unprotected) the ISO Class is 2. IBC Type IV is Heavy Timber construction and is considered ISO Class 2. The reason is that the heavy timbers perform well and do not fail early in a fire.

, There are several types of masonry used in the exterior bearing walls of joisted masonry buildings:


brick
concrete — either reinforced or non reinforced
hollow concrete masonry units
tile
stone
note that exterior bearing walls may also be any noncombustible materials with fire-resistance ratings of not less than one hour

, Heavy timber construction uses wood members much larger than those found in frame (Construction Class 1) or other joisted masonry construction. If the building uses steel columns or beams for walls, the beams must be protected so they have a fire-resistance rating of not less than one hour. Heavy Timber Construction (IBC Type IV); ISO classifies the building as heavy timber construction if it meets these requirements:


walls of masonry construction
floors of 3 inch (7.6 cm) wood plank or 4 inch (10.2 cm) laminated plank, both surfaced with 1 inch (2.5 cm) flooring
roof of 2 inch (5.1 cm) wood plank, 3 inch (7.6 cm) laminated plank, or 1-1/8 inch tongue-and-groove plywood deck
wood column supports not less than 8 inch (20.3 cm) x 8 inch (20.3 cm), wood beams or girders not less than 6 inch (15.2 cm) x 6 inch (15.2 cm), or protected metal

Advantages:


Uses floors and roof supported by superior exterior bearing members that provide for stability and are less likely to collapse during a fire
Uses materials that don’t readily burn

,
Disadvantages:


Uses unprotected steel for interior members of floors and roof, and steel loses strength and becomes less stable and more damageable at high temperatures
Uses slow-burning materials that do burn — adding fuel to a fire

noncombustible or slow-burning floors and roofs — regardless of the type of insulation on the roof surface

,,"
"
Classification:
Modified Fire Resistive construction is ISO Class 5.,
Building elements:
Modified Fire Resistive Buildings are buildings where the exterior bearing walls and load-bearing portions of exterior walls must be of noncombustible materials or of masonry, but exterior nonbearing walls and wall panels may be slow-burning, combustible, or with no fire- resistance rating.,
Variations:



Structural steel protection: Note that modified fire-resistive buildings also include structural steel protection techniques — fire-protection material applied to steel.,
Advantages:


uses noncombustible materials
allows greater height and area than other construction classes
uses load-bearing members or assemblies that resist damage from fire

,
Disadvantages:


expensive to construct and repair
provides a false sense of security

",How to Determine a Building's Construction Type6," ISO Class 5 encompasses IBC Type IB.

,


Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of masonry materials described in the definition of fire resistive (Construction Class 6) — less thick than required for fire-resistive structures but not less than four inches thick, or
Fire-resistive materials with a fire-resistance rating less than two hours but not less than one hour

, Materials include:

concrete
plaster
clay tile
brick or other masonry units
gypsum block
gypsum wallboard
mastic coatings
mineral and fiberboard
mineral wool



Ceilings protecting steel beams or joists: What happens when there is no fire-protection material applied to steel beams or joists that support floors or roofs? ISO still considers a building modified fire resistive if it has a suitable ceiling. Ceilings can be plaster or gypsum wallboard or suspended mineral tile. The entire floor-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting a floor) or roof-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting roof supports) should conform to construction details in a UL-listed or Factory Mutual (FM)-approved design. ISO individually evaluates each approved design.

Choose the right blade.,
Raise the blade.,
Use a zero-clearance insert.,
Support the entire sheet.,
Tape off your cut mark.,
Cut with the good face up.,
Make the cut.",How to Cut Plywood2," To get the smoothest cut from your table saw, invest in a blade with a high tooth count, such as an 80 TPI plywood blade.Most stock blades on table saws work well for rough cuts, but will not give you a clean edge.Alternatively use a zero-clearance insert under the plywood. To make one of these, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull from your hands. Once the blade is all the way through (the blade needs to be quite high), clamp the insert down. You will be cutting on the insert, which does not allow the bottom layer of plywood to chip downward because of the low clearance between the blade and the insert. The insert is sacrificial and it's usually only sensible to make one when cutting large amounts of plywood.

, Raising the blade changes the direction the teeth will enter the wood. When the blade is slightly raised, such that the teeth just barely cut through the surface, the teeth enter the cutting surface at an angle. If you raise the blade a little higher, you can get a perpendicular cut, which will make a smoother surface.








Don't raise the blade more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the cutting surface. A raised blade may offer a smoother cut, but it also makes for a more dangerous cut. Exercise extreme caution when cutting with a raised blade., Your table saw may have a gap between the blade and the throat plate, where the blade sits in the table saw. A zero-clearance insert closes the gap and offers support to the sheet, making a smoother cut.You can purchase a zero-clearance throat plate online or at your local hardware store.Alternatively make your own. First, carefully set a piece of wood or plywood onto the working table saw, taking care not to have the wood slip or pull away from your hands. Once the blade is all the way through (the blade needs to be quite high), clamp the insert down. You will be cutting on the insert, which does not allow the bottom layer of plywood to chip downward because of the low clearance between the blade and the insert. The insert is sacrificial and it's usually only sensible to make one when cutting large amounts of plywood. To make safe cuts, make sure that whatever you're cutting isnt at an angle or unsupported on the other side.

, Large pieces of plywood can get heavy. When cutting them on a table saw, make sure you can keep it flat before beginning your cut. Stabilize the sheet on sawhorses, or ask a friend to help you hold it steady.Having the entire sheet supported allows you to keep a steady feed rate, that is, the speed you run the wood through the saw.You can also use a circular saw to break down large sheets to more manageable sizes., Use a low-adhesion tape, such as painter's tape, on both faces of your sheet. This will help hold the wood fibers in place and keep the edges from splintering.Once you have finished cutting, peel the tape off slowly to avoid any splintering., Lay your sheet on your table saw with the good face up. The teeth of the saw will enter the sheet from the top and exit from the underside of the sheet. Tear-outs, or splintering, will occur where the teeth exit, so keep the good face up. , Hold your sheet steady and keep it pressed firmly against the fence, the straight edge of your table saw. Use both hands to guide the sheet through the blade.








Use the hand that is closest to the blade to press the sheet forward, through the blade. Use the hand that is furthest from the blade to press the sheet towards the cutline.As you get close to the end of the cut, move your hands so that you have one hand on either side of the blade. Carefully push the rest of the sheet through the blade.Work carefully when using your table saw. Keep your hands away from the blade.

"
"
Make sure the sheet is stable.,
Set the blade depth.,
Stand to the side of the saw.,
Position your saw for a plunge cut.,
Keep the underside of the blade clear.,
Lower the blade into the plywood.",How to Cut Plywood3," Lay your sheet of plywood on a few 2x4s suspended over two sawhorses. The entire sheet of plywood should be seated firmly on the work surface.A plunge cut is a cut that does not start from a straight edge, but the center of a sheet of plywood. If you need to make an opening in the middle of a sheet of plywood, for example, you would need to make a plunge cut., Lower the blade to about .25 inches (0.6 cm) more than the thickness of your sheet. This will ensure the teeth of the blades just barely cut through the underside of the surface.







, There is a high risk of kick back, or the saw running back towards you, when making a plunge cut. Do not stand directly behind the saw when you make a plunge cut., Place the front edge of the shoe, or the base plate of the saw, against your sheet of plywood. Carefully lift up the blade guard, and line the blade up with your cut mark., You won't be able to see what is beneath the sheet as you make your plunge cut, so check before hand to make sure the space is clear., Turn the saw on and slowly lower the saw blade into the sheet. Hold the saw firmly to keep it from kicking back to you.Once the saw is completely lowered into the cut, and the saw bed is flush with the cutting surface, release the blade guard. Move the saw forward to finish the cut. Let the blade come to a complete stop before lifting the saw out of the sheet."
"
Buy a good saw.,
Measure your cut.,
Notch the wood.,
Start the cut.,
Brace the cutoff end to avoid splinters.",How to Cut Plywood4," If you don't have access to power tools, you'll need to invest in a solid crosscut saw. Look at a saw's TPI, or teeth per inch. A saw with fewer teeth will cut faster, but you'll be left with a rough edge. A saw with a higher TPI will leave you with a smoother edge, but it will take some time to saw.Make sure the handle is comfortable when you grip it, and look down the back of the saw blade to make sure it is straight. The tip of the saw should be flexible. When you bend it, it should snap back to the center., Anytime you are working with wood, make sure to measure your cut. Once the wood has been cut, there is no turning back. Double check your measurements before cutting.

, Start on the edge of the board, and hold the saw blade upright. Draw the saw up a few times to get a notch in the edge of the board.You can use your thumb knuckle to guide the blade, but be careful., When you've made a solid notch in the edge, bring the saw to about 45-30 degrees. Work carefully and use smooth, full strokes to cut plywood.Keep your forearm and shoulder in line with the blade to ensure a straight cut.If you notice the blade running off track, give the handle a little twist to set it right., When you get towards the end of your cut, use your free hand to hold the cutoff end. Turn the saw upright and use short vertical strokes to finish the cut."

Research fumigation laws in your area.,
Clear the area before treatment begins.,
Bring individual objects outside for treatment.,
Place a tarp over the area.,
Spray gas into the tarped area.,
Leave for a few days.",How to Fumigate Wood2," Fumigation will likely be regulated by your government. The gasses used are highly toxic. Enclosed areas under fumigation, such as homes, are not safe to enter. No matter the laws in your area, having a professional handle fumigation is always the best plan., Anything alive must be removed from the treatment area. This includes family, pets, plants, and seeds. Remove any opened food and medicine containers. You may also bring non-infested items such as clothing and toys so they aren’t fumigated.Items that will stay in the area can be protected. Seal them in glass, metal, or gas-resistant bags.
Fumigants are toxic. It is possible for a gas such as Vikane to linger inside objects, such as beds and toys, for over a month.

, Rather than exposing your entire home to fumigation, bring infested objects outside. Set up a tarp to contain the chemicals. Safety equipment such as a gas mask can protect you, but you should not stay in the fumigation area. Either spray the chemicals quickly or pump them into the area., A fumigation tarp seals the entire area where fumigation takes place. The tarp holds in the chemicals, allowing them to settle. Set up the tarp as a tent. Close off any ventilation holes. Make sure there are no leakage points in the tarp., The best way to add in the fumigant is to use a pump. Professional companies pump the gas through the tarp so no one gets exposed to it. When treating smaller objects, such as furniture, you can usually spray the wood directly and exit the area before taking a breath., Home fumigation takes up to three days. Once the treatment is over, the tent can be removed so the gas dissipates. If you have a device that measures air quality, use this to determine how safe it is to go back into your home. Furniture treated outdoors can be moved back inside after treatment.You may still see insects other than termites. The gas may not have been in a high enough dosage to kill them.

, A pilot hole is a guide hole you drill in your lumber for the screws to follow. Drill the hole until the bottom of your masking tape touches the surface of your lumber.


Pilot holes are also useful for making sure your screw goes in at a level angle. And it helps prevent splitting if you have to drive a screw into a thin edge of lumber.

, This one should be the same diameter as the heads of your screws.

, Mark this drill bit to that length using your masking tape. This is unlikely to be more than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).

, Drill down until the bottom of the masking tape touches the surface of your lumber. Do your best to keep the wider hole centered on the narrower pilot hole.

,, Twist it in by hand until it can stand on its own.

, Push firmly on the drill and use pulses to avoid stripping the screw. With the countersink hole in place, the screw should sink easily below the level of your lumber.

, Ideas can come from anywhere: a discussion, a forum, work, or home.

, Sketch it, then draw it in greater detail as the idea and your decision to make the piece firm up. You can draw them to scale, but you may find that full scale is a more comforting thought when it comes to the dimensions.

, Some of the things that should be taken into consideration are:


Aesthetics
Project location/use
Material strength
The mix of materials
The wood grain

,,, There are many stresses inside a piece of wood but, when sawn, these stresses are relieved. You may not see it right away, but you may be surprised at just how much a piece of wood can move.

, Have your blades and cutting tools sharpened or buy some new ones. Dull cutting tools cause many of the blood letting accidents in the shop.

, Take the time to ensure that your saws are calibrated properly, so you can get that 90 or 45 degree cut exact.

,, Never ever work when you are tired or distracted. Missing body parts are not worth it.

, As the old saying goes, measure twice and cut once.

, Otherwise, it is extremely easy to turn a 5 1/4"" cut into a 4 3/4"" cut.

, Do not push them beyond their capability.

, Minute differences in rulers can cause problems when trying to put a project together.

, Do not rush to start gluing things together.

, Glue will make a tenon expand so it is almost impossible to insert it into its mortise. Making mortise and tenon joints properly takes time and patience. Try cutting a tenon thick and use a rabbet plane to get it to the proper thickness.

, Improper use of clamps can rack a project out of square.

,, Make every attempt to limit squeeze-out of excess glue. There is nothing worse than finding dried glue that will not take a stain.

, Don't let the tape get stuck under a layer of rock-hard glue.

,, Use progressively finer grits of sandpaper. Sand the wood until no swirl marks are left. For most furniture, 220 grit is about a fine as you need to go during this step.

, Perform the complete finish process on a scrap of each type of wood so you will know exactly what the project will look like when complete.


After determining which product and process looks best, do not skip or change any part of the process used on the scrap, when it comes time to finish the project.
Small differences in the finishing process can make a drastic change in the look of the complete project.

, Now it is time to really make your project shine, but do not hurry to start this process. Wait until the finish is completely cured before starting. Some products will cure overnight; others take weeks.

, Most people will rub the surface of a project to get an impression of how well the finish was completed. There are many oils, powders, and polishes that will create that mirror finish often desired. Read the different finishing books and brochures to get an understanding of the process.

, Enjoy the moment.


Most projects will contain a flaw here and there. Do not point them out when showing off a piece. Most likely, you will be the only one that knows the flaw exists.

Place your dollar on a flat surface.,
Moisten the bill with water.,
Turn your iron down to the lowest heat.,
Iron the dollar slowly.,
Let the bill cool for 60 seconds.,
Store flat for safe keeping.",How to Straighten Out a Dollar Bill1," The ironing board is the most logical place to iron your bill. If you don’t have an ironing board, you can use a nearby table, but make sure to place a shirt or other linen on the ironing area so that you don’t burn the table.;
, Spray a little water onto the dollar bill. You can do this with the spray function featured on the iron itself. Moisture helps remove those particularly pesky wrinkles during ironing.If you don’t have an iron with a spray function, use a spray bottle or run the bill under a sink that is set to low pressure.

, The goal is to dry the moisture out of the bill with the lowest heat necessary. Higher heat settings run the risk of damaging the dollar bill., Use straight movements from one direction to the other. Repeat this a few times until the bill no longer appears to further flatten.


Take care to avoid ironing folds into the bill. If you are having trouble getting the bill to lay flat, place it flat inside of a shirt. This will keep the bill weighed down flat while still allowing you to iron the bill.
Start ironing the bill as your iron is still heating up. This is particularly helpful if your iron's lowest setting is still particularly hot.

, The bill will be very hot to the touch immediately after ironing, so be careful! After the bill has cooled, you may flip the bill and repeat the ironing process on the new side of the bill.


You may reapply some moisture to the other side of the bill if it still has a large amount of folds or wrinkles.

, Once you are satisfied that the bill cannot get any flatter, you are finished. Pick up your newly flattened bill and place alongside the others in your wallet.

These will produce technically exact duplicates.",How to Copy a 3D Wood Carving1," You can reproduce these over and over again in a ""factory"" manner, getting an almost perfect, if not exact, duplicate.


""CNC"" stands for Computer Numerical Control. The specs of your replica would be loaded into a computer processor, which would then guide the cutting.
You can buy these machines in a variety of models and makes. Some use a laser to do the cutting, others use cutting tools or even plasma cutters. Most machines of this kind cost upwards of $60,0000 so turning your carving over to a professional (also called a milliner) for mass duplication on one of these machines is probably your best bet.
One advantage to the CNC machine is you are not limited in materials. You can make metal, plastic or even stone duplicates of you source object.;

Place the stick between your pointer and middle finger.,
Alternate the position of your fingers.,
Incorporate a figure eight movement.",How to Spin a Drumstick1," The basic drumstick spin is essential for any drummer to know. Position the middle of the drumstick low, in between your pointer and middle finger.The stick should be resting in the webbing of your two fingers.


You can use your right or left hand to practice this trick, and it will look even better when you can do it simultaneously with both hands.;
, With the stick in between your two fingers, alternate the positioning of your fingers.Your fingers should look like the legs of a swimmer, moving alternatively up and down. This up and down movement of your fingers will make the drumstick move back and forth in a pendulum-like motion.


Practice this finger movement to get accustomed to the back and forth motion of the drumstick.
The middle of the stick should remain in between your pointer and middle finger.

, As you alternate your fingers and the drumstick is moving back and forth like a pendulum, slightly roll your wrist to get some fluidity to the movement of the stick. As the stick spins, begin making a circular, figure eight motion with your fingers.


As you continue to spin the stick, it will naturally slide down to the end of the stick due to gravity. Because of this, you will have to eventually readjust the positioning of the stick."

Hold the balloon.,

Ask an adult.,
Never inhale from canister.,
Take only a few breathes.,

Find something unique.,
Record it.",How to Suck in a Helium Balloon," If the balloon is already inflated but isn’t knotted, simply hold the opening closed. Do so using your index finger and thumb. Squeeze the sides of the opening to prevent air from escaping.


If the balloon is inflated and knotted, you need to create a small hole for the helium to escape. Hold the balloon on the knot.;
, A sewing needle will work best to create the small pin prick. While holding the balloon, use your free hand to insert the needle above the knot. Slowly slide the needle through one side of the balloon to create a tiny hole.


While removing the needle, simultaneously cover the hole with the hand holding the knot. This will keep all the air from pouring out of the balloon.
If a needle isn’t around, you can bite a small hole into the balloon or use your fingernail.

, For best results, you will want to fill your lungs with as much helium as possible. To do this, you’ll need to make space in your lungs. Blow the air out of your lungs.


You will know the majority of air is out of your lungs when your stomach starts to collapse inward.

, When ready, loosen your fingers around the opening to release air. Put your mouth directly over the opening and take a deep breath. Inhaling for 2-3 seconds will be sufficient.If you’ve punctured a hole, move your finger from the hole and place your mouth around the hole. Inhale deeply until your lungs are full. Act as though you are taking a normal breathe and fill your lungs with the helium.
Holding the helium in your mouth alone will not work. You must inhale the helium into your lungs.

, Once you’ve filled your lungs with helium, begin to speak and/or sing as you normally would. Due to helium’s low density, the sound will travel twice as fast than regular air across your vocal cords. This is what causes the funny sound.If you don’t experience any change, exhale again and try to breathe in more helium.
Remember, the effects will only last a few seconds so make the most of it!

, Before attempting to inhale helium, discuss the risks with an adult like a parent or teacher. They may have ideas on how to take additional precautions.


If you are working with children, share the risks involved with inhaling helium like lung tissue damage and death.
If you're working with kids, make sure that they stop if they seem lightheaded, confused or unable to catch their breathe.

, Helium is even more dangerous if inhaled directly from a pressurized canister or tank.Doing so could result in your lungs rupturing or an air embolism. There have also been cases of suffocation and stroke.


This is also true for inhaling oxygen directly from a tank.

, Your entire body needs oxygen at all times. Inhaling helium multiple times, displaces oxygen from your lungs, which may cause damage to vital organs. For example, your brain can only function without oxygen for 5-6 seconds. Inhaling helium for several minutes is an unnecessary risk.


If you experience dizziness, stop immediately.
If you pass out and lose consciousness, seek medical attention immediately., Before you get started, think of several things you will want to say while using your helium voice. You will only have a few seconds before your voice goes back to normal. Using short phrases is a good idea.


Consider stealing lines from characters like Donald Duck. You could say things like, “Let me at them!” or “Nothin' to it!”, No helium experience is complete without singing a little tune. Find one that you think is hilarious and give it a go. Memorize a line of the chorus so you don’t have to look at your phone.


An excellent choice would be something from Alvin and the Chipmunks. , Pretty much anything you say while using helium will be amusing. Think of something all your own to say and/or sing. If you’re good at improvisation, let your creativity shine through and fly by the seat of your pants.


You can watch videos online or ask your friends to offer up some suggestions. Use these as inspiration to create your own funny lines.

, With all the fun happening, you will probably forget what you or your friends say. Because you will definitely want to relive the moments and laughter, get it on video!


You can do this using your phone or a video camera.

Hold the crumpled bill at each end.,
Run the dollar bill against a cornered surface.,
Flip the dollar in your hands and corner the other side.,
Check the corners of your dollar bill.,
Repeat until flattened.",How to Straighten Out a Dollar Bill2," You want to hold the bill as straight as possible between both of your fingers. Hold it taut, but take care not to accidentally pull the bill apart in your hands.

, Make sure the entire surface of the bill is firmly dragged across the edge of where two planes meet. The goal is to force the wrinkles and folds out of the bill.


The corner of a vending machine is a convenient place to try this method, given that the vending machine likely wouldn’t accept your bill in the first place. However, any edged surface will do, including wall, desk or table corners.
If the corner you are using doesn’t seem to be straightening out the bill, try using a corner with a more inclined or sharper edge.

, If you only run one side of the bill against a corner, you run the risk of creating new folds or bends in the direction you were applying force to the bill. Flip the bill and run the opposite face across the corner same as you did to the first in order to create as much parity as possible.

, It’s difficult to straighten the corners of the bill out using the edge of a wall. When you are done straightening the body of the bill, check the corners for “dog ears,” or small bends at the corners of the bill. If a dog ear is present, fold and crease the ear in the opposite direction to try to level out the bend (similar to removing creases from rugs or cloth)., Repeat the whole process until the darned vending machine takes your dollar bill. If the machine continues to reject the bill, you might have to use another bill.

Moisten the dollar bill.,
Press the bill between two heavy, flat objects.,
Check in on the dollar bill as it dries.,
Repeat the process if needed.",How to Straighten Out a Dollar Bill3," Spray the dollar bill with water. Use a water bottle to mist evenly. Unlike when ironing a dollar bill, you want the bill to be noticeably moist or humid. However, it is not advised to completely soak the bill in water through submersion.

, Ideal objects to use for pressing include heavy books such as dictionaries or phone directories. These objects press the bill flat and hold it in place while it dries.


Place an absorbent material between the heavy object and the bill to prevent water damage to the pressing object and to facilitate drying. Try cheesecloth, hemp or other common absorbent fabrics to help absorb moisture from the bill.If you don’t particularly care about the book in question, the bill along with the absorbent material can be placed within the book itself. Lay the book flat to ensure the bill dries without bends or folds.
The dollar bill can also be “framed” between two panes of glass as it dries. Framing the bill will help ensure a tight, flat seal and can take less space than stacking a few books.

, Allow to dry overnight, checking in occasionally to gauge dryness. Change the absorbent material as necessary to keep the drying process moving at a steady pace.


The bill shouldn’t take longer than a few days to dry. If it takes longer than a few days, change the absorbent material more frequently. You may have also moistened the bill more than necessary.
Store the press in an area that is not also dark or damp to avoid encouraging the growth of mold., Once the bill is dry, it should lay flat without folds or creases. However, if the bill still curls, you may repeat the process, provided the bill is not too flimsy or weak to withstand another treatment."

Hold the stick in matched grip position.,
Position your hand vertically.,
Pinch the stick and release your other fingers.,
Spin the drumstick backward.,
Catch the drumstick.",How to Spin a Drumstick2," Matched grip position is the starting position in which you hold your drumsticks. Grip the stick by hooking your pointer finger around the stick, and grasping the stick with the pad of your thumb.You should be holding the stick approximately 4 inches from the bottom of the stick.


Then wrap your other three fingers around the drumstick. The drumstick should be gently (but securely) resting in the palm of your hand.

, Normally when drumming, your hands (and sticks) are in a horizontal position. For the spin, turn your hand so you’re holding the drumstick vertically., Remain holding the drumstick with your pointer finger and thumb. Put your middle, ring, and pinky fingers behind the stick while still keeping the drumstick vertical., With your three fingers behind the drumstick, push the bottom the drumstick forward (so the top of the stick comes toward you).Your middle finger is going to be doing the majority of the pushing. As the drumstick begins to spin, release your thumb from the stick and allow the stick to spin over your pointer finger.


As the stick finishes spinning around your pointer finger, release your middle finger from the stick, and the drumstick will then finish spinning around your pointer finger.

, The stick will make one full rotation until it is back in its starting position. As the stick comes back to its starting position, catch it using all of you fingers and thumb.


Once back in the starting position, you can continue to spin the stick.

Position the drumstick between your pointer and middle finger.,
Hook your ring finger.,
Hook your pinky finger.,
Transfer the stick from your pinky to your pointer finger.",How to Spin a Drumstick3," Place the middle of the drumstick in between your index and middle finger. Spin the drumstick by moving your pointer finger away from you and moving your middle finger toward you.This will make the drumstick in between your fingers spin over toward your other two fingers (ring and pinky finger).


As you do this first spin between your index and middle finger, relax your ring and pinky finger so they can be pulled away and lower than your two spinning fingers. This will prevent the stick from hitting those fingers as you execute the first spin.

, As the drumstick spins and travels around your middle finger, hook your ring finger onto the back of the stick, and allow your pointer finger to relax and straighten out.This will transfer the drumstick from your pointer and middle finger to your middle and ring finger. Just like you moved your pointer finger away from you and moved your middle finger toward you to get the drumstick to spin, you are going to do the same movement with your middle and ring finger.


Move your middle finger away from you and move your ring finger toward you. This will cause the stick in between your two fingers to continue spinning.

, As the drumstick spins around your ring finger, hook your pinky finger behind the stick, and allow your middle finger to relax and lay flat.Allowing your middle finger to relax positions the drumstick between your ring and pinky finger.


From this position, you can again, move your ring finger back, away from you, and move your pinky finger toward you, causing the drumstick to continue spinning.

, As the drumstick spins around your pinky finger, it will come back around to the front (palm side) of your hand. When it is on the palm side, tuck your pointer finger down.When the stick is horizontal and perpendicular to your fingers, lift your pointer finger back up so it is in front of the stick.


At this position, your pinky finger and pointer finger should be in front of the drumstick, while your middle and ring fingers should be behind the drumstick.
As you move your pointer finger to be in front of the drumstick, slowly release your pinky and ring finger so the only two fingers touching the drumstick are your pointer finger (which is in front of the stick) and your middle finger (which is behind the stick).This will put you back in the starting position and you can continue spinning the drumstick.

Hold the stick with an open hand.,
Spin the drumstick.,
Catch the drumstick.",How to Spin a Drumstick4," Hold open your hand, palm facing up, and position the middle of the stick horizontally in the middle of your hand.Spinning the drumstick from its middle will allow the stick to be balanced as you spin it.Once you have the positioning down, close your hand loosely to grip the drumstick.

, Bring your wrist back, as if you are going to throw the drumstick away from you. As you “throw” the stick, open your hand all the way, really wide, so your fingers are almost pointing downward. This will allow the jointed part of your hand (where your fingers connect to the palm of your hand) to be the highest point on your hand.The highest point is where you want the stick to spin, so it doesn’t hit any of your fingers as it rotates.


Spin the drumstick with enough force so that it can make at least one full rotation spinning. If you don’t spin the drumstick with enough force, it will stop spinning on your hand.

, When the drumstick starts to slow down on the palm of your hand, clench your hand to catch the stick. It will be easier to catch the stick if one of the ends are in between (or near) the space between your thumb and pointer finger.

Be careful of the temperature of the water. Although the water should be warm, it should never be scalding hot, as this could cause the bill to loose color.

, About a teaspoon or two might be enough. Two teaspoons will make it stiffer yet, but even closer to brand new than just the one teaspoon.

, Rub the bill from one end to the other. Don't apply too much pressure that the bill's ink begins to come off, otherwise it will have no legal tender on it. Apply enough pressure, like you were brushing your hair- steady pressure running up and down the bill.


Rub the bill in circles with the bristle brush. Never rub straight across otherwise the bill's ink will smear and that's not good!

, Repeat the process with the bristles to the back side of the bill.

, The soap helps restore the crispness that the bill once had when it came from the factory.

, Listen for the little ""ticks""; these ticking sounds are the water droplets evaporating from the newly washed bill. Again, the side you begin with really doesn't matter. Don't ever spray any of the water from the iron onto the bill, unless the iron is sticking to the bill for some reason.

,, The bill should now look closer to knew than it once was.

Work on one section at a time.,
Measure your wall and molding.,
Prepare to cut.,
For the first section, you will be making straight 90° cuts on both ends of the molding.",How to Cut Crown Molding1," Start in the least-visible corner of the room, especially when installing molding with a design. This is because it is fairly easy to line up the pattern in each corner as you go, but the final corner will most likely not match.


In the first corner, draw a line on each wall that intersects at the corner along the bottom of the molding. This will help keep you aligned as you install. To do this, hold a small piece of scrap molding up to the corner. Run a pencil along the bottom of the molding to the corner, and repeat the process on the other wall so the lines connect.;
, Using a tape measure, measure the wall from corner to corner. Face the corner, and determine if you will start with the left piece or the right piece.


Measure out your first piece of molding based on the wall measurement. Mark your measurements on the bottom side of the molding on both ends.

, Place the molding upside down on your saw table. Hold it as if the table was the ceiling, with the side that touches the wall facing you. This will allow you to see the measurement marks you made on the bottom edge. , The molding will be installed flush against the wall in the corner. Don't worry about the angle yet, the second piece will be cut to fit into the first.

The first and possibly most important step in the construction of reclaimed wood furniture is the choice of the wood, and the style of construction.,
Always kiln dry reclaimed barn lumber (or any lumber for that matter).,
If you do not have access to a Kiln then you can air dry the lumber by stacking it on the 1x1 sticks in an area with decent air flow.,
Begin construction of the furniture.,
Metal detect the lumber.,
Rough mill the lumber is the next process.,
After your reclaimed lumber is dimensioned (edge joined, and planed to size), you can now start assembly by edge gluing your boards together for the given panels you will need.,
Begin final assembly.,
After sanding and final assembly, the finish work can take place.",How to Construct High Quality Furniture Using Reclaimed Wood," There are many different species of reclaimed wood indigenous to the American landscape, and all have different qualities. Also, there are many different construction techniques that are time tested methods and styles. Often the choice of the style of furniture helps to dictate the type of wood used. Maple, Beech, and Walnut seem to be the most often used woods for Contemporary reclaimed furniture, while Oak, Poplar, and Cherry seem to follow more closely with the rustic style.;
, The process of kiln drying involves stacking lumber on 1""x1"" sticks in bundles, in an airtight room. Once the lumber is in the ""kiln"", heat is added slowly until the ambient temperature reaches around 140 °F (60 °C). While the lumber is being heated, it is releasing moisture. Where does that moisture go if the room is airtight? In order to dry reclaimed wood properly to be used for your furniture, you have to have a commercial dehumidifier to draw the moisture from the wood and essentially dry it. Most species of reclaimed wood have an equilibrium moisture content of around 6-8%. It is crucial to get the wood to this moisture, because if it is higher than this, the wood still has moisture inside, that will cause the wood to shrink once in climate control.

, This is a much lengthier process than kiln drying but will accomplish the same thing. You want to get the lumber to a moisture content under 12-15%. You will also have to treat the lumber for insects as well.


The kiln drying process is also required to kill the bugs and micro-organisms inside reclaimed lumber. The recommended process to eliminate insects is to heat the core of the wood to 140 °F (60 °C) for 4 hours.

, The first process to construction is to have a plan for the piece you are building. This plan, or ""shop drawing"" can be a simple sketch, or a complex drawing from an architect or designer. No matter the project, this simple step helps assure that you will not make mistakes.

, This is highly important because one nail in a board can cause very painful and costly damage to machinery. Use whatever means possible to remove the metal without damaging the wood.

, This is the process of cutting to rough length (not finished length), and sizing to width. We typically use reclaimed lumber that has similar color or grain characteristics. Once the lumber is selected, The material needs to be face and edge jointed, then planed to thickness (unless you prefer the original surface of your boards).

, Once panels have dried from gluing and clamping them together, run them through a wide belt sander to flatten the table, and to sand it smooth. If you don't have access to a wide belt sander, a simple dual action palm sander will do, but it will take you hours.

, Depending on the type of furniture you are building, you have many options for joinery. For our knock down furniture, use simple butt-joints, insert nuts, and screws, for our more complex and custom furniture, use mortise and tenon, dovetails, and Dutchman joinery techniques. The rule to woodworking is to anticipate wood movement. Wood will expand and contract from season to season, so never ever ever attempt to try to keep wood from moving. Always allow for movement, and your furniture will look great for generations.

, If building multiple tables at a time, use a spray gun to apply finish. It is not only faster, but it is much easier and less messy. If you do not have a spray gun, you can hand apply most finishes unless they are catalyzed. Try low VOC commercial grade lacquer. You can also use hand rubbed tung oil before you spray, with pretty good results, although the oils can sometimes take 4 or more applications to actually get a sheen. Once you have completed your finish, a nice wax coat is the icing on the cake. Try steel wool with #0000, and rub the wax in, let stand, then buff out.

Inspect the knot.,
Pull out the bottom half of the knot.,
Slide one of the fork prongs through the knot.,
Use a knitting needle.,
Pull the knot out.,
Try again.",How to Untie a Balloon1," Look closely at the balloon knot and find where it rolls over itself.;
, You must be careful in this process. You want to be able to see the area where you'll be able to slide your fork into.

, Unless the knot is super tight, it should slide through real easy.


Careful not to pierce the balloon at this stage.

, This works even better than a fork prong. Thick needles with a blunt, rounded point are the best. Moisten the needle a little bit by licking it for easier access.

, Use either the needle or fork to roll the knot out. You can help by trying to push the knot while sliding it down., If it doesn't unroll the first time, slide it back up and repeat this process.

Choose your rope.,
Tie your hands in front of you.,
Put your hands behind your back.,
Consider tying your hands to a fixed object.",How to Tie Yourself up With Rope1," If you're only tying your hands, you won't need more than two or three feet of rope. You may find that thin, smooth ropes—even string or twine—are the easiest to work with. If you don't already have rope, you should be able to find something suitable at a hardware store.


Cut the rope to the length that you need. Rope and twine are generally sold in increments much larger than what you'll need to tie yourself up, and you'll be able to do a cleaner job if you buy them cut to size.
If you don't want the rope to chafe your wrists, consider using a thin, smooth rope. The thicker and rougher the rope, the more you risk hurting your wrists. Some people are allergic to nylon, so make sure that the rope won't irritate your skin.;
, Wrap the rope around each of your wrists, and leave the ends of the rope free so that you can make a knot. Be sure to cinch or knot the rope between your wrists so that you can't wriggle free. Imagine that you are using the rope to make a pair of handcuffs: your hands should be tied into separate ""cuffs,"" not one single, easy-to-slip-out-of wrap. When your wrists are wrapped up, tie a square knot, make a double-tied bow, or use another simple, sturdy knot.


Your left palm should be facing down. You should see the rope crossed just beneath your left palm. Place your right palm against the palm of your left hand so that your wrists line up.

, If your hands are tied behind your back, it may look more like someone else tied you up. Once you have tied your hands in front of you, bring your bound hands low enough that you can step over them. Lift your legs over the knot so that your hands are bound behind your back.


Some people find it easier to tie their hands together when their wrists are already behind their back. Try clasping your wrists behind your back, then attempting to tie the same knot that you would tie with forward-facing hands. Consider using a mirror so that you can see yourself tying the knot.
To bring your hands back to the front of your body. To do this, simply bend down, holding your bound hands as low as they will go, and step backward over the knot. You may find it easier to escape from the knot if your hands are in front of you.

, Tie your wrists together as normal, but also loop the rope around a pole, chair, or bedpost. It may be difficult to tie each wrist separately without someone else's help. You can, however, tie your legs to separate fixtures, then bundle your hands together.

Measure out the second piece of molding.,
Cut the other end.,
On the 45° end, use a coping saw to cut away the back.",How to Cut Crown Molding2," Mark the bottom of the molding. If you mark the top, your cuts will be incorrect. This is because the bottom of the molding goes all the way into the corner, while the top does not.


Set your power miter saw to a 45° angle. Assuming you are starting with the left piece, the saw should be angled from left to right.
Be sure to place the ceiling part of the molding onto the deck of the saw table, while you hold the wall side facing you.
Make the first cut, with the saw coming down on the mark you made on the molding.
When in doubt, cut long so that you can shave the extra off. Cutting short can make the entire piece useless.

, Adjust the saw angle back to a 90°. Bring the saw down on you measurement mark, leaving yourself a small amount of extra just in case.

, Follow the contours of the molding and strip away the back wood . The idea is that the 45° cut will fit over the contours of the first piece of molding. Sand it down to remove any gaps. Test the coping by holding a scrap piece of molding up against the contours. Gaps should be minimal. Use a caulk gun to fill in any gaps that won't go away.

Position the balloon.,
Inspect how the knot is formed.,
Push and pull the knot.The ultimate process of loosening the knot is to push and pull various sides of the knot.,
Separate a strand with your finger.,
Pick the connecting knot.,
Use your tooth to loosen the knot.",How to Untie a Balloon2," Hold the balloon so the inflated portion is wedged into your lap. Secure the balloon gently but firmly using your thighs.

, Try to follow where the knot loops around itself. Visualize how the knot was formed.

, Continue this until you are able to get part of the knot to yield.Focus on particular loops of the knot when pushing and pulling. The goal is to loosen and grip a single strand of the knot.

, Lodge your fingernail into one of the loops. Try to get a secured grip of that particular loop. You'll need to work on loosening the knot for a while before you can secure a section of the knot.


This is easier if your fingernails are long.

, Once you grip a strand of the knot, locate its connecting loop. Using your other hand, pry out the folded loop underneath the other loop. By prying one loop of the knot with one hand, you should be able to loosen this part of the knot., Once you've separated two loops of the knot, there should be a small opening. Wedge your fang tooth into the opened crevice. By pulling with your hands, gently, the knot should loosen and untie.

"

Inflate your balloon.,
Use a rubber band.,
Use a twist tie.,
Use a clothespin.,
Tape the balloon's end.",How to Untie a Balloon3," Be sure it is full but not overly full. Inflate it 3/4 of the way full.

, Twist the neck several times so it is well sealed. Stretch out the balloon with one hand. Wrap a rubber band around the neck, and tuck it into the other end of the rubber band. Pull the longer end tight.This knot is called a lark's head knot. The goal is to use the rubber band as a tightening agent.
For increased support, you could tie the rubber band as well. This could be just as challenging to untie as a regular balloon's knot.

, One of the easier ways of deflating your balloon without popping it is to use a twist tie. Simply hold the neck tight with one hand, and then begin securing the neck with a twist tie.

, Do the same process as above, only this time secure the balloon with a clothespin. Be sure the clothespin is fresh and sturdy, or else it might not hold the air well.

, Have a few strips of tape ready to be used. Grip the neck of the inflated balloon with one hand. Then tape off the ends using your strips.


Use scotch tape for the best results.

Wrap the rope around your torso and your non-dominant arm.,
Tie the rope.,
Consider binding yourself in several places.",How to Tie Yourself up With Rope2," Make sure that it's just a little loose—the rope shouldn't hurt you, but it should be tight enough that it won't slip off. You must wrap the rope with both ends going around you instead of one. When you are holding less than a foot of loose rope in each hand, pull the rope tight. Hold it tight until you are able to tie it.

, Tie the ends of the rope together using a square knot, a double-tied bow, or any other simple, sturdy knot. Squeeze your free arm into the wrapped rope, as deep as it will go, until you appear stuck.


Try wrapping the rope around the area with one hand, then using the other to grab the rope and help out. Tie the ends of the rope with a tight double-knot bow.
Consider puffing your chest or stomach out as you pull the rope tight and tie it. This way, all you need to do to loosen the rope is empty your lungs of air and make your torso more compact. You can also flex your arm muscles to make the wrap slightly larger than your natural form.
To escape this trap, squeeze the arm that you used to tie the knot. This should loosen the rope so that you can slip out of the wrap.

, Use a separate rope for each knot. Try knotting your feet together (with a 2-3 feet of long rope) using the same technique that you'd use for your hands. Consider binding your legs together in the same way, but bear in mind that the rope is likely to slip down your legs. Finally, tie your wrists together, making sure to tie a knot or cinch between them so that the rope doesn't slip off.

"

Repeat the steps above for the remaining pieces of molding.,
Attach the molding.",How to Cut Crown Molding3," If you are putting molding in a 4-wall room and started with a piece with two 90° angles, you will have to make one piece that has two 45° angles.


The 45° angles will need to be opposite angles. Be sure to leave an extra inch or two at first to make sure everything fits. A slightly too long piece will actually make the entire construction a little bit more snug and prevent cracks from forming as the house settles.
For a 4-wall room you should end up with one piece that has two 90° ends, two pieces that each have a 90° end and a 45° end, and one piece that has two opposite 45° ends.

, Run adhesive along the flat faces that touch the wall and ceiling. Also put adhesive on the parts of the molding that connect with another piece.


An extra pair of hands will be a great help when installing the molding, especially for the longer pieces.
Push the end of the first piece firmly into the first corner.
Use finishing nails to secure the molding while the adhesive sets. Use a nail punch to make sure the nails go under the surface of the wood. This will allow them to be painted over.
Attach the rest of the molding pieces, using caulk to fill in gaps as you go.

Grab a small reflective surface.,
Kneel down next to the door you wish to see under.,
Place the reflective surface flat on the ground, next to the door gap.,
Look at the edge of the reflective surface closest to the door.",How to See Under a Door1," The idea is to use the reflection to peer through the bottom of the door. Any reflective surface will do, so long as the reflective surface is clear enough to make out what is happening on the other side of the door.


There are a variety of options, including music CDs or small pocket mirrors. If you use a CD, choose one that you aren’t particularly concerned about. It's easy to scratch the object you are using during this procedure.;
, Take care not to make too much noise or move too suddenly when kneeling. Any loud noises or sudden movements may make your presence noticeable to those on the other side of the door.

, Face the shiny portion up, making sure not to place it halfway through the door's length. If you do so, the item may become noticed.

, Tilt the CD and angle your view as needed to see inside the other room. While you will not be able to see everything, you will be able to see a vast majority of anything on the ground, or close to the ground and far away from the door.Make sure there is plenty of lighting on the other side of the door. It helps if your side of the door is not very bright.

Reflect upon your sister's personality.,
Think about your sister's special interests.,
Reflect upon your relationship with your sister.,
Find pranks that don't make your sister the butt of a mean joke.,
Find pranks that don't put your sister in harm's way.,
Be inventive.",How to Prank Your Sister1," Of course you know your sister—she's your sibling after all, and you probably live together and have grown up together. Nonetheless, before you zero in on the perfect prank, it's important that you think about your sister's character and temperament: What kind of person is she? How do you think she'll react to being tricked?


Is she a jokester? Does she find nearly anything funny? If so, you probably have a bit more free reign in deciding how to prank her.
Is she sensitive and/or easily embarrassed? If so, you should be careful about what kinds of jokes or pranks you want to pull on her. You don't want to cause lasting hurt feelings that could put your relationship in jeopardy.;
, In your effort to tailor a unique prank, don't forget to identify your sister's interests and hobbies. You'll make a lasting impression if you can find a fun way to joke around with her about something she's really into.


Is your sister a jock? If so, then you could design a prank aimed at this, while being careful to not cross the line and destroy something that really matters a lot to her.
For example, if your sister is a soccer fanatic, you can let a little bit of air out of her ball each night. She'll have to continually re-pump the ball (which will be fun to watch!) but you won't have destroyed her property.
As another example: perhaps your sister is book lover who scorns pop lit. If so, you can remove her favorite classics from their dust jackets and replace them with the Hunger Games series.
She'll be in for a surprise when she pulls Great Expectations down from the shelf and instead is confronted with Katniss's dilemma! And who knows—she may decide to read it and see that the series is popular for a reason!

, Just as it's important to design a prank which is sensitive to your sister's personality, it's also important to think carefully about the dynamics of your relationship together.


You may think of yourself as very easy going, but if you and your sister don't always see eye-to-eye (perhaps she isn't as laid back), then choosing the wrong prank or pranking too often can hurt your relationship.
Try to think of ways in which you and your sister connect: if you both love to cook, for example, then choosing a prank which plays upon this shared interest could result in a prank you'll be able to laugh about together.

, The best pranks are those where everyone involved is able to laugh together (at least eventually). What you don't want to do is set your sister up to be laughed at.


Finding the fine line between pulling off a prank where your sister is mildly embarrassed, surprised, or confused and those where she is mortified or terribly scared can be tricky. Nonetheless, it's important to not move into this cruel territory.
One guideline to keep in mind to help keep you from crossing that line is to think about how you would react if the tables were turned.
For example, if your sister hacked into your phone and switched her contact info with your girlfriend's, would you be mildly annoyed and/or embarrassed, or would you feel that your privacy had been violated?
If you would be unable to trust or forgive her for pulling a particular prank on you, then don't pull it on her!

, Just as you don't want to cause any hurt feelings, you also want to avoid causing any physical harm to your sister.


You can find lots of prank ideas which set people up for physical falls, or which have you set up booby-traps where things will fall upon the unsuspecting victim.
When nothing goes wrong, and no one is hurt, then these can be funny. Keep in mind though, that it's typically out of your hands as to whether or not the prank will work as designed.
For example, there will be nothing to laugh at if your sister falls the wrong way and hits her head on the counter because you greased up the kitchen floor.

, In what follows, we offer some tried and true ideas for pranks, many of which are classics. Once you've thought about the unique characteristics of both your sister and your relationship, feel free to pick and try those that appeal to you.


Keep in mind that the very best pranks, though, are those that are inventive, creative, and designed specifically around the particular person you're trying to prank.
With that in mind, stretch your creativity to find unique pranks that will have your sister asking you “How did you think of that?” instead of “How could you do that to me?”.

Rub vegetable oil around the inside rim of the bottle.,
Light the paper on fire and drop it into the bottle.,
Place the egg on the rim of the bottle and watch.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Add vinegar to the bottle.,
Spoon the baking soda into the bottle.,
Flip the bottle upside down over the plate.",How to Place an Egg in a Beer Bottle," To get an egg into a beer bottle, you will need an egg, a pot, water, a stove, a glass beer bottle, vegetable oil, a small strip of paper, and matches. Remember, because the mouth of the beer bottle is small, you probably won’t get the whole egg into it. If you want to get the whole egg in, you must use a bottle with a wide enough mouth for the egg to rest comfortably on without falling through.Parental supervision is recommended for both boiling the egg and working with the matches.
A small to medium sized egg works best for this.
Use a glass bottle for this because the bottle will be in close contact with fire.
Cut a strip of paper thin enough that it can fit through the mouth of the bottle and not stick out the top.;
, Place the egg in a pot. Put enough water in the pot to submerge the egg and bring it to a boil. Once the water boils, remove it from the burner and let the egg sit for 9-12 minutes. The egg will cook while it is sitting in the hot water.Remove the egg from the hot water and let it cool.

, The easiest way to peel an egg is to run it under cold water or submerge it in ice water to cool it. Crack the egg gently on a hard surface to break the shell. As you start peeling, run the egg under cold water to make the shell peel away more easily.








Fresher eggs are more difficult to peel than older eggs.

, Get some vegetable oil on a paper towel or on your finger and rub a light layer around the inside of the mouth of the bottle. The vegetable oil increases lubrication and allows the egg to slide in easily.This step is not necessary, but is recommended.

, Strike the match to light it and then light the edge of the paper on fire. Drop the lit piece of paper into the glass bottle. Make sure you are using a glass bottle for this.








Proceed immediately to the next step after this.
Ask a parent for help with this step.

, Once the lit paper is inside the bottle, place the peeled hard-boiled egg on the mouth of the bottle and watch what happens. The egg will wiggle, the flame will go out and then the egg will get pushed into the bottle through the mouth.








The flame heats up the air inside the bottle making it expand. This hot air escapes past the egg causing it to wiggle. Once the flame consumes all of the oxygen it will burn out and the air in the bottle will cool down.
Cool air exerts less pressure. Because the air outside the bottle is warmer it exerts more air pressure and pushes the egg into the bottle.

, To get the pieces of egg back out of the bottle you will need baking soda, vinegar, and a plate.This experiment is essentially the reverse of what you did to get the egg into the bottle. You will increase the air pressure inside the bottle so the egg will get pushed back out.


You need about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of baking soda and 3 tablespoons of vinegar.

, Three tablespoons should be enough, but exact measurements aren’t necessary.With the bottle upright pour the vinegar into the bottle avoiding the egg as much as possible.

, Once the vinegar has been added, spoon the baking soda into the bottle on top of the vinegar. You may need to give the bottle a little swirl to mix everything.Once things start bubbling, proceed immediately to the next step.

, Immediately after adding the baking soda, flip the bottle upside down. To avoid making a mess, flip it over the plate to catch the solution that falls out. Make sure the egg pieces are positioned so that it blocks the mouth of the bottle.The baking soda reacts with the vinegar creating carbon dioxide gas. As the gas is made, the air pressure inside the bottle increases. The increased air pressure inside the bottle causes the egg to get pushed back out of the bottle.

Turn on your cell phone camera.,
Kneel down next to the door you wish to see under.,
Aim your phone lens under the door gap.,
Peer into the room using the phone screen.,
Take pictures or video.",How to See Under a Door2," The camera feature of your phone allows you to look at images captured by the viewfinder on your screen. Both the photo and video mode are acceptable for this purpose, with one able to take pictures of your subject, and the other able to take videos.


Turn off your flash feature on your phone camera, especially if you plan on taking photos. The bright flash of the camera is a dead giveaway of your activities.
Silence your phone completely, including vibrations. Vibrations rattling against the floor, as well as typical phone sounds, will give away your location. Try turning on airplane mode. Both Androidand iOSphones have this feature.

, Take care not to make too much noise or move too suddenly when kneeling. This includes noises and vibrations from your cell phone.

, Point the lens such that you have a clear view directly underneath the door. The most common way to achieve this is by placing the phone upside down on its head, or laying it on its side.

, The phone screen should give you a right-side-up view of the room no matter what position the phone is in. Your phone also offers exposure options, making seeing into a darker or overly bright room easier.Most phones also come with zoom features. Pinch or expand the screen to zoom in and out on any crucial details.
Keep in mind your cell phone screen won’t be able to angle itself for expansive views. Floor level is the extent of your coverage.

, Use your phone controls to take pictures or video of the events under the door. One advantage of taking video is that you will also be able to record audio of any conversations taking place on the other side of the door.


Remember: recording an individual without their consent is illegal.Phone cameras for both Androidand iOSalso have additional options such as slow-motion and panorama, if you have specific needs when viewing under the door.

Snake the camera under the door and turn it on.",How to See Under a Door3," The most expensive option for viewing under a door, telescoping or “snake” cameras can be purchased. They come in a few varieties, with some being reserved for more professional uses.


The cheapest among the telescoping cameras are the camera kits that plug directly into your cell phone. These can be purchased online and at some retail stores such as Walmart.

, The exact nature of these applications will vary from product to product. Make sure you read the specifications of the camera and its application to make sure your cell phone is compatible. Some are specially made to work with certain operating systems, while others will only work with certain models of cameras., Most snake cameras are made from a material that allows the camera to be angled in various directions. Maneuver the camera as desired and begin shooting.


If the camera wire is too flimsy to navigate effectively, try connecting it to a coat hanger or other pliable wire, and snake it under the door.Such cameras shoot in a small area, or use a macro lens. You’ll be able to see much of the room, but the image will be distorted or somewhat blurry compared to a normal camera.

Try a twist on the soda prank.,
Leave her a sweet surprise.,
Offer her a donut surprise.,
Prepare a caramel “treat” for your sister.",How to Prank Your Sister2," This is an oldy-but-a-goody. When your sister isn't looking, sneak a few dashes of salt onto her morning cereal and be prepared to watch her confusion as she takes her first sleepy bite!


If your sister is more cautious (maybe she's on to your pranking ways?) and guards her bowl, you can always premix the salt into the cereal, but you risk wasting an entire box or accidentally having one of your parents get to it first.

, Here's a twist on the cereal surprise: fix a bowl of your sister's favorite cereal at night after she's gone to bed. Be sure to place the spoon in the bowl, and then place the bowl in the freezer. Be sure to get to the kitchen before her in the morning and set out her cereal for her.


Watch her struggle to figure out what's going on as she grabs the spoon and picks up the entire bowl!
You can also freeze her orange juice at the same time.

, Your sis will think you're such a sweetheart when you bring her a soda. Little does she know that you gave it a few good shakes on the way to her room.


Yes, this one is a classic too, but it's remained a classic prank for a reason! Nothing beats a surprise syrupy spray in the face!

, Does your sister hoard her favorite soda or sparkling water? If so, this simple prank will be right up your alley: just rotate the pull tab on her soda cans 180° and watch with glee as she tries to figure out why her can won't open.You can step this one up by actually prying off all of her soda tabs and then watching her discover that every one of her precious drinks is “defective”.

, Does your sister have a sweet-tooth? If so, she won't be able to resist the bowl of candy you leave out: buy bags of Skittles, M&Ms and Reese's Pieces and mix them all together. These colorful candies are all great on their own, but mixed together? Yuck!This is a great one to keep in your back pocket for when your sister has a slumber party but won't let you hang out. You can prank both her and her friends at the same time!

, This is also a good prank to play when your sister is having friends sleep over. Buy a dozen cream-filled donuts and use a large syringe to suck out the cream (go ahead and save it for yourself—you deserve it!). Then, replace the cream with mayonnaise.When your sister and her friends come down for breakfast in the morning, they'll think that your parents left them a special treat. Have your camera ready to snap pics of their first (and only!) bites!
You can buy jelly-filled donuts instead and replace the jelly with barbecue sauce: disgusting!

, This prank is great for Halloween: Your sister won't be able to resist the tray of caramel “apples” you leave out on the counter. This prank takes a little bit of preparation but is not too hard:


Peel a few raw onions (making only one will probably look suspicious) and place a popsicle stick in the end of each one.
Take a 14oz bag of individually wrapped caramel candies and unwrap them.
Place the candies in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of milk and microwave until melted (about two minutes, stirring once or twice).
Dip the onions into the caramel, making sure they are fully coated, and then place in the refrigerator until they firm up.

Make a sweet face.,
Make a savory shower.,
Prepare a surprise hair treatment for your sister.,
Give your sister a dye-job.,
Help your sister get the perfect blow-out.,
Give your sister a tan.",How to Prank Your Sister3," Your sister needs to be a fairly sound sleeper for this one: sneak into her room once she's soundly asleep and quietly drizzle honey over her face. Be ready to be woken up by her shrieks in the morning!


Be sure to hide the evidence: put the honey back in the kitchen and wash the spoon you used.

, This is a great prank to do along with the sweet-face prank: Remove the shower-head in the bathroom that your sister uses, and place a chicken bouillon cube in it. When your sister rushes in to wash the honey off her face (and hair and hands!) she'll be doused with warm broth! It may help to grind the bouillon cube up a bit so that it will dissolve more quickly once the water runs through it and so that you'll be able to screw the shower-head back on tightly.
This pranks works best if your sister has her own bathroom; you don't want to accidentally prank your parents! Otherwise, you'll have to slip into the bathroom right before you know she'll be using it.

, Here's a variation on a shower-prank: Swap out your sister's favorite shampoo with honey. When she's ready to suds up, her hair will be a tangled, sticky mess!


You want your honey “shampoo” to be thin enough to actually squeeze out of the bottle, so you may want to experiment with mixing it with a bit of water, or even mixing the honey in with a small amount of shampoo or conditioner to get the right consistency. Make sure that it's still mostly honey, though!

, Get several packets of funky-colored Kool-Aid and dump them into your sister's shampoo or conditioner. Red or green are fun choices.


Unless your sister is half-asleep when she's showering, she'll probably notice that her suds are neon colored, but it will still be fun to hear her screams, and she'll have to scramble to find real shampoo to get the color out!

, Once your sister has finally managed to wash her hair of all the junk you pranked her with earlier, she'll want to fix her hair up pretty. The surprises haven't ended yet, though: While she's showering (or the night before) carefully pour a small amount of baby powder into the nozzle of her blow-dryer.


When she turns it on, she'll be blasted with a powdery spray! Back to the shower.

, This is a great trick to play on your sister, particularly if she's devoted to slathering on sun-screen every day. It's simple, too: just empty her regular lotion and refill the bottle with a self-tanning moisturizer. In a few days she'll be wondering why her complexion looks different!


To be extra devious, you can do this with her face moisturizer in addition to her body lotion.
Try to find a self-tanning lotion that has a similar scent to her regular lotion or she'll be on to you before it can take effect.

Wrap up a shiny surprise.,
Photo-bomb your sister's room.,
Make-over your sister's room into a fan-girl's dream room.,
Flip her room.",How to Prank Your Sister4," If you've got some time on your hands, your sister will be away for awhile, and if you can afford to buy several rolls of aluminum foil, you've got all you need for this prank. Wrap up as much of your sister's room in aluminum foil as you can.


Start with all of the small objects on her dressers and bookshelves, and then move to the large objects in her room, including her bed.

, Find a totally goofy picture of you and make multiple copies. When your sister is away, plaster them over every square inch of her room and wait for her reaction when she comes home and opens the door.


Alternatively, you can be more subtle, and hide the pictures of you in random places. Place one over her computer monitor, another over the bathroom mirror, one in her closet, another on her pillow, etc.
You don't need to hide all of the pictures all at once. This one can be a running joke, where you randomly hide one picture every day or two.

, This is a great prank to play before you sister has friends or her partner over. Choose a celebrity that your sister liked in the past but has outgrown now (like Justin Bieber, for example).


Buy a few fan magazines and print out pictures from the internet, and then go wild making over your sister's room to make her look like the biggest fan-girl ever.
If you can afford it, spend some cash to get a full-sized cardboard cut-out to place in a prominent place in the room.
Now just be ready to watch her try to explain to her friends that she's really not this lame!

, This prank is a bit time-consuming and fairly subtle, but is still pretty devious. When your sister is out (or even better, staying overnight with a friend), flip her room completely:


For example, if her bed is on the left side of the room, move it to the right, switch all of the items on her dresser to the opposite sides, reverse her closet, etc.
Make sure to keep everything neat, folded, and organized (assuming that's how it all started), but just in reverse-order.
When your sister comes home and asks who rearranged her room, pretend that you have no idea what she's talking about: “Everything looks exactly the same to me—are you feeling ok?”

"

Pull a switch-a-roo with your sister's contacts.,
Change your sister's passwords.,
Change her voice-mail message.,
Change the auto-correct on her phone.",How to Prank Your Sister5," For this prank, you'll have to be able to swipe your sister's phone for a while. When she's distracted, break into her phone and switch all of the contact names in her phone.


For example, if your sister has a partner, switch their name to yours in her contact list. You'll now be able to read all of her secret texts to her significant other!
If you change her password, write it down so you won't forget it and she won't have to go to the store and pay to get her phone unlocked.
Alternatively, you can delete all of the names in her contact list and replace them with mystery names: Guess Who #1, Guess Who #2, etc. It will take her ages to sort it all out!

, If you know your sister's passwords, you're in a great position to have a bit of fun. Hack into her accounts—Facebook, email, Twitter, etc.--and change her passwords to something new. She'll be totally frustrated, and if you can keep a straight face, you can watch her type away furiously trying to figure out what happened!


Consider changing all of the passwords to something like “Mysisteristhebesthumanbeing”. She'll never guess it.

, While you've got her phone, take a few minutes to record a new outgoing message for her sister's voice-mail.


Choose something totally embarrassing: for example, do your best imitation of her voice when you record “Hi, you've reached Kaitlyn, president of the Justin Bieber fan club. I'm too busy following Justin on Twitter to take your call, so leave a message at the beep.”
When you are done, set her phone to silent so that she won't hear calls. When her friends call, they'll be sent to voice-mail and will hear her new embarrassing message., If your sister texts a lot, this is a great prank. Once again, you'll have to swipe her phone, and then spend some time analyzing her texts. Look for words or phrases she uses a lot, like “I'm on my way”. Then, program her phone to auto-replace that phrase with something embarrassing or random.


For example, whenever she tries to text “On my way,” it will now fill in “I love Justin Bieber forever!”.
Alternatively, you can choose something random and annoyingly long, like a full paragraph from a book.

Give her the plague.,
“Help” your sister wake up on time.,
Set multiple wake-up calls.,
Give her a fright.,
Convince her she's had a growth-spurt.",How to Prank Your Sister6," When your sister is sleeping, sneak into her room and dot her face with a lipstick or a non-permanent red marker. Then when she wakes up, be sure to be the first one to see her: gasp when you see your face and ask her if she's sick.


She'll run to the mirror and be convinced that she's got chicken pox (or worse)!

, After your sister goes to bed, move all of the clocks ahead five hours (but keep your own alarm at the correct time and hide it from your sister's view). Then, set your alarm for 3am and run into your sister's room to let her know that it's 8am and she's going to be late for school.


Watch her run around frantically trying to get ready until she finally notices that it's still dark out.
If your sister doesn't pay attention to the days of the week or is younger, you may be able to pull off convincing her that she's late for school on a Saturday. You don't even need to set the alarms to get up early for this one!

, Gather together as many alarm clocks as you can (five or six would be great) and set them at different intervals throughout the night (for example, 2am, 2:30am, 3am, etc.). Hide them throughout your sister's room in places where she normally doesn't look before going to bed (for example, in her closet, in her sock drawer, behind her curtains, etc.).


Be sure to set your own alarm to go off a few minutes before the first one so that you can watch the craziness.
Your sister might be a bit cranky in the morning after having lost so much beauty rest, so keep your distance!

, If you tried the fan-girl prank from above and splurged on a cardboard cut-out, you won't want your purchase to go to waste. To get more mileage from your purchase, sneak the cut-out into your sister's room in the middle of the night and place it right next to her bed.


Then, make a banging noise sufficient to get her to wake up, and cover your ears as she screams at the “intruder”.
If you don't want to spend the money to buy a life-sized cardboard cut-out, you can recycle cardboard boxes: find the largest sized boxes you can, and using strong scissors or box-cutters, cut out a human figure.
If you're not great at drawing, place them on the floor and have a friend trace around you.
You may need to make the figure in pieces and tape it together (use a strong tape like duct tape), but you don't need perfection. You just need a rough human shape: your sister will be mostly asleep when she discovers it.

, Buy a package of large safety pins and carefully fold the side seams of her favorite jacket and pin them from the underside (you're trying to make her jacket tighter). You can also fold up the cuffs of her jeans and her shirt sleeves and pin them as well.


Next, put cushion inserts into her shoes. You can usually buy very simple inserts for just a dollar or two at the store: just trim them down to your sister's shoe size.
The inserts should make her shoes feel tighter; if her shoes are fairly roomy, put two inserts in each.
Now, when your sister tries to get dressed in the morning, everything will be too short and too tight!

Find a little extra light.,
Seal the glow stick in a plastic bag.,
Stick the glow stick in a freezer.,
Take it out and shake it.",How to Make Glow Sticks Glow Again1," Crack the glow stick down every bit of its length. If no light at all appears, your glow stick is completely used up and there's no hope for it. If you can get a tiny bit of light, even just a couple spots, you've got something to work with.


The light in a glow stick is caused by a reaction between two chemicals. One is kept inside a glass tube. Cracking the tube breaks the glass and lets the chemicals mix and react.
Be gentle. Cracking too hard will break the glow stick and spill glass and goo that can irritate the skin.;
, Put the stick in a zip-locked bag. Press out the air from the bag, then seal it. It's unlikely that the glow stick will break during this method, but just in case, this will make it easy to throw away.

, For best results, stick it underneath a lightweight frozen object. This will freeze the liquids inside, preventing them from reacting.


Setting your freezer to a colder setting may help as well. Before you do this, be aware that this can cause excessive ice buildup or freeze liquids in an attached refrigerator

, Check on the glow stick after an hour and try shaking it and cracking it. If this doesn't work, return it to the freezer overnight and try again the next day. Most brands of glow sticks will get a little extra glowing time when the liquids inside melt and recombine.


Some brands will be quite bright, while others will just stay at the same dim level, but last longer. There's no way to tell what will happen without experimenting.
Keep it in the plastic bag while you shake it, just in case it breaks.
It can take a little while for the glow stick to warm up and glow again.

Select a diode strength and color.,
Take apart an old DVD or Blu-Ray disk burner.,
Salvage the diode from the disk burner.,
Connect the diode to a laser driver.,
Power the laser with batteries.,
Encase the laser.,
Obtain a laser lens.,
Concentrate the beam.,
Widen the beam when you are finished.",How to Make a Burning Laser," The strength of a diode will be listed in microwatts (mW). The color of the diode will be determined by its wavelength (measured in nanometers, nm). A wavelength of 650 nm corresponds to a red laser, a wavelength of 405 nm corresponds to a blue laser, and a green laser has a wavelength around 520 nm. Green lasers are the most expensive, followed by blue. Red is the cheapest.You can buy diodes online and sometimes at electronic supply stores. The diode costs can range anywhere from tens to thousands of dollars, depending on the laser you choose.;
, If you aren’t picky about the color, you can take apart an old DVD or Blu-Ray disk burner. There will be two diodes. Find the diode on the disk burning side. The one on the disk reading side is not strong enough to produce a burning laser.The diode will look like a small round light. It is likely encased in metal and will be positioned so that it can shine on the bottom of the DVD/Blu-Ray tray.

, Once you have located the disk burning diode, remove it from the DVD (or Blu-Ray) burner. You may have to remove small screws or cut the diode away from the rest of the burner. It is possible that the diode is encased in a metal casing. If this is the case, the casing can be left on the diode after you remove it., The laser driver is the electrical component that controls the functioning of the laser. The diode will likely need soldered to the laser driver. There should be two leads coming from the diode for this purpose. Use a soldering gun to solder the leads to the driver at the positive and negative terminals. These terminals should be labeled on the driver and extend to the edge of the driver for soldering purposes.The driver should not be connected to any power source until soldering is complete.

, After the diode has been connected to the driver, you can connect the driver to a power source. Batteries are the go to choice since they make your laser portable. You will need at least AA batteries to produce a burning laser.The driver will have leads for a power supply. These leads will need to be connected to a battery pack or directly to the battery. If the leads need soldered, you will have to use a battery pack. You cannot solder onto a battery.

, You can buy a laser casing online to house the parts of your laser. Alternatively, you can make a laser casing from things lying around your house. Popular items used to make casings include Altos mint cans, bic lighters, and the casings of weaker laser pointers., A laser lens is needed to condense the light from a wide pattern to a thin beam. This concentrates the energy of your laser. This concentrated beam is what allows you to burn things with your laser.Glass lenses are better than plastic lenses, but they are more expensive.

, Adjust the lens to concentrate the beam when you are using the laser. This will make the beam powerful enough to burn through some materials and ignite matches or paper. Be very careful when using this laser. Do not point it at anyone or anything that does not belong to you. The laser is very dangerous when focused.It is a crime to point the laser at aircraft and/or motor vehicles.

, Adjust the beam so that the laser is spread out. This will make the laser less powerful when hitting any one spot. This is the safest way to store the laser in case it accidentally gets turned on. Keep in mind that the laser can still be dangerous, however. It should never be within reach of children."

Heat a pot of water.,
Pour the water into a glass jar.,
Let cool (recommended).,
Drop the glow stick in the water.",How to Make Glow Sticks Glow Again2," Heat until the water begins to steam or simmer. Heat speeds up the chemical reaction that causes the glow. By warming the glow stick, you can make it glow brightly for a short time, sometimes up to half an hour.If a glow stick ""died"" more than a day ago, this will have little to no effect. Once it's used up, it's used up.

, A sturdy jar will withstand the heat better than a glass. Find one tall enough to hold most of the glow stick.


You can use a mug instead. There's a risk of melting the glow stick, so don't use a nice mug.

, If your water came to a full boil, definitely wait five minutes for the water to cool. If your water was only steaming, you can go ahead right away, or wait about a minute.


The glow stick plastic will melt if the water is too hot. Some brands can withstand boiling water (100ºC / 212ºF), while others may melt in water above 70ºC (158ºC).If using a mug, wait ten minutes for boiling water.

, Leave it in for thirty seconds, then pull it out with tongs or rubber gloves. If there's any ""oomph"" left in the glow stick, it should glow brightly for a short time.


Do not put your face over the jar. The glow stick is unlikely to explode, but it's best to be safe.
If the glow stick melts, seal the jar in a plastic bag and throw it away. These materials cannot be recycled, and the jar should not be used again.

Ruining a possession that matters a lot to someone
Involving sharp objects or fire in your prank
Making someone angry by scaring them

Save the sanitizer in a cup or buy your friend a new bottle before doing this prank. They may become upset if they have to buy more sanitizer themselves.

, There are many companies that provide prank mailing services. You can mail your friend a box of glitter, an eggplant, bugs, and more. Do an online search to find the service that best fits your purposes.If possible, mail the package to your workplace or school so that you can see your friend open it.

, Create flyers advertising a Chewbacca roar contest and place your friend’s phone number at the bottom. Next, place the flyers all around your neighborhood. If you’re lucky, your friend will receive dozens of Chewbacca impression voicemails.Avoid pulling this prank using someone’s work phone. Their voicemail may fill up and they’ll miss important calls.

Make “candy apples.” First, create a batch of classic candy-apple coating.,
Make disgustingly cheesy “orange juice.” Purchase a box of dried macaroni and cheese and a small bottle of orange juice.,
Create toothpaste Oreos.",How to Pull Harmless Pranks3," Next, remove the papery layers from a few medium-sized onions. Push a wooden skewer into each onion to create a handle. Dip each onion in the candy coating and set it on a sheet of wax paper to dry. The onion will perfectly resemble a delicious red candy apple.


Once they cool, casually offer your friends a “candy apple” and watch their reactions as they bite into the onion.
Make sure you don’t serve this prank food to someone with an onion allergy.

, Drink or pour out the orange juice. Next, pour the cheesy powder insert from the box of macaroni and cheese into your empty bottle. Add water and screw the lid back on. Shake the bottle until there are no cheese lumps in the liquid.Once the bottle is ready, offer it to a friend and watch them gag as they drink it.
Chill the bottle until you’re ready to use it. A warm bottle of orange juice might make your friends suspicious.

, Purchase a package of Oreo cookies and a tube of toothpaste. Next, carefully pull each cookie sandwich apart and scrape out the icing. Squeeze a dollop of toothpaste on one of the cookies and press them back together. When your friend eats a cookie, they will get a disgustingly minty surprise.Place the minty cookies on a plate. Next, offer your friends a cookie and watch them gag as they eat it.
If you have suspicious friends, leave a plate of minty Oreos lying around to tempt them. You may not get to watch them eat it, but you’ll hear about it later.

Salt their toothbrush.,
Place a “bug” on the lampshade.,
Create useless soap.,
Wrap their bed in plastic wrap.",How to Pull Harmless Pranks4," Sprinkle salt over the bristles of your roommate or sibling’s toothbrush. The next time they brush their teeth, their toothpaste will taste salty and disgusting.


Use a small grain sea salt or table salt. Otherwise, they may see the salt grains on their toothbrush and become suspicious.

, This prank is fun to play on people who are afraid of large bugs. First, print a picture of a large cockroach or other gross insect. Next, cut it out and tape it onto the inside of a lamp shade. When your roommate or sibling turns on the lamp, they will see the terrifying silhouette of the large insect and believe that a real bug is inside the lamp shade.Look for images of gross insects to print out on the internet.
Use clear tape to attach the insect cut-out onto the lamp shade.

, Find a bottle of clear nail polish and a dry bar of soap. Paint several layers of clear nail polish on the soap, allowing it to dry between layers. Next, place the soap in the shower or next to the sink. When your sibling or roommate tries to use it, the soap won’t create any suds at all.


Apply at least four layers of clear nail polish. The more layers you apply, the better this prank will work.

, Purchase several boxes of clear plastic wrap from your local grocery store. Next, wrap your sibling or roommate’s bed in tight layers of plastic wrap by running the roll around the entire bed frame. When they go to bed, they’ll have to spend several minutes struggling to remove the plastic wrap first.Try to use a few long pieces instead of many smaller pieces. This will make the wrapping harder to remove.
You can either wrap each pillow and blanket separately or wrap everything together in a tightly sealed package.

Plan a surprise attack from the closet.,
Ring the doorbell and then hide in a box outside the front door.,
Give him a good scare.",How to Prank Your Brother1," This is an absolutely brilliant plan. First, pick a time when your brother doesn't think you're home and nobody else is there. Then, hide in a closet far away from he is, maybe your own. Then, quietly call the house from your cell phone. When your brother answers the phone, tell him that you need him to go to your closet (or whatever closet you're in) to check on something for you. Then, when he opens the closet, spring out at him and say, ""boo!"" He'll never expect to see you there and will freak out! You'll be able to hold this one against him for years.;
, The first sentence says it all. Find a big cardboard box that you can climb inside that closes up top, place it on your front porch, and then ring the doorbell and jump inside the box, making sure to quickly close it over yourself. When your brother opens the door and approaches the box, you can jump out! This is guaranteed to make him scream. It works best if you ring the doorbell when he's a bit away from the door, so he doesn't answer it too soon and see you climbing into the box.


If you can't find any big cardboard boxes around the house, then you can get some at your local grocery store. Just ask one of the employees -- many grocery stores often give away their extra boxes.

, Wait until he's so obsessed with what's going on with his computer that he completely doesn't notice who else is in the room. If you can do this at night, when most of the lights in his room are out, then even better. Put on a creepy clown, Scream, or Jason mask and slowly creep up to him until you're practically breathing down his neck. Then, release a guttural, terrifying howl, and watch him jump five feet in the air.


If you have another friend or sibling who is as quiet as a mouse, he or she can film the whole thing for effect, and you can use it as blackmail.

Know the goal of your prank.,
Verify the computer's are on the same network.,
Open the command prompt on your computer.,
Open the remote shutdown interface.,
Set the parameters of your remote shutdown.,
Enact the shutdown/restart and enjoy.",How to Prank Your Friends1," This prank uses a set of processes on your computer to signal the prankee's computer to shut down. You can even send a message to be displayed to the prankee to indicate how long he has until his computer remotely shuts down. You and the prankee will need to have computers that are somewhat recent and running Windows XP or newer.


Windows version 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 should work with this prank.;
, For this prank to work, you'll need your computer and the prankee's computer to be on the same network. Depending on your version of Windows, there may be small variations in how to check the networks for each computer, but generally, you should be able to do this by:


Navigating to your control panel, which can be found in the lower left hand corner start menu of older versions of Windows. You can also open your file explorer by clicking its icon on the lower status bar of most recent versions of Windows, and in the following window, select ""Network"" from the directory pane on the left.
In the resulting window, you should see a list of computers. At minimum, you should see your own computer and its network status. You'll need both your own computer and the prankee's computer to be listed in this window with a connected status., The easiest way to access the command prompt interface is by starting it from the program launcher. Open the launcher by holding the ⊞ Win key and pressing R. This should open an small window with a text input box to the right of the word ""Open.""


In the ""Run"" window's text input box, type the letters ""CMD"". This should open a window with a black background and white letters.

, In the command prompt window (the black background window with white letters), type ""shutdown /i"" and press ↵ Enter to prompt the remote shutdown window to open. You should now see a list of computers on your network., In the remote shutdown dialog box, choose the prankee's computer from the computers listed. Then, from the dropdown menu below the listed computers, choose whether you'd like to restart or shutdown the computer. In the remote shutdown dialog box, you can also:


Choose to warn the prankee of the impending shutdown/restart.
Adjust the frequency the shutdown/restart warnings appear.
Leave a message explaining the reason for the shutdown/restart. A strange message might have an interesting effect on the prankee - be creative!, Once you have set the remote shutdown/restart parameters, all you have to do is hit OK, and the wheels of your prank will be set in motion. You may want to perform this prank several times while recording the reaction of the prankee to capture the reaction. Priceless!

Make him put whipped cream on his face in his sleep.",How to Prank Your Brother2," This is another classic. Wait until your brother is sound asleep. This works best if he's on his back, with both of his arms out. Then, carefully squeeze a bunch of whipped cream in one of the palms of his hands. (If you really have no mercy, then you can use shaving cream, instead!) Then, use a feather or something small and light to gently brush against his face. He'll reach the hand with the whipped cream out, quickly getting the stuff all over his face!


If you want to make sure this works every time, you can put whipped cream in both his hands!

Place a bucket of water over a door.,
Put tape over all the light switches.,
Give him a wedgie.,
Switch up the contents of his drawers.,
Stuff cotton in your brother's shoes.,
Stick paper on his butt.,
Do the ""palms down"" prank.",How to Prank Your Brother3," This is an oldie but a goodie. Simply open a door part of the way and place a bucket filled with water above it so it rests between the wall and the top of the door. When your brother opens it, he'll be taking a little impromptu bath! This works best in the kitchen or another part of your house where it won't matter if you get water everywhere. And hey, if you can do it somewhere else, even better!

, Put some clear tape on the light switches early in the morning. Your brother will still be nice and groggy, wondering why none of the lights in the house work! When he sees you, tell him your house has no power. Wait for him to figure out that you're lying on his own. You can even tell him that the water in the house doesn't work, either, and see if he falls for it.

, Wait until your brother has turned away from you, and then sneak up on him as quietly as you can. Reach down to grab his underwear and pull it up as high as you can. This is guaranteed to make him scream and squirm! If you're really feeling up for it, you can try to give him an atomic wedgie, trying to pull his underwear up so high that you can wrap it over his head. This works best if your brother is a lot smaller than you are!

, Go into his room and either switch up his drawers, if that's possible, or just work to move the contents of one drawer into another until you've switched up all of his drawers. He will be completely confused and this is a perfect and unexpected prank. Plus, you can have the bonus of snooping through his things while you're at it! If he asks you if you've gone into his room, then just act completely oblivious.

, This one is especially fun if your brother is still growing. Just stuff a little bit of cotton in your brother's shoes. The next time he'll put them on, he'll think something funny is going on, like maybe that he's outgrown his shoes. He may even walk around like that all day if he's not smart enough to think some funny business is going on! This is perfect for boots or sneakers.

, This is another quick and easy prank. Get a piece of paper that's a similar color to a surface like a couch or a chair, or just get whatever color you want if your brother doesn't really pay attention to where he sits. Place some glue or double-sided tape on the piece of paper, and wait until he sits down. When he gets up, he'll be walking around with a piece of paper on his butt! This is an updated version of the always-effective ""kick me"" sign!

, This is a fun one. Show your brother that you've gotten really good at balancing a glass of water on your hand when your palm is down on a table. Bet him that he can't do it with both hands; he'll likely be up for the challenge. Then, have him put both of his palms down on a table while you place two full glasses of water over his hands. Then, say ""Bye!"" or ""Good luck!"" and casually walk out of the room. He'll be trapped -- he'll have to dump water all over himself before he can be set free!

Start out with measuring some fishing line.,
Tie the fishing wire to the cash.,
Position the cash in a good place.,
Find a good hiding spot.,
Wait for someone to go for the money.",How to Prank Someone with Money1," Measure it out and cut it to at least ten feet. You can always cut it if it’s too long but it’s harder to tie string to lengthen it. The longer it is, the easier it will be to hide or trick someone far away.;
, Ensure that the string has a tight grip over the cash, so that it won’t let go of the cash. However, you don’t want to make it look like it is tied to a string. The most sufficient way to do that is to make a coil with the string and tape it to the underside of the cash.

, You are going to want to find a place next to a good hiding spot, so think ahead. Find a place where someone is sure to walk by. In an overly crowded place, someone might step on the string and it will mess the whole prank up.


An example of a good location would be in the living area at home.
If you want to do it in a public place, a hallway might be a good place. Or, the sidewalk might be a good place because it stands out and is where people will mostly likely walk by it.

, A corner might be a perfect place. The most important thing to do is to not move. If you don’t move, it is much less likely that you will be caught. Another place might be behind a bush. However, make sure the string doesn’t get caught in the branches.

, Reel the string in and watch as your victim bends down and tries to pick it up. Try not to laugh as you see their face change from surprise to confusion and then realization. Stay hidden! Once they get to about eight feet away, quickly pull the string back to your hiding place and hope they didn’t track the money to where you are hidden.

Know the goal of your prank.,
Ask the prankee what his favorite fruit is.,
Set the trap of your prank.,
Tell the prankee to smell the image you've drawn.,
Smack the prankee's hand lightly into his face.",How to Prank Your Friends2," Your mission, if you choose to accept it for this simple physical prank, is to get the prankee to hit himself in the face. This will have many effects. It will make the prankee feel silly, be humorous to onlookers, and may even leave him thinking, ""'How did I fall for that?'""

, The answer to this question isn't especially important; this is part of your prank! You're trying to distract attention from the possibility you are up to something with this question.


Keep a straight face when you're asking or else you might tip the prankee of your shenanigans!
If you have difficulty keeping a straight face, you might want to practice some emotional control exercises.

, You'll probably want to make up an excuse to explain what you are doing because you'll need to ask to see the prankee's hand. Hold his hand palm up, and with your finger draw the rough image of his favorite fruit. Some excuses you might use to explain what you are doing:


""I learned a real cool trick in my psychology class. You can actually trick the brain into imagining certain smells, like fruit. Here, let me show you.""
""The other day I was hanging out with my fiend and he showed me this real cool magic trick. Can I show you?""
""I read about this silly trick online that's supposed to fool your nose into smelling something that isn't there. It didn't work on me. You want to give it a try? It's real easy.""

, To do this, the prankee will have to bring the palm of his hand up to his face and up to his nose. You are now in striking distance of completing your prank.

, While the prankee is smelling his hand, hit it lightly so that he lightly smacks himself on the nose. You might want to follow this up with some good-natured heckling, saying things like:


""I can't believe you fell for that!""
""It's OK, I fell for that one, too. That's why I had to pull it on you!""
""I gotcha pretty good, didn't I?""

Know the goal of your prank.,
Choose your moment to set up wisely.,
Determine the ideal location.,
Tape your prank into position.,
Set up a domino effect.",How to Prank Your Friends3," This prank will use a loud noise to startle the prankee. To accomplish this, you'll be using tape to fasten an air horn in an unlikely location in such a way that the airhorn is triggered and a loud noise made without the prankee realizing beforehand. For this prank, you'll need:Airhorn
Tape

NOTE: depending on the surface you are taping your airhorn to, you may need gentler tape so as not to do damage to paint or wallpaper.

, You should set up this prank when the prankee is away from the place you are planning to perform it. This way he won't overhear the airhorn when you test it out. He may figure out what you're doing if he hears you setting up!

, When selecting your location, your ingenuity and imagination are the only limit. You might tape the airhorn to the wall in such a way that when a door is opened it causes the airhorn to go off, startling the prankee. You could put it beneath his chair so that when he sits the airhorn triggers.Use camouflage to disguise your airhorn when you are able. An airhorn taped to the bottom of a chair will be quite suspicious. Disguise this prank by putting a jacket or hoodie sweatshirt on the back of the chair to block the horn from view., Take your tape and use it to attach your airhorn to the location you have chosen. You'll want to do a trail run after you've secured the airhorn in place so that you're certain the prank will work. Once you've set the prank, you'll have to wait for it to be sprung. Don't worry - you'll know it when you hear it.


If the prankee is away for a period of time, you may want to check on your prank several times throughout the day. Depending on heat, humidity, tape quality, and the surface you've taped the airhorn to, your tape may loosen over time, ruining your prank.

, People rarely expect to be pranked multiple times in a row. You can use this to your advantage to prank your target especially well. Do this by setting up several airhorn traps for the prankee in locations he's likely to trigger. You might:


Another good place to set up an airhorn trap is under the prankee's bed. Set up your airhorn so that when he lays down, he sets off the airhorn.

Know the goal of your prank.,
Borrow the prankee's keys.,
Prepare yourself to be shocked.,
Time your prank to prevent actual theft.,
Enjoy the reaction and clean up the mess.",How to Prank Your Friends4," A car is a big investment for most people, and by making your prankee believe that his car window has been destroyed, you can get a hilarious response out of him. You'll have some cleanup after you set up the prank, but to perform it you'll only need:


Car window (similar to the prankee's car window)
Gloves (recommended; optional)

NOTE: cheap car windows can likely be purchased from your local junkyard or salvage shop. You might even be able to get staff to help you choose the right kind of window by bringing them in on the prank!

, You don't want to be accused of theft at any point during this prank, so you should only do this with close friends. While the prankee is otherwise occupied, like right before he wakes up in the morning, snag his keys and unlock his car. Then:


Remove anything of value from the car. You don't want anything to be stolen because of your prank!
Roll down one of the windows of his car so that it is completely inside the door and cannot be seen.
Shatter your window carefully and quietly. Then use your gloves to spread the glass around the door of the rolled down window and a little bit inside the car to make it look realistic., To get the best response out of the prankee, you might want to agitate him by getting upset with him over his car being broken into. You might point out that at least he didn't have anything valuable in the car - an excellent tactic if you've removed something valuable from the car the night before when setting up your prank.

, With the window rolled down, the prankee's car will be vulnerable to actual theft. You'll either need to keep an eye on it so it isn't stolen, or time your prank so that the car is only left unattended for a few moments before your friend comes out and sees it.


You might arrange for your friend to drive you somewhere the morning of your prank so you know exactly when the both of you will be headed to the car.
Don't perform this prank before the prankee leaves for work. Shattered glass can be dangerous, even if his car window isn't actually broken.

, Since you were the one pranking and had fun at the prankee's expense, you should be the one to clean up the mess of your prank. Use a vacuum cleaner to suck up little bits of glass that are scattered on the inside of the car and sweep up any shards outside the car as well.

Put clear nail polish over his soap.,
Put food coloring on a bar of soap.,
Put red food coloring in his toothbrush.",How to Prank Your Brother4," This is another classic. Take some clear nail polish and cover his soap with it. After it dries, the soap won't be able to work! Make sure that there's no other soap in the shower and that he has nothing to use after he gets in there. When he comes out of the shower and says his soap doesn't work, look completely confused. You can even sneakily replace it with a clean bar of soap so it works fine if he tries to demonstrate what happened.

, Place a bit of yellow or light-colored food coloring on the bottom of a bar of soap. When your brother goes into the bathroom next, he'll start washing his hands and will wonder why they're only getting more and more dirty! And if he comes out without any tell-tale signs on his hands, then you can laugh at him for not properly washing his hands! Just make sure to warn everyone else about the prank so your unsuspecting mother or grandparent doesn't come out of the bathroom with yellow hands.

, Just one drop of red food coloring on the bottom of your brother's toothbrush will go completely unnoticed. He'll start brushing his teeth and will look in the mirror in horror, thinking he has the world's most sensitive gums. Soon, he'll start to look like a vampire, and he may suspect that you've been up to something! This works best in the morning, when he's rushing around and has no time for your jokes!

Decorate a sponge as a piece of cake.,
Pretend to eat flies.,
Serve him tasty ""toothpaste Oreos."",
Make him drink vinegar milk.,
Make salt and pepper drinks.",How to Prank Your Brother5," Take a sponge and cover it with frosting, chocolate, sprinkles, or any of your brother's favorite treats. Leave it in an inconspicuous place in the kitchen, maybe on top of the microwave or even in the fridge, kind of making it seem like it's your piece of cake and you really don't want anyone to touch it. If you bring it up to him, then he'll have less of a chance of eating it. Then, sit back, relax, and wait for him to howl in confusion when he bites into an ordinary kitchen sponge.

, This is another fun one. Squish a raisin into a napkin and then tell your brother you just caught a fly. Then, get a maniacal look on your face and start to laugh like you're off your rocker. Reach into the napkin and eat the fly, delightedly smacking your lips as you chew the whole thing. Then, just shrug and walk away like nothing out of the ordinary happened. Don't tell him what you really did -- he'll never figure it out.

, This is another gourmet-level prank. If your brother is really into Oreos, then all you have to do is carefully separate an Oreo, fill the inside with white toothpaste, and put it back together again. You can even do this to a handful of Oreos if you don't know which one he'll take. Wait for your brother to take a bite of his favorite treat, looking utterly confused and grossed out in the process.

, Wait until your brother pours himself a glass of milk. If he drinks a bit of it and then leaves it unattended, then quickly run in and drop just a bit of vinegar into the glass and stir it around. Wait until he returns to the glass and takes a confused and icky sip. Have a trash can close because he might vomit. Just make sure the glass isn't left unattended for too long or an unsuspecting family member may drink the sour liquid!

, Take a drink that your brother has been drinking (other than water). Put salt and pepper in it––the more salt and pepper, the better. Ugh!

""Break"" his remote.,
Put his video game controller in jello.,
Change his desktop picture.",How to Prank Your Brother6," If he loves to channel surf as much as the average brother, then this will be the perfect prank for him. Just take a tiny piece of clear tape and cover the light on the remote just enough so that it no longer works. He'll be completely confused when he tries to watch his favorite show, and may even try to put in new batteries before he figures out your trick (if he figures it out at all!). This works best when you have his least favorite TV show playing.

, Make a box of jello and pour a layer into a container large enough to hold the game controller. Use food wrap to completely cover the game controller, then for added security, place it into an airtight bag and seal tightly. When the layer of jello has hardened, place the controller on top and cover it with a layer of liquid jello. Let it harden. Take out the jello. Place the controller back and watch him freak out., If he actually manages to step away from his computer for five minutes, change his desktop picture to something completely ridiculous as quickly as you can. Pick My Little Ponies, Teletubbies, or pictures of the cutest cats you've ever seen. This works best if he has a laptop that he'll be taking out in public later, so he can surprise a room full of people with the desktop filled with flowers and puppies.

Figure out ways to get to these locations.,
Divide the targeted habitations into basic areas.,
Bringing it all together: When operating in hostile territory (your target's room) you will need to act quickly, discreetly, and quietly.",How to Prank Large Groups of People,"


Suggested items are string, no-residue tape, twist ties, Mentos, talc powder, stiff cardboard, or anything else you would need for a potential prank.;
, Be careful, however, as you enlist help. You do not want your targets to be forewarned of your intentions.

,


Eliminate those that would cause property damage, injury, or anything of that sort. There is nothing funny there. Keep your mind open to all sorts of crazy ideas, and write down whatever comes to mind.

,,


Beware of people who would ""flip out"" and ruin your fun. Authority figures are not usually a good idea. Note rivalries (preferably friendly) between members of your group--this can present an opportunity for confusion as both prankees assume their rival has pranked them.

,


Hotel staff can be very helpful as you obtain a list ""for your group."" The below will focus on a hotel setting.

,


Card keys, doors left open or walking in are all effective. To get a card key: Most rooms will have multiple keys. Enter the room with accomplices and a friendly excuse. As you see a key, move over to it, then pick something else up and distract the people in the room with it (or have your accomplice make the diversion). While everyone is distracted, slip the card into your pocket and leave slightly after. Distraction is the key to keys.

, There are a multitude of pranks you can do; you are only limited by your imagination. Below are some suggestions.

Bathroom: Loosen the shower head. Turn off the water in the toilet, either by turning the valve on the wall or disconnecting the chain in the tank (mechanical toilets only). For a more grandiose toilet trick, disconnect Take the tank refill tube and bend it so it faces out from just beneath the tank lid. When flushed, the toilet will immediately begin to spray the refill water all over the occupant of the bathroom. Devastating. This only works if the water is on. Turn the water in the sink off. If there are hair dryers, discreetly place baby powder (talc or cornstarch) in one end so anyone using it will get a face full of powder. Here are some other bathroom tricks (not tested by contributor). Place Icy Hot or Vaseline on the toilet seat. Pour clear gelatin into the toilet bowl. Put Kool Aid, a jolly rancher or a meat broth cube in the shower head (beef, anyone?)






Bedroom: Unscrew all of the light bulbs and disconnect all electronics except the alarm clock. ""Short-sheet"" the beds by remaking the bed with the sheets folded halfway down the bed. Set the alarm clock for some time very early in the morning. Call the main desk and order as many wake-up calls as possible for times in the middle of the night. If you are feeling vindictive, put some salt in the bedsheets (not tested). Or, for a different touch, put water balloons or ice in the beds. Disconnect the receiver from the phone. Tape down the little button beneath the receiver with clear tape.






Front room: Unscrew the light bulbs. Put random things in the fridge. Put salt or other nasty tasting (but harmless) things in drinks. Get a Diet Coke and thread a Mentos on a small piece of string and hide under lid of the bottle; cut most of the string left outside the cap off. Strategically place the rigged Diet Coke; when opened, the Mentos will drop in, creating a sudden fountain of sweet goodness exploding all over the unsuspecting victim. Warm Diet Coke works best! (Do not place near valuable objects). Tape down and disable the phone as described above. Rearrange furniture. Raise and lower the room temperature as much as possible. If all else fails, hide in a dark corner and leap out making the freakish noises only you can make, scaring your target silly.






For a challenge, rig the door so that it dumps water on the first person to enter. There are two separate ways of doing this. Method 1: Get four plastic cups (or number desired) and fill with icy water. Take a thin, stiff object such as a blank CD and place a circular piece of tape on one half of one side of the CD. Have an accomplice place the disc's sticky portions to an underside of a door frame. While supporting the CDs, place the cups of water on top of them. Close the door slowly, pushing the CDs above door edge. When prepared, the CDs will be wedged in between the door frame and the top of the door with the icy water-filled cups waiting on the CDs. When an unsuspecting victim walks through the door, the CDs and water will be supported a moment by the tape (allowing victim to be directly below) before tipping and plunging the frigid contents onto the hapless person below. Method 2"" If the door frame has a lip, place four cups (or number desired) on this lip. Hold them up with sufficiently strong tape, adhering them to each other and the wall. Take a piece of string, and connect it to the series of cups with one end. Tie the other end to the inside door handle (the side that will be seen last by the victim) of the room, leaving some slack to allow the door to be opened a certain distance before the trap springs. Fill the suspended cups with icy water, taking care not to exceed the sticking capacity of the tape (you want it to last for your intended victim.) If set up correctly, the target will walk through the door, opening the door as they walk in, using up the loose string. Once the slack on the string is used up, it will tauten and pull the water filled cups free, dumping the contents on the shocked person below. Works magnificently!







, If you have accomplices, delegate tasks for maximum speed and efficiency. Above all, be safe and have fun! Your friends and victims will never forget your kind, considerate gestures to make their boring, bland journey into a fun-filled fiasco!

Come up with a personality for your twin.,
Name your twin.,
Pick a style for your twin.,
Come up with a reason why your twin hasn't been around.,
Use Photoshop to make it more believable.,
Create an online persona for your twin.,
Pick a victim who you don't know super well.,
Casually mention your twin.,
Have your friends help out.,

Make your fake twin appear.,
Tell your friend that he or she has been pranked.",How to Prank a Friend and Make Them Think You Have a Twin," Your ""twin"" can't be exactly like you or there will be absolutely no fun in playing a prank. Think of famous real or fake twins — the Olsen twins, the Mowry Twins, or even the famous fake twins, Steve Urkel and Stefan Urquelle. They distinguish themselves by not being exactly like each other. One tends to be more brainy and reserved while the other is more suave and outgoing. But you don't have to stick to these common twin stereotypes. Not every twin is as different as Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield from Sweet Valley High, but having some distinguishing characteristics will make it easier for you to make your twin seem like a living, breathing human being.


Still, you should find a different personality for your twin; if you're more adventurous, your twin can be more into playing music. If you want to be a veterinarian, your twin can be afraid of pets, or even the outdoors.
Really think about it. Sit down and make a list of all of the characteristics of your twin. Write down the things your twin likes and dislikes, and write down at least five personality characteristics of your twin. Is your twin outgoing? Spontaneous? Hilarious? Shy? Socially awkward? The more you get to know your fake twin, the more easily you'll be able to convince your friend that your twin exists.;
, Don't pick anything too outlandish, or your story will be harder to believe. Unless you have a completely outlandish name, that is. Make it believable that you came from the same parents. If your name is Sarah, have a twin with another fairly common name, such as Mary or Ashley. But if your name is Persephone, then yeah, it'll be more believable that your twin's name is Calliope.

, Your twin's style can be related to his or her personality. If your twin is adventurous, then he or she will probably wear more fun, casual, and rugged clothing than if your twin was Miss Perfect. Pick clothing that will suit your twin's personality and also make sure that it's not too close to your own fashion sense. Then again, you'll need to be supplying your fake twin with clothes, so you don't pick something too out there unless you feel like furnishing a new wardrobe.


Having your twin wear glasses, or having your twin not wear glasses if you wear them, is a great way to distinguish yourself from your twin.

, If you're really committed to making your fake twin seem real, then you need a reason for why your twin doesn't go to your school or hang out in the same places where you hang out. You can say your twin is at a boarding school or is training at the Bollettieri camp because he or she is a tennis whiz. Or maybe your parents had a bitter divorce and your twin is living with your other parent. Whatever the reason is, you have to have a good one, or your friend will be able to see right through it.


You also have to be quick on your feet. If your friend asks why your twin is never around, you need an instant answer or your prank will be over.
Another thing you can say is that you and your twin, who doesn't go to your school, really don't get along. That could be another reason why your twin is never around.

, If you're really committed to making your twin seem real, then you can doctor a photo that makes it look like you have a twin so you can show it to your friend to make the prank seem more believable. You don't have to force the photo upon your friend, though. You can just leave it as the background on your phone or as the background on your computer and let your friend come across it. Here's what you can do:Use a camera with a self-timer to take a photo of yourself in one location.
Time to get dressed up as your twin! Once you do that, you should sit in a different part of the location, such as on the other side of a couch, and take another photo of yourself.
Edit the photos so that you can cut the part of one photo with you in it right over to the other photo, so there are two versions of you in one photo. Ideally, you'll look like you're sitting right alongside your beloved twin.
Change the opacity of the pictures between 30 and 50% so you can see both pictures in one.
Use the Eraser Tool and choose a soft brush to erase the silhouette of any overlapping parts of the photos that don't make sense. Erase any other overlapping parts that won't make sense.
Change the opacity of the photo back to 100%.
Save it and use it to prank your friend!

, If you really want to go all out, then you can create a Facebook persona for your twin to make it really seem like you have one. You can dress up as your twin and create a Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram account for your twin — heck, even create a blog for him or her, if you really want to go all out with it. Having a social media presence would help make the twin seem real. Your friend would wonder why you would go through the trouble of creating an online persona for someone who doesn't exist.


If your friends are in on it, then they can message the fake twin to make it seem more believable. Just make sure that there are no haters on social media who come on and say, ""Hey, you don't really have a twin.""
The trick is that it'll be a bit suspicious if you have a Facebook account for your twin without having any photos of the two of you together (unless you use the nifty photoshop trick above). However, your twin can be one of those mysterious people who don't have many photos up aside from their actual Facebook photo.
You can slowly friend the friend you are trying to trick on social media, but don't be too obvious about it. You can even casually say, ""So my twin told me you're friends on Facebook now? Nice.""
You can even message your twin back and forth a bit to make it more believable. If you have a cover about your twin being in boarding school or something, then you can say something like, ""I miss you, sis! Can't wait to see you soon.""

, It goes without saying that it'll be a little bit hard to trick someone you've been friends with for years into thinking you have a twin — unless that person is incredibly gullible. If you want to prank your friend, it should be someone who has not been to your house or who has not spent a ton of time with you, or it'll be pretty hard to make your friend believe that you suddenly have a random sibling.


It'll be best if this person has never been over your house, unless you plan on having plenty of photoshopped photos of you and your twin around.
Ideally, this could be a new kid in your school. Though be careful — it's already so hard to be the new kid in town.

, Once you've found your victim, then you have to slowly start bringing up your twin. You don't have to make a big deal about it. Just say something like, ""Sarah was just telling me about this new show..."" and then have the person ask who the heck Sarah is. Don't say something like, ""Sarah, my twin, is awesome,"" or that will make it too obvious. Find a way to bring up your twin in conversation a few times instead of just having your twin pay your friend a visit out of the blue.


It's even better if you have other friends who are in on it who also bring it up casually. The more people making it believable, the better.

, It'll be pretty hard to pull off the twin prank on your own. If you really want it to be convincing, then you should get your friends to also mention the fact that you have a twin, and to even take it a step further. They could interact with your twin on social media, pretend to call your twin in front of your friend, or just talk about how much fun they had at the water park with your twin over the weekend. Don't lay it on too thick — just enough so that the idea of you having a twin begins to be plausible.


Just be very careful with this. You don't want the wrong person to find out about your fake twin plan and then to totally blow your cover.

, When the time is right, you need to plan an exit. Maybe you can say that you can't make it to the movies that night, but that your twin may be able to come. Maybe you're at a party and you say your twin is outside and that you need to go outside to let her in. Maybe you can say that you have a cold or that you're grounded, but that your twin can come out to play. Whatever it is, make it pretty believable without being too dramatic. You'll need to be out of there so that your twin can magically appear, right?


Just tell your friend that you'll be around again soon. You can say something like, ""My twin Sarah's so much more fun than me anyway. You'll barely miss me.""

, Once you disappear, it's time to put on the clothes of your supposed twin, do your hair differently, or just do whatever else you need to do to make your get-up believable. Then, just show up into a situation where your friend and your other friends may be. The other friends can help play it up and say hi to your twin, or just act like it's no big deal if your twin is around. If it's just your friend and the twin, it may be a little harder to make it believable.


Start talking to your friend. Make sure you use a slightly different voice so it's less likely that you're faking it.
Don't spend too much time trying to prank your friend. After the initial surprise, just play it cool. If you try too hard, your friend will be on to your tricks pretty fast.

, Once you've spent enough time hanging out as your twin, you can just say something like, ""Got you good!"" or take off your disguise to show that you've really been faking it the whole time. You can take a photo of the surprised expression on your friend's face or just have your friends joining in on the fun. Make sure your friend doesn't feel like you're being mean but that you were just having a bit of fun.


Once you've pulled off your twin prank, you can feel proud of yourself for a prank well done and enjoy returning to your life as a non-twin!

Though your audience may laugh throughout your joke, the punchline is the part of the joke that draws the biggest laugh. come up with several potential endings to your joke.


Think about what your point of view is. You want to have a unique perspective to your punchline that makes it funny. It will take a while to develop a joke. Spend time thinking about what makes your joke funny in the set up. Your set up is when you make a comment on something you find humorous. Your punchline is when you add your personal twist on the topic.
Take a look at Jerry Seinfeld’s joke about stain removal products: “Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you’ve got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem. Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash.”

The set up is the first two sentences. Jerry explains what is funny about stain removal commercials. Here he takes a specific point of view and focus on one aspect, bloodstains.
The punchline is the last sentence. Jerry ends the joke with a comment on how weird it is that stain removal products use getting bloodstains out of clothes as a selling point.

;
, Grab a notebook and a pen and write your set up at the top of your page. Then write down several punchlines for that joke. Try to have a different angle in each one. Don’t censor yourself right now. Instead of thinking too hard on getting a perfect punchline down, free write the first things that come to you.
Attempt to keep your punchlines related to your set up. Pick out certain words from your set up to include or build on in your punchlines.
Using Jerry’s joke on detergents again, think about what kind of punchlines you might write from the set up. “Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you’ve got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem.”
What could you write to end your joke that calls back to this set up? Maybe you write something like “Maybe your biggest problem is that you’re a serial killer.” Probably not as good as Jerry’s, but that’s why brainstorming and writing out several options helps you. Even though this punchline may not be as funny as the original, it still ties into the set up. It also takes the joke in a different direction than the audience may be expecting. , Writing that perfect punchline requires that your set up serves as a story the listener can follow to your punchline.


After you’ve written down some punchlines, read over each one and make sure that your set up leads to your punchline. Cross off any punchlines that don’t tie back into your set up.
However, if you have a punchline that you really like which does not exactly tie back into your set up, you can rewrite your set up to better serve your punchline. Jokes are fluid and the process for writing great jokes often involves making several edits.

, Though many comedians have developed styles of telling jokes which don’t always follow the strict set up to punchline structure, most jokes are relatively short. Your set up should be only a few sentences, in most cases around one or two. Your punchline should be the same length or shorter. Take a look at a Jimmy Carr joke that is two sentences. The set up is one and the punchline is another. “It shouldn’t be called the “Make A Wish Foundation,” should it? It should really be called the “Make Another Wish—We Can’t Do Anything About THAT Foundation.”

, Once you’ve decided on one punchline to complete your joke, go ahead and write down the whole joke. Look at how long it is and look for places where you can trim the joke down.


Is your set up too long or too short compared to your punchline? Are you including parts of the joke that don’t serve your point of view or make the punchline better?
In Jerry Seinfeld’s joke about laundry detergent, think about how much less funny it would be if he added a part about the other functions of laundry detergent. If he talked about the other kinds of stains detergents remove, or how silly the commercials are as a whole, the joke wouldn’t be as funny. There would be about three more sentences in the set up which had nothing to do with the punchline.
Additionally, make sure your punchline is about one idea. Look at the Jimmy Carr joke again. The punchline is: “It should really be called the “Make Another Wish—We Can’t Do Anything About THAT Foundation.” Here, the punchline touches on one idea that sums up Jimmy’s point of view. He’s not wasting time giving examples of other wishes or explaining how the first wish the kids would have is to not be ill. His punchline is tight enough that we the audience get what he is saying without him having to explain it. The emphasis on the word “THAT” is funny because we automatically know that “THAT” means the kids’ illnesses, without him wasting time explaining it.

, Your punchline can often contain a reinterpretation of what you’ve established in the set up. This is a way to spin your joke or shatter the assumption you have established in your set up.


Say you have a joke about something that’s in the news. Here, your set up is like a headline that you might read in the newspaper on a news site. This is often what SNL’s Weekend update does. The anchors on Weekend Update provide the audience with information which is true in the set up. Then the anchor will deliver a punchline which is funny because it takes a left turn and shatters the audience’s assumptions.
For example, look at a joke from an actual Weekend Update. “David Beckham, the British soccer star, has signed a 250 million dollar deal with the Los Angeles Galaxy Soccer Team...” This is delivered like a news headline and isn’t funny by itself. Your audience is expecting that you will follow up with some joke about David Beckham, or money, or maybe even a British man moving to America.
However, it’s funnier to use your punchline to redirect your audience’s assumptions. Your set up gives you a lot of potential topics to cover. The audience may expect you to go on a tangent about David Beckham. But here, in the actual joke, the punchline takes a bit of a turn: “...which apparently… exists.”
Here, the punchline breaks any assumption the audience may have had about what such a deal means. Instead, it makes a comment on how no one in the U.S. knows or cares about one of the world’s most popular sports.
Use the 5 W’s to help you find your punchline. Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. By answering these questions, you will have material to build on and which can help you find an angle your audience may not expect. In this David Beckham joke, trying to answer why he made the deal can lead you to your punchline as your own sense of humor makes you ask why anyone cares about this topic in the first place. Answering the “Who” also helps because whether you like soccer or not, David Beckham is a world famous athlete.

, Knowing who your audience is will help you write punchlines that land better. You want to have a punchline that your audience can relate to and will find funny.


This means that you may have to watch your language if you’re going to perform your jokes in a certain setting or for a certain age group of people.
Don’t write a punchline that you know your audience won’t understand.
Knowing your audience will also help you to tailor your jokes and punchlines better. This might also make it easier to find a funny punchline. If you’re performing jokes for people in a certain profession, having jokes and punchlines that pertain to that profession will be funnier because those jokes are more relatable.

, While your punchline doesn’t always have to end on the funniest word, it’s good to get in the habit of trying to do so. The punchline, is after all, a punch. It should be quick and snappy and end on the funniest note.


Find the punch word. In each punchline, you will have one word which connects to the idea of your joke and is the funniest part. You want that word to be as far back in your joke as possible.
Here’s an example from a joke by Mike Birbiglia. “My family is Italian, but we’re not real Italian. We’re more like Olive Garden Italian.” The funniest part of the joke is “Olive Garden Italian”. It’s placed at the very end of the joke because it’s the funniest part and since there’s nothing after it, it gives the audience time to react and laugh.
If you continue after the button, you don’t give your audience time to enjoy the joke.
Go through your punchline and find the button. If it’s not at the back of your joke, see how you can rearrange the structure of your punchline to end on the button.

, Read your joke out loud. Find the cadence of it. Part of what makes your jokes, and your punchlines funny will be how you deliver the joke in your own unique voice.


See how it feels to read the joke out loud. Check for any parts that seem awkward or drag on too long. Look for any more places that you can trim.
Read your joke to your friend and notice where he laughs and if the joke lands. Ask your friend for his opinion on it and see where you can make changes.

, A topper is an extension to your joke which serves as a second punchline or a funny way to transition to another joke, or add on to your current joke. Your topper is basically your next joke which feeds off of your previous one. You will see this a lot in sets that stand-up comics perform.
The topper is meant to help you slowly and naturally move onto a new topic while continuing to get laughs.
It’s sometimes written to seem like you like you just came up with it on the spot while performing.

, Sometimes, a topper can be used to connect your jokes in the form of tags or one liners.


Connect the jokes you have written down by adding another punchline.
In another Mike Birbiglia set, he talks about kids in middle school starting to make out. He ends the joke by saying “I’m not doing that. And all the girls were like 'that is fine. You’re not on the list.'”
Here, the first punchline is “...all the girls were like 'that is fine.'” This punchline ends the first joke and draws a laugh.
The topper, or second punchline “You’re not on the list.” Continues the joke, draws a bigger laugh, and lets Mike transition into talking about social cliques in schools based on who is on, or not on “the list”.

, Sometimes your joke won’t land. If that happens, you can write a topper as a backup punchline.


Say you have a joke where your punchline doesn’t hit. You have a very simple joke like “A priest, a minister and a rabbi walk into a bar and the bartender says: What is this, some kind of a joke?” You deliver this simple joke and no one finds the punchline funny. You can have a topper in your back pocket to play that continues the joke.
It can be as simple as “The priest, the minister, and the rabbi look at each other and then the priest says, ""What, are you some kind of comedian? Is that why you need a second job as a bartender?”
You can even go further and put yourself in the joke. Oftentimes, what’s funny is when people are capable of self-depreciating humor. Since this topper isn’t all that funny, you can use this opportunity to make fun of yourself. Add a second topper like “For religious figures, those guys did not tip me well. I had to pick up an extra shift to pay rent.”
By making fun of yourself and putting yourself in the joke as the broke bartender/comedian, you might create a bit of sympathy from the audience and draw in a laugh.

What’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old-uncle laugh (then again, maybe not).


Everyone’s an individual, so there are no hard and fast rules. But, unless you personally know the members of your audience, here are some good rules of thumb to follow: elderly people won’t like crude jokes; stay away from misogynist jokes if you’ve got an audience full of women; people of a specific ethnic or racial group won’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group; and jokes requiring specialized knowledge (of, for example, science or old movies) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge.
The more you know about your audience the better you’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them.;
, You can find fodder lots of places—from your life, joke files online, by repurposing jokes you’ve heard in the past, and so on.


You may want to start your own joke file. You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer.The latter option may allow for easier revision.

, Every joke has a “target,” which is what the joke is about. It’s important that the joke’s target (the most basic element of your material) be suited to your audience. Make sure it’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they’re likely willing to laugh at.For example, husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa; students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous.

, The opening of the joke—or setup—should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it, but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge.Think of the setup as the foundation of a story. It’s a fundamental part of the joke; if you don’t lay a good foundation here, then the punchline won’t make sense to the audience or they won’t find it humorous.
Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny—it’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny.The exaggeration can be slight or considerable—it just depends on the individual joke.

, The ending of the joke is obviously crucial. This is where the payoff comes in, what makes the joke succeed or fail. If you want to make the audience laugh, your punchline needs to be surprising.


Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper, which is an additional punchline. The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way.

, Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told. For your joke to be funny, it has to surprise the audience in some way, which means it has to seem original or new.


One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending.Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life. This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable. It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s)., Practicing your joke is crucial. You don’t need to have it completely memorized—in fact, you ‘‘shouldn’t’’ memorize it—but you need to be really comfortable with it, so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked, which is very possible once you’re in front of an audience.


Memorized jokes sound wooden, like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer.
Good jokes have a lot of details and personality, so don’t be afraid to embellish.Try different things out and see what feels right, what sounds best. Don’t use a joke until you’re completely comfortable with it.
Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself. If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s, your joke isn’t ready and you need to practice more.You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you’re ready for a “real” audience.

, A joke’s rhythm is a function of its wording and timing.A good joke should be short but not too short.In other words, you want to get the audience’s attention and get them invested, but you don’t want to carry on so long that you lose them.


Unless you’re telling a one-liner or a three-liner, consider aiming for about a minute per joke, though you may be able to go a little longer depending on the audience and your delivery skills. If you’re carrying on for ten minutes with a single joke, you’ve definitely lost your audience.

, If you’re uptight and uncertain, the audience will feel that way about you. Instead, be calm, happy, and confident that you’re going to be a riot act—this makes your listeners much more likely to find you funny., It’s boring to listen to a monotone—use different inflections that suit the specific joke you’re telling.If it works for the joke, use different voices for different characters and/or sound effects (a car horn, a siren, a door creaking, etc.). These will liven up the joke, making it more like a story. That said, don’t use an accent unless you’ve mastered it, or you’ll do more harm than good for your joke., Waiting an extra second or two before revealing the “ah-ha” moment of the joke creates suspense in the audience.This should get you a bigger laugh when you do reveal the punchline.


Some people suggest following the Rule of Threes, which states that a joke’s punchline should come in the third line of the joke.This is limiting, however, as it only applies if you’re telling a three-line joke, as opposed to a one-liner or a longer joke.

, Smiling says you’re confident and sure of your joke, but laughing may says you’re trying too hard.


While the biggest comedians out there (think: Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld) can get away with laughing at their own jokes, it’s generally not a good idea to laugh at yours unless you know how your audience will react. Doing so may make you seem like you’re over-compensating for material that’s not actually very funny or like you’re cocky.

Practice telling the story in the mirror.,
Add tags to the story.,
Introduce the story.,
Be brief.,
Be confident.,
Remember to use your hands and face.,
Make eye contact.,
Try to end on the biggest laugh.,
Move on if your audience doesn't laugh.",How to Tell a Funny Story," The set up establishes the premise of the story by providing your audience with the necessary background information and details.Your set up should be as tight and to the point as possible. It should focus on one theme or idea, as you want the story to be brief, but entertaining and easy to understand.;
, The punchline or laugh line is the heart of the story. It should lead the audience in one direction and then surprise them by suddenly escalating into a more interesting climax or going off into a completely different direction than was suggested by the set up.A twist in the story, or element of surprise, usually makes for a good punchline.
Determining your punchline will help you pair down any extra details and tailor the set up so it works up to a big laugh.

, Read your first draft of the story out loud to determine which points are funny and which points in the set up could be tightened or edited out.


Remove any extraneous words and only use adjectives when necessary.
If you do use adjectives, make them interesting and attention grabbing; don’t use “big” when you could use “hulking” “gigantic” or “astronomical”., Watch your body language as you tell the story. You should be relaxed, friendly, and appear confident.If you are telling a story with different characters, alter and vary your voice to match a character as they talk. Avoid being monotone or mumbling in a low voice.
Try to tell the story like you are telling it to a good friend. Don’t be too formal or stiff. It’s important to appear like you believe in the story you are telling. Make it your own and make it believable to your listener.
Pause before the punchline to signal to the listener that they should pay attention. This will ensure they hear the punchline and hopefully, be ready for a big laugh., Once you have practiced the story a few times, you may start to get comfortable with the material and start to add tags, or additional punchlines.Your tags may build on the original punchline, or they may twist the punchline further into a new, funnier direction.
Tags will help you capitalize on the momentum of the original punchline and extend the laugh or create an even bigger laugh so don’t be afraid to use them.

, If you are trying to introduce it into an existing conversation among friends, use a short introductory phrase to begin the story, such as: “You know, that reminds me of a story…” or “It’s funny you should mention that, just the other day, I was…”

, It’s important to get the first laugh as quickly as possible, ideally in the first 30 seconds. Don’t worry about setting up an elaborate, detailed scene or mentioning what happened the night before, unless it’s full of funny details that get to the point.If you can’t tell the story in less than thirty seconds, make sure the first thirty seconds and compelling and entertaining.

, Don't trail off, don't look away from people and don't stutter. Try to relax and tell the story in a casual tone, like you’re telling it to a good friend.


Because you have practiced the story beforehand and gotten used to telling the material well, it should be easy to act like a confident storyteller.

, Well-timed hand movements and facial expressions can really liven up the details of the story and keep your listener engaged.


Don’t forget to also vary your voice and pause before the punchline. As in all comedy, timing is very important and will contribute to a good telling.

, Don’t be afraid to look your audience in the eye as you delve into the details of the story.


Eye contact also indicates you are confident and comfortable in front of your audience.

, Most listeners will only remember the last part or punchline of a story. If the ending is flat, it will likely ruin the funnier details in the set up. Remember not to laugh yourself.Ideally, you want to leave the audience laughing and wanting more.

, Desperation, no matter how smoothly it’s presented, is never funny.If your story doesn’t get the big laugh you were hoping for, shrug it off.


Wrap up the story with a smile and say something like: “Well, I guess you had to be there"" or ""I guess it really can't be translated from the original German"".
Don’t focus on the story if it doesn’t go over as well as you had hoped. The best way to recover is to laugh at yourself (even if no one else did) and move on to another topic or subject.

Get a napkin or cut a square out of a plastic bag.,
Cover each corner with a piece of tape.,
Punch a hole into each corner with a hole puncher.,
Cut four pieces of string.,
Thread and tie the strings through the holes.,
Thread the strings through a button.,
Toss the parachute.",How to Make a Toy Parachute1," If you are going to use a napkin, choose a large, dinner-sized one. A paper towel could also work., Flip the napkin over, and cover the back of each corner as well. This will make the corners nice and strong for the next step., Make sure that you are only punching through the taped area, otherwise the napkin will rip.








If you don't have a hole puncher, cut a small slit into each corner instead.

, Each piece needs to be the same length as your square. For example, if your square was 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side, then your strings should be 8 inches (20 centimeters) long., Take your first string and poke the end up through a hole. Bring the end down, and tie it to the rest of the string. Do this for the other strings and corners.







, Find a button that has four holes in it. Feed the other end of each string through each hole. Tie the strings together into one big knot under the button.You can also tie the strings to a paperclip, a charm, or a small washer.
If you have a small toy, like a Lego or plastic soldier, tie two strings together on each side to make loops., Hold the parachute by the button, then toss it upwards. If you are allowed to, climb up onto a table or chair, and try again! This will give the parachute even more time to float down!

If you made loops for a small toy, slip the loops under the toy's arms first.

Cut a large square out of a plastic bag.,
Tie a knot into each corner of the square.,
Cut two long pieces of string.,
Tie the end of each string to each corner of the square.,

Toss the parachute.",How to Make a Toy Parachute2," Make the square at least 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side.This parachute will only work on small toys, about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) tall. Great toys include toy soldiers and Lego men. It won't work on dolls and bears.

, This will help keep the strings on. Set the square aside when you are done., Each piece of string needs to be twice the length of you square. For example, if your square was 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side, then the strings should be 16 inches (40 centimeters) long.You can use yarn, fishing line, embroidery floss, or even thread!

, Take your first string, and tie each end to a corner on the top of the square. Take your second string, and tie each end to the corners on the bottom.Make sure that you are tying the strings behind the knots so that they don't slide off.

, Find a small, plastic figure, like a toy soldier or Lego man. Slip the left loop under the left arm, and the right loop under the right arm. If the strings won't stay on, stick a piece of tape over them.

The toy should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) tall. If it's too big or heavy, the parachute won't work.

, Hold the parachute by the toy, toss it upwards, and watch it float down! If you are allowed to, get onto a chair or staircase, and try again. This will give the parachute more time to fall down."

Tape together the cut corners along the bottom point.,
Flip the tablecloth over and fold the pieces of tape onto the back.,
Cut two long pieces of string, and make a mark at each end.,
Tape the end of your first string to one of the taped corners.,
Tape the end of the string down.,
Tape the other end of the string to the next corner.,
Tie a knot into the middle of each loop.,
Slip the mini loops over the arms of an action figure.",How to Make a Toy Parachute3," Make sure it is the thin kind; the kind that have the felt coating on the back will be too thick for this project. If you can't find any cheap, plastic tablecloths, use a large trash bag instead.This parachute will work on action figures that are 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 centimeters) tall, like Star Wars action figures., Fold the square in half to make a rectangle, then fold it in half again to make a square. Draw a 5-inch (13-centimeter) square on the corner where all four corners are loose (not joined). Cut the square out, going through all four layers, then unfold the square. You will have something that looks like a plus sign., Go to the first corner you cut the 5-inch (13-centimeter) square from. Push the edges together to close the square. Place a 2-inch (5-centimeter) piece of tape halfway over the bottom edge. Leave the bottom half of the tape hanging over the edge of the tablecloth.Do this for the remaining three corners.

, Flip the tablecloth cove. You should still see the pieces of tape sticking out from underneath it. Fold each piece of tape over the edge of the table cloth. Now the corners are taped on both sides.You will have something that looks like a bag or basket with a slit in each corner. Do not tape these slits up!

, Find some thin cording, such as crochet string, thin yarn, or kite string. Cut two 30-inch (76-centimeter) pieces. Use a marker to make a dot on each string, 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from each end.You will need two dots on each string, one fo each end. These will be your guides for the next step.

, Take your first string, and place the end over one of the corners you taped up. Align the mark with the edge of the tablecloth, then place a strip of tape over it. You will have about ½ inch (1 centimeter) of string peeking out over the top of the tape.Keep the tape horizontal; don't let it hang over the edge of the parachute.

, Fold the loose end of the string over the tape, towards the edge of the tablecloth. Place another piece of tape over it to secure it., Use the same technique as before. When you are done, tape the other string in the same way. When you are done, you'll have two loops hanging from your parachute., Hook your finger through the first loop and tug it away from the parachute to find the middle. Tie a knot in the loop right above your finger. The loop should have equal amounts of string on both sides of the knot.Repeat this step for the other loop.
Leave some space between the knot and the middle of the string. You want to be able to feed elastic through it.

, If the loops are too small, you can link mini rubber bands together to make a harness for the figure. You can also lay a strip of tape across the figure and the string to hold everything together."

Cut an octagonal shape from a polythene bag.,
Make a small hole at each corner of the octagon.,
Tie a 10 inch (25 cm) piece of string through each hole.,
Tie the long ends of the string to a paper clip.,
Find a toy that will use the parachute.,
Attach the toy to the paper clip.,
Cut a hole that is .4 x .4 inches (1 cm x 1 cm) in the middle of the parachute.,
Use your parachute.",How to Make a Parachute1," Any ordinary grocery bag will do. An octagon has eight sides of equal length and resembles a ""Stop"" sign. Take a ruler to measure that each side has a length of about 4 inches (10 cm).






;
, You should make eight holes in all. Find a sharp object such as the end of a metal paintbrush or a very thin pair of scissors and punch a hole about .5 inches (1.2 cm) away from each corner. Touch the sharp object to the polythene and then gently push it through, being careful not to tear the bag.








, Just run the string through the hole and tie it in two sturdy knots outside the hole to keep it firmly in place. A thin piece of string will work best because the thicker the string, the more it will weigh down the parachute. The parachute should be as aerodynamic as possible.









Choose a string with a color that contrasts the shape of the parachute, such as brown.

, Tie each of the eight strings to the same part of a paperclip, creating one thick knot. Use a thinner paper clip so you don't weigh down the parachute too much.








, You can use a toy soldier, make a person out of modeling clay, or use any small figurine that would use the parachute -- it doesn't have to be a person. Animals like using parachutes just as much as people.

, Latch the paper clip around the toy, whether it's around its neck, waist, or one of its legs. If you can't find a good point to attach the paper clip to the toy, you should use another toy. Once you attach the toy to the paper clip, the toy will be connected to the parachute and will be ready to use it.








, This hole will be used to stabilize the parachute. As your parachute falls, this hole will direct the airflow and will prevent the air from trying to escape around the edges.








, Hold the polythene part of the parachute as high as it will go. You can even climb onto a chair for extra height. Then, throw it up slightly and watch the parachute fall to the ground. For extra cushion for your toy, you can throw it over a thick carpet or a field of grass.

Tie this piece of yarn around a toy.,
Use your new parachute.",How to Make a Parachute2," A napkin on the thicker side will be best so it won't tear. But if it's too thick, the parachute won't be as aerodynamic.

, Use yarn of medium thickness for the best results.








, Just pinch the ends of the napkin and tie the yarn around them. This method of attachment works better than poking holes in the napkin, because this will make the napkin more likely to tear.








, Tie them together at their ends, creating one thick knot.








, Tie this piece to the knot that holds the other four threads together. This piece will attach to the toy that will use the parachute.








, Find any toy suitable for parachute use and tie the hanging string around it. Once you've firmly attached the string to the toy, tie the free end to the knot that holds the threads together to attach the toy to the parachute. It should tie around the middle of the toy for balance.








, To see your parachute in action, just place your hand inside its center, throw the parachute in the air, and let it go. Watch the parachute and your toy float down safely.

Mark out areas where you might put cages, enclosures, a veterinary clinic, cafe for visitors and have an entrance area as well. As part of the planning, make sure to get the scale accurate; for example, you don't want to keep a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a garden - it would need a wide plains area to expend its energy.

, Make these from cardboard, wire, paper, odds and ends around the house etc. Use your imagination to create a wide range of 3D elements that sit on the board. You might also need to add fences - simple ones can be used and you can pretend that they are large enough to keep in the dinosaurs.

,, Plastic dinosaur toys and models can be purchased from many places, from dollar stores, toy stores, supermarket toy areas, hobby stores etc. Wooden ones can also be purchased from dollar and hobby stores; these you can assemble yourself and paint in colors as wished.

",How to Build a Plastic Parachute,"






;
, Anything from a plastic slip-cover to a garbage can bag can work well. Make sure it's loose and flexible.








, Make it as even as possible so you don't end up with a lop-sided parachute.









You can use a large bowl or dish to trace your circle. Or if you're really confident, you can even draw a circle freehand!

, Twine or any moderately heavy string should work. Try to scale it to about the same length as the diameter of your parachute.








, A sharp pair of scissors can help a lot here, otherwise you may stretch and/or tear the plastic. Tearing however is not suggested for it can be very messy.









Try taking open scissors and dragging one blade pressing firmly along the circle. Often this leads to a perfect or near perfect cut.

,,, A minimum of four holes should be enough. Be careful not to rip the holes—you will be using them to tie your string to the plastic.





,, Again, be careful not to tear the holes while knotting, if you are using soft plastic. Avoid getting the string tangled, as well.








, You'll want something moderately heavy. Any object that weighs about 5-10 grams will work.








, You will want to have some height to enjoy the parachute, but be reasonable. After all, you'll need to go back and get it.








, Don't be alarmed if it doesn't open when you drop it at ground level. Even parachutes need time to get air beneath them.

Get some hard board, wood or even cardboard, about 24 inches by 17 inches(61cm by 43cm) if you are using a Schleich horse, fairly bigger if using a Breyer, also consider the amount of horses you have and adjust the size to fit your requirement, although this will hold about 4 Schleich figurines comfortably.,
Next, you need some long pieces of wood preferably quite thin and in small strips.,
If not making a gateway, ignore this step and go straight below.,
With wood glue, glue the pieces of wood to the side of your paddock.,
Now collect some AstroTurf ,fake grass, and use that as your horse's grass, this can be found on websites such as amazon.,
Finally, watch your horse enjoy his/her new home!",How to Build a Toy Paddock,";
, If necessary saw it to the height you would like the fence to be, I suggest just below the head. Measure these so that they fit each side of the wood, two longer for the longer sides and two for the shorter ones. Also, make sure these are not too thick so they do not invade the space. If desired, a 4 inch (10cm) piece of wood can be cut out of the smaller side to make a gateway. Leave the 10 cm piece of wood to one side.

, With your 10cm piece of wood, use hinges and screw them onto the smaller side BEFORE gluing down. Once this has been done, screw it onto the gate, making sure they are secure. If hinges are not available, use a toy fence or makeshift one instead, perhaps out of pipe cleaners or lollipop sticks.

, These will make the fencing around the paddock. Wait to dry using the manufacturers instructions, and make sure they are secure;if not restart the step until they are. If it is warm out side and is not due to rain, leave outside in a secure area where no animals can get to, to dry for the night. Or in a warm airing cupboard!

, If this is not available, try using a green piece of paper or wool cut up instead. Stick the grass down to the hard board and wait for the glue to dry. (This is optional, you do not have to glue it to the board for different scenes, Replace the grass with sand for a dressage ring or wood shavings. You could even use stones and pebbles!)

, Make small jumps out of wood or cardboard for a more realistic effect. Maybe use a small doll or rider to ride your horse. From most good toy shops, tree's and shelters may be available, for that extra touch. You can also find rocks and pebbles in the garden, They make great walls, jumps and scenery!

Cut a flexible straw into 8 equal parts lengthwise, as shown in the image.,
Fold over the the other end of the straw (the uncut portion) slightly and hold in place with pliers.,
Stick double-sided tape on each of 8 cut ends of the straw.,
Find a plastic bag and smooth it out to remove wrinkles.,
Attach each of the eight cut straw pieces with double-sided tape.,
Weight and stopper the open portion of the straw.,
Decorate the parachute if wished.,
Play with your newly made parachute.",How to Make a Parachute With a Plastic Bag and a Straw,"

Only cut down to the concertina flex part of the straw and not beyond.




;
, Seal this end together using a flame:

Hold the end in place with the pliers.





With care, use the naked flame to heat seal together.






,

Bend over the end, with the double-sided tape intact.






,

Cut off the handles and the base, as shown in the image.





Cut out a rough square shape as shown in the image. The square should measure about 35 centimeter (13.8 in) x 35 centimeter (13.8 in) / 13.7"" x 13.7"".





Fold like origami. Fold in half, then a quarter, then an eighth, and then a sixteenth (1/2>1/4>1/8>1/16).





Once folded, cut the folded piece a length of 15 centimeter (5.9 in) / 5.9"" radius. Cut off this excess, so it'll form an isosceles triangle.





Unfold the circle. You'll see that the fold lines remain clearly, indicating suitable positioning of the parachute strings to ensure even balance.






, Stick the sticky side alongside one fold line.

Continue working your way around the entire parachute using even positioning, as shown in the image. It's helpful to click and enlarge this image to follow it more easily.





The appearance at this stage.











, Where the cut lengths of the parachute meet the concertina flex of the straw, there remains an open hole. In order to weight the parachute for smooth floating, you'll need to fill this with some small beads.

Carefully funnel the small beads into the hole.





Seal the beads in by corking it with tissue pieces. Make sure it is firm so that the beads don't come tumbling out.






, While this step isn't necessary, it's also fun and it personalizes the parachute. A great activity for kids during the holidays or on rainy weekends!
, Throw it into the air on an angle. It should go up like an umbrella. Release and watch it drop.

Add the face and other details.",How to Make a Minion from Despicable Me1," This minion uses a toilet paper roll as a base. It is simple and easy to make, and perfect for anyone who loves to work with glue and paint. Here's what you will need:


Toilet paper roll
Blue and yellow paint
Black and yellow paper
Black marker
1 – 2 large googly eyes
Glue
Paintbrushes
Newspaper
Masking tape or paper tape
Black yarn or pipe cleaners;
, This will make your minion nice and solid. If you cannot find a toilet paper roll, try cutting a paper towel roll in half, or into thirds.

, This will make the domed shape of the minion's head., This will cover the top of the head and make it smooth. Keep covering it with tape from different angles until you can't see the newspaper anymore.Make sure that you are using masking tape or paper tape, or the paint won't stick to it. Regular scotch tape is too smooth.

, The yellow part will be the body of the minion and the blue part will be the overalls.

, Use a thin brush to paint two ""n"" shapes across from each other, right above the blue part of the tube. This will make the straps.

, Start by placing the minion down on a sheet of black paper. Trace around the minion using a pencil. Take the minion off the paper and draw an ""m"" right above the circle. Make sure that the bottom of the ""m"" is touching the top of the circle. Also, make sure that the ""m"" is the same width as the circle. The arches from the ""m"" will make the shoes. Cut the circle out; be sure to include the ""m"" shape.


Glue the minion down onto the feet. Use school glue or tacky glue to line the bottom rim of the toilet paper roll. Place a few drops of glue onto the newspaper inside the minion as well. Press the minion down onto the feet. The arches from the ""m"" should be sticking out from under the minion, like shoes.

, If you want, you can paint or color the hands black to look like gloves. Minion arms are shaped like long, skinny rectangles; they have three loops at one end, sort of like a three-leaf clover.

, Fold the bottom of each arm by 1 centimeter. Put a drop of glue onto the folded part, and press it against the minion, just below the shoulder strap.

, Glue one or two large googly eyes down for the eyes. Use a marker to draw around each eye. This will make the frame of the goggles. Next, use a marker to draw a line going around the entire head, from one side of the goggles to the other. This will be the strap.


If your minion has two eyes, make sure that the googly eyes are touching each other.Minion eyes are very close together.

, Cut some yarn, and glue it onto the top of the head. If you want your minion to have spiked hair, cut a pipe cleaner into 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) pieces, and poke them onto the top of the minion's head. If they don't go in too easily, make the hole first using a toothpick.

, Use a black marker to draw the mouth. You can also use it to draw the buttons and pocket on the overalls. In the movie, the minions had a letter ""G"" on the front pocket of the overalls. You can use that, or use the first letter of your name to make the minion your personal minion."

Color in the mouth, gloves, and shoes with a black fabric marker.",How to Make a Minion from Despicable Me2," This minion requires a bit of sewing, but it is cute and squishy once finished. Here's a list of what you will need:


Banana-yellow sock
Blue sock
Teddy bear stuffing
Needle and thread
Scissors
Googly eyes
Yarn
Black buttons
Black and grey felt
Black yarn
Fabric glue

, You need a bright yellow sock, the color of a banana. You will also need a blue sock.

, You will be using the toe/foot part to make the minion's body. Save the top part for later; you will need that to make the arms.

, Make the running stitch about 1 centimeter away from the cut hem. Gently pull on the thread to close the sock and tuck the raw edges inside. If the stuffing starts to come out, poke it back in with your finger. Tie the thread off in a knot and cut it., How long you make it will depend on how large you want the overalls to be. Most minions' overalls stop about half-way up their body.

, Measure down 1 centimeter from the top part of the sock. Cut a small half circle along the folded part. Repeat this for the other side. This will make the arm holes/shoulder straps of the overalls.

, Draw a thin line of glue along the top, inside edge of the overalls, as well as around each arm hole. Tug the overalls on, and press the top edge of the blue sock down onto the minion's body. If the edges of the overalls keep popping up, pin them down with some sewing pins. You can remove the pins once the glue dries.


Draw and cut out the arms. Start by drawing two minion arm shapes on the top part of the yellow sock and cut them out; be sure to cut through both layers of the sock so that you end up with four pieces.

, Pin the right sides together of each arm. Sew around the edges; try to keep the seam allowance as small as possible. Be sure to leave the narrow bottom part of the arm open. Turn each piece inside out, and fill it with teddy bear stuffing.


A minion arm is shaped like a skinny rectangle. The hand is shaped like 3 loops, sort of like a 3-leaf clover.

, Cut two L shapes out of the top part of the blue sock. The back/straight part of each L should be on the fold of the sock. You will end up with two pieces.


Sew the feet and stuff them. Pin wrong sides together of each L shape. You should end up with two Ls, but that have the fuzzy side of the sock showing. Sew around each L shape. Try to keep the seam-allowance as small as possible. Leave the top part of each foot/L shape open. Turn each L shape inside out and fill it with stuffing.

, The arms will go onto the minion's body, just beneath the shoulder straps. You can make them stick straight out, like a T, or you can have them hanging down by the minion's sides. The feet will go onto the bottom of the minion. The toes should be pointing towards you. Try to use the ladder-stitch while doing this to make it as seem-less as possible.

, Use fabric glue to attach a small, black button to the front of each shoulder strap. Cut a square from the left-over blue sock, and glue it down onto the front of the overalls to make the pocket. Use a fabric marker to draw the stitching, pockets, and the initial.


In the movies, the minions had a letter ""G"" on the front of their pockets. You can draw a ""G"" too, or you can make it your own minion and draw the first letter of your name instead.

, Cut two circles out of grey felt that are a little bit larger than the googly eyes you are using. Use Put a drop of fabric glue onto the back of each eye, then press each eye down onto the grey felt circles. Then, use fabric glue to attach the felt circles to the minion. If your minion has two eyes, make sure that the felt circles are touching.

, Place a thin line of fabric glue all around the head, going from one side of the goggles to the next. Press the felt down onto the glue.

, You can cut the yarn however long you want it. If you want your minion to have spiky hair, tie knots at the end of the yarn pieces, and glue the bottom of the knot to the top of the head.

, Minions make many silly faces, so you can draw the mouth however you want. When you are done making the face, use the marker to color in the hands; this will be the minion's gloves. Then, use the marker to color in the bottom part of the feet. This will be the shoes.


Remember, minions don't have noses or eyebrows.

You can use other options like any egg shape toy or snack packaging. Simply paint it yellow and glue them together.


Glue the egg shut. Open the egg and place a thin line of super glue along the inside rim. Close the egg and wait for the glue to dry. This will help keep your Minion together longer.

, This will make the arm holes.,, Do this by folding 1 centimeter of each pipe cleaner arm inside the egg. Place a large drop of hot glue over each fold.

, This will be the uniform. If you want, you can also paint n's right above the seam line to make the straps.

, In the movie, the Minions also had a letter ""G"" on the front pocket. You can also make this your personal minion instead, and draw your first initial instead.

, You can use any color of clay, and color it black later, of you can use black clay.


Once you make the gloves, stick them onto the arms before they dry.

, You can use black paint or a marker. Let the paint dry before moving on.

, Cut some black yarn into short pieces, and attach it to the top of the minions head using some glue.

, Place the glue onto the egg first, then press the eye down onto it.

, The gloves should already be on the arms, but you might want to put some glue around the cuff of each glove so that it won't fall off. To attach the shoes, place a large drop of glue on to the of each shoe, and press it against the bottom of the minion.

, Minions make lots of silly, random faces, so you can draw whatever you want for the face. To draw the goggle strap, simply draw a thin line going all the way around the head, from one side of the goggle to the other.

Unfold your napkin and decorate your parachute with felt tip markers.,
Cut 4 even pieces of string.,
Attach 1 string to each corner.,
Tie the strings together and attach a weighted object.,
Drop your paper parachute.,
Observe the speed of your parachute.",How to Make a Paper Parachute1," Carefully unfold your dinner napkin and lay it on a flat surface.


If you would like to decorate your parachute sail, place the napkin on top of a piece of newspaper, cardboard, or scrap paper. Use felt tip markers to draw on your sail.;
, Unwind the string and cut off a strand that is approximately 1 foot (0.30 m) long. Unwind the string. Lay the cut strand next to the unwound string as though it were a ruler. Cut the second strand the same length as the first. Cut 2 more strands in the same manner.You could also use a 12 inch ruler.

, Gather and twist the napkin’s top left corner ½ inch from the edge. Tie 1 string tightly around the gathered corner—create the knot near the top of the strand. Repeat this process on every corner, making sure to tie all of the strings at approximately the same spot.


This will result in long tails that are the same length., Gather all four strings together 2 to 3 inches above the bottom and tie the strings in a knot. Select an object to add weight to the parachute, such as a rock, an action figure, or paperclips. Use the 2 to 3 inch (5.1 to 7.6 cm) tails to secure the object to the parachute., Now that you have created your paper parachute, it is ready for action. Decide where you will drop your parachute from—this may be over the banister of your stairs, from a play structure, or even from the top bunk of a bunk bed. You may even simply throw it up into the air. Once you have reached the top of your launch zone, release the parachute and watch it glide to the ground., Note the rate at which your parachute is falling? Is your parachute falling quickly to the ground or gliding slowing to the ground?If it is moving towards the ground at a rapid pace, the weight it too heavy or the parachute sail is too small. Try attaching a lighter object to your parachute, such as a feather or paperclips, or create a larger sail.
If your parachute is moving too slowly towards the ground, the weight is too light or the the parachute sail is too big. To change the speed, attach a heavier item to your parachute, like a rock, or create a smaller parachute sail.Feel free to experiment with different weights and sail sizes.

Know how to care for a Breyer horse.,
Build a barn.,
Lay down thick sawdust or shredded paper or straw on the floor of your horse's stall if it's okay with your guardian.,
Pretend that your Breyer horse is a real horse for the purposes of playing with it.,
Feed your Breyer horse two times a day.,
Groom your Breyer horse daily or at least every other day.,
Keep the horse warm.,
Keep the horse insect-free.,
Get a rider for the horse.,
Keep the mares and stallions apart.,
Play lots with your Breyer horses.",How to Play with Your Breyer Horse," After purchase, and during play, good care of the horse will ensure that it lasts a long time. Read How to care for a Breyer horse to begin with.

, Think ahead and, if you are planning to own two or more Breyer Horses, build a three-stall barn. If you are planning to own just one Breyer, then build a two stall barn. It's always nice to have a spare stall just in case an emergency comes up.


If possible, build the barn with a loft that is strong enough to hold a lot of hay and supplies, such as a wheelbarrow, some buckets, of course, hay. Maybe even some tack.;
, This bedding will give your horse a comfy yet clean space to lay down on during the night.


Clean your horse's stall daily. You won't need to clean out all the straw or bedding out daily, but you must pick up your horse's manure and take care of urine spots in his stall to make sure he is comfortable and won't get sick.

, Pretend when you're not looking your horse comes out from its pose, either if it's running, jumping, standing there, or laying down. Pretend it can move its legs and needs real care. Once you're okay with this, the remaining steps are all about playing with the horse as if it were for real.

, Depending on the size, age, and life of your Breyer, you will need to feed your horse a grain at least once a day.


Make pretend grains for the horse. It could be barley, oats, corn, or a mix. You could also use a pellet feed.
Make sure your Breyer has hay when eating its grain. It helps the horse to digest its food better.
Provide a toy bucket. Always make sure your horse has access to water. In the cold winter months, pretend to use heated water buckets for your Breyer horse so the water does not freeze.

, Start with a curry comb, then go on with the bristle brush, then use a face brush on his face, then pick out its hooves, and if necessary, put on a pretend ""Hooflex"", a liquid that helps your horses hooves look nicer and make them stronger. It's almost like a jacket and blanket for your horse's hooves.


Only use small toy accessory brushes and do not scrape along or dig into the horse when grooming or you will likely leave marks on the plastic.
If it is very hot or your horse got done riding you may need to cool it off by spraying the horse gently with a (fake) hose. Make sure your horse is tied or you have someone holding its lead while you wash him.

, In the winter, when it snows, you will need to blanket your horse so he won't get cold.


Blanket all your horses if it is 35 degrees or colder. Doing so will keep your horses warm and from getting a cold.
If you have a traditional Breyer horse, you will need a large size blanket made from scrap fabric or a handkerchief. If you have a classic, you will need a medium size blanket made from the same items. If you have a small horse like a stablemate, make a smaller blanket.
You can use felt to make your horse a warm cozy winter blanket.
Check that the blanket won't fall off or be a source of tripping the horse.

, In the summer, your horse will need fly spray and a fly mask when going out in the pasture to keep the irritating flies away from your horse.


Try buying a fly mask from a Breyer store because homemade ones usually don't end up as planned. You are welcome to make your own fly mask but remember, a fly mask doesn't have eye holes and is made of a netting, not of felt or cloth. Make sure your horse can see through the fly mask without having eye holes. Make sure the fly masks fits well and doesn't poke your horse's eyes.

, If you have a (doll) rider for your Breyer, that's great. If you do have a rider, make sure you have a bridle that fits your Breyer. The doll can't ride without a bridle. Have the rider to ride the horse for at least 20 minutes a day. If not, you can still make sure your horse gets enough exercise. Maybe try longing your Breyer horse.


It is recommended that you have tack, and saddle pads and extra halters, but if you don't have a saddle or anything, just ride bareback.
You should lodge your horse if you don't ride for at least 15 minutes a day to get your horse's energy out.

, If you own two Breyers, and one is a stallion and one is a mare, separate them when they graze. Otherwise, you might end up having a foal on your hands (unless you want this to happen).


If you have two mares, it's okay to leave them together just as long as they get along. Usually, mares will get along but sometimes they don't.
If you have two stallions, you could keep them together, too. Just keep a close eye on them because stallions can be aggressive if there is a mare in the picture.
If you have two foals, make sure they are with their mothers until they are one year old.
If you have a gelding you can keep it with any of your horses whether it's a mare, stallion, foal or another gelding.
You can have three mares together in one pasture with two foals that are with their mothers. One foal could be a filly, and one a colt.
If you have a stallion and a gelding in another pasture everyone gets along.

, Make up your own story lines for the things the horses get up to, including going to horse shows, escaping from the pasture, falling in horse love, frightening the rider, getting sick and well again, and so forth."

Take your doll to a repair shop.",How to Take Care of a Porcelain Doll," Porcelain dolls are extremely fragile and should be handled with great care. A porcelain doll that is a child’s toy does not need to be handled with gloves. However, when a doll is a collectible or a decoration you should always wear white cotton gloves when you handle it. The oils on your skin can stain the doll’s porcelain and clothing, as well as attract dust. , When cleaning or dressing your doll lay it out on a towel, not directly on a table. This will protect your doll from getting any dirt or smudges on it. The towel also helps prevent breakage by adding another layer of protection for your fragile doll. , If your doll is a collectible or you want it be extra safe, store it in its original box or a ventilated container. You can purchase doll display cases online that work well for this. However, if you smoke, store your doll in an airtight container to prevent stains. The doll should always be out of direct sunlight and be in room temperature, not extreme temperatures.Keep your doll somewhere not too close to a window to avoid high temperatures and harsh light from outside from damaging your doll.

, Carefully detangle your doll’s hair with a hair detangling pick. Keep your doll’s hairline dry, otherwise the glue might come loose and the wig might fall off. Synthetic and straight hair can be carefully brushed with a wire brush. Curly hair should not be brushed because the curls could get ruined. , Regularly dust your porcelain dolls with a feather duster or a large, soft paint brush. This will help keep your doll clean and might mean you never have to give it a deep cleaning. If there is stubborn dust you can put your doll in a nylon sock and carefully vacuum the doll over the stocking or use an air compressor on the lowest setting. If you don’t use the stocking your doll’s hair can get frizzy, tangled, and ruined. If you don’t have a stocking you can cover your doll’s hair with your hands. , You can carefully clean your porcelain doll with a dry cloth or chemical sponge. You can use a very tiny amount of water if needed, but don’t use too much. Rub the cloth or sponge on the doll. Make sure to wipe, not to scrub, otherwise the paint (especially the makeup on the face), might come off. You can clean crevices and hard to reach places (such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) with a Q-tip or toothbrush. Make sure to be very gentle, especially around the eyelashes. , If your doll has stains on it, you can try to carefully remove them. Start with a little bit of gentle detergent diluted in water and wipe the stain. If that does not get the stain off, you can try a little bit of baking soda and water. Always test on a hidden part of the doll first because using soap or baking soda can cause the paint to possibly come off. , If your doll’s hair is really dirty you can carefully remove the glue on the wig with your fingers and water. Use water and glass cleaner to clean synthetic hair and gentle detergent to clean human hair. Once the wig is completely dry you can reattach it with white glue. , You can fix your dolls eyes if they are foggy and crystalized. Put a very small drop of sewing machine oil on your dolls eyes. Rub the oil in then lay your doll down on its stomach. You should leave it there for about an hour. Make sure to check on it once or twice to make sure the oil has not spread onto the porcelain. It is very important to only use a small amount and that it does not touch other parts of the doll besides the eye. The sewing machine oil might cause cracking if you are not careful. , Fix any holes in the clothes by hand sewing them. If you notice dirt or stains on your doll’s clothes you can take them off and wash them. Try to remove any accessories off of the clothes that you can before washing them. Hand wash the clothes in cold water and let hair dry. , If your doll has any cracks or does not look like you can repair it yourself, take your doll to a doll repair store. There are many doll repair stores that will fix your dolls. You can search for “doll hospitals” or “doll repair shops” in your area to find one that can repair your doll.

, Add some torn up paper on the ground to make it comfortable. Or, if you have access to real straw, cut into small pieces and add that to the ground.

, The space you provide for the horse to roam in will depend on how much play space you can devote to the horse. Try to match the space to the horse's size, as larger horses will need more space than ponies, for example. The following sizes are just suggestions, it's your imagination, so make the sizes whatever works for you:


If you are adopting a Shetland pony, you won't need more than a 1 foot (0.3 m) X 2 feet (0.6 m) paddock (with shelter included).
If you are buying a Clydesdale or draft, you should have at least a 3 feet (0.9 m) X 2 feet (0.6 m) paddock with the shelter.
Use large pieces of cardboard painted green to represent fields or paddocks. You can also take the horses outside, just be sure to give your toys a good clean after being outdoors.

, Make a feed bucket from a tube lid or use a toy bucket. Use a small container for water.

, This is especially important for the colder seasons. You can make one from fleece or blanket fabric, or just cut up scrap cloth or old clothes. Use blanket stitch to hem the edges and prevent them from fraying.

, This might include a rope bridle, a saddle, new horseshoes, etc. Don't forget to put the grooming gear together too, as you'll want to groom the new horse after getting him.


You can make items from paper, ribbon, string, etc. Use your imagination and save some money.

, If you'd like to brush and groom the horse, find small brushes, a bucket, and other grooming gear for the collection. A halter would be useful for this too, to tie the horse up while it is being groomed., Tell the other horses what his name is and get them all acquainted.


If he seems nervous, put him in his personal stall for a while.
Put him in his stall if he acts aggressively towards your existing horses.
Reward him with a treat for being patient.

, He has traveled from the store to your house and needs freshening up. It's a good time to bond too. Use this time to notice any special markings or features of your new horse.

,


If he has never been ridden, get him used to the saddle by gently applying pressure to his back, but if he has been broken in he should be fine.

, Take him riding, jumping and practicing moves. Spend time talking to him and grooming him.

, If you have different families, you might want to name them similar names – for example, if you have a family of black models, you could call them Raven, Rook, Black Bird, Crow, and Wren.

, Does it look like a famous horse? Why not name it after them? If you love a celebrity, you could name it after him or her.

, Can it jump really high? Call it High Flyer! If it’s lovable, call it Snuggles.

, Just put a trait in front of a-Lot – e.g., Love-a-Lot, Slow-a-Lot, Stamp-a-Lot or Drink-a-Lot.

, For example, Socks, Blaze, or Snip.

, For example, Lovey, Speedy, or Thirsty.

Dust regularly.",How to Collect Breyer Model Horses," There are many, many Breyer model horses, so most collectors don't try to collect every single one. One way to build a satisfying collection is to choose one size of Breyer model and focus on that. Your horses will all look like they belong in the same place, and you'll still be able to choose from a wide variety of breeds and postures. Here are a few examples:


Traditional models are the largest, and among the most popular.
Mini Whinnies are the smallest, and therefore the cheapest.
Classics, Paddock Pals, and Stablemates are additional popular types, but there are many more.;
, The mold is the metal sculpture made to create a new shape or posture. If you particularly like the shape of a model, try tracking down every horse made from that mold. Horses from the same mold are often decorated with many different paint jobs, so you do not need to sacrifice variety for consistency.


Cigar and Newsworthy are two examples of popular molds.

, If you love Arabians, Highland ponies, Shire horses, or any other breed, consider forming a color-coordinated collection. You can even base your collection around a non-breed-related attribute—such as white feet or a black mane—that is shared by individual horses.


If you own a living horse, try collecting models that look like it.

, Try this if you have money to spare and enjoy a collecting challenge. Breyer releases special limited-edition horses, and you can earn bragging rights among the collector community if you track them down.


Some of the fanciest models are the ""Gallery"" horses, available in porcelain, bronze, or resin.

, People often collect horses from a certain time period or a certain region. Some collect horses that are famous for a certain sport, such as racing or jumping. This is a fun way to explore your interests and make your collection unique.

, Toy stores might carry recent models. Horse supply stores often stock higher-quality models and holiday specials. If you can't find what you're looking for nearby, order models directly from the Breyer website or other horse model sites.


Compare prices from several places. Online stores tend to be cheaper than physical stores, but not if you have to pay for long-distance shipping.
The Breyer website has a map where you can look up a Breyer store location near you.

, These are often much cheaper, and they are sometimes sold by someone who doesn't know what he or she has. Visit charity shops, yard sales, and other places where you can find used goods. Look up model horses on online used-goods websites.


These horses are often scuffed, damaged, or broken, but they should be significantly cheaper. It's up to you to decide whether the damaged model is still worth collecting.

, These are much like real horse shows, only using models instead! The goods here are usually more expensive than other models, but there's a great selection of top-quality models.


The manufacturer hosts an annual ""Breyerfest"" as well.

, Breyer models can be quite expensive, averaging about $50 for the larger examples. If you collect the more expensive or rarer models, you might end up paying over $500 for the crown jewel of your collection. Save up and decide in advance how much you're willing to spend.


In general, the larger models are more expensive. If you don't have much to spend, consider collecting small models, such as Mini Whinnies.

, Don't spend your entire budget on a model horse if you don't know how much it's worth, or if you're not sure which model it is. You can find plenty of useful information from identification guides, online videos, the official Breyer website, and online collectors' forums.


Always look up a model's value online before selling it.

, Some types of Breyer horse tend to become valuable over time. If you manage to find one for cheaper than you expect, it might be worth getting it even if you're not certain about the value. If you're lucky, the horse will increase in value over the years, and you'll be able to resell it for more than you paid. Here are examples of models that fit this description:


Limited edition models
Models marked ""retiring"" in the Breyer catalog. (Try searching online auction sites for sellers who may not be aware of the model's status.)
Models based on a famous horse from competitions, or from a television show.

, There are three rating usually used to describe how ""used"" a model horse is. You should always inspect the horse when possible to confirm this, to make sure that the seller is telling the truth. These ratings are a good starting point:


LSQ = Live Show Quality. Excellent quality, no damage.
PSQ = Picture Show Quality. Some flaws or damage that can be covered up for display.
""Body"" means the horse has serious flaws or damage.

, If you plan on reselling the model, leave it in the original packaging to keep its value high. If you're collecting for your own enjoyment, feel free to remove the packaging so that you can take a better look.


Be careful while unpacking. The wires in the packaging can scrape the horse's sides and leave a mark.

, Keep them on shelves or cabinets free of clutter. Avoid areas where they might have liquid spilled on them, or where they're likely to be knocked off the shelf.


Check that the models will not wobble when touched. Keep unstable models in a separate area, so they don't fall and scratch other models nearby.

, Breyers will melt if left in very hot conditions, such as a car during the summer. Even in cooler temperatures, direct sunlight can cause them to fade or change shape.

, Carefully dust whenever it begins to build up. If a model gets dirty, clean the Breyer horse gently with a damp, soft cloth, plus a little dish-washing liquid if necessary.


Do not use a sponge or an abrasive cleaner. This may damage the model.

Make a home for the Breyer horse.,
Make a stall inside the barn.,
Make fake manure for the horse stall.",How to Make Items for a Breyer Model Horse1," Make a barn or other suitable place for your horse to stay. A barn can be made from a large cardboard box:


Use the opening part of the box to turn into the stable doors. Cut the flaps in half, leaving them attached to the box still. To draw the flaps together when the horse is inside, push in a thumbtack in the middle opening edge of each door. Wind thread around one tack of a top door, and one of another door. Glue in place to keep on these two doors permanently. When you wish to close the doors, simply wind the unglued end of thread around the other two thumb tacks and the doors will stay shut. (Other methods can also be improvised.)
Draw a wood paneling design on the barn doors to make it seem more realistic.
Cut out a window on the sides of the barn.
Draw grooming gear and tack on the back wall of the barn.
Paint the whole box a barn color if wished.;
, Build a stall from ice cream sticks or similar craft sticks. Or, use thin unwanted paperback books to build a stall from.


If you have a stallion and a mare, keep them in separate stalls.

, This is optional but fun. Use modeling clay to make brown colored manure piles.


Sprinkle a little sawdust down for added authenticity.

Done.

, Use half of a toilet paper roll. Simply cut in half, then color the inside blue. Gently rest in the pasture or inside the barn.

, Use old lids or tops off food items to make into food containers.

, Use netting from the craft material basket. Glue to popsicle sticks and fill with dried grass from outside. Hang onto the barn.

Choose the wood you'll use for this project.,
Take the measurements for the stall.,
Using the measurements you've taken, cut the wood pieces to the appropriate lengths.,
Glue four corner posts in place first.,
Glue the side pieces onto the outer edges of the poles.,
Move to the back end of the stall.,
Make the stall door.,
Attach the door piece to one of the front poles using small hinges.,
Decorate if wished.,
Done.",How to Build a Model Horse Stall," It can be balsa wood, craft sticks, twigs or small pieces of scrap wood. You'll also need plywood or similar wood for the base.;
, Basically, aim for a rectangular shape, with longer sides and shorter front and back ends.


Measure both length and width for the stall against the model horse you intend to display or house inside the stall. Leave sufficient room for the horse and a little space around it, including a spot for a model haynet or bucket, with which to ""feed"" the horse.
The side lengths should be as long as the entire length of the stall, including the poles.
The end width lengths should be able to be glued to the poles as well, without overlapping into the side lengths.
Measure for a door at the front width of the stall. This should be able to reach both front poles, so that it has something to hang from and something to close onto.
Also decide how high the stall is to be. It should be no higher than where your horse's neck begins, so that its head can be seen over the top of the stall. The poles used on each corner of the stall should measure about another quarter above the stall height. The poles can be made from dowel or use four thicker twigs of equal thickness each.

,


Cut both the four side poles and both sides and end pieces. Remember to cut the poles about a quarter a length higher than the side height of the stall.
Also cut a base piece of wood for the stall pieces to rest on. This can be cut from plywood or some other sheet wood that is strong and reasonably slim.
If using craft sticks, there may be no need to cut the side pieces, just the end pieces, poles and base.

, Measure out the shape of the stall on the base piece. Mark where the four posts go, then glue them firmly to the base. Wait for them to adhere fully before proceeding.

, Starting at the base, glue the wood lengths to two side poles. Repeat, stacking upward until the desired height has been reached. Then repeat on the other side.


While it's nice to try to avoid leaving gaps as you glue, if you're using twigs, this will be harder to do, so just go with whichever twigs like to stack on top of other twigs and accept that there will be gaps.

, Glue the pieces of wood in place at the back, again starting from the base and working upward. You may need to shave a little more off these pieces if your measurements weren't exact enough to account for the side pieces.

, This is easiest made from craft sticks but balsa wood or twigs will work too. If you need to cut the craft sticks to a short height, do so before making the door; the horse's head should sit over the top of the door.


Using the width measurement for the front, lay craft sticks across in a row.
Lay one craft stick across the top of the row of craft sticks.
Lay another craft stick across the base.
Lay another craft stick diagonally between both the top and bottom sticks, to form either a Z or an S shape.
Glue the three pieces into place, carefully making sure that the row pieces are firmly together without gaps.
Allow to dry.

, This will enable you to open and shut the door. On the other side, attach a small latch and tiny nail (use a jewelry finding) to keep the door attached. Alternatively, use a thumbtack and make a loop from string or an elastic to keep the door attached to the pole––stick the thumbtack on the pole, pushing it almost all the way in but not completely and attach the loop part to the door. The loop should attach around the thumbtack to close.

, Perhaps paint the stall or paint the horse's name on the stall's door. Or, you could paint little designs here and there, such as flowers, letters or spots.

, You can now put the horse's stall on display or use if for play. Don't forget to put the model horse inside!

If you made fake manure to put in your stall, here is how to clean it out.",How to Make Items for a Breyer Model Horse3," Get all of the manure out and the sawdust that got urinated on. Dump it all into a wheelbarrow or cart and take it to the manure pile. You can use s small cardboard box for the ""manure pile"".

"
When it gets cold in the winter, keep your horse warm.",How to Make Items for a Breyer Model Horse4," Make a blanket as follows:


Find a piece of polar fleece, an old blanket or unwanted clothing. Choose a fabric and pattern that pleases you.
Cut this piece of fabric into a rectangle shape. It must be large enough to drape right over the horse.
Stitch around the entire edge of the fabric piece. This gives it a hem to stop it from fraying.
You can use the blanket as it is. But if you want to add the straps that keep a blanket in place on a horse, use lengths of ribbon for this. Attach with simple stitching and tie bows to keep the blanket in place when it's on the horse.

, If you drop them, they are less likely to break when they land.

, Once a Breyer is scratched it has to be re-airbrushed to fix it. Keep sharp objects away from the Breyer.

, Don't play roughly with them- playing roughly often leads to damage.

,, Sometimes Breyers get the paint worn off on the tip of their ears and tail. If the ears or tail were black, use a Sharpie to re-color the area.

, White horses will sometimes yellow with age. You can undo this by soaking the horse in four gallons of hot, not boiling, water with 1 cup of bleach in it.


Horses with white markings and colored bodies may yellow with age too. You can whiten the yellowing by exposing the horse to direct sunlight.
Monitor this whitening process and remember to rotate the horse to complete all sides.

, They may fade. This means keeping them off a windowsill or a shelf that is hit with lots of sunlight.

, You could use an old cardboard box for this; paint it a nice color and build a stall inside it, with a door. Breyer also sells ready-made ones if you prefer.

, You could make a racing mix consisting of breakfast cereal and oats.

, These can be made easily from an egg carton; simply cut out a single egg holder and thread string through its open end, each side, then tie with a knot to keep in place. Hold it by the string and you have an easy food bucket. Add the food made in the previous step and feed it to the horse.

, These can include feeding charts, grooming information and veterinary notes.

, Use toothpicks to make hanging hooks; snap to an appropriate length and glue these to the wall for hanging tack from. Hang the horse's lead ropes, halters, bridles, etc. from these.


A saddle stand can be made by placing a craft stick down flat and gluing a craft stick each side of it. Glue it to the wall.
Find a small, flat container and use it for keeping riding boots in or blankets.

Soak the hair in fabric softener.,
Comb out the hair with the fabric softener still in the hair.,
Rinse out the hair.,
Brush with a fine-toothed comb.",How to Untangle and Soften Doll Hair1," Choose a high-quality brand of fabric softener for the best effect. Pour some fabric softener in a bowl or cup. How much you need depends on the amount of hair on the doll. You should have enough fabric softener to completely soak the doll's hair.








To avoid wasting fabric softener, start off by adding a small amount. Add more fabric softener as you go along, adding enough to soak the doll's hair.
Place the doll's hair in the bowl. Work the fabric softener into the hair using your fingers. Keep going until the hair is completely coated.Set the doll aside. Keep the doll in a safe place, where it will not be disturbed. Leave the fabric softener in for at least an hour. If the doll's hair is in particularly rough shape, consider leaving the softener in overnight.;
, After soaking the doll's hair for your chosen time period, comb the hair out with the fabric softener still in place. The softener should act as a conditioning agent, smoothing out the doll's hair and loosening tangles.








You should use a wide-toothed wig brush, as these brushes tend to work out tangles best. If you do not have a wig brush, any wide-toothed brush should work. Go slowly to avoid breaking the doll's hair as you comb.However, with a smaller doll like a Barbie doll, a fine-toothed comb may work better.
If you're working on a doll with very long hair, consider working out bigger tangles or knots with your fingers before brushing., Once the hair is brushed, rinse out the softener. You can simply rinse the doll's hair out under cool tap water in your sink. Make sure to get all the fabric softener out. If any softener is left in longterm, it could damage the hair. Periodically squeeze the hair to see if you notice any softener oozing out. Keep rinsing until no fabric softener is present.








You can pat the doll's hair slightly dry with a clean towel. You can also let the hair air dry in the sun.Do not blow dry doll's hair. Doll hair is delicate and will not respond well to being dried with a hair dryer.

, Once the hair is somewhat dry, brush it out again. Use a fine-tooth comb this time, as this will straighten the doll's hair and work out small tangles. Brushing the hair one last time can also aid with the drying process.

Fill a bowl or cup with cool water.,
Stir in a quarter teaspoon of baby shampoo.,
Shampoo the doll's hair.,
Leave the doll's hair in the bowl for 10 minutes.,
Rinse the hair three times.,
Dry the hair a little.,
Brush out the hair.",How to Untangle and Soften Doll Hair2," You can use baby shampoo to soften a doll's hair. Pick a cup or bowl that's big enough to hold all of your doll's hair. The temperature of the water should be colder if your doll has curly hair. Hot or warm water can cause curls to loosen.







, Once your bowl or cup is full of water, stir in a quarter teaspoon of baby shampoo. Mix the shampoo into the water until it has dissolved completely.








Do not substitute regular shampoo for baby shampoo. Baby shampoo is mild enough to be safe for use on doll hair. If you do not have baby shampoo, try to buy some. You also may be able to get away with using a mild form of shampoo, like shampoo for sensitive skin or shampoo for hair that's been dyed recently.

, Once the bath is prepared, place the doll's hair in the water. Swirl the hair around until it's wet. Then, work in the shampoo using your fingers. Keep massaging the doll's hair until you work up a small lather.







, Once the doll's hair is shampooed, set the doll aside for about 10 minutes. This gives the shampoo a chance to soften the hair. This will help remove any tangles and leave the hair soft and shiny. Set the doll aside in a safe place where it's unlikely to be disturbed., After 10 minutes have passed, rinse the doll's hair. Empty the shampoo bowl, rinse it out, and then fill it with clean water. Rinse the doll's hair in the bowl until the water becomes soapy from the shampoo. Rinse the bowl again and repeat this process two more times.








Make sure you get all the shampoo out. If the water still becomes soapy on the third rinse, run the doll's hair under tap water until all the shampoo is removed. Leaving shampoo in the doll's hair longterm could cause damage.

, Once the hair is rinsed, you need to dry it out slightly. You should not brush hair when it's wet. You want to wait until it's damp to brush. To dry, you can hang the doll upside down and let the hair air dry a little. You can also pat the hair somewhat dry with a towel.Once again, do not use a hairdryer as this can damage your doll's hair.








, Once the hair is damp, start the brushing process. For a smaller doll, use a fine-toothed comb. For a larger doll, go for a wide-toothed wig brush or any wide-toothed brush.









Brush slowly to avoid breaking or damaging the hair.On dolls with long hair, work out big tangles with your fingers.

Remove all items from the doll.,
Brush your doll's hair regularly.,
Avoid over-styling your doll's hair.,

Be careful when washing dolls with mechanical parts.",How to Untangle and Soften Doll Hair3," Before washing a doll's hair, make sure to remove any items from the hair. Dolls may have bows, bandanas, barrettes, or other accessories embedded in their hair.









If a doll has been in storage for a long time, it may have items tangled deep in its hair. Spend some time fishing through a doll's hair to check for accessories before washing the hair.

, If you want to prevent hair from becoming tangled or damaged, brush out your doll's hair regularly. After you or your child plays with the doll, comb out the hair before putting it away for the day.









Comb a doll's hair as you would your own. Start at the bottom of the lock and work your way up to get out tangles., Styling a doll's hair can be fun. However, messing a doll's hair too much can lead to tangles and damage. Stick to simple styles, like braids and ponytails, rather than trying to emulate fancy hairdos you've seen on TV or in the movies. This will keep your doll's hair smooth and soft.







, Before attempting to wash a doll's hair, read the manufacturer's instructions if you still have them. Some types of dolls come with special instructions for washing and hair care. American Girl dolls, for example, have hair that you should not wash on your own. The corporation provides a number you can call to ask for advice in the event your doll's hair is damaged., If a doll has mechanical parts, be careful before washing the doll's hair. Water can cause damage to a doll of this type. You may want to consider removing the hair or head, if possible, before washing. You can also wrap the doll's body in plastic wrap to protect it from water damage during the washing process.

Finished!",How to Make a Crinkle Taggie Baby Toy," The main thing you need to make a crinkle taggie baby toy is material, preferably something in bright colors or contrasting like black and white so that the baby is visually stimulated.









You need to have two pieces of material that are identical in size and shape, but not necessarily color and texture. These will form the front and back of the toy.
The pieces of material do not need to be very large. In fact, an ideal size is about 8x8 inches. They don't need to be perfect squares either. The material can even be cut into the shape of an animal or other object, as long as it does not have long thin areas that would be difficult to turn inside out.;
, The tags are made with pieces of ribbon, ric-rac, bias tape, or any other trimming materials that will not fray easily.









Using an assortment of colors and textures for the trimming materials make the toy more attractive to the babies sense of touch.
The trimming materials will be folded over to form small loops so each piece should be about three inches in length.

, The last thing that is needed to make the crinkle taggie toy is something to give it its crinkly sound. One of the easiest and safest things to use for this is an empty cereal bag.









Of course, in order to prevent the possibility of bugs being attracted to the toy, the cereal bag should be thoroughly washed and dried before it is used.
To do this, the cereal bag should be gently split along the seams and cut up the side to make one flat piece that is easily wiped clean with a soapy dishcloth or sponge. It can be left to air dry, or dried by hand.

, Although one half of the cereal bag is sufficient, some people prefer to use the whole bag for extra crinkling.









The cereal bag should be laid out on the work surface. It does not need to be entirely flat since it is supposed to be wrinkled to make the sound.
One piece of the material should be centered, face up on top of the plastic cereal bag.

, The pieces of trimming materials should be spaced around the edge of the main piece so that a small section of the open ends of the loops hang off the edges of the material.









This is done so that the ends are held in place when the toy is sewn. The loops should be pinned so that they stay in place while sewing.
It's okay if they lay across each other on top of the material because the toy will be turned right side out so that the tags hang freely along the edges.

, After the tags are pinned in place, the other piece of material should be placed, pattern-side down, on top of everything.









It is important to align the edges of the two pieces of material so that they can be sewn together properly.
The two pieces of material and the cereal bag should be pinned together along the edges.

, Using a sewing machine, the toy should be sewn all the way around the edge aside from a space in the center of one side that is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm).









Due to the cereal bag, it might be difficult for the sewing machine to draw the toy through while sewing, so the person might have to help it along.

, Trim the edges as necessary. After sewing the toy, it should be trimmed close to the seam to remove any excess cereal bag or cloth that sticks out too far. This will make it easier to turn the toy right-side out through opening that was left.








, You can use the ladder stitch for an invisible seam.








, You crinkle taggie baby toy is now ready for your baby to enjoy!

Buy real clothes or order them off the Internet, blankets, diapers, bottles, pacifiers, blankets, stroller car seat - both toddler or infant, fake formula (this can be made with fabric softener or glue and water, it's up to you) wipes, toys, etc. However, do not feel the need to buy over--priced items as a reborn isn't real and doesn't have feelings. Also plan for what doll you want. Do you want a girl or a boy? Do you care if the main body is cotton in exchange for a cheaper price? Be prepared to spend at least $90.;
, When he/she arrives, pick out a name and fill out the birth certificate if the baby comes with one and doesn't have a name yet and if it is not already filled out for you, and if they did not, you can print one off the internet. Take your baby out of the box, and remove their clothing to observe the doll and see if there are any marks or scratches on them. Then, redress them. Take some photos with your baby.

, Choose whether you want to change the baby to make sure they are clean after their long trip, or to prepare a bottle for them, or cover them up in a warm blanket to take a nice long nap. Whatever you choose, be prepared to repeat it every day. Spend some time holding the reborn and sitting with him or her, as this will make you feel more confident and comfortable with your doll.

, Having a schedule for Feeding times, expected changing times, nap times, play times.

, There's nothing wrong with having a little boast and if you want to have him or her all to yourself, that's fine too.

Remove all the doll's clothing.,
Choose a product to use in the doll's hair.,
Prepare the water.,
Wash the doll's hair.",How to Wash Doll Hair1," Before you begin washing your doll's hair, make sure you remove all of the doll's clothing. You do not want to accidentally damage a doll's clothes during the washing process. You should also remove any hair clips or accessories in a doll's hair. These can sometimes be easy to overlook, so comb through a doll's hair first to remove any hair ties., Once you've prepared the doll, find the right product to use in its hair. The type of product you use depends on the type of doll.


For a Barbie doll, use a mild conditioner and gentle soap. For shampoo, it's best to use baby shampoo. If you have a doll with similar hair to a Barbie doll, consider using these products in that situation as well.If your doll is older and its hair is damaged, consider using a gentle fabric softener. This will help clean out the doll's hair and can also help restore its glow and softness. It can also remove odors that have built up in a doll's hair over time.In general, using mild products work best. Doll's hair is far more delicate than human hair, so a gentler shampoo or conditioner is ideal.

, Once you've chosen your product, prepare the water. Most people recommend water that is either cold or lukewarm. Hot water can be damaging to a doll's hair.









Stir in a small amount of the product you are using.Mix the product into the water., Dip your doll in the water. Gently lather the shampoo into the doll's hair. As you go, try to work out any knots or tangles you notice along the way. If your doll's hair is particularly dirty, consider letting the doll sit in the water for 10 minutes.








If you're using fabric softener to restore old doll hair, the process is slightly different. You should fill a small bowl or basin with as much softener as you need to coat the doll's hair. Place the doll's hair in the bowl and cover the hair until its soaked in softener. Then, let the doll sit for 20 minutes."

Make sure you get all the product out. Letting shampoo or conditioner dry into hair can cause damage. If you used a product like fabric softener, it may take slightly longer to wash out.








, Once you're done rinsing the hair, pat the doll's hair dry. Use a clean, dry towel and soak up large blots of water using a gentle patting motion.








If the doll's hair does not come completely dry with patting, you might have to set the doll aside and let it air dry.

, After you've done some initial drying, brush the doll's hair out. If your doll has a lot of thick hair, it might be best to try and brush the hair out while it's still wet. Tangles might be easier to remove if they haven't dried into hair.

Glue the eraser tip to the center of the round disc object.,
Bend a piece of pipe cleaner in a circular shape around the base of the eraser tip, at the point where it is attached to the round disc.,
Cut a length of thin ribbon to form a loop on the other side of the disc.,
Allow everything to completely dry.",How to Make Your Own Baby Alive Pacifiers," If you can't find a small round disc of a suitable size for the pacifier back, you'll need to make one. It is suggested that you use something like a plastic lid off a coffee or hot chocolate can as this is strong yet flexible, and will be easy to cut. Draw a suitably sized circle on the lid, then cut it out with scissors.


Ask a responsible older person to assist with cutting if you're having trouble with this.;
, This will make it prettier and more interesting. This step is optional, you can leave the eraser clear if preferred.


Check that the eraser tip fits the doll's mouth. If not, you may need to whittle it a little with a craft knife to get the shape right. Ensure that a responsible older person does the cutting if this is needed.
Adding colored tape will potentially make the tip bigger, so bear this in mind before adding it. Test the fit again after adding the tape, and make adjustments as needed.

, You may need to hold the eraser in place upright, taking care not to touch the hot glue or gun end.

, Do not do this until you are certain that the eraser tip has dried firmly to the disc, as you don't want the eraser tip to fall off. Cut off the excess pipe cleaner that doesn't form part of the circle, then glue the pipe cleaner circle in place. This gives the impression of both dimension and a neat finish, as well as covering the glued base of the eraser tip.

, Glue the two ends to the center of the other side of the disc, in a loop shape. This forms the holder of the pacifier.

, Once fully dried, the pacifier can be used with the Baby Alive doll.

",How to Reborn a Doll," This is the easiest way to complete your first doll. Once you get a feel for the colors and doll making you can experiment with your own way of doll making. The kit should contain everything you need to complete the project such as paints, stuffing materials, body, doll limbs, mohair, and the tools to complete the doll. A doll making kit should cost around $150 and will contain almost everything needed for your first project. If you do not purchase a kit, the following suggested items will help you get started in reborning. There are purchasing links listed in the sources section of this article.;
, Most dolls will need a head, arms, legs, cloth body, hair. If you are reborning an open-eyed baby, you will need to purchase eyes and perhaps eye lashes, if you choose not to buy a doll making kit.

,,, Most reborn artists use Genesis paints which will require the purchase of an oven, preferably a convection oven. You will need to purchase paints, paint brushes, perhaps sea sponges or berry makers.
,, Typical areas to find veining would be on the backs of the hands and the bottom of the feet. Look at photos of babies to get a good idea of where to place the veins. Use a very thin paint, almost like watercolor, to paint the veins. Light layers of paint are what is needed to paint a reborn doll.

, Place the doll parts onto the towel.

, The temperature is usually between 260 to 265 °F (127 to 129 °C) for 8 minutes to set the Genesis paint.

,, Be sure to use a very thin, almost watercolor consistency paint, otherwise your doll will end up looking chalky. Bake according to the previous directions. Let it cool.

, Bake to set paint.

, Typical places to blush would include the bottoms of the feet (use a ""U"" motion to paint around the outer edges of the sole); in baby creases (do this delicately) and across the bridge of the nose and cheeks. Use a sea sponge or mop brush to pounce the paint. Bake to set paint using previous directions.

, Use a filbert paint brush to apply the paint. Apply one layer of paint to the nails and several layers to the lips. Bake as directed above to set the paint.

, Use a delicate hand, and thinned paint, to carefully paint veins on the eyelids. Use a purplish paint that looks much like Dioxide purple. Bake the doll parts as directed to set the paint.

, The paint should be very thin so the brows look delicate when painted onto the face. Bake the doll parts as directed to set the paint.

, Use a whitish paint and delicately apply a dab of paint following the curvature of the nail. Bake the doll parts as directed to set the paint.

,,, Add a good dollop of Gem-Tac or similar glue to inside of the head cavity in the scalp area. Use a hemostat or other long gripping tool and a sponge to smear the glue around. Let dry.

, The eyelashes are rooted the same way. Root the eyelashes in and then glue them from inside the doll head.

, Look at newborn babies to get a general idea of how to style the hair.

, Let it dry.

,, In general, line the body cavities with cut off pantyhose and fill with beads or other filler to weight the body and head. Secure the nylons and place in appropriate doll cavities.

Choose the one with only baby doll experience, unless her services cost significantly more than the other.

, It's safest for you and your baby doll.

, Medications for sicknesses can usually be cured at home but check-ups can't happen at home. If a friend has baby doll or toy health experience you could ask her.

Add any accessories to that cost. Beware about getting too many accessories, though. The price will quickly rise.
Shipping will cost about an additional $13, but you can try to convince your parents to pay for that.;
, Look in your wallet, check your piggy bank, and search the cracks of your couch for change. Once you have all your money, subtract that from the total cost of the doll you want. That's your target!


Say you find that you have $28.50 and the doll you want with its accessories is $120. That means you'll have to raise $91.50.

, That way you'll always know how close you are to earning your American Girl Doll, and you'll feel a sense of progress. It may take a while, so be patient.


Remember to subtract anything you buy from your total.
Keep your money in a safe place. Put it in a jar and hide it somewhere like in your dresser or desk drawer. That way your brother or sister can't find it, and it's less tempting to spend it.

, The key to saving is not spending. You've made a goal to save enough for an American Girl Doll. Don't waste your money on small things you don't want as much.

, This is the best way to earn money as a kid. Your parents can't do all the housework, so they'll be willing to pay for your help. Think about your parents' least favorite chores and offer to do those chores for them.


For instance, offer to wash the dishes, sweep and vacuum the floor, walk the dogs, babysit your brother or sister, mow the lawn etc... The more specific you are with your suggestions the better.
Do your chores regularly! Be thorough and don't cut corners. At the end of the day you can smile knowing you've earned your money!

, You can't find work without people to work for. Knock on your neighbors' doors and ask family friends if they have any work they need done. Be sure to sell yourself as a responsible and hard-working kid.


Have a rate in mind, but wait to talk about it. If you do good work, they'll pay you a fair price.
Be respectful. Not everybody wants work done. If they don't want to hire you, don't press the issue.
Ask your parents before starting, and let them know where you are at all times.

, Make sure they're in an area where people will see it, like a bulletin board or on a busy street corner. Put your phone number, name, and the work you want to do. Then wait for somebody to call you!


Make slips with your number on it so people can take your information on the go.
Make your flyer colorful and visually appealing. Pictures and big, bold fonts are good. Convey as much information in as few words as possible.

, If you get a job, do your best work. The better your work, the more they'll pay you and the more likely they are to ask for you again. Hopefully word will spread and soon enough everybody will be asking for you!

, Set up a stand on a popular corner and sell cupcakes and cookies to your neighbors and friends. Be patient and understanding. Not everyone wants to buy, but if you're nice and you persevere you can make a lot of money like this.

Determine the type of paint used to paint the reborn baby.,
Determine if the reborn baby's skin is excessively shiny or looks wet.,
Determine if the body of the reborn baby has joints.,
Determine the type of filling used inside the reborn baby.,
Determine if the reborn baby has quality hair.,
Examine the details of a reborn baby's features.",How to Buy Reborn Babies2," Some paints will adhere to the doll's skin permanently; whereas other paints may rub off the doll's skin or fade as time passes.


Look for reborn babies painted with heat set oil paints manufactured by Genesis. This brand of paint is most commonly used by the majority of reborn baby artists; however, other brands of oil paints that have been applied in thin layers can also adhere permanently to the doll's skin without rubbing off.

, These signs indicate that the paint will rub away from the skin eventually, as the artist most likely scrubbed the doll's skin with acetone before it was painted.


Look for dolls that have skin with a matte appearance, which indicates that the paint and method used will not fade or rub away from the skin.

, This will allow you to position the doll in numerous poses.


Look for jointed reborn babies made from sturdy and heavy material such as flannel, thick cotton, or suede; all of which will allow you to easily move and position the joints.

, Some filling materials may cause the vinyl of the doll's body to deteriorate or become stained over time, such as colored sand.


Verify that the doll is filled with either glass beads, polyester filling, metal pellets, or hard polyester pellets.

, Some material that resembles hair may not look or feel authentic; whereas other hair types may easily fall out.


Observe the reborn baby's hair from all angles to make sure that there is hair on the back of the head in addition to the front.
Look for reborn babies with soft, angora goat hair that can lay flat on the doll's head. The hair should sealed from the inside of the head with a waterproof adhesive, which will prevent the hair from falling out.

,


Look to see that eyes, lips, and nostrils are aligned properly, and that the eye sockets do not contain any gaps that allow the eyeballs to roll around.
Inspect the fingernails and toenails of the reborn baby to see if they have been manicured, trimmed, glossed, and appear realistic.

Mark each ear lightly with a pencil.,
Using a thumbtack, slowly start pushing the sharp edge into the mark placed on the ear.,
Use a sewing pin to break through the vinyl if you have ended up with a dent instead of a hole.,
Evaluate the size of the holes using an earring.,
Enlarge the holes if needed.,
Keep evaluating the size of the hole you're making; it won't hold the earrings straight or look nice if you make it too big.,
Have your doll wear her new earrings frequently.",How to Pierce an American Girl Doll's Ears Without Pay," This will protect it from messing up while you pierce the ears. It will also prove the job to be easier as well.;
, This will give you the outline of where you will put the piercing. If it is not even then simply erase and try again.

, Patiently wedge it in until it goes all the way through. If it is taking awhile, try twisting it whilst the tack is still on the mark.

, This should be enough to pierce the ear--then, enlarge the small sewing pin hole using the thumbtack.

, Your doll should be able to wear post earrings, especially very small studs to suit her small face. If the earrings go in and stay in, you are done!

, You will want to use a sharp item that does not make a mark. You could try a metal tapestry needle, an awl, a THIN nail, a metal skewer or corn holder from the kitchen, or many other items. Look around and see what you can find!

, When the hole is big enough for the earrings to go in and stay in, you're done!

, She will look prettier with the jewelry hiding the holes. The vinyl can also close back up a bit if she doesn't wear earrings for awhile, so you might have to go through the enlargement process again.

Read a catalog or look at the American Girl website ahead of time to help decide what to buy.
,
Consider your budget.,
Consider the ways that the owner of the doll enjoys playing with the doll.,
Consider the seasonality of the items.,
If the person you're buying for (whether it's yourself or someone else) is a young AG fan (roughly 7-9 - kids younger than that probably won't have AG dolls, because they're less likely to be able to take good care of them), consider how easy the accessory is to use.,
Go to the AG Place and then go to the section that suits your doll.,
Choose items that match the hobbies of the doll owner.,
Think of what colors you like.",How to Select Accessories for American Girl Dolls,", American Girl doll accessories are often priced more than other doll accessories which means that the cost of the accessories can add up quite quickly. In addition, doll furniture tends to be more expensive than clothes or smaller accessories., Some people are really into dressing up their doll, while others are more into putting it to sleep or taking care of it., If a doll accessory is Christmas-themed, will it get played with during the rest of the year?, In the case of clothes, does it require a lot of snaps or is it something that would fall off the doll easily (like a hat)., For example, if your doll is Kit, then you would go to the historical doll section and then to Kit. If you don't live near an American Girl Place, go to the website and click on the section for the doll you have., American Girl has doll accessories for many common hobbies for girls., This is very important in terms of doll clothes. The colors of American Girl clothes resemble that of retail clothing stores -- darker in the winter and brighter in the summer. If the person who owns the doll finds dark colors dreary, then winter clothing might not be the best thing to get."

Decide which doll you are taking.,
Pack your doll's clothes.,
Don't forget accessories.,
Consider where to pack their items.,
Decide where to put your doll herself.",How to Pack Your American Girl Doll for a Vacation," Consider taking a doll with short and straight hair like Kit, or a Truly Me with straight hair or hair easier to brush and that doesn't get messed up easily. Don't bring long haired dolls like Saige or Rebecca because their hair will be constantly brushed and you won't end up having the time of your life, instead you'll be sitting inside doing your American Girl doll's hair - that definitely won't be the time of your life. (But if the only doll you have has long hair, or you REALLY want to bring one with long hair, keep her hair in an easy style like braids or a bun for the whole vacation so it doesn't get messed up.);
, With the clothes it really depends where you are going, if it is very warm and hot weather then your doll will have to wear shorts and a t-shirt, or a short-sleeved or sleeveless dress. For pajamas in warm weather you could take a nightgown, or shorts (or even pants, if it's just warm rather than really hot) and a shirt. For colder weather, you'll want things like jackets, tights, and long pants. For pajamas you will want long sleeve ones with long pants as well.

, So of course your doll might have a little stuffed animal or a toy she likes to take around when traveling, so you might want to put that toy in a little bag or the suitcase. Please note: Sometimes little accessories can get lost while traveling, just be careful they aren't hanging out.

, So if your doll has a little suitcase for herself you may put the clothes into that but if she doesn't a little bag might be handy. If you don't have a bag or a suitcase you just may be able to fit her clothes into your suitcase. They will fit - they're small! If you take a small bag, make sure nothing is hanging out because as things can get lost so please shut tightly.

, Sometimes you might not always want to carry your doll everywhere, so if you want you can put her in your suitcase.


If you put her in your suitcase, make sure to wrap something (cling wrap works well) around her so she can't get anything spilled onto her while being in your suitcase.

Find your favorite doll to take with you.,
Consider taking two dolls.",How to Pack for an American Girl Doll1," Try to bring dolls with straight hair or with short hair, like Kit Kittredge. It's harder to care for dolls with long curly hair when you're traveling and there is a risk of getting their hair messy from wind, food crumbs, etc.;
, If you do, this means packing more things for them but it's a good idea to let them share clothes or you'll carry too much. The more you take, the easier is to lose things. If you do decide to bring an American girl doll with curly hair and/or if she has a water spray bottle to use, make sure the spray bottle is empty, this way your trip will be comfortable.

Turn ordinary objects into accessories.",How to Make an American Girl Doll House," Before you convert something into a dollhouse, you will need to make sure that it will fit the doll and her furniture. You want your doll to be able to stand up comfortably in her house, and you want the furniture to fit easily into the rooms without going over the edges. Whatever space you end up using or building for your dollhouse will need to at least 20 inches tall, 20 inches wide, and 20 inches deep in order to fit both the doll and her furniture. This section will give you several options on where you can build your dollhouse.;
, You can transform a simple bookshelf into a dollhouse, or you can make your own bookshelf. Depending on how wide your bookshelf is, you may be able to add some vertical walls or dividers to create more rooms. Bookshelves take up the least space, and can be turned into multi-storied houses.

, You can convert a wardrobe into a large dollhouse by adding 2 to 3 shelves inside. Some wardrobes include drawers, which can be used to store extra items for your doll, such as clothes and brushes. The best part about using a wardrobe for a dollhouse is that you can close the doors when playtime is over so that dust, pets, and younger siblings can't get inside.

, You can purchase a unite with cubbies from a furniture store and turn it into a dollhouse, or you can make your own by stacking several crates together and securing them with wood glue or nails. Make sure that each cubby hole is at least 20 inches tall, or else your doll will not have room to stand up in it. Cubbies will allow you to create multiple rooms without having to insert any dividing walls.

, You can create a dollhouse by stacking several boxes or crates together. The boxes or crates can be made out of cardboard, wood, or plastic. Secure the creates with nails, screws, or wood glue.


Cardboard boxes will be the cheapest and easiest to paint and decorate, but they will also be the least durable. Multiple cardboard boxes stacked together may begin to sag beneath the weight of the doll and her furniture after a while.
Wood will be more expensive, but they will also be more durable. Depending on the quality of the wood, however, some of the creates will need to be sanded to achieve a smoother finish.
Plastic crates may be more expensive than cardboard boxes, but they will be more durable. Depending on the finish, some plastic crates might have to be sanded first before painting or adding wallpaper and flooring; not doing so might result in the paint chipping off and the glued-on pieces falling off.

, If you are using a wide shelf or wardrobe, you can easily turn it into 2 or 3 separate rooms. You can create more rooms by cutting a sheet of wood, plywood, or cardboard the same height as the ""room"" and wedging it into the shelf vertically. You may need to secure it with some wood glue or hot glue.


You can also use foam-core or sheets of fabric instead.
You can make doors by cutting rectangles into your walls before you insert them into your house. Make sure that the rectangles are at least 20 inches tall.

, You can also build a dollhouse from scratch out of wood, plywood, cardboard, or foam-core. You will need to create something that looks like a bookshelf, with each floor being at least 20 inches high and 20 inches deep.


If you are using wood or plywood, look for something that is between ½ to ¾ inch thick.If you are using cardboard or foam-core, glue 2 to 3 sheets together to make the house more durable.
If you wish to add multiple rooms, create walls out of the same materials that you are using for the rest of the house and insert them after you have put the rest of the house together. Each wall should measure the room's height by the room's depth. For example, if each floor is 20 inches high and 20 inches deep, then your walls need to be 20 inches by 20 inches.
Since you are building this house from scratch, consider cutting some windows into the outside walls, and doors into the dividing walls. Make sure that the doors are big enough for the doll to fit through.

, Knowing what types of rooms you want inside your dollhouse will help you decide what to make the walls and floors out of. Some rooms, such as bathrooms and kitchens, will look better with tiled floors, while other rooms, such as living rooms and bedrooms, will look better with wooden or carpeted floors.


If you are making a dollhouse for one of American Girl's historical dolls, look at pictures of houses from that era to get some ideas.
Look at home decorating magazines to get more ideas.

, You can add color to your dollhouse by painting the walls with acrylic paint or spray paint. You can paint each room a different color. You can also paint the walls a solid color with a large brush or spray paint, and then paint designs using a smaller brush or stencils. If you choose to use spray paint, make sure that you paint outside or in a well-ventilated area.


Consider leaving some parts of your dollhouse unpainted. For example, if your dollhouse is made out of wood, then paint just the walls. The unpainted floors will look like wooden floors.

, You can add some texture and personality to your dollhouse by adding some wallpaper. If you are making a house for a historical American Girl doll, look at pictures of wallpapers from her era and finding something with a similar design or pattern. There are many ways you can make wallpaper:


Wrapping paper is great for covering large areas. Measure the walls of your dollhouse, and cut sheets of wrapping paper according to those measurements. You can glue the paper down to the walls using spray-on adhesive, or you can paint a thin layer of glue onto the walls and press the paper down. You can seal the paper with either a paint-on varnish or a seal-on varnish.
Colored contact paper or shelf and drawer liner is another alternative to wrapping paper, except that it does not need to be glued down or sealed. Simply measure the areas you want covered, cut sheets of colored contact paper/shelf and drawer liner according to those measurements. Then, peel off the backing and stick the sheet to the walls.
Scrapbooking paper comes in 12 by 12 inch sheets and is good for small spaces. You will need to use several sheets of scrapbooking paper to cover large areas. You can use the same pattern for an entire wall, or you can mix and match patterns to create a tiled effect. Like with wrapping paper, you will need to glue the scrapbooking paper down using either a spray-on adhesive or painting on a thin layer of glue. You can also seal the scrapbooking paper with a paint-on or seal-on varnish to make it last longer.
You can also purchase small amounts of wallpaper from your local hardware store and glue it to the walls of your dollhouse.

, Make your dollhouse appear cozier by adding some pictures and mirrors on the walls. You can print out small pictures (or cut them out of magazines) and tape them to the walls of your doll house. You can also glue small craft mirrors to the walls in bathrooms or above dressers.


For something more elegant, put the pictures and mirrors inside mini picture frames.You can find them at most arts and crafts shop. If you like the style of a frame but not the color, you can always paint it with some acrylic paint. You can make simple frames fancier by adding gemstones and beads.

, You can make your dollhouse appear more realistic by adding some windows. You can either cut square holes into the walls, or you can add pictures of the outdoors and tape them to the walls instead. You can either find pictures on the internet and print them out, or you can cut them from a magazine.


Make your window appear even more realistic by adding a square of clear, plastic sheeting or cellophane over the picture. Cut a square of plastic sheeting or cellophane a little bit bigger than your picture. Put some glue around the edges of your picture, and press the plastic sheet onto it.
You can hide the edges of your window by putting colored tape over it, or gluing thin craft sticks around the edges.

, You can make your windows appear cozier by making some curtains for them. You will two small wall hooks, a short dowel or wooden rod, some fabric, and some ribbon.


Take your dowel and cut it a few inches wider than your window. You can paint it, or you can leave it blank.You can make the curtain rod appear fancier by gluing a fancy bead or button to each end—just make sure that they match.
Screw tiny wall hooks above the window, one to each side. You will be placing the dowel over them.Cut two pieces of fabric. Each piece should be a few inches taller than your window, and half your window's width. Fold over the top inch or so of each piece and sew or glue the edge down. Make sure that you can slide the wooden dowel through.
Assemble your curtains by sliding the pieces of fabric over the dowel, and setting the dowel onto the hooks. Pull the two pieces of fabric apart, one to each side of the window. Tie a piece of ribbon around each curtain so that they don't fall shut over the window.

, Wooden floors can add a more luxurious feel to a dollhouse. They can also lend any dollhouse a more authentic look, especially if it is for one of American Girl's historical dolls. Unless your dollhouse is already made out of wood, you will need to made some wooden floors for it. Fortunately, there are many ways you can make a wooden floor:


Popsicle sticks or small pieces of craft wood can be used to create a wooden floor. If you are using popsicle sticks, you can prevent gaps by cutting off the rounded ends. Glue the sticks to the shelf, and coat the wood with varnish. You can tint the floor a darker color using wood stain. Do this before adding the varnish.
Use sample pieces of wood flooring to create an authentic wooden floor. Some hardware and furniture stores sell sample pieces of flooring. Purchase several of these and glue them down side by side on the shelf.
You can also sheets of wood-textured linoleum to mimic the look of wooden floors. Simply measure the floor of your dollhouse, and cut sheets of linoleum according to those measurements. Glue the linoleum down to the floor of your dollhouse.
If you have a tight budget, you can use wood-patterned scrapbooking paper. Because scrapbooking paper comes in 12 by 12 inch sheets, you will need to glue several sheets of scrapbooking paper side-by-side in order to cover the entire floor. Use either spray-on adhesive or paint on a thin layer of glue. You can help the paper last longer by coating it with either a spray-on varnish or a paint-on varnish.

, You can make your dollhouse appear more realistic by adding tiled floors to certain rooms of your dollhouse, such as the bathroom and the kitchen. There are many ways you can make a tiled floor:


Purchase some small tiles from a hardware store or an arts and crafts store, and glue them down onto the shelf. If there are gaps, you can seal them by painting over the whole floor with varnish.
Tile-patterned linoleum sheets can also be used to cover floor. Measure the floor of your dollhouse and cut sheets of linoleum according to those measurements. Glue the linoleum down to the floor of your dollhouse.
If you are on a tight budget, you can use some tile-patterned scrapbooking paper instead. Because scrapbooking paper comes in 12 by 12 inch sheets, you will need to glue down several sheets of scrapbooking paper side-by-side. of You can create the appearance of large tiles by alternating solid-colored sheets of scrapbooking paper in a checkerboard pattern.

, You can make your dollhouse appear more comfortable by adding some There are many ways you can add rugs and carpeting to your dollhouse:


Use miniature, sample rugs. Some stores make and sell miniature versions of larger, full-sized rugs. Purchase some and set them down over the wooden floors you have made. Try using some miniature versions of Persian rugs for a historical dollhouse.
Small bathmats can also be used to make rugs and carpets. You can cut and glue down a bathmat to create a carpet. You can also cut down a bathmat to a small rectangle and use it as a cozy rug in a bedroom or living room.
Purchase some carpeting from a carpet store or a hardware store and glue it down to the shelf. Choose something with a low pile so that it will be proportional to the doll.
Use towels to make carpets and bathmats. Simply measure the floor of your dollhouse and cut a towel according to those measurements. Glue it down to the floor of your dollhouse using fabric glue. You can also cut towels into smaller rectangles and use them as bathmats in a bathroom.
Scraps of fur can make trendy and chic rugs, especially if they are a bright color.

, Many companies that sell 18 inch dolls also sell furniture for them. Visit your local toy store or your favorite doll company's website and buy some doll furniture for your dollhouse.

, Doll furniture can be expensive, but making it can not only be inexpensive, but also fun. You can use all sorts of materials to make shelves, tables, and beds, including wood, plywood, foam-core, and cardboard. You can also paint your furniture with acrylic paint or spray paint.


If you are making a bed, don't forget to make a mattress, some pillows, and bedding! Make sure that the bed is at least 18 inches long, or else it will be too small for your doll. You can make mattresses and pillows by folding pieces of fabric in half, sewing two of the edges, stuffing it with cotton, and then sewing the third edge shut. You can use bandanas and some old pillow cases (provided that they are small/large enough) as blankets.
Plastic cups can easily be turned into stools. You can make your own stool by turning a plastic cup upside down and painting it or wrapping fabric around it. Don't forget to add a cushion to it!, Some people-sized items can be used as furniture for your doll. Look around your home and local shops for items that can resemble doll furniture. If the item you find is not the right color or is too plain, you can decorate it further by painting it with acrylic paint or spray paint. You can then paint designs with a smaller brush or stencils. Here are some ideas:


Many garden shops and arts and crafts stores sell planters that look like chairs or benches. Some of them might be just the right size for your doll. You can make them appear cozier by making a small cushion out of scrap fabric.
Jewelry chests can already resemble dressers, and some of the fancier ones can make great dressers for a historical American Girl doll. If you don't like the handles, you can unscrew the old ones, and glue on a large, fancy bead or round button instead.
Small storage containers with drawers often look like modern dressers—except doll-sized. Most are about 6 to 8 inches tall, made out of plastic, and have 3 to 4 drawers.
If you are painting a mini dresser be sure to pull out all of the drawers before painting, and wait for all the paint to dry before you put your mini dresser back together.

, There are many ways you can add lights to your dollhouse:


Mini, battery-operated Christmas lights can be strung along a wall, over a window, or around a mirror. You can purchase them online or from an arts and crafts store. The battery pack can be hidden in a dresser or under a bed in the dollhouse.
Add a battery-operated cabinet light to the ceiling of your dollhouse. Many battery-operated cabinet lights are easy to install—you can also use double-sized foam mounting tape to secure a cabinet light to the ceiling of your dollhouse.Hanging chandelier lights for school lockers can be suspended from the ceiling of your dollhouse for an elegant look. They are battery operated and come in many different styles and colors. You can conceal the battery pack inside a dresser or under a bed in the dollhouse. They can be purchased from arts and crafts stores during certain times of the year, or they can be purchased at office supply stores.
Purchase decorative lights designed for 18 inch dolls. There are many companies that sell 18 inch dolls, and some of them also sell accessories and furniture for the dolls. Look at the companies' websites and see if you can find a doll-sized light.

, You can add some color to your dollhouse with some plants and flowers. Fake plants and flowers will last forever, but you can use real plants as well, so long as they are small enough to fit inside the dollhouse. Just make sure to water them!


Try cutting some small, fake flowers and putting them into a small bud vase.
You can create potted plants by filling a miniature pot with clay, plasticine, or craft foam, and sticking fake flowers into it.
If you wish to use real plants, try using some succulents. They are low maintenance and easy to take care of. They don't have to be watered that often, and are small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. They are the perfect size for a dollhouse!

, Many doll companies that sell 18 inch dolls also make accessories intended for these dolls. Browse the websites of some of your favorite 18 inch doll company and purchase some accessories to decorate your dollhouse with. Another thing to do is buy furniture from American Girl, Our Generation, and Journey Girls. You can also find lots of little accessories at your local craft store.

, You can make additional accessories, such as phones, computers, and food out of clay.

Fit the walls together.,
Add finishing details.,
Connect your chipboard.,
Enjoy your dollhouse!",How to Make a Doll House3," You'll need a couple of pieces of wood and some basic tools and supplies for this dollhouse (Barbie-sized, but easily customized). The tools are common ones that you will likely already have, but your local hardware store may do tool rentals if you don't. Just ask! The supplied you'll need are:


4 pieces of 1x8 lumber (at least 24"" long each), or an 8' long board if buying a single piece
4 pieces of 12""x12"" medium weight chipboard or similar material (you might need to go to an art store to find this)
A drill with a 1/4"" bit
A hand, table, or jigsaw to make basic cuts in the wood
1/4"" dowels (either a single stick or 8 single pieces)
Sandpaper
Wood glue
Paint and other materials to create the finished look

, There are four starting pieces pieces, though two will later be split and cut further. For now, cut all four to 24"" in length.

, Line up all four pieces and, using a measuring tape and pen, mark holes at 3"" and 6"" from both ends along the narrow 3/4"" strip of the sides (only one side will need the holes). Be very sure that all the holes line up with each other. Each piece of wood should then have four marks. Drill a hole in the center of the side at each of the marks you made, using a 1/4"" bit.

, Leaving two of the pieces at 24"", take the remaining to boards, cut them in half, and then trim an extra 3/8"" from the inside edges. You should now have two boards that are 24"" long and four boards that are 11 5/8"" long.

, Put some wood glue and a dowel in each of the holes on the 24"" pieces, one hole at a time. Let the glue set and dry and then glue the holes on one of the shorter pieces at a time. Fit the shorter pieces onto the dowels of the larger pieces, so that the trimmed edge is at the center of the larger piece. This should leave you with two final pieces of wood with a 3/4"" gap at the center of one half of each board and a total width of 14 and 1/2"". Sandpaper the edges smooth.

, These two pieces of wood fit together at these center gaps like a puzzle, the gap pointing up on one piece and down on the other. When together, they form the walls of four connected rooms. This means that you can take them apart whenever you need to and store the dollhouse away or take it with you when you travel.

, Paint or wallpaper the walls, cut doorways, or finish it in any other way you want to. Just remember to keep the directions of the wall straight and to not paint or glue anything in a way which permanently joins the two board together.

, The chipboard will make up the floor for the dollhouse, with each 12x12 square being one of the four rooms. Paint or otherwise finish one side of each of the 4 pieces to match what you want the four rooms to be (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, etc). When they are dry, arrange them into the order you want them (they must for a large square), then turn them over and tape them together on one side only.


This will allow you to fold up and store the entire dollhouse out of the way.

, Put the walls on the chip board floor and star filling the house with furniture. Your child can turn the house and enjoy each room individually, and the whole thing can be folded up and put away when it's time to clean up.

Enjoy!",How to Make a Doll House4," Find a wooden bookshelf with deep shelves. A shorter shelf, roughly 3 1/2' or 4' bookshelf is preferable. A larger shelf will need to be secured against a wall to be safe to play with.

, Adjust the shelves at the correct height to create ""rooms"" which are about 20"" tall. If you got a double-wide bookshelf at the suggested height, this should give your dollhouse 4 rooms.


If the shelves cannot be adjusted to the desired height, you can add extra peg holes for the correct height or brace the shelf at the desired height with L brackets.

, Use a jigsaw to cut windows from the back or sides of the bookshelf if you really want a window. Sand down any cut edges to avoid injuries for your child.

Beware the dangers of mold and mildew.,
Make sure that you keep your dollhouse in a location that is completely dry.

,

,
Realize the dangers of the sun.,
Avoid waiting until it's too late.,
Keep the dollhouse somewhere cool and away from bright sunlight so that you can keep it preserved in its original condition for as long as possible.

,
Beware that pets and small chewable items are pretty incompatible.,
Make sure that you keep your dollhouse furniture and other accessories stored high up above the ground so that your dog cannot get them.

,
If you have a cat, you might want to keep your dollhouse craft center in a room where you can close the door and keep them out.

,
Clean regularly.,
Give your dollhouse and furniture a wipe down with a dry or slightly damp cloth whenever you see dust accumulating.,
Avoid storing your dollhouse in hot areas.,
Beware of the cold, too.",How to Keep Your Dollhouse Furniture Safe," In a damp climate this dangerous duo can sweep in and cause damage to your beautiful miniature home, especially to the wallpaper and upholstery.;
,,, If your dollhouse has already suffered from mold you will be able to see it with the naked eye.


Depending on the type of mold, it may appear white and powdery or even black.

,, Another reason to keep your dollhouse away from the windows is because the strong sunshine can cause the paint colors to fade and can discolor the wood.

, You might not notice it at first, but after many years of sitting in the same spot you will see that the UV rays coming through the windows have caused damage to the dollhouse.


If the sunlight gets very hot it can loosen the glue or soften plastic items – causing further damage to the house.

,, Cats love to play with things and dogs will chew anything that they can get their teeth on which is why your pets can be another enemy of your dollhouse furniture collection.


If your furry friend gets a reproduction 17th century table in their mouth, it can be dangerous for them – because they can choke on the small pieces.
In addition, other crafting items such as paint and glue can be toxic for your pets.

,,, Of course, over time dust will build up on your dollhouse and the furniture within it so It is important to dust on a regular basis.


Dust buildup can actually damage your collection. Read this to find out how to get rid of dust.
Dust is made up of tiny particles of dirt and skin and when it rests on a surface it can cause a number of minuscule scratches that can cause damage over time.

,


Depending on the type of wood that used to build the dollhouse, you might want to consider using a specific type of cleaner to give it a polish.

, As mentioned in the section on sunshine, heat can be damaging to materials.

, As well as being vulnerable to excessive heat many dollhouse materials also become very brittle when they are subjected to cold temperatures.


This is especially true for plastic dollhouse furniture as it becomes very brittle when it is cold.

Remove the flaps from the top side of any grocery box. For a shoebox, simply remove the lid.;
, The inside paper must be blue, so that it looks like water. The outside of the pool can be any color you like., These measurements will determine the paper pieces that you'll cut., Glue each blue piece into place, taking care to match up the pieces evenly. This forms the water., Glue these to the outside of the box. There is no need to add paper underneath the box.

If you want to put in a little extra effort, cut the external pieces into squares and glue in place to look like tiles on the side of the pool.

It's time to play.",How to Make a Dollhouse from a Cardboard Box," You can use anything from a shoebox to a large moving box, depending on the size of the dolls and the space you have available for storing the box. The larger the box, the more work the house needs but the more options you'll have, so even for small dolls, a large box can provide hours of fun in designing, making and playing.


Choose a box that is clean. Avoid boxes which are dirty, have smudge marks, squashed insect stains or similar as such stains will disappoint any kid playing with it.
When choosing a box, try to imagine possibilities for its shape, flaps, lids, etc. This can help you in deciding which box will work best if you have to choose from several.;
, While an article can help guide how you construct this style of dollhouse, ultimately you will find the outcome works best when you work with the materials you have and the ideas that suit those who will be playing the dollhouse., The box can either be accessed from its open side, standing upright or it can be accessed looking down into it, as if it were a 3-D architectural model.

If making the house upright, choose how many stories the house will have. It doesn't need to have upstairs areas but it is a good idea to have more than one room, as it's just more fun and more realistic too. Larger boxes fairly much cry out for at least one upstairs room area.
When working out how to lay out the box, try placing it in different positions and angles until you can see its perspective the best. For example, a shoebox with a joined lid can work well on its side, using the pull-out lid as an additional room or area when opened; or it can work well from the top looking in, using the lid simply as the roof that is closed when not being played with.

, You can either use the flaps that aren't needed from the box, or cut out additional cardboard from another unwanted box. Or, use cardboard that comes from inside such items as calendars, sheets, etc.; these are often a good strength and shape for forming divider pieces.

If making a traditional two-story dollhouse, make the dividers into a simple cross shape that fits across both sides of the box exactly. This will make four rooms. If you want more rooms, simply slide in more dividers, making slits in the cardboard lengths that will slide over the already fitted divider pieces. If you want two rooms, one for each doll, simply add one flap across the exact middle of the box, dividing it in half. When it stands upright, the house has two floors, one for each doll.
If making a dollhouse that is looked down into, use thinner card and slide in as many rooms as you need. Think of it in the same way as looking at an architectural drawing on paper, and cut the dividers to make differently sized room shapes.

, Use a strong glue suitable for cardboard. This will prevent the cardboard from falling down once you start adding other things., Decide where you'd like windows. These can be cut out as simple holes, or you can draw on a cross design inside a square and only cut out the four squares, to leave the cross shape inside the square., It may be easiest to do away with doors and simply draw or paint a few on the outside of the house for effect. However, a door between the dividing rooms can be useful, so here is one suggested way to make a door:

Select the positioning for the door.
Draw a vertical rectangle shape where the door is to be.
Cut out the top and one side of the rectangle. Cut the base of the rectangle as well, leaving one long side uncut.
Pull the door open, creating a crease on the uncut side. You now have a door.
Draw a doorknob on it, or glue on a small lid from a tube or glue on a bead, for the door handle.

, These will be the areas that are covered by decorations, so they need to be done before adding fittings and furniture., You can do quite a few different things to the walls. Always measure and cut the materials to size before pasting on the walls. Here are some examples for you to choose from:


Use wallpaper offcuts to make wallpapered walls. You will need strong glue or wallpaper paste to stick it on the walls.
Make collages from magazines. Choose images that match the room, such as kitchen appliances for the kitchen, makeup and clothes for a bedroom and bathroom items for the bathroom.
Paint the walls. Use tempera, acrylic or poster paints to paint the walls. Try to vary the colors to suit the use of the room. You can also use a combination of paint and wallpaper, doing the upper or lower half the wall in wallpaper, then the upper or lower half in paint, and using craft sticks to create a wooden border between the two effects.

, The flooring can also be done in a variety of ways. Here are just a few suggestions:

Lay carpet. Use thin carpet samples from a carpet store (or ask them for some offcuts). Alternatively, simply use scrap fabric. Different materials in each room can be quite effective.
Paint the floors. Paint them to look like wooden or painted wooden floors.
Add rugs. Use scrap fabrics, doilies, handkerchiefs, etc., to make ""rugs"" for the floors.
Paint tiles on the floors. For the bottom level of the box, you could even glue on a mosaic from broken bits of tiles or beads, just for something different. However, the last option will be quite fiddly.

, Simply cut out two rectangles that measure a little more than half the window size, from scrap fabric. Hang one from one side of the window and the other from the other side. These can be left closed over the window or tied back with ribbon or yarn. Allow kids to have both choices, they'll work out what they prefer soon enough.

More complicated curtains can be made by pinning on a little wire and sewing the curtains to ride over the wire but unless you like fiddly sewing, this isn't really necessary, at least not for a cardboard dollhouse.

, Use drawing or painting to improve the outside of the house, as it's easiest and fastest. You can also glue things on, if wished. Some things you might like to paint on include:

A front door on the uncut broader side of the box. Add a welcome sign and a little bell.
Some pets running around the side of the house.
A garden at the base of the house edges, with some grass, flowers and shrubs. Trees can be added too, and perhaps some vines.
Occasional bricks can be painted around the corner edges, to give the impression that it's a brick house.
A mailbox could be added.
The name of the house could be hung from a little sign.
Window boxes with flowers could be painted under the windows. You could even make these using craft sticks and artificial flowers, glued underneath.

, As well as the wall coverings, some things to add that make it feel more like home include:

Portraits and paintings. These can be cut out of magazines, glued to cardboard and ""framed"" with matchsticks (cut the end of the matchstick off). Tape or glue on the wall.
A clock, or several clocks. Either draw one on paper or cut one out of a magazine, attach to cardboard, then glue on the wall.
Photos or other pictures.
Posters.

, This could be pre-made furniture that the dolls already have or you can make furniture from small boxes, grocery packaging, lids, etc. There are plenty of online instructions available for making simple recycled dollhouse furniture., Give the recipient the dollhouse, find the dolls, and let the fun begin.

Use a hobby kit. Some toy stores and doll stores might have kit beds you can put together following the instructions.
Simply pile soft items on the floor of the house you're making, so that it looks like a bed. Handkerchiefs, pieces of material and small blankets can work to make a simple bed.

, Many things can work or function as bedding. Such as plain or decorative pillow cases. The plain one can work as sheets. And the decorative one can work as a quilt. A small colorful washcloth and foam insert can work as a pillow. You can also use small things from other brands such as ""Barbie or ""Groovy Girls"" for pillows and blankets.

, Figure out if you want the top shelf or bottom shelf for her bed. When you decide, fold a towel to fit the shelf for a mattress. Then get a bandanna and set over the towel for a blanket. Last get some small pillows.


For the shelf you didn't use for her bed, make it into a storage place. Get a shoebox for her clothes trunk and put her clothes in there. For the rest decorate it the way your doll wants it.

Turn the box upside down.






Draw arches of the same size on each side of the box. Do not draw them to the edges though––stop them about 1inch or 2.5cm from each edge and the top of the box.






Cut out each arch. You should be left with four legs that use the box corners and the tabletop still intact.

Collect the following materials.,
Clean your casserole dish.,
Pour the fabric softener into the casserole dish.,

Soak your doll.,
Remove the doll.,

Ignore doll for twenty-four hours.,
Enjoy your doll!",How to Condition Your American Girl Doll's Hair," In order to effectively wash your American Girl doll’s hair, you will need the following supplies, all of which you should be able to locate within your house:


A large, shallow casserole dish.
Non-concentrated fabric softener (unscented, unless you are actively trying to disguise a bad smell in the doll’s hair.) If you are unable to find non-concentrated fabric softener, add water to dilute the concentration.
A book, or something to elevate your doll during the cleaning process.
A towel.
A ladle or measuring cup.
Masking tape.;
, Check to make sure no stray food or grease particles remain in the dish. These could get caught in the doll’s hair and make cleaning their mane even more difficult.

, You will want to fill the dish halfway. Any more than that will be overkill and anything less will be an insufficient amount to get the job done.


If you don't have access to fabric softener, you can also try using your preferred brand of conditioner. If you choose to use conditioner, condition the doll’s hair gently and rinse thoroughly.

, Detangle the hair as much as possible. Keep the clothing away from water, as moisture can permanently damage the fabric. Take the clothing and hair accessories and put them in a safe place, away from the washing site.

, If the masking tape gets wet at any point during the cleaning process, re-tape so the moisture stays out. Continue to re-tape during the process as needed.

, The only exposed parts of the doll should be her face and hair. Be aware that repeated exposure of your doll’s body to moisture may result in mold damage.

, You want the doll angled so she is lying next to the casserole dish, with her hair dangling into the bowl. Use your book or whatever you have chosen to help elevate your doll to position the doll more effectively.

, If any portion of the hair is not covered by the liquid, use your ladle or cup to pour additional fabric softener onto the hair so every strand is thoroughly coated.

, Using your fingers, detangle any stubborn knots. You’ll want to be gentle, as excessive pulling may only make the knots worse. Be patient and work slowly, adding more fabric softener as needed.

, Once all knots have been detangled, soak your doll in the fabric softener for an additional twenty minutes. This will give the softener ample time to condition the hair.

, Take the doll out of the casserole dish and transfer her to a sink. Gently rinse the solution out of the doll’s hair, making sure to keep the doll’s face and body dry.

, Once the doll’s hair has been thoroughly rinsed, dry the hair either by leaving the doll out overnight, or by placing the doll in front of a fan gently blowing cool air. Be careful not to set the doll down directly in front of the fan, as this can cause the hair to tangle.


When drying your American Girl doll’s hair, never apply heat through blow drying, curling or straightening. This will cause the hair fibers to dry, stiffen, frizz or melt. , Refrain from styling your doll’s hair during this time or using hair ties or ribbons directly following a wash. This can cause the doll’s hair to indent, curl or frizz.


While your doll is enjoying her spa day, treat yourself to your own! Take a hot bubble bath, paint your nails, braid your own hair. If you pamper yourself while your doll is being pampered, you'll both emerge refreshed and ready to play.

, Once the doll’s hair has been dry for twenty-four hours, feel free to dress her and play with her as much as you wish! Avoid taking her outside, if possible, as this only increases her chances of getting dirty.

, What are other people who already own the dolls suggesting? And how good of a rating do the dolls have?, In the store, you can see them in person to know for sure what they look like. Catalogs and websites are great, too., The books let you know about their personality, if that's important to you.

, Try playing with their hair and playing with them in general. See which dolls you are starting to like and which dolls you know you don't want.

, They have great videos on how to care for your dolls, which can influence your final decision.

, For example, the short hair may look cute, but you can't do many hairstyles. Long hair is fun, but it can be tough to take care of.

, List them alongside why you want them and what you would name them (if they don't have names or you don't like the ones they have).

, She's only here for one year and you might miss the opportunity to get that doll if you wait too long.
Do you want a doll that looks like you, just a pretty doll to add to your collection, or a doll that you can make up your own story for? If you say ""yes"" to any of these questions, a Truly Me doll might be the best choice.
Do you want a historical doll with which you can reenact stories and past events, and make up your own?

, Consider the following questions:


Do you really want this doll?
Do you have any other dolls similar to this one?
Is she a Girl of the Year and will you regret not getting her?
Is she probably going to be retired pretty soon? (You can figure this out by Googling when the doll was released. For example, Julie has only been out for nine years so they probably won't retire her soon, while Addy has been available since 1993, so she has a higher chance of being retired.)
What are her ratings and comments on Americangirl.com?


, After eliminating one, you're down to two or three and it's up to you to repeat these steps.

Wash the doll's hair.,
Brush the doll's hair.,
Determine where you'll cut.",How to Cut a Doll's Hair1," A doll's hair is much different than human or animal hair. They are usually made from a fiber commonly used in wigs, either Kanekalon or Saran fiber, and are prone to getting dirty. Washing your doll's hair will restore its shine and make it nice and smooth for cutting. Lie your doll in some sort of basin or bowl appropriate for the doll's size. Remove all of the doll's clothes to avoid getting them wet. Wet the hair and then apply a tiny dot of fabric softener. At this point you should try to detangle any knots in the hair using your fingers, and if needed a comb. After working in the fabric softener, let it sit for twenty-minutes. Rinse out the fabric softener and let it air dry. If you do not have fabric softener, you can use shampoo or common dish soap. Avoid any harsh chemicals.
Avoid using any sort of electric heat to dry the hair as this can be damaging.
You may use cold or warm water. However, avoid water too hot because it can damage the hair.;
, After the hair is dry, you'll want to get it as straight as possible. This will help so that you know exactly how long the hair is and have a better idea of where you want to cut. Start from the end of the hair and use short strokes with the brush to detangle the ends. Slowly move toward the scalp, replicating the downward brushing pattern until you have done the entire hair. If you brush upward, you'll leave heavy knots in the hair. Brushes and combs used for human hair may not be your best option. You can buy a special doll hair brush or use a brush especially designed for wigs found at any hair care store.

, Determine how long you want your doll's hair to be and how much you'll cut off. Take a small rubber band or hair tie and place it at the cut point, making sure it gathers all the hair. This will be where you make your cut.


If you want to take an inch off the doll's hair, you'll place the rubber band or hair tie an inch from the bottom of the hair.

Make the cut.,
Give it a summer cut.,
Cut bangs on your doll.,
Give your doll layers.",How to Cut a Doll's Hair2," Get a pair of scissors. It is best to use hairdressing scissors or thinning shears, but virtually any sharp scissor will work. Right above where you placed the rubber band or hair tie, make a cut. Any hair that was below where you marked off will be removed and the doll's hair will be that much shorter. Double check your cut and how much hair you want removed. Once you make the cut, there's no going back!

, You might want your doll's hair to be short in the summer much like people's. You can simply measure out a short hair cut for your doll, depending on how long you want it to be. It is best to cut long first and then slowly cut shorter since you cannot put hair back on.

, Section off the part of the hair that you want cut into bangs using a rubber band or hair tie. Comb the bang area forward and then slide the rubber band over the head. Apply warm water to the hair, such as water warmed up in the microwave in a tea cup. Make sure it's not too hot. Let it dry and then cut the bangs along the upper eye level.


It will appear shorter once you remove the rubber band, so make sure to cut it a little long at first. You can always touch up the bangs once the rubber band or hair tie is removed.

, Place the doll on its back, upside down so that the hair is against a flat surface. Separate out the top layer of their hair using a rubber band or hair tie. Then access the layers below and cut to shorter, varied lengths to give the doll's hair the impression of volume.

Learn a new a skill.",How to Cut a Doll's Hair3," If you or your loved one play with a doll often, hair can get damaged due to heat, wear and tear or a variety of other reasons. Rather than buying a new doll, you may just want to cut off the damaged portion.


If the hair is damaged too close to the doll's scalp, cutting may not be an option.You'll just want to wash the hair to see if you can salvage it rather than cutting the hair.

, Sometimes you can get tired of the same look but don't want to spend the money on a new doll. Dolls can hold a lot of sentimental value and cutting its hair can add a fresh new look to an old friend.Some examples of hairstyles that can be achieved through cutting include: time pieces (like a 1950's look), short summer looks, or really any customization you want. Once you decide on the lengths you'll need to achieve each look, you can place your rubber band or hair tie where you want trimmed.

, Whether you, or a son or daughter, have an interest in hair styling, a doll can be a great way to practice. Buy hair shears used by hair stylists and practice common hair styles on dolls. This is a great activity for kids who have an interest in creative hairstyles.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out a rectangular piece of cardboard.,
Pick out the color of your yarn and felt.,
Cut a piece of felt about 4 inches (10cm) wide and 2 inches (5cm) long.,
Start to wrap the yarn around the cardboard.,
Continue wrapping until you get the thickness you want.,
Sew the yarn to the felt by hand first.,
Cut the yarn along the opposite edge of the cardboard.,
Sew the yarn to the felt using a sewing machine.,
Center the seam or ""part"" of yarn hair down the middle of the doll's head and pin it securely.,
Unravel the hair if desired.",How to Make Doll Wigs1," For this project, you will need cardboard, yarn, felt, scissors, thread, a needle, and a sewing machine.;
, You want it to be 4-6 inches (15-20cm) long. To determine the height, figure out how long you want the hair to be. The height of the piece of cardboard should be equal to the desired length of hair.

, What color do you want the doll’s hair to be? The felt should match the yarn, so make sure that you will be able to find felt in the color you choose.


You can choose any weight of yarn that you want. A fine yarn is closest to the thickness of hair and will lay more naturally, but you will need more of it to complete the project. On the other hand, you could use a bulky yarn and simply unwind the strands once the hair piece is sewn into place. It's completely up to you.

, Measure it against the doll’s head to make sure that it will be long enough. It should be long enough to form the part down the middle of the doll’s head. Eventually, you’ll use this to hold the hair together. Set the piece aside for later.

, You should be wrapping the yarn around the side that matches the desired hair length. After about 5 rotations, slip the felt under the yarn. Try to wrap it evenly over one edge of the piece of cardboard.

, Just be careful that you don't make it so thin that you would be able to see through to the doll’s scalp. Ideally, you probably should wrap the yarn along the length of the cardboard until it is at least three strands deep. The end product will probably look about the way it does on the cardboard, so if it looks thin there, then add more yarn.

, Use a needle and thread to loosely stitch the yarn in place down the center of the felt. If you have lined it up correctly, the edge of the cardboard should provide you with a guide to follow down the center of the felt. This seam will be the part down the middle of the hair. When you're done, each piece of yarn should be lightly secured to the felt. Don’t worry about small, tight stitches, since the sewing machine will take care of that.

, Try to cut in a straight line so that the hair on each side will be of equal length. Set the cardboard to the side.

, Set the sewing machine to produce a tight and narrow zigzag stitch. This time, you want to make sure that the yarn is securely fastened to the felt and will not fall out easily. Sew down the center of the felt, following the line of stitches that you sewed by hand. Don't backstitch when you get to the end--just sew off the edge of the felt and knot the ends of the threads., Use a needle and thread to stitch the hair into place. You can follow the line of the seam that you made with the sewing machine. But if the doll will be a child’s toy, make sure that you sew the felt securely. To that end, you can also do two seams, one down each side of the felt beneath the yarn hair.To adapt this process for a boy doll, simply make several wefts using shorter yarn. Attach them to the doll’s head in horizontal rows, beginning in the front and adding more close together until you reach the nape of the neck.If desired, you can lay the hair flat and glue it to the head of the doll. Or you might consider doing this with a few strands in the front, so that the doll has a fixed hairline. Just use a white craft glue that will be flexible when dry.

, If you like the chunky yarn hair look, you can leave it as it is. Otherwise, most yarn is easy to unwind. Just pick apart each strand and brush it out with a fine-toothed comb.

Consider what method you should use to detangle and/or clean the doll hair.",How to Clean and Brush a Designafriend's Hair1," As DAF (Design a Friend) doll hair is made of synthetic nylon, like many other dolls, it should not be washed with soap.


Is the doll hair simply knotted? If so, brush your doll's hair.
Is your dolls hair difficult to brush, matted and greasy? Then it's time for a full hair wash and brush.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out two equal-sized squares of plastic wrap and fabric.,
Center the doll's head in the middle of the plastic wrap.,
Place the fabric over top of the plastic wrap.,
Douse the fabric with white craft glue.,
Add another layer of craft glue.,
Repeat the process until the cap is smooth to the touch.,
Cut the rubber band and slide the fabric off the doll’s head.,
Turn the cap inside out.,
Trim off the excess fabric.,
Fit the cap onto the doll’s head.,
Trim the edges of the cap.,
Cut your wefts of hair into sections for the cap.,
Use hot glue to attach premade wefts of hair to the cap.,
Let the glue dry.,
Enjoy!",How to Make Doll Wigs2," For this project, you will need plastic wrap, a piece of sturdy fabric, white craft glue (Tacky glue or even Mod Podge might work), two rubber bands, hair wefts, and a hot glue gun. You'll be making a removable wig for your doll, rather than attaching the hair to the doll's head.

, The squares should be large enough to completely cover the doll’s head with a little extra to spare. Any fabric works, although you might want something on the thicker side., Wrap the plastic down around the doll's head, keeping it as smooth and flat as possible at the top. Fix it securely in place using a rubber band. The plastic wrap will protect the doll's head while you mold the wig cap to fit its size and shape.

, Wrap it over the doll's head just as you did with the plastic wrap. Use a second rubber band to secure it in place. As much as you can, try to smooth out the fabric at the crown of the head and along where the front hairline will be. It’s okay if some of it gathers in the back, since this area shouldn't be visible in the finished product.

, Smear it thickly over the area above the rubber band. Make sure that it’s thoroughly coated and try to rub it into the fabric until it is saturated. Leave the fabric to dry for several hours.


The glue will ultimately give a specific shape to the fabric, since it dries in the shape of the doll's head. It also provides some stiffness, to secure the cap in place when you're done.

, Again, smear it on thickly and make sure that you completely cover the doll's head.

, It should be thick enough that it will hold its shape even when it is removed. However, it should also be flexible enough that you can remove it from the doll's head or securely slip it back on as needed.

, The fabric should come off easily, and the glue should not crack or break. If it does, you may not have used a sufficiently flexible glue and you might need to repeat the previous step. You can remove the plastic wrap at this point and discard it.

, The side that is covered in the smooth layer of glue will be the interior of the wig cap, while the fabric will be the exterior side to which you will attach the wig hair.


At this point, you should have something that looks almost like a shuttlecock from a game of badminton. One end will be rounded and stiff, approximating the shape of the doll's head, while the excess fabric will trail out around it.

, You don’t have to get the cap perfect at this point. Just use scissors to cut off the part that doesn’t have any glue on it. You can discard the excess fabric.


The cap should look roughly like a snug-fitting sock that is molded to the shape of the doll's head.

, It should fit securely. If it is too loose, you may need to start over again, this time ensuring that the fabric is stretched as tightly as possible over the doll's head.

, If the wig cap is too large or the edges are uneven, use a pencil or marker to draw a line along where the edge should be. The cap should end a little above where you want the hairline to fall. Remove the cap and use your scissors (or an Exacto knife) to trim along the line.

, A weft is made from hair that has been woven or sewn to hold it together. Wefts usually look like hair extensions: wide, thin sections of hair, rather than large chunks. You can purchase them from some craft or hobby stores, and also from online specialty stores. The weft sections that you cut should be long enough to loop over or behind the doll's head from one ear to the other., Line the first section up along the front of the cap, so that it runs parallel to the hairline and ends on each side just above where the doll's ears are. Glue the seam line of the weft onto the cap. Line the next section of hair up next to or within less than 0.2 inches of the first section, and glue it into place. Repeat the process down the back of the head until the wig is completely covered.


Don't worry too much if the ends of the wefts look a bit unfinished. You can arrange the hair so that it falls over the ends to conceal them.

, You may need to trim the hair so that it comes to an equal length, unless you like the layered look. You should be able to part the hair down the middle or brush it back as desired. You can also trim the front row of hair so that your doll has bangs.

, You should now have a wig for your doll that looks like a miniature of a wig that a human would wear. The best part is that these wigs aren't secured to the doll, so they're interchangeable. Make a couple of these if you want to change up the doll's style or give it a new hairdo.

Leave your doll in direct sunlight.,
Clean the area.",How to Remove Ink from an American Girl Doll's Face1," This is the active ingredient in most acne creams or scrubs. Head to your local grocery store or pharmacy and check the labels of a few different products. You want to find a cream that has at least 10% benzoyl peroxide. If you use acne spot treatments at home, you may already have an effective stain treatment in your bathroom., You can use a cotton swap or a toothpick to do this, or simply use your finger if the stain is a bit larger. Cover the entire stain thoroughly with the acne cream., If you leave the medication unexposed, it will quickly dry out. To get the best effect, you want to let the treatment really soak into the stain without drying. Use Saran wrap to cover the stained area, making sure that the cream stays put directly on top of the stain., Cover the doll’s hair with a towel or piece of clothing to protect it from the sun’s UV rays. This can cause unnecessary drying and damage to the doll’s delicate hair. Also cover her body and any areas that aren’t being cleaned for the same reason. Take special care to protect the doll’s eyes, nose, and mouth, if possible., You can also leave your doll under a UV lamp, if you have one. The benzoyl peroxide has a bleaching effect when exposed to direct sunlight. While that would be unpleasant for human skin, this is exactly what you want for your dolls. This will not stain the “skin” of the doll, but will bleach the stain out. It doesn’t matter if your American Girl is fair or African American– it has no adverse effect on their skin.Don’t leave your dolls in the sun when it’s extremely hot. Their vinyl skin can soften, and actually become deformed.
Remove your dolls from the sun every two hours or so to prevent damage and apply more cream, if necessary. Let their skin cool before putting them back out into the sunlight.

, After your doll has been in the sunlight for a while, take a damp cotton swab or tissue and clean the stained area. The stain should be gone, or lightened. If necessary, repeat all of these steps again to continue lightening the stain until it is completely gone. The darker and larger the stain, the longer this process may take.Some stains may take a couple of weeks to fully work out. Be patient, and keep repeating the process until you are satisfied with your result.

Then, add a few droplets of lukewarm water until you’ve formed a paste.This won’t take much, so don’t put the cup or bowl under running water. You can stir the small mixture with a small spoon, some sort of stirring rod, or a toothbrush you can use to apply the paste.

, Using a clean toothbrush, cotton swab, or small towel, gently start working the paste into the stained area.Depending on the type of ink on the doll’s face, you should see the stain start lightening immediately. If the stain is particularly dark or large, this might take a few applications of paste.


Tie their hair out of the way before you apply paste to their face.
Be careful not to get water in your doll’s eyes, which can cause rusting.

, Take a damp rag or cotton swab and remove the paste from your doll’s face. Evaluate the results. You may need to create more paste and try again. If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to try cleaning the stain with a benzoyl peroxide cream.

Take care to protect the doll's hair, eyes, and cloth body before cleaning. Dampen the cloth, and scrub with pressure on the stain. Do this for awhile, continuously checking the stain. Hopefully, the stain will begin to fade as you do this. Again, this works best for faint ink stains., Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball or a paper towel. Like with other techniques, make sure the doll's hair is out of the way before you apply the rubbing alcohol to the face. Scrub the stained area thoroughly. After a bit of rubbing, check to see if the stain is fading. You may need to remoisten the cotton ball or paper towel with more rubbing alcohol, and keep going until the ink has faded completely., You can find this in the cleaning supply aisle of most grocery stores. Because the Magic Eraser is pretty large and you'll most likely be cleaning a small area of your doll's face, feel free to cut it into a smaller pieces. Put water on the Magic Eraser, and start scrubbing the stain. After you scrub for a bit, use a dry towel to dry the surface., If nothing you try at home works, you may need to send your doll to the American Girl Doll Hospital.

, Clean water is all you need, so fill up your spray bottle at the sink. You will use it to dampen the doll’s hair before you detangle it., Before you fix your doll’s hair, tie a bandana, washcloth, or handkerchief around her eyes. This will keep them dry and safe from damage. You can also ask a friend to hold a hand over the doll’s face while you spray her hair with water.

, To avoid damaging your doll’s head or hair, you want to hold her steady. You can hold her between your legs or have a friend or parent hold her tightly., It is easiest if you start with a section closest to the doll’s face. Separate the strand from the rest of her hair with your fingers, and then grab the strand about 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the bottom of the hair.

, Use your spray bottle to spritz the strand of hair. Spray it 3-4 times, until the hair is damp but not soaked. Be sure not to spray water directly into the doll’s face or eyes. Water can cause her eyeballs to rust!, Using your pick, gently comb out any tangles from the strand of hair. Start near the bottom, combing down toward the bottom of the hair. Then, once the bottom section of the strand is tangle-free, begin combing sections further up the strand near the doll’s head. Be careful not to pull too hard, or you could loosen the doll’s head.If possible, have someone hold the neck of the doll to stabilize it.

, Once you have finished detangling one strand of hair, grab the next section. Beginning at the bottom of the strand, use your pick to remove any tangles. Do this with all sections of the hair until you have completed the doll’s whole head.

, Once you’re done, simply let your doll sit and relax while her hair dries. Be sure not to use a hairdryer, since they can damage or melt your doll’s hair! Once her hair is dry, you are free to style it or go back to playing with her as usual."

Repeat these steps for each section of hair.",How to Care for Curly American Girl Doll Hair2," Your doll’s curls should be separated into individual strands, so you can grab each curl individually. If the curls aren’t clearly separated, grab a small section of hair near the doll’s face. 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair is perfect.

, Spray enough water so that the strand is wet, but not dripping. If your doll’s eyes aren’t covered, make sure that you don’t spray water into her eyes., First, look at the direction that the curl is going. Then, wrap the curl around your finger, a pencil, or a paintbrush in the same direction that the curl is already going. Hold it for 5-10 seconds, and then slide the object gently out of the curl.Pencils and paintbrushes work best for dolls with very curly hair. For hair that is slightly curly, your finger will work just fine.

, Move around the doll’s head, grabbing one curl at a time. For each curl, repeat the steps above. Once you have reached the other side of your doll’s head, her curls should be smooth and beautiful!

If it's a popular brand, you may be able to find manufacturer's instructions online.;
, Most plush toys can be safely washed in the washing machine, particularly cotton and polyester blends. Wash them with your regular clothing on a gentle cycle. Alternatively, you can also do a load of just plush toys.If the toy is very dirty or soiled, sprinkle some baking soda on it before putting in the machine.

Sanitize toys with a bleach solution.,
Allow toys to air dry in a dish rack.",How to Clean Baby Toys2," Unless the toy has batteries or instructions specify that they are not dishwasher safe, running small plastic toys through the dishwasher will remove dirt and disinfect them. Place on the top rack of the dishwasher. Afterward, allow the toys to air dry on a dish rack.Check the tag to verify that the toy is dishwasher safe. If you can't find any information, you can assume that it is dishwasher safe. Most small plastic toys without batteries are dishwasher safe.
If the toy is a bath toy, like a rubber duck, be sure to empty it of dirty bathwater prior to placing it in the dishwasher.
Small plastic toys can also be hand washed in the same way that metal, electronic and large plastic toys are. However, using the dishwasher is easier and generally more consistent.

, Toys that cannot go in the dishwasher should be washed by hand. Apply warm soapy water to a rag or sponge and rub the toys down. Be careful to remove all visible stains and dirt.If the toys are very greasy or grimy, add vinegar and baking soda to the water.
When hand washing toys with batteries, make sure to remove the batteries prior to washing them. Do not submerge them in water or wash the inside of the toy. Scrub the outside with your soapy sponge.

In the process, they could have spread illnesses from their house. Clean up immediately after a play date., Even if nothing in particular has prompted you to clean your baby’s toys, you need to clean at regular intervals. Planning for a monthly cleaning is a good rule of thumb., It can be easy to forget about big toys, like dollhouses, but these need regular cleanings too. Clean the surface and insides of larger toys.

They are usually pale, but not always., If it is too hot for that, apply tinted moisturizer and concealer. The dolls come shiny or matte, depending on whether or not they are customized.

, Get it trimmed every 2 months or more. Get one haircut and stick with it for a while. You can make little changes, like adding some long layers, or choppier bangs, or side bangs instead of blunt bangs, but nothing to major until summer vacation or another long time off.

Some dolls may just need their hair combed or brushed, while others need their hair washed. Some doll hair may need to be trimmed to hide frizzy or matted ends. This section will help you determine what the problem is and how to go about fixing it.;
, A simple brushing can get rid of tangles and help a doll's hair look nicer. Work in small sections, and start from the ends first. Do not brush from the roots down, as this can strain and damage the hair fibers. Use a wide-toothed metal comb or a wig brush with metal bristles. Avoid plastic combs or brushes (including metal brushes with plastic points), as the plastic will create static and cause flyaways.








If your doll has curly hair, then brush each curl individually, and gently wrap the curl around your finger.
Do not use a brush that you use for your hair. Brushes collect a lot of natural oils from hair, and these oils may damage doll hair.
If your doll has yarn hair, then brush it gently with a wide-toothed comb, or with your fingers.

, If the doll hair is mostly nice, but the ends are matted and frizzy, consider trimming the ends off with a pair of sharp scissors. Keep in mind, however, that this change will be permanent. Doll hair does not grow back.








, Doll hair can be dampened and then wrapped around straws or hair curlers (depending on the doll's size). This method can be used to restore a doll's curly hairstyle, or it can be used to help conceal matted, frizzy ends. To learn how to curl your doll's hair, refer to the section in this article on curling your doll's hair.

, Sometimes, a doll's hair is just dirty, and can benefit from a gentle wash. You can also wash a doll's hair to soften the fibers and help manage tangles. To learn how to wash your doll's hair, refer to the sections in this article on washing synthetic hair and washing natural hair (real hair and mohair).

, Before you decide to wash your doll's hair, you will have to determine what it is made out of. Some doll hair can be easily washed, while others can be ruined by washing. Similarly, some dolls can safely come in contact with water, while others can be ruined if they come in contact with water. Here are the doll and doll hair types can and cannot be washed:


Dolls made out of synthetic material, such as plastic and vinyl can safely come in contact with water. Most modern dolls bought from the toy store are made out of synthetic materials.
Dolls made out of wood or porcelain will need extra caution when getting their hair cleaned. Any moisture that touches the doll's head may cause rot or mildew to form, ruining the doll.
Doll hair made out of real hair and mohair can be washed with caution: most dolls with this type of hair have wigs that are glued onto their heads (as opposed to being rooted).
Doll hair made out of synthetic material can be safely washed. Most modern dolls from the toy store have hair made from synthetic materials.
Doll hair made out of wool cannot be washed as water will ruin it. Consider cleaning the hair by brushing cornstarch or talcum powder onto it instead, and then brushing it off again.Doll hair made out of yarn can be washed with caution: most dolls with yarn hair are made of fabric, and may begin to rot or form mildew if they get wet. If you must wash yarn hair, then wash it like you would synthetic doll hair, but with fabric softener or laundry detergent intended for hand-washing.

, You can use any container as long as it is large enough to fit the doll's hair without causing it to scrunch up.

, Put a small amount of dish soap into the water and swish it around to help mix it.You can also use a wig shampoo, which you can find at beauty salons and wig supply shops. Avoid using ordinary shampoo, as it can cause the doll hair to become poofy. 








If you must use regular shampoo because you do not have any dish soap or wig shampoo, then use a mild shampoo, such as one used for children or infants.

, Using a brush with metal bristles or a wide-toothed comb, gently brush the doll's hair out. Start brushing from the ends first, and then work your way up towards the roots.









Do not brush your doll's hair starting from the roots. This is damages the fibers and causes them to wrinkle, frizz, and tangle.

, While water will not ruin the paint on a doll's face, it may cause moveable eyes to develop rust or mildew. If your doll has blinking eyes that close when you lay her down, consider taping some cotton balls over them. This is so that the eyes don't get wet and rust when you wash the doll's hair.







, Turn the doll upside down and place the hair into the water. Avoid getting the roots of the hair wet.








, Run your fingers through the doll's hair, massaging and lathering it. If the doll's hair is especially dirty or dry, then you can consider letting the doll's hair to soak in the water for 10 to 15 minutes.







, You can rinse the doll's hair by placing it beneath a faucet and running clean, cool water over it. Do this until the water runs clear, and avoid getting the doll's head wet.








, Washing the doll's hair may have caused it to become tangled. You can detangle it by applying a gentle conditioner to the hair and working it through the fibers until they are smooth and no longer tangled. Be sure to rinse the doll's hair under cool, running water until the water runs clear.









You can also use fabric softener instead., If you wish to add curls into the doll hair, do so now. Doll hair styles easiest when it is damp or wet. Use hair rollers if it is a large doll, or straws if it is a smaller doll. Never use a curling iron or hair straightener, or you will risk melting the hair.








, Once you have finished washing the doll's hair, lay the doll down onto a towel, and spread the hair out around her. You can also press another towel on top of the hair to soak up any remaining moisture.









If there are any fibers still sticking up, you can gently run a wide-toothed comb through the hair.

, Once the doll hair has dried, you can consider running a wide toothed comb or a metal brush through it. If you curled the doll's hair, take out the hair curlers. If you want ringlets, leave the curls as they are; for fluffier curls, gently pull the curls apart with your fingers.









If you taped cotton balls to the doll's eyes to protect them, you can remove them now.

, Many dolls with real hair or mohair have wigs instead of rooted hair. The dolls are usually made out of porcelain and should not get wet. To avoid getting your doll wet when washing her hair, you will need to remove the wig from her scalp. Gently pry the wig loose, starting from the edges. If you cannot remove the doll wig, or if it starts to tear, then leave the wig on the doll and proceed with caution.

, Start by loosening any tight snarls with the tail end of a comb, then switch to a brush. Gently brush the doll's hair in small sections, starting from the ends and moving upwards towards the wig base.








, You can use a sink, a small plastic bin, or even a bowl—so long as it is large enough to fit the entire doll wig, without scrunching up the fibers. Add a few drops of mild shampoo and gently swish the water around to mix it.








, Let the wig sit in the shampoo water for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure that the wig is completely submerged. Do not massage the fibers, as this will ruin them., After the wig has soaked for 10 to 15 minutes, take it out of the water and run clean water over it to get the soapy water out. Do this until the water runs clear.








, Soaking your doll wig in a solution of cool water and a few drops of vinegar can help make the doll hair appear shiny. To do this, fill a new container with clean, cool water, and add a few drops of vinegar into it. Then, place the wig into the water for about 5 minutes.









The vinegar smell will disappear once the hair dries.

, Once you have finished washing the hair, hold the wig up by the base and let the water drip out of it, then place it on a towel. Spread the doll hair out in a fan shape. This will ensure that all of the fibers dry evenly.








, You can help the doll hair dry faster by placing another towel over the wig and pressing down on it, soaking up as much water as you can.








, Once you have removed as much moisture as you can, take the wig out of the damp towels and place it onto a fresh, dry towel. Once again, spread the fibers into a fan shape, and let the wig sit undisturbed until it dries.

, Once the wig has dried, place it onto the doll's head to make sure that it still fits. If the wig fits properly, you can glue it back onto the doll's head. Apply some craft glue to the doll's head using a paintbrush, and slide the wig on.If the wig doesn't fit anymore, you will need to stretch it or tighten it until it fits. You can tighten a wig by running thread through the hem and pulling it until the wig fits. You can loosen a wig by cutting a few threads loose in the hem., If you wish add curls to the wig, then you can mist the hair with some water, and curl the hair. You can use hair rollers, straws, pens, pencils, or dowels to form the curls. You can also use a curling iron set to the lowest setting, but do so with caution, as heat can damage the fibers.

, Most doll hair can be curled while it is still wet, even if it came straight originally. Curls can be great at concealing frizzy ends. This method works great for synthetic hair, real hair, and mohair. It will not work on wool hair or yarn.


Keep in mind that if your doll's hair came straight, the curls you add may loosen over time.
Never use a curling iron on synthetic doll hair. You may consider using a curling iron on real hair, but do so with extreme caution, and use the lowest setting. Heat can still damage real hair.If your doll is large, you can use small hair rollers like you would on your own hair. For most dolls, however, you will have to make your own curlers.

, You are looking for thin, cylindrical objects, such as straws, pencils, pens, or dowels. Remember, the shorter the object is, the easier it will be to work with.


The thinner your object is, the tighter the curl will be.

, Take a small segment of doll hair and start wrapping it around your curler. Start with the ends of the doll hair and roll upward.









If you are curling a larger doll's hair (such as an 18 inch doll), work in segments that are about an inch wide.
If you are curling a smaller doll's hair (such as a fashion doll), work in segments that are a centimeter wide, or smaller.

, You will need to secure your roller so that it does not fall off. Depending on what you have used for your curler, there are different ways to secure it:









If you used a straw, you can fold the straw in half over the hair, and tie it with a small rubber band. You can also secure the hair with a bobby pin by slipping the pin over the hair; the bottom of the bobby pin will go into the straw and the top of the pin will hold the hair down.
If you used a pen, pencil, or dowel, then you can take a small rubber band and wrap it around the hair that is on the roller.

, Once you have secured your first roller, move onto the next segment of hair and repeat the process: wrap the hair around the curler, roll upwards towards the scalp, and secure it.








, You will need to let the doll sit with her hair in curlers until the hair dries. Do not attempt to speed up the process with a hair drier, as heat can damage doll hair.


If your doll has real hair, you can consider using a hair drier, but do so with extreme caution, and use the lowest setting.

, Once the hair has dried, gently take out the curlers. Remove all of the bobby pins and rubber bands, gently unroll the hair, and pull the curler out.









For ringlets, leave the hair as it is.
For fluffier curls, gently pull the curls out with your fingers until you get the desired look.

Check for other indicators.",How to Identify Sindy Dolls," This makes it harder to identify all Sindy dolls with absolute accuracy and you may need to take your doll to a collector with good knowledge for certainty.;
, There are things that you should be able to spot for each doll era:


1963-64 doll: ""Made in England"" is on her neck, 29 centimeter (11.4 in) in height, soft head, rigid body without marks, hollow and hard legs; hair colour is blonde, brunette and auburn and it has a fringe (bangs) and looks like a messy bob.
1965 doll: ""Made in England"" is on her head, head and arms are soft, vinyl legs which bend a little, rigid body and same hair colours as previous doll.
1966 doll: No marks on head or neck, ""Made in Hong Kong"" on her waist, head now made from heavier vinyl, rigid body, heavy legs that can bend; same hair colours but thicker.

1970: Hair length still shoulder but part is now down the middle. Has features of previous doll but some may also have numerical markings.
1971 (Trendy girl): This one seems to be the most popular with collectors. The head can be moved to any angle (and comes off), the hair remains centre parted and she has rooted eyelashes. She now has a range of blonde colours for hair as well as brunette and auburn. Numerical and letter markings are now commonplace.
1971 (Lovely Lively Sindy): Every part of the doll can be moved and posed. Same hair colour range as the previous dolls and has ""Made in Hong Kong"" and numerical and letter markings.
1975: Gayle was developed for the US market, a black Sindy.
From the late 70s, Marx Toys manufactured Sindy dolls in the USA but was withdrawn by 1980.
1986: Magic Moments Sindy has hair and a swimming costume that changes colour in water.
Hasbro manufactured Sindy in the 1980s before Pedigree took back the doll in the late 90s.
Vivid Imaginations has manufactured recent versions of Sindy dolls, under licence from Pedigree.
2003: A 40th anniversary Sindy was released and since this time Sindy dolls have lost their large breasts and long legs and now look like 12-15 year olds and dress in teen clothing; the aim has been to make Sindy appear more innocent than the competing Barbies and Bratz dolls.

, It's very hard to simply read text when it comes to judging a doll. You should also use images to help you reach a decision. A good comparison is to check your doll against images uploaded (see Google Images for example) or to check out existing and past auctions of Sindy dolls that show photos.

, The outfits help to date and identify the Sindy doll. However, for dolls that have been played with, the outfits may not be the original ones or pieces may be missing, so be very careful here. It's a good idea to study a Sindy resource site with images very carefully before presuming anything!

, A Sindy in a box or on a Sindy stand may aid in identification.

Learn what interests and attracts children of different age.,
Determine what age group you're choosing toys for.

,
Research what kinds of toys are suitable for the appropriate age group.,
Choose toys for children that will entertain them without posing a health hazard.,
Give the toys to your children enthusiastically.",How to Choose Toys for Children,"


Infants and toddlers are constantly learning about the world around them by means of their senses. That's why they like toys that they can touch, squeeze, poke, smell, see and hear. They find bright colors and fun noises entertaining. In addition, toddlers enjoy toys that can be opened, pulled, pushed, stacked or poured.
Preschool children have a lot of energy and use their playtime to learn new skills. They enjoy painting, drawing and making things. They also like to use their imagination to play dress-up, make up stories, or pretend with their toys.
Older children like more realistic toys that are recognizable from the ""real world."" Think of children's jewelry or fashion, TV or movie-related products, or music. Sports also become very important at this age and many children will focus on a game or favorite physical activity.;
,,


For babies up to 1 year old, choose brightly colored objects; mobiles with attached objects that can be hung so the baby can see but not touch them; unbreakable toys, preferably ones that make a squeaking or rattling noise; washable toys and dolls with embroidered eyes so the child can't swallow any loose parts; or stacking ring cones. Avoid toys with small parts especially detachable small parts or glass or button eyes; sharp edges; toxic paint or other materials; toys with long chords; push and pull toys; and balloons.
For children between 1 and 2 years old, choose brightly illustrated books made of cloth or stiff, pasteboard pages; mirrors not made of glass; toys they can take apart into large pieces; building blocks made of cardboard, plastic, or foam; floating toys for in the bathtub; pounding and stacking toys, or musical toys. You should avoid small toys and toys with small parts that can be swallowed, toys with sharp edges, and balloons.
If the children are 2 or 3 years of age, select creative toys like play dough; sandbox toys; large crayons; pegboards with big pieces; brightly colored books with music; children's simple musical instruments; sturdy cars or wagons they can climb onto, ride, or push; low rocking horses; soft foam balls; or simple dress up items. Avoid electrical or lead toys; tricycles that are higher than 12 inches (30.5 cm); small objects such as marbles, beads, or coins; sharp- edged toys or toys with small parts that can be removed; and balloons.
For 3- and 4-year-olds, select dolls with clothes that aren't difficult to put on or remove, non-electrical trucks, tractors or trains; balls; building blocks and interlocking plastic blocks; and creative toys such as play dough, blunt scissors, large non-toxic markers and crayons, and sewing cards. You can also choose ""pretend"" toys such as toy telephones, sturdy play dishes, and dress-up clothes; books; puzzles; or simple board games. Don't choose electrical or lead toys, flammable costumes, or toys with small, removable parts or sharp edges.
4 to 5 year-old children enjoy playing with building blocks; modeling clay; finger paints; simple construction sets; battery operated toys; puppets; stencils; card and board games; simple children's musical instruments; books; 9-24 piece jigsaw puzzles; children's bicycles with 20-inch wheels as well as training wheels; and small sports equipment. Avoid electrical toys unless they run on batteries; toxic, oil-based, or flammable materials; kites made of aluminized polyester film; sharp-tipped shooting toys or darts; and fireworks.
For children between 5 and 8 years old, choose roller skates, sleds, and bicycles with 24-inch wheels; jigsaw puzzles, games, and dominoes; kites; uncomplicated tool sets; magnifiers and magnets; battery powered electrical toys; dolls; children's cameras; printing sets, as well as stamp sets; painting and drawing utensils; or sewing materials. Avoid kites made of aluminized polyester film; fireworks; non-battery operated electrical toys; shooting toys and cap guns; and sharp-edged tools.
For children between 8 and 12 years old, select arts and crafts materials and hobby materials; construction sets; electrical trains; models they can build themselves; 26-inch wheel bicycles; musical instruments; or sports equipment. Avoid fireworks; air rifles; chemistry sets; and darts and arrows.

, Try to coordinate the toys with your child's interests. For example, if she loves horses, you can give her a toy horse to play with, and later, when she's ready for her first riding lesson, you can give her a riding cap, crop and boots.

, Sit down with your child so you can play with her new toy together. This will teach your child that her toy and her world is interesting.

Practice in a room with little air flow.,
Work on keeping the smoke in your mouth.,
Exhale slowly.,
Choose your smoking device wisely.",How to Do Smoke Tricks1," Windy days will make it impossible for even the best smoke tricksters to conjure up a trick. You want as little outside wind as possible, so stay away from fans, close the windows, and choose a still, quiet room.





;
, The smoke will start to dissipate in your lungs, making it thinner and weaker. Take short breaths in, puffing your cheeks out slightly, and work on keeping the smoke in your mouth. Think of taking 3-4 partial inhales instead of one big, long drag on your hookah or cigarette.








You should feel the smoke towards your throat, especially if you take several quick breaths.

, A long, slow exhalation keeps the smoke packed together, helping it appear as a thicker, more coherent cloud. Work on exhaling in a controlled, stream, almost letting the smoke eek out of you instead of forcing it.







, Rolled smoking devices, like joints, cigarettes, and blunts have thick smoke because the paper is burning along with the contents. E-pens, with their high vapor content, are also good to smoke for tricks. But the easiest way to do tricks is with a hookah because the glycerin in shisha is vital to thick plumes of smoke.








Water bongs and pipes are usually the hardest to use for smoke tricks.

Plan the event.,
Plant the seed.,
Enact a sudden death.,
Prepare your appearance as being injured.,
”Die” from an injury.",How to Fake Death1," Decide how you want to fake it. Map out the event on paper to better flush out your ideas for the prank. Plan to “die” in front of people you know can handle it. Gather any supplies like fake blood or a trick dagger from a local costume shop.


”Dying” in front of someone will take a lot of convincing and dedication from you. Be prepared to go the extra mile in selling your “death"" to your peers.
Try to decide a good location to “die.” You probably don’t want to be somewhere too public or else a bystander could call an ambulance.Night is a good time because there won’t be as much light on the scene.;
, Pick out one or a group of your friends to witness your faux death. Begin telling them clues that you aren’t doing so well. Decide if you want to “die” from an injury or disease. If you’re are planning a disease induced “death,” tell them about your failing health. Be dramatic to the point of them believing you.


Choose symptoms like headache, nausea, jittering limbs, or fainting.
If you are planning to “die” from an injury, make up a person who is angry with you. Build up a story about how someone shady is anxious for you to pay them.

, Pretend to be in extreme, sudden pain. Fall to the ground holding your side. Place an open packet of ketchup in your mouth so that once you hit the floor it looks like blood is oozing out of your mouth.Make yourself as limp as possible after having a brief convulsion. Control your breathing. Don't let them see your chest rise and fall.


Having too much of a spasm can give away your act.
Do everything in subtlety when it comes to tricking your friends or the camera.Lay there until people start to get scared. Never let a “trick” get taken out of context. Come forward if the audience becomes too distraught.

, You can do this in several different scenarios and most of which can happen out of sight from your audience. You could have gotten into a car accident or been severely beaten while being mugged. Roughen up some of your clothes to appear as though you were severely injured. Add blood smears and tears to parts of your outfit.


Apply charcoal to parts of your face to look like you’ve been beaten up.Break an old pair of glasses for an added effect.

, It’s best to have a set time of meeting and show up late for dramatic effect. Make sure your audience is in the location you planned them to be at. Wear the clothes and makeup from your “injury.” Limp onto the scene and begin to mutter audibly what happened like, “a . . . a . . . car crash” or “he sa. . .sa. . . said give me the ma. . .money.”


Collapse just before you reach your audience. As mentioned earlier, have an opened packet of ketchup in your mouth for when you fall. Once you hit the ground, bite down on the ketchup and allow it to ooze out of your mouth.Once they start shaking you, asking you if you are alright, say, “gotcha!”

Take a drag, keeping the smoke in your mouth.,
Open your mouth and exhale slowly.,
Quickly inhale the smoke back into your mouth.,
Try a ""Snap Inhale"" when you get more comfortable.",How to Do Smoke Tricks2," Your tricks will be easier to pull off and look better if you don't drag the smoke into your lungs.








, You don't want the smoke to get too far out of your mouth. Open you mouth halfway and slowly exhale the smoke from your mouth for 1-2 seconds.









You are, in a way, simply letting the smoke escape on its own. You can tilt your head back to make it even easier.

, When the smoke is still in a cloud, 2-4"" from your face, quickly suck it back in. You might move your head towards it to get it all. Keep your lips somewhat close together as you inhale to make it easier to get powerful suction.







, The principles are the same -- you let the smoke out of your mouth and then suck it back in, but snap inhales are much quicker and more impressive. To do one:









Take a 2-3 second drag, keeping the smoke in your mouth.
Curl your tongue up to the roof of your mouth, with your lips still closed.
As you open your mouth, snap your tongue down to force the smoke out with a short puff of air.
Quickly purse your lips, like you were whistling, and suck back in the cloud of smoke."

Contemplate your decision.,
Write your obituary.,
Prep the information.,
Send in the application.",How to Fake Death2," Some people will view this as going overboard. Before you go through with getting your own obituary published, re-think your reasons and desires for doing so. If this is for a practical joke, it could be over-the-top and funny for that reason. If you are doing this for spite or legal reasons, do not go through with this.


While planning this, contact any family members that may read the obituary and tell them the truth before they begin grieving.

, Obituaries can be as long and detailed as you wish. It is best to keep them brief and too the point. Write in short, but clear sentences. A good start could be:


”O'Neill, Eric B. age 28 of California passed away April 20, 2016. Eric’s greatest joy was caring for his hamster, Button Boy. “
Many newspapers charge by the line and have packaged deals for the amount of lines like four lines for $40 and 40 lines for $400., To successfully publish an obituary, you’ll need to provide to the newspaper a name, address, and phone number for the person paying for the obituary. On top of that information, you’ll need the name and phone number of the mortuary or cremation provider. This record is usually kept confidential unless consent is provided by you.


If in doubt you can coerce the newspaper with a fake name and use a willing friend’s phone number., Once you finish the application, you’re ready to send in the obituary and payment. These days newspapers will accept obituary notices via phone, email, fax, or mail. Look into the requirements of your local newspaper before applying."
"
Create a fake Facebook account.,
Choose a legacy contact.,
Get a few willing friends.,
Send in a memorialization request.,
Wait for the confirmation.",How to Fake Death3," You’ll need to create an additional account on Facebook to take over your account once Facebook deems you “dead.” You’ll also need to deem someone as your legacy contact if you are trying to trick the internet.


Change the relationship status. Make the fake Facebook account a sibling of yours via Facebook’s family setting. This will make it easier to convince Facebook that your “death” is legitimate.
Add several friends of yours on the fake account., From your current Facebook profile, set your legacy contact in your settings as your “fake” sibling (which you just created). Facebook will give you a template that you can expand or detract from.


You can find the legacy contact in the security section which is found in the settings menu., You’ll need at least a couple of friends to write “RIP” on your Facebook wall. This will help curb any suspicions from the Facebook team responsible for memorializing accounts. Ask a small network of friends.

You might be able to get the request accepted without the help of your friends, but it doesn’t hurt your chances.

, From the fake account fill out a memorialization request for yourself. It helps if you are good with an image editing software in order to generate a fake article about your death. If there is anything you can use, submit it through the memorization request.


The additional obituary or newspaper article is only optional as it says on Facebook., It should take a couple of days for Facebook to review your request. Once they do they will send either a confirmation or denial to your fake account. Try not to log into your real Facebook account until you received a confirmation from Facebook.


Once they memorialize your account, you will have complete control of your “old” Facebook through the fake account."

Be aware of the importance of gross motor skills.,
Look for balls in different shapes and sizes.,
Get your child a tunnel or boxes to form a tunnel.,
Consider a push bike or a wooden horse.,
Get your child a large plastic truck or push toy.,
Buy an indoor trampoline or a plastic slide.",How to Choose Toys That Improve Childhood Development1," Gross motor skills are skills like agility, balance, and posture. Your child needs to use large muscle groups to improve her gross motor skills, often when she is standing, walking, running, or shift her weight while standing. Having good gross motor skills will ensure your child has proper coordination of her arms and legs and a good sense of balance.Gross motor skills are a major element of strong physical development in a child, often through repetitive motions and motions that require agility and balance. Your child can work her gross motor skills through running and walking but toys can also allow her to work them in smaller, more manageable ways.;
, Foam balls, hollow balls, and bouncy balls are all great for gross motor skill development, especially if your child tends to be more active. Always make sure the balls are not small enough to be swallowed by your child, especially if your child is an infant. Toddlers and preschoolers often possess the motor skills to throw and bounce balls with their playmates.Another option is to get your child small tactile toys like patterned balls or tactile discs. Tactile discs come in a set of five or ten discs with different textures that your child can touch, pick up, and move on her own., You can find nylon tunnels made for children at your local toy store or online. You can also purchase foam or nylon boxes that your child can move to form a tunnel. Tunnels and tents are great for building coordination and balance, especially if you are looking for an indoor space to promote positive development in your child.Encourage your child to crawl through the tunnel or tent. Help her move the boxes to make tunnels or an obstacle course where she has to crawl, stand, and use her weight to move the boxes.

, A small plastic tricycle made for small children or a wooden rocking horse are both great for developing gross motor skills. Look for a push tricycle with no pedals, as this will force your child to use her legs to push herself back and forth on the tricycle. These types of toys help your child to build her coordination skills and her weight distribution skills.Practice riding a bike or a wooden horse can also prepare your child for balancing on a real bike, or a real horse. Make sure the bike or horse is sturdy before you allow your child to play on it. These toys are best for children two years and older, or children who have started to walk on their own.

, A push toy is good for infants (birth-18 months) and toddlers (18 months-35 months), as they encourage the development of coordination skills and weight distribution skills.You could get your child a large plastic truck that she can push or another push toy like a plastic lawnmower or a small plastic baby stroller.Look for a push toy that is not too big or too small for your child. Your child should be able to move the push toy when she is standing and when she is sitting, as you do not want to force her to use her legs all the time.

, If you are looking for a larger toy that is more of an investment, you may consider an indoor trampoline or a large plastic slide. These toys are good for toddlers and preschoolers who are walking and are starting to get comfortable with their weight and coordination skills.Look for a trampoline that has a safety net around it so your child does not injury herself on the trampoline. You can then let your child play with other gross motor skill toys like bouncy balls on the trampoline.
The plastic slide should also have high sides so your child cannot fall out of the slide easily. Place soft mats around the slide so your child has a soft landing if she does slip on the slide. Try not to let her use the slide unsupervised and play with her on the slide, holding her if necessary."

Take a drag for 2-3 seconds, keeping the smoke in your mouth.,
Push your bottom lip out so that your mouth is open.,
Inhale slowly through your nose.,
Adapt the French Inhale to other tricks.,
Try ghost-facing.",How to Do Smoke Tricks3," You may want to subtly puff your cheeks out to make this easier. You need to keep the smoke in your mouth, however. The more you can keep in your mouth, the better the trick will be.








, Hold your bottom lip out, as if your had an underbite. Smoke should start to escape from your mouth, drifting upwards.








, As the smoke escapes, drifting up from your bottom lip, inhale slowly as possible from your nose. You should get a reverse waterfall cascading across your upper lip and into your nostrils.








, Can you blow a ring through your mouth and inhale it through your nose? How about a French Ghost, popping out a bit of smoke from your mouth and then grabbing it back through the nostrils. The French Inhale is a way to practice using both your nose and your mouth together for tricks.








, This trick involves little but patience. To do it, take a very big drag. As you open your mouth for the French Inhale, lightly and slowly exhale, pushing the smoke out and up as it hits your outstretched bottom lip. If you've inhaled enough smoke you should end with your face obscured in a thick, ghostly cloud.







"
"
Get a full mouth of smoke.,
Open your mouth in an O shape.,
Push the smoke out in quick bursts.,
Practice shaping your mouth to get different rings.,
Make your rings into hearts.",How to Do Smoke Tricks4," A good, long drag is necessary, keeping the smoke in your mouth as much as possible.








, You don't want to pucker your lips out, just open them in a natural shape, as if you were saying ""Oh."" Some people have more success pulling their lips back a bit, towards their teeth. What is most important, however, is having your mouth open and round.







, This is the most challenging part of the trick, as you need to get control of your breath to pull it off. There are three ways to do it, each with slightly different results:









Try short, quick exhalations. These take some practice, but it will feel like ""reverse hiccups."" A hiccup is little more than a sudden, brief inhalation, and you can feel this if you try to mimic a hiccup feeling. Instead of inhaling, though, push the air out. You can also think of making a ""Huh, Huh, Huh,"" sound.
Place your tongue behind the hole in your lips and ""flick"" out bits of airs. This is the best way to shoot the rings out far, but they will be thinner and weaker rings.
Try the ""cheerio"" method. Push your lips out so that your cheeks are slightly concave (curving into your mouth). Tap your cheek with a finger, hitting it reasonably hard to force some air out of your mouth. This is a great way to get a ton of rings quickly.

, The shape of your lips, along with the force you put behind your exhale, will all change the size and lifespan of the rings. The best way to learn how is to practice, as everyone's mouth is different and there is no recipe for certain rings.








Hookahs, which produce thick smoke and burn for a long time, are often the best devices to practice on.

, This cute little change of pace requires that you can already make solid rings. After you blow one out, snap the air 1-2"" above the ring. The resulting burst of air will dent the top of the ring, making a heart appear.

Mix some dishwashing soap with water in a small dish.,
Dip the end of a wide straw in the soap mixture.,
Take a big inhalation.,
Exhale the smoke through the dry end of the straw.",How to Do Smoke Tricks5," The more soap you have to water, the better. This is basically bubble fluid, so you want it to be liquidy but still full of soap.


Start with 1/2 cup of water and a 2-second squirt of soap, then adjust accordingly., Again, this is similar to dipping a bubble wand in some children's bubble mix. Leave the end of the straw in the liquid as you inhale some smoke.

, Inhale as much smoke as you can from your chosen device. The more smoke, the bigger your bubble.

, Make sure that you exhale slowly, building the bubble so it doesn't pop on you. Pull the straw off when you're done to close off your bubble.Don't inhale with the straw at your lips or you risk inhaling a big bunch of soap.

Choose a subject.,
Observe your subject.,
Make a mental list of assumptions about the person.,
Prepare the subject.",How to Cold Read1," The ""subject"" is the person on whom you will perform the cold reading.


Select the person you will ""cold read"" ahead of time if possible. The more time you have to learn about your subject, the better. Some cold readers actually have accomplices visit or interview the subject prior to the cold reading so that the cold reader can then use this information to dazzle the subject and the audience.
Asking for a volunteer is also a good way to choose someone, as volunteers are likely to be receptive and, more importantly, will likely want to believe that you can communicate with the dead or that you can see things about them that you should have no way of knowing. However, watch out for skeptics.
""Shotgun"" the audience. Shotgunning is a technique in which you make one or more broad general statements, such as ""I'm sensing someone who has had some marital problems recently,"" or ""There's someone named, I think, Billy, that's asking to communicate with his granddaughter."" As you address these statements to the audience, watch for reactions. There's almost certainly someone who has recently had marital problems or whose grandfather went by the name Billy.
If you want to narrow your pool down further, you can try to refine your ""knowledge"" by then making more specific assertions, such as, ""This Billy, he lived a long life. He used to enjoy fishing, no hunting maybe - being in the outdoors."" Focus on the people who reacted to your very broad first statement and then look for further reactions. Using this technique allows you to gain the subject's confidence and to amaze the audience before the reading has even begun.;
, Even if you have only a little time to get to know your subject, you can still learn a lot by ""profiling"" them.


Look at readily available visual clues about the person that will tell you something about them. Their age, the way they dress, their height and weight, and the presence or absence of a wedding ring are among the many clues that can help you immediately learn more about the person.
Read the subject's body language. Before the reading starts and throughout your cold reading, watch the subject's body language carefully. Involuntary gestures, facial expressions, and changes in posture can tell you whether the person is becoming anxious, which is usually a good sign that you have said something that is correct or are about to do so. Looks of disappointment can signal that you've said something wrong, and if you correct yourself slyly and quickly, the person and the audience (if there is an audience present) will be amazed at your correction.

, As you observe the subject, think about certain things that you could reasonably guess about them. Some of your assumptions will be wrong, but it helps to build a character in your mind.

, Introduce yourself and get the subject's name. Look in their eyes and tell them, if you haven't already, that you can communicate with the spirit world. Explain that the person on the ""other side"" really wants to communicate with them, but that you are merely a vessel or ""go-between"" and you will need the subject's help. This makes the reading more dramatic, prepares the subject for the possibility of mistakes and enlists their cooperation.

Understand the importance of fine motor skills.,
Let your child play with Cheerios when she is an infant.,
Allow your child to rip up scrap paper.,
Give your child a small keyboard.,
Get your child a cloth toy box.,
Look for stackable toys.,
Get your child a pattern-recognition game.",How to Choose Toys That Improve Childhood Development2," Your child develops her fine motor skills through repetitive movements, as this builds her muscle memory. Fine motor skills are skills that are performed with smaller muscle groups, such as her fingers, wrists, and hands. These types of toys will also help your child improve her eye hand coordination and be more precise with her body movements.You should encourage the development of fine motor skills in your child at an early age, from infanthood into preschool. Reinforcing fine motor skills will allow your child to get used to small movements and give her strong agility skills.

, Play with small edible object is a great and easy way to improve fine motor skills in infants, especially as they are prone to put almost anything in their mouths.Give your child Cheerios and other small, chewable foods that she can play with in her high chair or when sitting on a clean floor. Encourage her to move the Cheerios around and pick them up and put them in her mouth. You can put the food in a bowl and have her pick them out of the bowl or on a cookie sheet with raised edges so she can play with them without making a big mess.

, Scrap printer paper can act as a useful fine motor skills toy as it allows your child to use her hands and arms. Avoid newspaper, as the newsprint can be dirty and get everywhere. Have your child rip up the paper into pieces and then count the pieces together to practice numbers with her.Make sure the paper is acid free and safe for use for children. You can also use felt pieces, cut into small bits if you are worried about your child putting paper in her mouth.

, Giving your child a musical instrument made for children’s play will allow your child to use all five of her senses. Playing a keyboard, even badly, can help you child improve her eye hand coordination and her control over her finger movements.Try to teach her how to hit the keys properly and to use her fingers properly on the keyboard. You can also teach your preschooler basic chords or basic songs like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” on the keyboard to improve her listening and playing skills.
Another option is to get your child a set of toy drums so she can hit them with her hands and improve her eye hand coordination. A xylophone is another popular toy musical instrument for children that is good for developing fine motor skills.

, A cloth toy box is usually a small box made of cloth that contains smaller plastic toys. Your child can learn to open the box on her own and take out the smaller toys to play with them. This will allow her to work on her fine motor skills and understand how to open and close boxes. She can then also be taught to put the items back into the box during clean up time.You can add larger or more complex toys to the cloth toy box as your child grows older. You may decide to include puzzle pieces or toys that require critical thinking to challenge your child in her older years.

, This could be a plastic pyramid made of stackable pieces or stackable animal toys. Stackable toys allow your child to learn how to build a structure and put together pieces to form a whole.You can also give your child Legos as a way to improve her fine motor skills and learn how to put small pieces together.

, This could be a set of colored pieces that come in match-able pairs or printed cards that require your child to match an animal to the animal sound it makes. These types of games allow your child to improve her eye hand coordination and her critical thinking skills at the same time."

, Also, state where you were born on it, such as write, ""I was born on the planet Conhora and I was born in a tiny area of water called Conhorasea"". Make your planet unique to you.

, This helps anyone reading your diary understand your facts better. You can write something like, ""I was born on the planet Conhora. I was born at 2:30 AM as a beautiful fairy. My mom said I was a bundle of joy.""

, State your real name (because your earth name is an undercover name), age, a little about your friends, and anything you want to! Write something like, ""My name is Oceania. My specific type of fairy is water. I spent all my time next to rivers, streams, and beautiful lakes. I loved to write in my diary, but I left it there. So, now, I have a new diary to write in by the river. I am 113, just becoming a teenager, and my best friends are a fire fairy and a night fairy. Their names are Flame and Luna.""

, For example, don't write, ""We had the Civil war three and my parents abused me."" Some people on Earth will think that's nothing compared to them. Write something more like, ""We faced our enemies, the Magnolians, every day in a war for almost 100 years. They were very scary. They were half human and half spider. They tangled us up in webs.""

, Your talents will be nothing compared to Earth. So make something up and be creative! Write something like, ""I was very good at sword fighting, but also archery and something called swittle sewing. We sewed with a pine cone to make swittles, which were jumpsuits we loved to wear. My mom even told people about my swittle sewing skills.""

, Write something like, ""I was a bit of a rebel and broke some rules to do what I loved. Archery was against the rules, even though my talent was archery. I was caught a couple of times. I liked dark clothes with skulls and controlled the water. I was very bubbly sometimes, but mainly, I was a kind of fairy who liked to be serious and practice my fighting. Being rebel is just part of being me.""

, ""I hope the Magnolians won't come to Earth anytime soon. Last time I visited Magnolia, they were plotting to come to Earth and destroy it! This is top secret, so reading this is something I do not wish you'd do. Plus, this news is serious and scary. Signed, (the name you had on your planet).""

Go fishing.,
Build on the answers to your questions.,
Delve deeper.,
Make a positive analysis of the situation.",How to Cold Read2," If you ask questions, you'll often get the right answers from the subject himself. For example, you could clarify what you learned in shotgunning by asking, ""Now, Billy, he's your grandfather?"" Ask questions in such a way so that they can be perceived as statements. That way, if the subject affirms your question, it will seem as though you knew the answer. If the subject indicates that Billy was not his or her grandfather, it's okay because you were just asking a question.

, Most of the time, the subject will volunteer more information than is necessary. He might say something like, ""No, Billy was my uncle. He lived on a farm."" You now actually know something about your subject. By using this information to ask more questions, you can give the impression that you actually know quite a bit about the subject. If you're a good listener, you can get up to speed quickly.

, Once you're on a fruitful line of questioning (or ""reading""), keep going. If, for example, the subject says they are making a decision. You could follow that with a statement such as, ""But this decision involves another person, too."" Most decisions do involve at least one other person to some extent or another. If you're observant and brave, you might notice the subject's wedding ring and say instead, ""But this decision needs to be made with your husband."" If you're right - because the statement is so obvious, yet also targeted toward an observable attribute of the person- you'll be that much more impressive.

, Once you've helped the subject to open up and you have some idea of what you're talking about, you can bring the reading to a satisfying end by relaying a message from the deceased friend or relative. You don't need to be exact and you don't need to give advice. Just tell the subject what he or she wants to hear: that everything will go well.


You could say, for example, ""Billy wants you to know that he's always watching over you and he misses you. He's happy and he wants you to be happy too. And you will be. You're going to make the right decision."" You may want to warn of challenges ahead to give a more realistic tinge to your reading, but the most important thing is to make the person feel good.

Use Barnum statements.,
Make the subject's answers your own.,
Use pregnant pauses.,
Cover your errors.",How to Cold Read3," Barnum statements, named after the circus showman P.T. Barnum, are statements that will apply to just about anybody, but which will give the impression that you know something about the subject. Using Barnum statements is like shotgunning, except you're just dealing with one person.


For example, you could say, ""You're on the verge of making a big decision in your life."" Most people, at any given time, are dealing with a big decision. The subject will likely be somewhat impressed that you knew that about them and may even volunteer more information.

, Much of what a cold reader does is simply repeating back what the subject has said. Do this in such a way so that it appears you already knew the answer. If you manage to do this cleverly, the subject will tend to forget that it was he or she that gave you the information.


Suppose the subject affirms that they are on the verge of making a big decision. You can simply say, ""Yes, that's right,"" thereby claiming their answer as your own. You can even go further by saying, ""Yes, that's right. It's been troubling you for a while now."" The more information the subject volunteers, the more information you can claim.

, One method of fishing around for information is to pause long enough for a reaction from your subject.


For example, if you mention that a decision needs to be made with her husband, you can wait a moment to see if the person has anything to say about that. She may immediately tell you you're right or wrong, or they may be expecting you to tell them more. In the latter case, watch their physical reaction. If you see some reaction that tells you you're on the right track, take up where you left off with a statement such as, ""He's worried about the decision.""

, Sometimes a question will simply be off the mark and this can ruin the illusion if you don't recover quickly and gracefully.


Suppose, for example, that the person says they are not on the verge of making a big decision. There are a number of ways to handle this. One would be to say that the spirit you're communicating with must be talking about someone else that you both know. Another would be to change the time frame with a statement such as, ""But you made a big decision in the past year, something of a new start."" You can also subtly change the way the question is framed with a statement like, ""I'm sensing something new is happening in your life or is about to happen."" Twist the questioning until it makes sense to the subject.

Be aware of the importance of emotional and cognitive development in children.,
Let your child choose a doll or a small stuffed animal.,
Make finger puppets for your child.,
Get a playhouse for your child.,
Allow your child to play dress up.,
Practice activity cards with your child.,
Get felt books for your child.",How to Choose Toys That Improve Childhood Development3," Play is essential to the emotional and cognitive development in children, as play allows children to practice their verbal and nonverbal communication and their body language. Cognitive development is your child’s ability to process information, emotions, reason, and memory. Having strong cognitive skills is also an essential element to developing strong critical thinking skills.


Children can also process emotions through play and gain self-confidence, as playing with others requires children to respond to the feelings of others. Healthy play in childhood will often lead to a healthy adulthood, especially in terms of emotional processing and coping mechanisms for strong emotions.

, Having a special doll or stuffed animal to take care of can help your child develop stronger emotional skills. She can use the doll to explore relationships and emotions in a healthy, safe way. Allow your child to pick her own doll or stuffed animal, as this will make it feel more like it belongs to her.There are many types of dolls currently available on the market, from American Girl dolls to Barbie dolls. Look for a doll that looks like your child or let your child choose her own doll.
Stuffed animals can also be good for emotional development, as they allow your child to display nurturing and caring skills towards the stuffed animal. Make sure the stuffed animal is made for children and does not have any parts that can be swallowed or toxic to children.

, Finger puppets can be made from socks, cloth, or felt. You can then draw faces with different emotions on the finger puppets and use them to perform a scene or play for your child. You can also show her how to use the finger puppets herself. This will allow her to play around with emotions and relationships in a positive, exploratory way.Finger puppets also allow your child to access her imagination and expand her vocabulary as she creates voices for the puppets. Puppets can help her develop her ability to think abstractly and to improve her eye hand coordination.

, Encourage your child to develop cognitive skills through play in a dollhouse or a playhouse. Your child may act out scenes that she has watched adults do already or other scenes from her imagination. You can also stock the playhouse with accessories to make it feel more realistic.Another option is to get your child a mini-kitchen where she can pretend to prepare and cook meals. This type of toy is great for her cognitive skills and her fine motor skills.

, Let your child explore her imagination by playing dress up with your clothing or with a tickle trunk of costumes and accessories. Dress up with your child and act out a scene from a small audience of family members or let your child direct you on an imaginary stage. These kinds of activities will allow your child to use her imagination and feel free to express her emotions through play., Activity cards are often made of plastic and are full of bright, big pictures. Activity card sets can focus on different emotional reactions, vocabulary, sounds, or actions. Practice these cards with your child to help build her self-awareness and her self-esteem. They are also great for building language skills and sensory awareness., Books are a great way for your child to name and learn objects and words, especially early in their development. Look for thick books with pages that are easy for your child to turn or felt books that have tactile qualities that will encourage your child to hold them and look at them. You can read the books to your child or encourage your child to read with you and listen to the sound of words as you read."

If they said yes, sigh and say, ""Thank you for telling me the truth."" and hold your diary with you. If they say no, say, ""Oh thank goodness!""

, Keep trying for at least 2-3 months. If they don't, say, ""It may be time for you to know."" Hand them the diary and let them read it. If they laugh at you, take your diary and leave. No need to say goodbye. They'll know they hurt your feelings, if you leave. If they act serious about it, start talking about your planet. If it goes way too far though, or if your friend is scared and crying about the Magnolians, tell them it was a harmless trick and no one is coming to Earth.

Sing a note as high as your voice can reach, then push it further with as much breath as you can muster.

You can achieve this by not drinking water or even replacing water with beverages which cause dehydration like alcohol or coffee.
Exercise and release water from your body by sweating.
Severe dehydration can lead to confusion, headache, fever, fainting or even death. Don't get carried away., Heartburn, or acid from your stomach reaching up into your throat, will cause irritation in the tissue. Spicy foods can cause this reflux, which may also make you feel like you need to cough, further irritating the tissue around your larynx and effecting your voice.This may not be as effective for people who regularly eat spicy foods.
Try a cuisine your body is unfamiliar with. Some options may be Indian, Ethiopian or Chinese food.Many restaurants with spicy food will note the spice level on the menu. Opt for the dish with the hottest spice.
Avoid acid reflux which can create ulcers and abdominal pain. This can be treated with acid blockers.

You can't actually catch a cold by making yourself cold. Although, exposing your throat to the cold could make it hoarse.Most colds go away in 7-10 days, but they can be pretty miserable. If the cold does not go away, it may need to be treated with antibiotics., Inhaling pollen can inflame your vocal folds. Inflammation in your lungs and nasal drip can cause changes to your voice leaving it hoarse.If you take antihistamines to solve the problem of excess mucus, it could actually dry the protective mucus in your throat leaving your voice even more raspy and hoarse.

, People with asthma can treat their symptoms with an inhaler. Using an inhaler over the long term can cause a hoarse voice. Also, repeated dosing can lead to a low-grade yeast infection in the mouth and throat increasing the hoarseness of your voice.Be sure to work with your doctor to find the appropriate dosage.

Reduce your body fat percentage.,
Lower your sodium intake.,
Build muscle.,
Amp up the cardio.,
Drink water.,
Eat less carbs.,
Safely consider diuretics.,
Try supplements.",How to Get Veins to Pop Out1," Having veins that bulge like a body builder's comes down to body fat percentage. The veins that will pop out are surface veins. The less padding you have between your skin and your veins, the more prominent your veins will be. Eat a diet focused on getting lean by decreasing your body fat.


Below 10% body fat for men should result in most major veins being visible. The lower your body fat, the more visible your veins will be, especially in hard to see places like your abs.For women, the body fat percentage should be around 15%.To get this percentage of body fat, eat clean. That means loads of fresh vegetables and lean protein while skipping junk foods, soda, and dessert.;
, Sodium causes you to retain water. When your body is retaining water, your skin puffs up, obscuring your veins.Keep away from the processed foods and pretty much anything you haven't made yourself. Odds are if it's prepared outside of your kitchen, it's been doused in salt.
Currently, 2,300 mg of salt is the upper limit daily recommendation. That's just one teaspoon of salt. The Institute of Medicine and the American Heart Association suggest 1,500 mg of sodium per day.To make this manageable, buy fresh and use herbs and spices to jazz up your palette.

, To build the kind of muscle that yields protruding veins, you need to focus on serious muscle building strategies. These muscles don't come from 3 sets of 10 reps that most people suggest for workout routines. Serious muscle building comes from 3-5 reps at a heavy weight.


Start by doing 6 sets of 5 reps, but increase the weight you are lifting by 25%.Muscle needs to exert force to grow.

, Cardio is an excellent way to burn fat and get lean. High intensity interval training (HIIT) works great for this. HIIT workouts are when you do super high intense bouts of cardio with rest in between for 20-30 minutes.Examples of HIIT are cycling between short intense bouts of speed and rest or completing 10 100-yard sprints with 60 second rests in between.

, Drinking enough water keeps you hydrated and your muscles hydrated. This helps reduce your water retention. Drinking more water than necessary can flush excess water, therefore lowering your water retention.Keeping a healthy level of potassium in your system helps you expel water instead of retaining it (like sodium).Many bodybuilders dehydrate themselves before a competition. Drinking less can lead to your veins becoming more prominent.This method is not recommended because it is very dangerous. If you use this method, use it with extreme caution.

, Carbohydrates increase the amount of fluids your body holds. Eating a low carb diet can result in lower water retention under the skin.Diets low in carbohydrates also lead to fat loss.

, Diuretics rid your body of water, helping to make those veins prominent.You can buy diuretics, or you can use natural ones, like espresso. Diuretics can be extremely dangerous, though. If you use them, be safe and smart about them.

, Agmatine is a supplement that is a by-product of the amino acid Arginine. Agmatine prevents nitric oxide from breaking down in your body, which promotes increased blood flow to your muscles. Enhancing this blood flow can increase your vascularity.A nitric oxide supplement can also help you achieve more prominent veins.Creatine is another supplement thought to attribute to increased vascularity."

Alternatively, writing letters, numbers, and/or messages on someone’s back can give them the chills as well.Lightly running your fingers over someone’s arms or other body parts can also induce chills.;
, Try brushing or combing your friend’s hair to give them the chills. Styling someone’s hair can also give them chills; for example, you can try braiding a friend’s hair to induce chills.Gently pulling at the ends of someone’s hair can also give them the chills.

Tie something around your arm.,
Clench your hand into a fist.,
Continue until you feel a pressure in your arm.,
Try holding your breath.,
Exercise.,
Increase your body temperature.",How to Get Veins to Pop Out2," Using tourniquets increases pressure in your veins and fills them, causing them to be easier to see.Tie something around the section of your arm or leg where you'd like the veins to pop out.


Another method is to place your right hand right above your left wrist (or vice versa) and grip it tight.
This is the same idea used when you go to give blood or give a sample drawn. The nurse ties a band around your arm to get the vein to pop so she can see where to put the needle.

, After securing the band around your arm, clench and unclench your fist several times. Doing this with a tourniquet traps the blood in your veins, which causes the veins to pop out., This should take about 10 to 15 seconds. Just as if you were holding your breath, you'll be able to tell when your arm or leg needs oxygen. Your veins should be popping out.


Release your hand or the tourniquet when your limb needs oxygen. The veins will slowly return back to normal upon the release.

, Holding your breath hinders the flow of oxygen in the body and increases blood pressure. Close your mouth and nose and press hard. Bodybuilders sometimes use this trick when posing to make their veins pop.This method can be dangerous. Popping veins this way can sometimes lead to ruptures. These can happen in less serious places like the eye, or in serious places like the brain. Just remember to breathe after 30 seconds or so.

, During exercise, cutaneous veins are pushed towards the surface of the skin, making them appear to pop. This is especially prominent in bodies with low percentages of body fat.Lifting weights can produce more prominent veins in the exercised muscles. Veins are also more prominent after exercise because you are dehydrated., When your body heats, the blood is pushed towards the surface of the skin, increasing the appearance of veins. One quick trick some bodybuilders use is to use a hairdryer on your skin to get the veins to pop. Another, safer way is to heat your body through the foods you eat. Try hot peppers or cayenne pepper. Some supplements also provide the same benefits of these foods."

Play a song.,
Play crisp sounds.,
Speak in a soft voice.",How to Give Someone the Chills2," Try playing music that involves a variety of instruments like classical or techno music to induce chills. Somber music is also known to give people chills. You can also try playing your friend or partner’s favorite song to give them the chills. If you know of a song that has a story that resonates with a friend or partner’s current life situation, playing this song may give them the chills as well.For example, if there is a song about rediscovering love after a break up and you have a friend going through a similar situation, then playing this song may give them the chills.

, Crisp sounds like a pen writing on a piece of paper, fire crackling, vegetables being cut, or paper crumpling can give people chills. Play a recording of one of these sounds or make the sounds yourself to give someone the chills.Additionally, sounds like running water, ocean waves, and white noise can also give someone the chills.
Rubbing two different textures together can also give someone chills, like nails on a chalkboard.

, Soft or slow speech patterns can also give someone the chills. Think of a massage therapist’s voice or the voice of a practitioner doing guided meditation. You can also try whispering in someone’s ear to induce chills.For example, whispering in a low voice, ""I am watching you"" or, ""I am right behind you"" could give someone the chills.

Make a loud noise.,
Jump out and surprise them.,
Tell a scary story.,
Play a scary movie.",How to Give Someone the Chills3," Making a sudden loud noise can startle someone and give them the chills. Slam some books on a table or the ground, scream, clap loudly, or make another loud sound to induce the chills in someone.For example, while your friend is quietly reading, blow a whistle.

, Hide in the closet, behind the door, or in a dark room. When the person enters the area, jump out and scream. This will most likely scare them and give them the chills., You can either create your own scary story, or personalize an existing scary story for the target person. If you decide to create a story, make sure the plot is believable and relatable to the person. Let them know from the beginning that the story is real, and tell the story in a low, husky voice.You can personalize an existing scary story by switching out minor details to make the story seem more real. For example, make the setting the same city where your friend grew up, or develop a protagonist that is similar to the person you are telling the story to.

, Like scary stories, scary movies can also give people the chills. Put on a horror movie or a psychological thriller, turn the lights down (or off), and watch your friend get the chills.Some examples of scary movies you and your friend can watch are The Ring, The Bad Seed, Psycho, Paranormal Activity, The Shining, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Blair Witch Project, to name a few.

Freeze the putty.",How to Fake Fingerprints1," Putty, Play-doh, or modeling clay are all good options, as long as they are clean and new.Roll a small piece of your chosen material into a ball, and press the finger you wish to imitate into the putty.A hot, flattened piece of paraffin wax will leave a better impression, but only after five or ten minutes of pressing.;
, This will keep the impression of the fingerprint as hard as possible while you work with it. Different materials and brands will react differently to cold, and may not be usable as putty afterward — but that's fine for this purpose.

, Boil a small pot of water, then add an equal amount of gelatin powder by volume.Stir constantly for several minutes, dissolving as much of the powder as you can. Let the mixture cool.

, Once the gelatin has cooled to a thick gel, melt it in the microwave, then let cool to a gel again. Microwave repeatedly until the gelatin has no bubbles, and when a drop acts thick and rubbery., Once the gelatin is rubbery and bubble-free, melt it one final time, then pour the hot, liquid gelatin into the fingerprint mold you made from putty.

, Put the putty and gelatin into the freezer. Within a few minutes, the gelatin should harden into a solid, rubbery substance. Peel the gelatin carefully off the putty. You now have a fake fingertip, with the impression of a real fingerprint marked on the surface.

Keep practicing.",How to Do a Toe Stand," You should not attempt this move without wearing the appropriate shoes. Avoid wearing split-soled shoes as they don’t support your foot.Tennis shoes can work, but keep in mind that performing this move over and over will wear the material down and cause tearing.


The best option would be a triple toe and heel build-up shoe. These shoes have triple the padding of normal shoes throughout and are specifically made to enhance balance and overall support. You can find these at specialty shoe stores.
Tap shoes work great as well. Not only are the toes strong, the sound they make will give you a clue as to whether or not you’re landing properly. Grab a pair of these from any dance studio or online tap retailer.
Another option are tap boots. They look like high-top sneakers and offer great ankle support. Beginners should consider this option. It’s like the best of both worlds.;
, Loose ankles will help you avoid injury so stretching is key. Lay down on your back with one leg bent and foot flat on the ground. Cross your outstretched, straight leg over the bent leg so the ankle meets at the knee. Trace the alphabet in the air with the raised foot. This will help loosen your ankle. Do this for 5 minutes or until comfortable.


Repeat this exercise with the other foot.

, Standing up with both bare feet on the floor, perform heel raises. You do this by slowly raising your heel off the ground but keeping your toes flat. You should feel stretching in the arch of your foot, as well as your ankle and calf. Do this at least ten times on each foot.Do the reverse as well by keeping your heel firmly planted on the ground and raising only your toes up. Repeat this on each foot 10 times.

, A great way to practice this move is to start by sitting down in a chair. Make sure you use one without wheels. With both feet on the ground and back straight, slowly raise your heels off the ground and onto your toes.


Hold on to either side of the chair with both hands for more stability in the beginning.
If available, a short stool would work as well.

, Once your confidence has been built a little and you feel comfortable, practice the same move standing. A good place to practice this for the first time would be in a gym or studio where you have access to a stable barre. With the proper shoes on, face the barre and hold on with both hands. Slightly bend your knees and hop onto your toes.


Initially, only hold the toe stand for a second or two. Find your rhythm and balance.
If your ankles feel shaky, stop immediately and take a break. You want to avoid injuries.

, Perhaps you are at home and needing a way to practice. Consider using the kitchen counter. While you can face the counter and hang on with both hands like using the barre, consider adding a level of difficulty by holding on with one hand.Once comfortable with the motion, barely hold on to the counter top. Maybe only keep one or two fingers on the surface.

, Think about the position you would take if you were about to sit down. Your knees should be about 6 inches apart and at a 90 degree angle. Place your weight on your bottom.Don’t bend too deep. This could throw off your balance.
Use your arms to help balance too. Hold them out at your side or above your head.

, Try to avoid rolling forward onto your toes. This may cause serious injury. Instead, slightly jump to pull your weight onto your toes.


Check to make sure you’re landing on the very tip of your toes and not on the balls of your feet., Maintain the stand for a few seconds, around three if your balance is really good. Don’t force it. Take your time to ensure you really have all the steps down and your balance feels right.

, Once you’ve really gotten the move down, try performing the trick while balancing on a single foot.


You can incorporate your new dance move into a routine, even spinning on your toes.

, Be sure to stretch regularly. Concentrate on stretching your legs, lower back and arms. Focus particularly on the hamstrings, quadriceps, knees and lower back areas. If a person is stiff, they may end up in a hospital bed, not in their own bed with someone they picked up after a night at the club.

, Don't expect to get this move down on the first or even hundredth try. This takes timing, agility and concentration, all of which will come to you with patience.

, Now that you're mentally and physically prepared, tackle each component of this move separately. This move will only become fluid after each action is memorized on its own.

, Practice jumping in place as high as you can. When jumping, be sure to bring your knees as high as possible.

, Grab your left or right foot, while standing in place on the opposite foot. Hold this pose as long as you can. Don't worry about how you look, you'll look a lot cooler when you've got this whole move down.

, Decide which leg gives you the best balance (this is now you're ""standing leg""). Grab the opposite foot just as you've practiced. Jump with the foot from your ""standing leg"" and bring it up from behind the leg you're holding, continuing to bring it up and over. Land with the jumping foot first and then bring your other foot down.

This is the fastest and easiest way to get your veins to pop out quickly. The exercise forces blood into your forearm muscles, as well as gravity.


If you can never see veins in your arms, and doing push-ups doesn't work, you may need to work out to lower your body fat percentage before your veins will be visible. Skip to the next section.;
, If you don't feel like doing any push-ups, or aren't able to, pump your forearms up a little by clenching and unclenching your fists. Lay your hands out palm side up on a flat surface. Now grasp both your hands to make them in to fists, gripping your hand into a fist, then letting go. Continue this in a ""pumping"" action.


This action should force blood into your forearms, an effect called vasodilation, as you've forced your muscles to require more oxygen and thus forced more blood to flow into the area, making the veins appear more prominent.
Stress balls or grip-clamps are also good tools to use to give your fist some resistance, as well.

, If you've got lean arms and big veins, sometimes all you've got to do is let your arms hang down to get as much blood to fall into your extremities as possible, which can cause your veins to pop out. Easy, and it works.


If you can, hang over the back of the couch or the kitchen counter, or some other surface that you can lean your armpits against and let your arms dangle.
You might start getting that ""pins and needles"" feeling if you get too much blood in your arms, and they'll fall asleep. Stop what you're doing when and if this happens.

, Muscle shirts are often worn tight to make muscles bulge and veins pop. While it's not recommended that you wear clothes that restrict blood flow (which is unhealthy for your veins, muscles, and your heart), it is possible to roll up the sleeves on a shirt to make a regular-fitting shirt tighter, or to wear a tight-fitting shirt that will have the same effect.


Cutting off the blood flow to any part of your body is never recommended. Never use tourniquets or other tied-off bands to force the veins to the surface in your arms. If left in place too long, this can cause irreparable tissue damage, or even result in the loss of a limb.

, Simply put, the lower your body fat, the more your veins will pop out. Most people's abs start showing at 12%-10% body fat, and veins will start appearing on the arms and elsewhere on the body at about the same point.


The great thing about your arms is that you don't carry too much body fat in this area, so it's a little easier to get your veins to show in your forearms and biceps versus trying to get veins to show in your abs where you carry most of your body fat.

, Along with cardio and a clean diet, the best ways to lose weight and get the veins in your arms to pop out is to target your arms, specifically. You need to choose the right exercises to build up your arm muscles in order to add lean muscle mass to your biceps, triceps and forearms. The following are great for high volume vein-popping exercises:


Bicep curls
Tricep extensions
Skull crushers
Close grip benchpress
Pullups
Forearm curls
Forearm extensions

, To get your veins to show more visibly, you want your workouts to focus on toning, not bulking. That means lower weight at a greater volume. For example, instead of curling doing 8 reps of 50 pounds, curl 30 pounds for 40 reps. This will cause you to tone and strengthen the specific area you're targeting., Heavy farmers walks, forearm curls, reversed grip bicep curls, and other grip-style exercises are great ways of building lean muscle in your forearms and increasing the vasodilation that occurs. You should notice your veins popping while you do these exercises.


Generally it's recommended that forearm exercises should consist of an appropriate number of reps to end in muscle failure. More reps, less weight.
If you don't have access to a gym, try to do some dead hangs on a door-frame. These build up massive forearm vascularity, forearm strength, and finger strength. Just put your fingers on the top of the door-frame, and hang for as long as you can. Do a few every day, and eventually add some pull-ups to the routine.

, Vascular health is a key component to getting ripped and developing veiny arms. There are two types of cardio you can choose to incorporate into your fitness plan. Slow and steady cardio is the normal type of cardio where you work at a moderate intensity such as riding the elliptical, walking on the treadmill or riding the bike.


The other form of cardio is called HIIT (high intensity interval training) and this is when you do super high intensity cardio for a short amount of time (20-30 minutes) and you do short intervals with rest in between them. An example of a HIIT cardio workout would be ten 100 yard sprints with 60 seconds rest in between them.
An example of a slow and steady cardio workout would be 45 minutes on the elliptical machine.

, Less body fat percentage, more visible veins. It's pretty much as simple as that. Calculate your daily calorie needs, based on your body weight, age, sex, and height, and figure out how many calories you need on a daily basis to keep your frame trim.


If you want a relatively easy and hands-off way of tracking your calories and exercise regimen, consider signing up for a Fit Tracker account, or some other app which will help to facilitate your weight loss plan.

, While it's somewhat unproven, tilapia is exceptionally rich in selenium, which is thought to promote weight loss, muscle growth, and is thought by some to actually help to ""thin"" the skin, making it easier to see your veins. It's efficacy for this function is debatable, but it's a fact that tilapia is exceptionally good for you, rich in lean protein and low in fat and calories, making it an excellent addition to a healthy diet.

, Since animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs have a good amount of fat, aim for vegetables higher in protein and lower in fat such as broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, and kale. In order to get tree branch veins in your arms, you need to really focus on eating a clean diet, rich in lean protein. Aim for about one gram, per pound of body weight, if you hope to build lean muscle and get your veins to the surface.


Your diet is the most important aspect of your fitness plan you need to focus on if you really want to reduce your body fat percentage. The type of calories you put into your body and the overall amount of calories are absolutely critical to building lean muscle mass and burning fat.
Lean chicken, eggs, and fish are all a good source of protein, but also can make you gain weight. Go for protein-rich soy and legumes.

, Try to limit the amount of sodium that you take in, so you can eliminate the water weight that you're holding onto, which will get your skin to tighten around your muscles and get your veins to pop. The less salt you take in, the more visible your veins.


One body-building trick that's not recommended is limiting the amount of water you drink before a show. While this does work in eliminating the water weight and getting your skin to tighten, it's not recommended for overall vascular health. Eliminate the salt instead and you'll get the same effect. Stay well hydrated.

, Along with limiting your salt intake, increasing the amount of slow-digesting carbs that you take in can help to eliminate the water weight that you're holding onto, helping you slim down quickly and get your veins to pop out. Carbs with a low gi-index, such as rice, sweet potato, and brown bread help to process out the sodium in your system and make your veins more visible, especially after workouts.

Advanced method: Grab a baseball bat, or another stick a few feet long. Put one end on the ground and your forehead against the other. Spin while your forehead touches the bat.
Don't try to run or do anything complicated after this. You probably won't be able to, and you might hurt yourself.;
, Next time you go to the park, sit in the swing and twist it around until you can't anymore. Then let go and spin around really quickly.


Spin on an office chair or a turning desk chair.

, Another simple way to get dizzy is just to crouch for a long period of time, your legs bent like you're in a huddle. Then, stand up abruptly. This is sometimes called getting a ""head rush,"" but it's basically the same as getting dizzy.


If you're hungry, or if it's very hot out, this will be more intense. Dizziness can result in fainting if you're not careful.

, When your bottom is higher than your top, the blood rushes to your head and you can start to feel quite dizzy. Try to move as little as possible while you do this, and you'll notice the effects more.


Hang upside down from a swing-set, or from a fence, or from a pull-up bar. Make sure you turn around before you let go.
Ride a roller coaster that goes upside down, or a ride one of the fair rides that you can control the spinning. The Tilt-a-Whirl is a great way to get dizzy.

, Often, if you start doing some exercise, like jogging, doing jumping jacks, or even something like jumping rope, you'll get a little dizzy. Pick something that will have you moving around, go outside, and do it.


You get dizzy sometimes when your blood sugar is low and you need to eat something, or you get overheated. If you get dizzy when you do this, it's important to sit down, drink some water, and get something to eat quickly.

, Whether in a book or a picture online, optical illusions can get your head spinning even if you're sitting still. It's a great way to give yourself the illusion that you're moving without actually going anywhere.


Lots of moving optical illusions are available on YouTube. They're pretty trippy.
If you don't like the optical illusions you find, try watching the iTunes or Windows Media Player visualizer while you're listening to some music you like. Wild stuff.

, Dizzy challenges are all over social networking and YouTube, featuring kids doing silly tasks after spinning to get dizzy in some way. Check some out for inspiration, or try doing one of the following things after you get spun:


Put on as many socks as you can
Do a math problem
Write your name
Say the Pledge of Allegiance
Walk a straight line, slowly
Hit a whiffle ball

, If you spin around too much and get dizzy, there's a good chance you'll lose your balance and maybe even fall down. Never try to get dizzy in the kitchen, or anywhere indoors.


The best place to get dizzy is outside, where there's plenty of grass and room to move around. Falling on the grass is ideal.
If you have to be indoors, make sure there are no objects or toys on the ground, and that you're far enough away from furniture and walls that you won't get hurt.

, Don't spin so much that you'll fall down and you won't have to worry about getting hurt. Usually 7-8 spins will be enough to get you dizzy. You don't need much more than that.


It's very hard to control your fall when you're super-dizzy, so it's easy to break a wrist or an arm, or hurt yourself worse.

, Dizziness and nausea are related. Unless you want to see what you ate for breakfast again today, don't make yourself dizzy if you've eaten something in the last hour or two.

, It's very important to have someone around if you're trying to make yourself dizzy. If your hurt yourself, someone who isn't all light-headed needs to be around to help you out, or steady you if you start to fall.


Get your parents to watch you. If they say no, there's a good reason. Don't do it.

, If you're feeling too dizzy and you don't like it, just sit down and put your knees up and wrap your arms around them. Put your head in between your knees and just breathe deeply.


Dizziness can be a sign of lots of different health problems, including blood sugar problems, eye problems, nerve problems, and imbalance in your inner ear., Dozens of kids in schools all around the world die each year from self-choking to get a ""high."" Cutting off the oxygen to your brain is extremely dangerous, and can result in serious long-term brain damage, heart problems, and even death. It's not a ""high"" that you feel, it's your brain dying from lack of oxygen.Don't let any kids at school try to talk you into it, or tell you that ""it's not a big deal"" or ""it's a totally legal high."" It's a really easy way to kill yourself accidentally.

Invert the image's direction and color.,
Transfer this to a printed circuit board or overhead transparency.,
Make your fake finger from graphite and wood glue.,
Remove the dried glue fingerprint.",How to Fake Fingerprints2," This method can make a much more accurate fingerprint, and does not require an impression in putty, but it requires specialized equipment. Do not attempt this unless you have access to these tools, including a high-quality scanner or camera, and a printed circuit board (PCB). An overhead transparency can be used instead of the PCB, but this is less effective., This method can create a fake fingerprint from nothing more than a fingerprint left on a touchscreen, a doorknob, or another dry, glossy surface. To locate these, you can dust a surface with crushed, powdered graphite from mechanical pencil lead, or use a fingerprinting kit with a black powder.


A white surface will work best with this method.

, For best results, photograph or scan the fingerprint with a quality of at least 2400 dpi.Load the resulting image into a computer with photo editing software.

, Use the photo editing software to ""flip"" the image from left to right, creating its mirror image. Reverse the color of the image as well, so the raised fingerprint is white and the background of the image is black., For best results, print out your fingerprint onto tracing paper, then use a UV etching machine to transfer the fingerprint onto a printed circuit board (PCB).If you do not have access to these materials, you can try the less effective method of printing out the fingerprint directly onto an overhead transparency sheet.

, The fingerprint image on the PCB or overhead transparency is actually slightly raised, and can be used to make a fake fingertip. To do this, cover the image with graphite powder, then smear it with a thin layer of white wood glue or light-colored latex milk.A small dash of glycerin in the wood glue will make it slightly more moist and workable, creating a more effective material.

, Once the wood glue has dried, carefully peel it off the surface beneath and take a look at your new fingerprint. You can even trim this to fingertip size, then use theatrical glue to attach it to your own finger.

Set aside a specific time to be still.,
Choose a designated place where you can go and be completely still.,

Posture your body for stillness.,
Close your eyes.",How to Be Still for a Long Period of Time1," There will always be a long list of things to do that may require your immediate attention; however, it’s important that you establish a period of uninterrupted time when you refrain from any activity that shifts your focus away from being completely still.


Early mornings usually work well because you have not begun your daily routine, and the likelihood of the house still being quiet is greater.
Late night is another option because your mind starts to settle down and your body begins to relax, primarily because you’ve finished doing all of the things that you had to do for the day.;
, You should have a designated area where you go that is free from noise and external distractions.


A quiet space in your house that’s separate from the other areas in your house will work.
Parking and sitting in your car at a quiet location is another option.
Consider going on a retreat, where you can have an extended period of peace for several days.

, Once you’ve settled into your designated area, you should get completely comfortable. Make sure your body is in a comfortable position that you can sustain for a reasonable amount of time.


If necessary, take a few minutes to do some light stretching to release muscle tension in your body.
Taking a few deep breaths is a common relaxation technique, which increases the level of oxygen to your brain, enabling you to relax better., Initially, you may be a little restless because the nature of the body is such that as soon as you tell it to be still, it gives you hundreds of reasons why it should move. Send an internal message to your body that it’s time to maintain stillness.Although you will have to choose the best posture for yourself, there are some recommended techniques that will help position your body for stillness.


You may choose to sit on the floor, sit in a chair, kneel on the floor, or lie down. If you choose to sit in a chair, make sure that you sit upright with your head, neck, and torso aligned. Your lower body should also be in a comfortable position. If you’re sitting on the floor, it helps to cross your legs if you can.
Putting your hands on your knees or thighs usually works well.
Tell your body that it’s going to sit still and completely motionless except for breath no matter what., Although some people find it easier to keep their eyes opened, by closing your eyes, you prevent yourself from looking around and becoming easily distracted by your environment.

Practice, practice, practice.",How to Wiggle Your Ears," You’re probably not pinning all your hopes and dreams on the ability to wiggle your ears, but just in case you are, brace yourself. Accept the possibility that you may not be physically capable. So don’t beat yourself up if nothing happens! Blame your ancestors instead.Wiggling your ears is what’s known as a “vestigial” trait. This means that, once upon a time, our ancestors were all able to do this quite easily. But since it doesn’t serve any real purpose, people just quit doing it, so over time humans lost the ability to do it so easily.
There’s some debate about how many people are still able to do it. Some believe that only a small percent are capable, while others believe that more people than that can relearn how to do it with practice.;
, To truly master wiggling your ears, concentrate on not one, but three different muscles: the auricularis anterior, posterior, and superior. Don’t worry about the fancy names, though. Just focus on what each muscles does.The auricularis anterior lifts the ear both upward and toward your face.
The auricularis posterior draws it toward the back of your head.
The auricularis superiors only lifts it upward.

, Some people have found that learning to control other specific muscles in your face makes learning how to wiggle your ears easier. So if there’s another trick that you find easier to do, start off with that instead. Then, once you learn how to manipulate one small cluster of muscles, switch back to your ears. You could try learning how to:Raise only one eyebrow.
Roll or dart just one eye at a time.
Flare your nostrils.

Shrink and dilate your pupils.

, Expect the muscles in your face to affect other neighboring ones whenever they contract or expand. Use this to really feel how your ears move in relation to other facial features. Try to isolate the muscles in and around your ears as you do.


As an experiment, raise your hand. Curl your fingers into a fist and squeeze. Most likely you’ll feel the muscles in your forearm tighten without you having to command them to.

, These may possibly have the strongest and most direct effect on your ears’ muscles. To see how, look to either side of you without turning your head or neck. Concentrate on your ears as you do. Chances are that you will feel one or both pull back.You’ll probably look a little crazy, but go with it and just go nuts with your eyes. Look in all directions, roll them around, or anything else that comes to mind. Feel how each action might tug your ears forward or push them back.

, If you can raise one eyebrow at a time, do it. If not, raise both. Then furrow your brow like you’re really mad. Alternate between the two and vary speeds. Keep your focus on your ears and how their muscles respond., Grin like you’re the Joker, nice and wide. Lift your cheeks as you do. As before, concentrate on what your ears do in response so you can isolate the muscles there., Don’t worry about mastering any one motion just yet. For now, see if you can move them at all. Once you’ve warmed your face up and isolated where your ears’ muscles are grouped, flex them any which way you can. Alternate between trying to move them up, backward, and forward., If you have instant control over all three muscles, good for you! But if you find that you have far more control over just one or two, focus on those for now. Continue flexing and relaxing each one to strengthen both that muscle and the ones connected to it.

, As you gain more and more control over the first muscle that you focused on, move on to whichever one feels the most responsive. Practice that by itself at first, and then start alternating between that and the one from before. Then, when both start feeling more natural, move on to the last muscle and repeat.

, If you’re not quite sure that anything’s happening, don’t rely on feel alone. Set up a mirror so you can watch them in action. Put on a pair of glasses or shades so you can see and feel them move along with your ears.

, Remember that wiggling your ears is kind of a pointless skill, so expect those muscles to be pretty weak because you’ve never had any reason to engage them. Keep it up even if it doesn’t seem like much of anything is happening when you flex them. Give them time to strengthen so they can work up to the challenge."

Charge your wand.,
Change your wand’s power level as appropriate to its capabilities.,
Cleanse your wand periodically.",How to Use a Magic Wand1," You can charge your wand by transmitting energy from yourself into the wand. Usually do this through the hands by holding the wand in both hands. Other methods include:


Pyramid chargers. Placing the wand in a specially built pyramid charger can give it a strong charge. Pyramids can transmit energy to other items as well, and can send energy over long distances.Natural light sources. Sunlight or moonlight, particularly strong moonlight from a full moon, are also powerful sources of wand energy.
Use desirable energy sources. This is often yourself, but be aware that wands are sensitive to other energy sources as well. Since, you don’t want to charge your wand with unwanted energy, protect your wand with a covering. This could be a cloth or a pouch, for example. Black, blue, or purple pouch coloration and celestial designs are often popular.
Be careful of depleting yourself of energy when self-charging the wand. If you feel this happening, be sure to draw energy toward the center of your body: upward from the feet and downward from your head.;
, For example, if your wand’s magic powers were provided by an herb bag, you may want to keep herbs handy for when you are running low on magic.

, This is a way of ridding your wand of unwanted, negative energy prior to recharging it from a new, desirable energy source. There are a variety of ways to cleanse a wand. Just make sure that whatever method you use doesn’t damage the wand. So, be careful of smoke, fire, and water damage when implementing the methods below.


Selenite is a common cleanser. Selenite, often used synonymously with gypsum, is the transparent variety of the gypsum mineral.You can put your wand in contact with selenite for any length of time, and anywhere from a couple of hours to several days is common.
Sage smoke is another method. Light the sage, and allow the smoke to circulate around the wand.
Flowing water cleanses as well. Holding your wand in a river, stream, waterfall, or other flowing natural water source can wash away negative energy.

Stretch your jaw to the right.,
Repeat the entire process.",How to Crack Your Jaw2," Stretching your jaw can also help relieve pain. Begin with your jaw in a relaxed and centered position, but do not allow your teeth to touch. Use the mirror to see if your jaw is centered.You may have tension in your jaw without realizing it. If this is the case, your jaw may be shifted to one side or the other.When the mouth is closed and in a neutral position, the lips should be closed but the teeth should not be in contact.

, As you are opening your mouth, imagine that your jaw is dropping to the ground and that it is pulling your mouth open. You should feel your jaw muscles being stretched, but should not be in any pain.

Wear a bite splint at night.,
Check your jaw for tightness throughout the day.,
Avoid opening your mouth too wide.,
Avoid foods and candy that require excessive chewing.,
Implement a massaging routine.,
Go to the doctor or dentist for severe, consistent pain.,
Go to a hospital or emergency room if the jaw is locked in place.",How to Crack Your Jaw3," Pain in the jaw is often caused by grinding your teeth, also known as bruxism, or putting tension on muscles around the jaw while you sleep. A bite splint, which you can get from your dentist, is a removable protective device that covers the surface of the teeth and gums while you sleep. Wearing a bit splint at night can help decrease this tension and, therefore, relieve the pain in your jaw.


Symptoms of bruxism can include flattened, flat, loose, or chipped teeth, worn tooth enamel, increased tooth sensitivity, headaches originating in the temples, pain that feels like an earache, and indentations on your tongue., It won’t be easy, but training your brain to stop doing behaviors that aggravate your jaw issues can help ease the pain you feel. For example, pay attention to when you clench your jaw. You can help train your brain to recognize when you’re clenching your jaw by checking it for tightness when you perform certain activities.For example, check your jaw for tightness every time you walk through a doorway, close a browser window, or go to the bathroom. Choose actions you know you perform multiple times on a daily basis., Opening your mouth too wide can also cause your jaw to pop out of place. To help prevent this from happening, keep your mouth closed as much as possible when you do things like yawn, talk, or eat., You should also make an effort to stay away from foods that require excessive mastication. Having to chew more than normal can cause pain in your jaw. In general, you’ll want to stay away from things like gum, sunflower seeds, chewy candies, and ice chips., Stretching and massaging your jaw can help relieve pain and relax the muscles. Start by massaging your jaw once a day before bed. If you are experiencing more pain than usual, add a second session in the morning until the pain has subsided and return to massaging it only once a day.


To massage your jaw, place your fingertips on your lower jaw and move them up, pushing on the skin while you do this. Once your fingers reach your scalp, remove them and start the movement again from your lower jaw. Do this for about 2 minutes., Most jaw pain will go away on its own or through self-massage and stretching. If you have consistent, severe pain, however, you should seek professional help. You should also visit a professional if you’re having trouble swallowing your food or if it hurts to open and close your jaw. Your dentist or doctor can both diagnose TMJ and guide you as to what treatment is best for your situation., If your jaw is locked in either an open or closed position, you should go to the hospital or emergency room to get help. To treat a locked jaw, the doctor will sedate you to a comfortable level and then manipulate the jaw until it returns to the correct position."

Clear your thoughts.,
Focus on simply breathing.,
Let things go.,
Train your mind to visualize something that is still or an image that is typically associated with peace.",How to Be Still for a Long Period of Time2," Once you’re in a comfortable and relaxed position, and you’ve postured your body for stillness, you will need to clear your thoughts and let go of all the mental chatter. It never fails; once you sit still, the activity in your mind tends to increase. Therefore, you will need to rein in the distractive thoughts that start to flood your mind.You can start with a statement like “I'm not worried about anything right now. I just want to have a moment without unnecessary thoughts."" But you may need to repeat that statement a few times while taking deep breaths.Whenever your mind starts to wander, try mentally counting down.

, Being mindful of how you’re breathing helps you to relax and be still. Also, paying attention to how you breathe helps you to gradually begin to concentrate.


Listen to your breath.
Inhale and exhale naturally.
Don’t try to manipulate your breathing pattern.
Allow yourself to feel the air moving in and out of your nose.

, Avoid worrying about everything that you have to do that day or the next day. And don’t allow your mind to drift off into memories of the past or thoughts about the future. Be present in the moment. By practicing the awareness of your stillness, it can help you to remain still.
If you hear a distracting sound, just try to quickly refocus on your breathing.
When a physical sensation comes, such as an itch, try to avoid responding to it while you are being still.

, Having an object to concentrate on can keep your mind from wandering. For example, a waterfall, a beach, or a tree, and try to only focus on it. The goal is to let your mind achieve relaxed awareness.Having a picture of a tranquil setting may be helpful.
Allowing your senses to come into your visualization experience works as well.

Prepare your hands.,
Hold the wand in your right hand for most activities.,
Alternatively, hold the wand in your dominant hand or writing hand.,
Maintain a comfortable grip.",How to Use a Magic Wand2," Rub your hands together vigorously up and down and side to side for approximately 10 seconds or more prior to holding and using a wand. This will open the energy pathways in your hands,which is crucial to transferring energy to the wand.

, According to most texts, the wand should be held in the right hand while praying or while summoning or addressing spirits.When dismissing spirits, however, hold the wand in the opposite hand. In this way, the wand is a sort of defensive weapon.

, Think of the wand as transferring energy from your dominant hand to your other, receiving hand. Energy should flow from your center, through your arm and hand, and out the point of your wand to the receiving hand., Feel around the wand for a comfortable spot to grip it. Listen to the wand to hear how best to hold onto it."
"
Find spells necessary for your wand's potential ability.,
Clearly focus your inner intention.,
Make strokes with the wand.,
Perform incantations with your wand.,
Practice the spells you have chosen to perform.",How to Use a Magic Wand3," Try to listen to your wand and become attuned to its abilities. Some say that the wand finds the wizard.When you are in tune with your wand, you’ll know what spells you can cast with it. Common spells include:Love spells to attract love, seduce a mate, or heal a broken heart.
Beauty spells. These often encompass height or weight adjustment or improving self-image.
Money spells that focus on wealth, prosperity, power, or good fortune.
Protection spells to shield someone from negative energy, to protect a home or specific place, and to ward off dark magic, for example.

, This is important prior to using a wand. There are several considerations to take into account before casting a spell.


Consider what you plan on calling for--exactly what you want--and think about how this will bring yourself harmony.Determine whether or not your use of the wand will cause harm, and specifically how it will affect others.

, Strokes are simply the movements that you make with your wand. They are a way of bringing your inner intentions to the external world. Different people use a different number of strokes when casting a spell.


It might be helpful to think of each stroke as forming a letter. Some say this is how the word spell came into being—by spelling out your intention with strokes., Incantations are sung spells. The word comes from the Latin stem “canto,” which means to sing. Incantations put out powerful vibrations into the universe, and entrust your will to whatever higher deity you ascribe to., Like anything else, practice is necessary to make a spell work. Sometimes a spell might not come to fruition for a period of years.In other instances, you'll see more imminent results that show your energy manifesting itself in the universe.

Drop an item on the ground.,
Bend over to retrieve the item.,
Pick up the item.,
Snap upwards.,
Smile!,
Practice at home.,
Engage your crush in conversation.,
Sell it.,
Make eye contact with your crush and keep talking.",How to Bend and Snap," This item can be anything at all; a pen, a piece of paper, your keys, etc. The only qualifiers are that the item needs to be something you can easily pick up, and small enough that you can hold it in one hand.


Do not drop anything fragile or expensive, as there is no guarantee it won’t break or shatter.;
, To do this, you will need to hinge forward at the waist, simultaneously sliding your hand down your leg. This movement will draw attention to the length of your legs, as you lean down to pick up the item.


If you’ve ever done a Kettlebell Swing, the bending motion is very similar.Push your chest out as far as possible during the bend. If there is writing on your shirt, someone looking at you should be able to read the words, even as you’re bent over., Take your time while doing this. The whole point of the maneuver is to keep your crush’s attention on you, so feel free to draw out the motion for as long as you’d like.

, Once you have the item in your hand, snap back up to standing, with your hands positioned on either side of your chest, framing it. Arch your back to stick your chest outwards, in the direction of your crush.


A woman sticking her chest out is considered a non-verbal invitation towards intimacy or flirting.Make sure if you’re bending and snapping for someone, that you’re actually interested in them, otherwise you may end up with some unwanted attention or advances.

, Gymnasts stick their landings by lifting their hands in the air to keep their balance.A smile is how you will stick the landing of your bend and snap. A smile lets your crush know that you have completed the motion and you’re ready to re-engage in conversation.

, Before you share your bend and snap with the world, do a couple of test runs at home in front of the mirror. This will give you the self-confidence necessary to really sell the motion when you’re doing it out in public.


If you’re still struggling, watch the bend and snap scene from Legally Blonde. Watching Elle Woods take you through the motions a few times may help you see what you’re doing incorrectly.

, When you’re ready to perform the move for real, find your crush and start chatting. What you talk about doesn’t matter, as long as it’s clear that your crush is paying attention to you.


You can also try using your bend and snap to attract your crush's attention. Once you have their attention, use that to propel you into further conversation.
The closer you stand to your crush, the bigger the effect your bend and snap will have on them. Standing close to your crush without them feeling uncomfortable and moving away is a clear sign that they’re interested in you and that you should proceed with your bend and snap., Confidence is one of the most important traits you can have while flirting. Being confident will do more for your dating life than being attractive.It doesn’t matter how athletic or graceful you are; anyone can do this move and as long as you do it confidently, you will execute it perfectly.

, Don’t just finish the move and walk away. It doesn’t matter how good your bend and snap is if you can’t carry on a good conversation outside of it. Let the bend and snap help you attract your crush's attention, but once you have it, it’s on you to make the most of it.

Prepare your ropes.,
Hold up your left hand with your palm facing you and pointing to the right.,
Place the top of the small rope into your left hand between the thumb and pointer finger.,
Place the top of the medium rope into your left hand to the right of the small rope.,
With your right hand, reach under the long rope but over the medium rope to grab the small rope.,
Grab the bottom of the medium rope and place it between your thumb and index finger.,
Double check that all your ropes are arranged correctly in your hand.,
Reveal the three ropes of equal lengths.,
Count out the first of the three equal lengths of rope.,
Count out the second of the three equal lengths.,
Reveal the three ropes restored to their original lengths.",How to Perform the Three Equal Ropes Illusion," You will need one small rope 9 inches (22.9 cm) long; one medium length rope, 18 inches (45.7 cm) long; and one long length rope, 26 inches (66.0 cm) long. Cut each length from the same longer rope, which should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick, woven, and relatively floppy, so that each rope is identical except for the length. Melt the cut ends of the rope so that they don't fray., Your hand will act as a shield to keep the audience from seeing how the trick works, so make sure to keep it between you and the audience throughout the trick., Slide it all the way to the left, so that it's squeezed in the base of your thumb. Allow the rope to extend about two inches over the top of your hand. Narrate this to the audience - throughout the trick, you'll count out the ropes to demonstrate the trick and help with the illusion., Then place the longest rope to the right of the other two ropes. Make sure these ropes also extend about two inches over the top of your hand, even with the top of the first rope. Talk to the audience as you do this, counting out the three ropes., Bring the top up and place it between your thumb and index finger, next to its other end. At this point you should have four rope tops in your hand. The leftmost two are both ends of the small rope. The third end is the top of the medium rope, and the rightmost end is the top of the long rope. The small rope must be looped around the long rope but not around the medium rope., Place it at the end of the ropes you already hold, so that it is the rightmost end. Then repeat with the end of the long rope, making sure to count out the three ropes to the audience as you go., You should now hold three loops, with the long rope passing through the loop of the short rope. The ends of the ropes should be arranged in your hand, from left to right, as follows: top of short rope, bottom of short rope, top of medium rope, top of long rope, bottom of medium rope, bottom of long rope. All the tips should be at equal heights so nothing looks suspicious., Grab the three rightmost of the rope ends sticking out of your hand, which should be both ends of the long rope and one end of the medium one. Close your left hand around the other three ends (both of the small and one of the medium), making sure to hide the loop in the small rope. Pull your hands away from each other, pulling the lengths of rope taut between them. When you hold up the ropes to show the audience, it will appear as if you have three ropes of equal length., Transfer the tops of all three ropes to your right hand, making sure to hide the small loop from the audience. Keep the top of the medium rope in your left hand, however, and pull it up through your right hand so that the audience can see its entire length. Count out ""One..."" as you do so. You'll now have the medium rope in your left hand, and the long rope looped through the small in your right hand so that they look like two ropes of equal length., Subtly transfer the looped small and large ropes from your right to your left hand and the medium rope from your left to your right hand. Then, still holding the medium rope in your right hand, slide that hand down one leg of the long rope, making it look as if you simply put the second equal length of rope into your left hand.Count this rope out loud: ""Two...""

Now you'll have the looped long and short ropes in your left hand and the medium rope in your right hand. Simply place the medium rope in your left hand next to the other two and count it out loud to the audience as the third of the three ropes of equal length.

, To do this without giving the trick away, grab the three loose (bottom) ends and bring them into your hand next to the three ends you're already holding. Bring the bottom of the loops up into your hand as well to keep the whole rope lengths hidden from the audience. Then simply grab one end of the small rope and pull it up and out of your hand to reveal the entire rope length. Repeat with the other two ropes, counting them out loud as you go."

Rehearse the trick a lot.,
Know your equipment inside out.,
Note what other things beyond your own gear and skills that could go wrong.,
Use and carry the props with care.,
Set up the props yourself.,
Watch for audience dangers.,
Be very careful with animals.",How to Prevent Accidents when Performing Magic Tricks," Before you get to performing the trick, ensure that you have practiced it so many times that it feels like second nature to you and you could practically do it blindfolded. Your own ability to see a difficult or even dangerous trick through to its conclusion comes down to your own confidence, a lot of practice, and a certainty that you're able to accomplish the trick properly and safely.;
, What is sharp, what bends, what can break, and what can fail? You should know all of the possibilities with the equipment you're using, including the ways in which it can fail on you.

, Are there props over which you don't have control, such as a table or chair, or lighting? Perhaps the venue has a stage you're unfamiliar with. Think about all of the possibilities and how you can manage them.

, For example, if carrying scissors, a sword, or any other sharp object, always carry them facing downward and away from yourself and other people. Alert people when you're moving objects that can potentially cause harm, whether it's during setting up, rehearsal, or the actual show. Have proper covers, sheathes, bags, boxes, and other containers to keep dangerous props carefully stored when not in use. Even balls and small objects can cause someone to trip over if left lying about.


Be very careful with anything that has a naked flame. Always extinguish it when not in use and never turn your back on it.

Always put away your props after use and label them clearly.

, Every time you have a magic show, do the setting up yourself or under very strict supervision. You should know exactly where each prop is, how it has been placed, and what condition it is in. If someone else sets it up, it may cause you to err when performing the trick or you might not notice any weaknesses or problems with the props until you're actually performing.

, Your props and your own abilities are something you can control. The audience is something that is much harder to control and while you should perfect the art of keeping the audience spellbound and quiet, things don't always go according to plan. Be prepared for such possibilities as:


Children running onto stage when least expected

Shouting or loud noise from the audience
Attempted exposure of your magical ""secrets"" (in this case, learn how to perform the ""sucker"" trick in which you appear to have given away the secret but you haven't)
Dangers to any audience member you've recruited as a volunteer should be completely removed. Ensure you know how to keep such participants completely safe during the performance of the trick.

, Whether it's bunnies and birds or tigers and horses, animals can be an unknown quantity. They must be very well trained, healthy, and in the case of dangerous animals, their trainer must be present at all times ready to take appropriate action should anything go wrong.


Obey all laws with respect to kind and humane treatment of animals. They are not props but living beings deserving of the same respect as you.

Select two people to be your volunteers.,
Have the first participant close their eyes.,
Ask the first participant to straighten out both of their arms in front of them with their eyes still closed as you wave your hands around their arms.,
During the waving motion, secretly tap the spectator behind his/her shoulder.,
Quickly and dramatically tap the second spectator behind his/her shoulder.,
Tell the first participant that they can open their eyes and reveal what they felt.",How to Perform the Invisible Touch Trick," To build more excitement in, ask for two people who are relatives or have some sort of bond.;
, They will be the one feeling the effect.


Say something like, ""In order to make you fully aware of any sensations, I will ask you to close your eyes now.""
This could be done any way you prefer such as having them look into your eyes or hands while acting as if you're putting them in some sort of trance or just ask them to go into a meditative state.

, This is where showmanship comes into play. Tell them you are going to scan their aura, or conjure some sort of spirit. With their arms straight in front of them about shoulder height, have one of your hand above and the other below their hands, making sure to leave space to let the audience see that no physical contact is being made. As you wave your hands and move your fingers from their arm to chest and shoulder area back and forward.

, The secret move is that, of course, you do touch them.


The trick works on a concept called dual reality. When you move on to tap the second spectator, each one of them will think the trick happen at the same time while it happened at a completely different time. So when waving your hands back and forward, when reaching around the shoulder your middle finger actually taps him/her behind the back. But this is covered by the quickness of the move and the constant movement of the other fingers.

, Then just go and tap the second participant as many times as you tapped the first one. To make yourself more convincing to the audience, tell the second participant to stay quiet about how many times you touched him/her and where.

, You will be surprised at how this will keep them scratching their heads, build your reputation, and even puzzle other magicians.

Prayers about nature and natural subject matter, including seasonal prayers and incantations during a full moon.

, Since wands transmit energy, they improve energy flow through the body. This can be applied to breaking down blockages in a variety of systems, such as the circulatory and nervous systems. Clear away blockages by pointing the wand at the blocked area or areas, and focusing your energy and any verbal prayers or mantras that you might like to use.

, In this case, you would point the wand toward yourself. Meditate on the negative thoughts and feelings, and allow the wand to draw them out. You might speak your wishes at this point as well. Reduce stress and nervousness. Wands help clear blocked pathways that help release stress, nervousness, and other negative energy., Many people do this while lying down. Run the wand over your body and focus on when and where the wand vibrates. These areas require more attention from the wand. Once the wand stops vibrating, your auras are cleansed."

You'll need to get your hands on the greenbacks yourself. So find a job, help out your neighbors, and cash those checks. Go to the bank and ask for $1 bills. The more bills you have, the better. You want a veritable downpour, not a drizzle.


While you're at the bank, check to make sure the stacks of $1 bills (or $20s, if that's how you roll) don't stick together. Sometimes fresh bills, all crisp and hot off the presses, adhere to each other. If this is the case, ask for rain-able bills. The teller, if they've any sense, won't ask any questions.;

Set it on a high level with enough room in front of it to add your stacks o' cash. Turn it to the on position when it's not plugged in. That way, when you go to plug it in, you're in front of it when it turns on, ready to get rained on and rained on and rained on as your dead presidents swirl through the air.

, Sure, you could make it rain by yourself. You could run around your room, spreading the dough, raining on your bed as part of your nighttime routine, and then go to sleep comfortably on your piles and piles of simoleons. Or -- OR -- you could take your stacks and liven up any party, a coffee date with a friend, or dinnertime with your parents. Think of the endless possibilities!

Gather the necessary materials.,
Measure and cut out squares from the cardboard.,
Make one side of the squares black.,
Tape the edges of four squares together.,
Form the secret compartment.,
Put the box together.,
Decorate the outside of the box.,
Prepare the box for your trick.,
Perform the trick.",How to Make a Magic Box1," To make a disappearing handkerchief box, you’ll need to gather several household items:Thin cardboard or posterboard
Tape
Scissors
Handkerchief
Paint, wrapping paper, and other decorative items
Glue
Black construction paper or black paint;
, Use a ruler and pencil to mark out your squares, and cut them out using a pair of sharp, sturdy scissors.


You can make your magic box any size that you want, but you’ll need six squares of the same size no matter what their size. For a manageable small box, measure 4”-6” squares.

, You can do this by gluing the cardboard squares onto the black construction paper or by painting one side with black paint. For one square, glue black paper to or paint both sides.


Paper may be preferable, as it is the same color and texture throughout. You also don't have to worry about smearing the paint.
If you glue your squares to construction paper, allow the glue to dry. Then cut them out and trim the excess paper from the edges.

, Place four squares on your work surface with the black side down. Tape their edges together, then bring the last two sides together to form a box. Place a strip of tape on the outside of that edge too.


Don’t use the double-sided square for this step.

, Place the remaining single-sided cardboard square on your work surface with the black side face up. Place one edge of the double-sided square about ⅓ of the way from one edge of the square. Secure with tape on that side to form a hinge.

, Slide the four-sided box you made in Step 4 over the secret compartment piece. The double-sided square should create a flap inside the box and should be able to move freely back and forth. Secure at the bottom with tape.


If the flap isn’t able to move, trim the edges just a little bit. Don’t trim too much, or you’ll ruin the illusion.

, Use paint, wrapping paper, and/or stickers to decorate the outside of the box. Make it as colorful as you can; the vivid colors and patterns will help distract your audience as you perform the trick.

, Push the flap forward to open the secret compartment, and place a handkerchief inside. Then, push the flap back into place. Hold the box by the side where the flap connects so the compartment stays closed.

, Show your audience the “empty” box while you hold the secret compartment closed with your hand. Then, reach into the box, behind the flap, and pull out the handkerchief. Voila!"

Finish off your invisible thread.,
Attach tape to the end of your invisible thread.,
Store your thread for future use.",How to Make Invisible Thread," Your invisible thread will be one strand from a thread woven of several strands. Most people use black woolly nylon, but some people will use green or dark blue. Wooly nylon is strong with a little elasticity.


Choose a thread which is a matte color as opposed to glossy, which is more likely to reflect light.
Consider the lighting and the background the thread will be used with to help choose your color.;
, You will want to have these handy to help you hold your thread and not lose it. Break a small piece of Scotch tape from the dispenser. Roll this into a circle with the sticky side facing out. Attach the two ends of the circle together and press this onto your worktable.Work on a white table or board to make it easier to see the invisible thread.

, Each piece of string is made up of many smaller threads woven together. Rub the cut edge of your string to separate these threads.You can buy this thread at craft stores or find thread in your own pieces of clothing.
Consider cutting thread from an old shirt, shoelaces, or sport socks.

, Pinch this single strand of thread between your thumb and forefinger and gently pull it up and and out from the top of the string., Press the end of the string onto one of the rolls of scotch tape. Fold the roll of tape over the top of the string and press it together to hold firmly to the end of the string. Press this piece of tape back onto your worktable to secure the end of the string to the table., Using the taped end of the string as your base, hold the other end of the woven string gently in your hand and pull away from the taped end to unravel the rest of the string. Gently peel it from the single strand taped to the table.Do not pull too hard as you peel the strands off your thread, because you may break your thread.
If your thread does break, go back to your string and choose another one, then start over.

, As you peel the strands off your thread, they will begin to bunch together where they are tugging against your invisible thread. Grab these strands from the bottom to take out the slack and straighten them to help remove them from your invisible thread.


If you are making a long invisible thread, you may need to support the thread with your other hand as you peel further away from the tape.
Gently hold the thread between your thumb and forefinger near the peeling strands as you pull them off the end of your invisible thread.

, You can continue peeling until your reach the end of your piece of thread. Alternatively, if you have peeled enough to expose the length of thread you need, you can cut it free from the rest of the strands., Press this end of your invisible thread to the other piece of tape on your work table. Fold the tape roll over the end of the invisible thread and press it firmly between your thumb and forefinger to make sure it sticks to the thread.You can now stick the tape to a playing card or whatever you would like to float.

, Cut triangles opposite each other on the sides of a piece of poster board or cardboard. The points of the triangles should be facing inward toward the center of the board, with the base of the triangle being he side of the board.


Stretch your invisible thread between these two triangles. Pass the ends over the tip of the triangles and wrap them around to the back of the board. Press the tape ends onto the back to secure it to the board.
Use a white board. This will make it easier to see the thread against the board.

Take the empty box with your free hand and show it to the audience.",How to Make a Magic Box2," All you need for this box is a matchbox (not a matchbook), some small scissors, a pencil, and a small coin such as a penny., Put the coin up against one short side of the matchbox “drawer” and mark its edges on the box with the pencil. This will help you make sure that the flap is just large enough for the coin to slip through.

, Use the scissors to make three cuts at the bottom of the drawer to form a flap. Leave one side intact to serve as a hinge.

, Hold the matchbox with the flap side facing you so that your audience can’t see it. Show the coin and the box to your audience.


Make a big deal about the box being empty. Shake it to prove there’s nothing inside.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Trace the sides of the ""real"" card box onto the cardboard.,
Tape the sides of the fake deck together.,
Cut out and glue the photocopies to the fake deck.,
Trim any ragged edges.,
Perform the trick.",How to Make a Magic Box3," To make a disappearing card box, you’ll need the following materials:A real deck of playing cards
Thin cardboard or posterboard
Clear tape
Glue
A pen or pencil
Scissors or a craft knife
Color photocopies: 1 of the front of a playing card, 1 of the back of a playing card, 2 of the long edges of the card deck, and 1 of the short edge of the card deck

, For this trick, you will create a box insert that looks a deck of cards -- a ""fake"" deck. The fake deck will be inserted into the real card box.


Place the bottom edge (the short narrow side) of the card box onto the cardboard and trace around it.
Place the box on its long narrow side and trace around it. Repeat this process a second time.
Place a playing card on the cardboard and trace around it. Repeat this process a second time.
You should now have one short rectangle, two longer rectangles, and two rectangles the size of playing cards traced onto the cardboard.
Use a craft knife or scissors to cut out the rectangles.

, Alternate the playing-card-sized rectangles (A) and long thin rectangles (B) like this: A B A B. Tape them together.


Next, bring the untaped edges of the fake deck together to form a box shape. Tape those edges together.
Tape the short rectangle to the bottom edge of this box.

, This is where you create the illusion of the “deck” that you’ll make disappear. It's actually an empty box that you'll insert into the real box.


Glue the photocopy of the front of the playing card (the ""face,"" such as the Jack of Diamonds) to the front of the fake deck. Glue the photocopy of the back of the playing card (it usually has some sort of pattern) to the back of the fake deck.
Glue the photocopies of the deck edges (the ridged edges of the cards when they’re held as a stack) to the sides of the fake deck.
You should now have a box that’s open at the top and looks like the front and back of a playing card, but much thicker.

, For this trick to work, the fake deck needs to look as realistic as possible, so trim any ragged edges from where you glued on the photocopies.

, You'll perform this trick by making your audience believe that the fake deck you just made is a real deck of cards. Because the fake deck is actually an empty box you insert into the real box, when you open the real card box after putting in the fake deck, it will look empty!


Place one or two real playing cards on top of the fake deck. Hold the fake deck vertically, keeping the open top facing upwards. Cover the open top with your fingers. Show the audience the “deck,” keeping the real cards fanned out in front of the fake deck.
Slide the fake deck into the real box, keeping the open top facing upwards. Do some tapping and say a few magic words. Be very showy about it Then, open the real box to reveal that it's ""empty""!

Hand your friend a stack of twenty-one playing cards.,
Deal the cards out face-up in three columns, working row-by-row (1st column-2nd column-3rd column, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc).,
Gather the three columns into one stack of cards again.,
Repeat the past two steps two more times.,
Deal two piles of cards from a deck of 52 into equal piles of 26 each.,
Give the spectator one of these piles and you keep the other.,
Let the spectator know that you are going to make the number of red cards in your pile equal to the number of black cards in his pile.,
Make the trick interesting by building it up any way you desire.,
Amaze them with your magic trick.",How to Perform a Card Trick Using Math," Instruct them to pick one out, without showing or telling you which card they chose, and to place the card back into the stack at random.

, You should have three columns of seven cards in front of you. Have your friend tell you which pile contains their card (without telling you which card it is, of course).

, This time, be sure to put the pile that holds their card in the middle of the three piles. For example, if the first pile contained their card, then you could pick up the third pile first, then the first pile (containing the card) and then the second pile—or the second pile, then the first, then the third. It is very important that the pile containing their card goes into the middle.

, When done, you will have dealt the cards out a total of 3 times. If you have done the card trick correctly their card with be the 11th card in the pile of cards. Do not flip the deck over at the end, or else you won't be correct.

, This is a complete deck without the jokers. You may want to go through the deck beforehand to make sure it's complete and there aren't any duplicates.;
, If they'd like to have more control, let them pick which pile they want.

, The mathematics behind this is fairly simple, however, most people will not think beyond the trick, or try to figure it out.


The catch of this trick,is that any deck of cards in which you deal out two piles of 26 cards will ALWAYS have one pile of red cards equal to the black cards in the other pile. For example, if your pile of 26 cards has 10 red cards, then the remaining 16 cards must be black. Therefore, the spectator's pile of 26 cards MUST contain the remainder of 16 red cards (to your 10 red cards) and a remainder of 10 black cards (to your 16 black cards). So, as can be seen, the number of red cards in your pile (10) equals the number of black cards (10) in the spectator's pile.

And, of course, the reverse is true: The number of black cards (16) in your pile, does equal the number of red cards (16) in the spectator's pile. Pile A always equals pile B in terms of red and black cards.



, This presents more of a show and gets the spectator more entertained and intrigued, not knowing how you do it. Make it interesting and fun by being dynamic and exciting yourself.


You can vary this trick by making three piles, and it will add another dimension to the overall effect by creating a diversion. Then, you might say that the number of red cards in your 2 piles will equal the number of black cards in their single pile.

, Have your spectator flip over their cards and then slowly, dramatically, flip over yours. Wave your hands a little, indicating the magic air you've cast over the deck. How did you do it? You'll never tell.


And can you do it twice in a row? Why, yes. Yes, you can. Would they like to see?

Because pencils are small and available around the house, they're the best and most convenient to practice with.;
, It's important that you line up the erasers perfectly, as you'll be applying a great deal of pressure between the two ends. Make sure both erasers are pretty thick, and that one isn't any duller than the other.

, Don't let the erasers separate from each other while you push. If your erasers aren't lined up perfectly, you may end up slipping out of your push and poking yourself with the pencil point. It's best to practice this trick alone, at first, to prevent mistakes like this from occurring in company.

, Once you've applied the ample pressure, try pulling the pencils apart. This is when you should feel them being forced back together. If it's not working, you may have to hold the pencils together for longer, or with more force. You definitely want to practice this trick on your own to start. That way, you can work out the kinks and perfect the ""magnetism"" by yourself before sharing it with your audience.

, As with any good magic trick, you want to become a master before sharing it with the public.Doing the trick a few times isn't enough. You want to make sure that it's polished and consistent, so that you won't embarrass yourself when you share it with others.


Record yourself performing the trick. You can go back and replay the video. Watch yourself over and over again. You'll understand your mistakes, and you'll also figure out how to master the trick.

, A magician has a lot of power over an audience, and you need to make sure that you're confident in your speech to properly draw your audience in.You'll want to speak with an even, upbeat tone. This proves that you know what you're doing and makes your audience trust you.


Call attention to the magic of your trick without giving away any secrets. Tell your audience that you'll be ""turning pencils into magnets"" or ""magically pulling two objects together."" It's best not to explain the science, as you want to keep up illusion.
Eye contact is key for a magician. Making a lot of eye contact will establish a trust between you and your audience. This will draw them in and make them pay close attention to you. This connection with you will make it all the more rewarding when the magic happens.
Try speaking some magic words as you perform your trick. These words include ""abracadabra,"" which translates to ""make something happen,"" and ""voila,"" French for ""here it is.""If you can incorporate these phrases into your performance, you'll look like an expert.

, Remember, first off, that applause will come when you've properly rehearsed a great trick. You don't want to demand this directly from your audience, or they'll find you conceited. For a magician, applause doesn't just include clapping. Gasps and cheers can also be nestled into this sense of approval.


If you want to earn a large response from your audience, dress like a magician. This might include a large hat and a robe with long coattails. Dressing like a magician will get people to believe in your magical powers.

, While some magic tricks are far too complicated to get the audience involved, the magnetic pencil trick works well for a volunteer, as it uses the natural forces of physics. Perform the trick for your audience to start, so they can see how you've done it.


You'll then want to call up your volunteer. You can guide them through it, ensuring that they're pushing on the two pencils with enough force and for enough time. If they're following your instructions closely, then the trick should work perfectly.
There's nothing more rewarding for an audience than watching an untrained magician complete a great trick. This way, everyone will be able to try the trick within their own homes.

, If you're curious, you can test the physics of this trick on your own body. The doorway should be large enough for you fully extend your arms within it, or at least fairly close to this width.


You can also try this trick in a tight hallway, or between two walls that are near enough to each other. Make sure that the two surfaces are as close to parallel as possible.
While it's not required to perform the trick, it's exciting to see how the science of the pencil trick works. A good magician should have a fully-formed idea of how his tricks work.

, You'll want to situate yourself within the frame, equidistant from both surfaces. Feel the wall and make sure that you can press equal force on both sides. This trick hinges on keeping an even balance between the pressure on both of your hands, so keep that in mind when positioning yourself., After you've gotten comfortable, push upon the sides of the doorframe or other surface with a bit more force. The more force that you exert, the more magic you'll feel on the other end of things.You should hold this position for about 30 seconds to feel the full effect of the trick. Make sure not to damage the doorframe by applying too much pressure.


It should not feel particularly comfortable when you're pushing against the walls. This trick works because your arms are exerting enough force to become used to the equal reactionary force of the wall surface. If your arms feel a little sore while you're pressing, you're probably doing it right.

, While you'll be able to keep them down at first, they'll then magically lift up, re-establishing the position that you held them at in the doorframe.


When you press your arms against the doorway, there are two major forces operating at the same time: a positive ""push down"" signal, a voluntary movement, and an involuntary ""lift"" signal.Research suggests that the latter is cancelled out when the two forces act together. This means that inhibiting voluntary movement is actually its own neural function, rather than simply the absence of positive voluntary commands

,  Once they have done this get them to place Packet A on Packet C.

,,  Ask them to repeat this cut. Thank the spectator.

, Holding the cards closely to your chest you firstly need to identify your key card.  You need to find the card quickly.  It will either be in the bottom half dozen or so cards or the top half dozen or so. 

, Remember to count your key card as number one. If the key card is towards the top end of the pack you should count to the top of the pack and then continue from the bottom until you reach number 26. You have now identified your spectator’s card.

,  The cards should still be face up close to your chest. 


Say something like: “I am having real trouble finding your card. I will need to try doing something else.” Whilst you are saying this bring the two halves of the pack together but with the cards in the right hand going on top of those in the left.  Looking at the cards face down the spectator’s card is now the top one.

,  Your right hand should be obscuring the whole of the deck from your spectators.

,  This move should not be visible to spectators as your right hand should cover this slight.

, You are now ready for the reveal.  You might like to ask the spectator to tell you the name of their card.  As they do so you toss the pack from your right hand to your left hand.  The air pressure on the overlapping card should force it to turn over.

;
, You don't have to count out 26 cards by hand. Simply cut the deck, then place the halves next to each other on a table. Press down on them to remove any air pockets. If they're the same height, then they contain the same amount of cards.








, Really bend the deck into a C-shape, touching the top to the bottom of the card and holding it there for at least 15-20 seconds. You want strong, permanent, and visible kinks in the middle of the deck.









When done, you should have a shallow V-shape, so that the center of the bent deck points upwards in the middle.

, Just do the same thing, bending the deck hard in half, so that you have another heavily bent deck, just reversed.

That said, take the time to learn the full technique to for a better card flower. If you're really struggling with this, just manually re-organize the cards so that they alternate bending back and forth.









Turn the decks both face down. They will be bent in different directions.
Press the short ends of the deck together.
Slide the decks back and forth against each other so the cards work into each other.
Press together once the cards are staggered one after the other.

, It will be a little larger than normal as the bends will probably cause the deck to ""rise."" The point , however, is that the deck is all squared.









Work lightly when squaring the cards. Forcing or muscling the cards could ruin your bends.

, Simply hold the deck from one of the short sides, and use your hands to let the deck ""bloom"" to either side. The bends in the cards will make long, 2-card petals as the bends push the cards away from each other.

, The back and forth motion, while light, will help you work the cards in between each other. With some practice you can also use it to ""clean up"" your shuffle, mixing up any chunks of unshuffled cards.

Have your volunteer take the card on top of the deck.,
Guess her card.",How to Perform a Card Force Trick," You'll need someone to perform your magic trick for. Search out a group of people to amaze.


Look for people who seem friendly and open to your performance.
Avoid people who seem reclusive or groups in the middle of serious conversation.;
, Be sure to smile warmly so they feel relaxed in your presence. When addressing a group, position yourself so everyone can see you.


Speak loudly enough for them to hear you.
Make eye contact as you talk. , Politely tell your audience that you’d like to perform a magic trick for them. Tell them you’ll need a volunteer. Learn the relationship between the people in your crowd. If they're coworkers, you'll likely want to pick the boss. Confident people tend to make better volunteers and will play along to entertain their employees. Find out your volunteer's name and introduce her to the crowd to make her feel like part of the show. Say ""This is Anna (her name), and she'll be helping me perform today.""
Be firm when choosing a volunteer. Point at them and say ""I want you to help me."" Don't give them a chance to say no or the rest of the audience will think they can say no as well.

, Say “As you can see, these are in no particular order.” Sneak a peek at the last card in the fan. That’s the card you’ll be forcing on your volunteer. Shuffle the cards a few more times but be sure to keep the force card last in the fan.


With your cards fanned out face up, the force card will be at the bottom.
Remember your force card, it's the card you'll be making your volunteer choose later on.

, Flip it over so that the cards are now facing down. The force card is now the top card in the deck.


Now that you know the position of your force card, you're ready to perform the force.

, Say, “Do exactly as I do. Count down off the top of this deck like one, two, three, four, five (the number they choose) and deal a card face down for each number that you count.”


People will rarely pick one. If they do have them pick again.
The idea behind having your volunteer choose a number is making her feel like she is in control of the outcome of the trick., Keep them face down. Put them back on top of the deck. If your volunteer has chosen the number five, your force card will now be the fifth card in the deck.


By rearranging the cards, you are creating the illusion that you are further randomizing the order of the cards.

, She will be reversing what you have just done and bringing the force card back to the top of the deck. Have her place her stack back on top of the deck.


Talk to your audience during this part of the trick not only to keep them entertained but also to distract them from the fact that your volunteer has just reversed your actions.
Jokes can be a great way to distract your audience during this part of the trick, but don’t force it. Showcase your personality., Tell her to look at the card. Let her show it to the crowd. If you've done the trick correctly, she will be holding your force card.


Make sure she doesn't let you see the card. You can even hide your eyes. You want it to be clear to the audience that you cannot see the card.

, In a magnificent gesture, ask her, ""Is the card you're holding the three of spades (your force card)?"" The crowd will be amazed!


Exclaim the card loud enough for everyone to hear you. Make a production of it.
This is your big moment, play it up.

, Hold the deck face up between your thumb and ring finger with your first two fingers gently grasping the force card. Hold your deck so that there is a one inch slant separating the top card from the bottom card.


The top card should be angled towards you and the bottom card should be angled away from you.

, With the cards face up, your force card will be the bottom card in the deck. Gently pull it until it is parallel with the top card in the deck. Don't let your audience see you separate the force card from the rest of the deck. Hold your other hand lightly around the cards to help hide your movements.


Limit the movement of your fingers.
This requires finger dexterity. See the movement from your audience's viewpoint by trying it out in the mirror over and over again until it looks believable., Riffle through the slanted part of the deck over your forefinger. Go slowly to give your volunteer plenty of time to stop you. Continue to keep your force card hidden as you riffle through the deck.


Typically, you want your volunteer to stop you somewhere in the middle of the deck.

, When she says stop, pull the cards in your top hand out of the deck along with your force card. Use your other thumb to hold the rest of the cards in place.


Be smooth. Your force card should meet the other cards in midair.
This action requires speed in performance, but try it in slow motion several times alone and then increase pace., Put them on the table. Take the remaining cards out of the deck and set them aside. The force card should now be on top of the deck.


This must be a very quick motion so that your audience doesn't see you have added the force card.

, Have her look at the card. Tell her to show it to the crowd. If you've done the trick correctly, she will be holding your force card.


Remind her not to tell you what it is. Make sure it's clear to the audience that you cannot see the card.

, In a brilliant display, ask her, ""Is your card the three of spades (your force card)?"" The audience will erupt with applause!


A brief pause can be used to build suspense.
Be a showman. Act like you're reading your volunteers mind and tease her whenever possible.

Hold the card with one hand.,
Grip the long sides of the card with your index finger and pinky (your ""outer fingers"").,
Uncurl your inner fingers to make the card ""disappear."",
Make the card reappear.",How to Make a Card Disappear1," Pinch it between your thumb on one side (either the face or back) and your middle and ring fingers (your ""inner fingers"") together on the opposite (either the face or back).This trick will be much easier to perform with your dominant hand. However, with practice, you may be able to use your non-dominant hand instead.
This trick will not work if your audience is on all sides. You need to make sure the back of your hand can be obscured.;
, Try to grip the card using only the sides of your fingers as tight as you can. Bend the card into a slight arc that is convex in relation to your fingers. Simultaneously, curl your inner fingers by retracting them behind the card. The sections of your inner fingers between your first and second knuckles should be roughly parallel to the card., Straightening your fingers while maintaining your grip will bring the card to the back of your hand. Show your open palm to your audience, but be sure to keep your ring, middle, and index fingers held close together.It will take some practice to make it so the edges of the card do not show through at all. Try to only let the card get halfway down the crevices of your fingers.

, Now that your card has ""disappeared,"" you can even more easily appear to conjure it from thin air. Simply curl your middle fingers forward again and pinch it between your thumb and index finger.Run through these steps as quickly as you can. The faster you move, the more convincing your sleight of hand will be.
Once you've gotten the hang of doing this basic trick, try adding movements with your wrists. This will work to misdirect your audience and disguise your moves.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Begin the trick by holding the now seemingly unbent card in your hand with the celluloid perfectly lined up behind it.,
Ask for a volunteer from the audience.,
Throw the handkerchief to cover both the hand holding the card and the tumbler your assistant is holding underneath.,
Ask your assistant to hold onto the ""card"" in the handkerchief.,
Instruct your assistant to push the ""card"" into the tumbler.,
Take the tumbler back from your assistant.,
Produce the card from your pocket.This may be as simple as simply turning out your pockets, as the audience will wonder how it was able to get there.",How to Make a Card Disappear2," In addition to a playing card, you will need a translucent tumbler-style cup, transparent celluloid, and an opaque handkerchief or a bandana.


Bend the card in half and make sure it is well-creased. Using a face card will disguise the crease. Unbend the card before you begin the trick.
The cup must be wide enough that an unfolded card can be pushed into it while narrow enough that the card must be forced. The glass must also taper towards the bottom. A tumbler that is highly decorated, such as with designs or ridges, will make the trick easier to pull off but is not absolutely necessary.
Cut the celluloid into the exact dimensions of the playing card you are using., Grip the card with your thumb on the bottom and your index finger at its top, bending it slightly to keep the celluloid in place. Make absolutely sure the celluloid is not visible to your audience., Tell your new assistant to call out the name of the card. Request that the volunteer hold the tumbler under the card.


You may also ask your assistant to borrow the handkerchief you need. However, this may backfire if the volunteer offers you a translucent one. If the handkerchief is too clear, your audience may see how the trick is performed.

, Appear to take hold of the card through the handkerchief with the hand you used to cover the card. In reality, quickly fold the card in half and palm it using the hand that originally held it. Place the card into a easy-to-reach pocket for later. Leave the celluloid in its place under the handkerchief., Being the exact size of the card, the celluloid will create an outline giving the impression that the card is still there. The cloth barrier will make the celluloid feel indistinguishable from a playing card to your assistant. Ask your assistant to tell the audience if he or she is holding the playing card seen earlier., Both the celluloid and the tumbler should still be covered by the handkerchief. Tell your assistant and the audience that you will now cause the card to vanish from the cup., Grip the cup from the bottom and flip it over. Remove the handkerchief in plain view of your assistant and the audience. Turn the glass around to show the audience that the card is not inside..

, You may also choose to add some dramatic flourishes, misdirecting the audience away from your pocket. While they are focused on one of your hands, use the other to grab the card. Discreetly introduce your card into the ""action"" to make it seem to appear from nowhere.

Get prepared for your show, where no one can see, by sorting the cards to setup the first ten in your deck so they are in the following order: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A.,
Step before your audience holding your seemingly ordinary pack of cards.,
Drawing from the top (""without"" shuffling the deck), place the cards, one-by-one, ""face down"" on a table in order, beginning on your right and adding them toward your left, then they will be: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, with the A on the left end, and 10 on the right, but only you know that.

,
Explain to a trusted volunteer from your audience that you would like him/her to move one or more cards, one by one, from the left end of the row to the right end of the row, without scrambling, flipping them or looking at them.,
Turn back again once your volunteer tells you that s/he has completed this movement.

,
Look at the first card on the right end of the row without letting anyone see it; this tells you the number of cards the volunteer moved.

,
Say aloud, ""You moved ___ cards (fill the number)"", and bow to hear the applause.

",How to Do Your First Card Trick," The suit (color and kind) does not matter. Put them on the deck face down and back into their pack. (This would be called ""stacking the deck"", and it would be cheating, if you were actually playing cards off the deck as you fixed it up, without shuffling them, but this is a trick...);
, (Someone can introduce your act, telling them that you are going to amaze them with this magic.) Carefully remove the cards from the pack. (This is just one of many easy card tricks on wikiHow.)

,, Explain it again. Turn away from your volunteer, so that you can't see which or how many cards have been moved.

Use a strip of plastic to perform the trick.,
Purchase a pre-manufactured card.,
Pick your angles well.",How to Levitate a Card1," Take a normal, standard deck card. You will also need a small strip of plastic, about three fourths the length of the card. It should be thick enough that it’s sturdy but still flexible. You don't need special plastic. You can use what you have around the house.Tape or hot glue the strip of plastic to the card, lengthwise. Your card is done being rigged. Tape the middle of it to the back of the card. This works best with a clear piece of plastic. If it is too hard to hold the piece of plastic with your palm, try a wider or longer piece. Perform the trick. Hold one end of the plastic on your thumb, with the other end on your middle finger. Then bring your fingers together, making the plastic go up in an arc. If you angle the card correctly towards the audience, it will appear as if the card is floating.;
, These cards come with a clear plastic strip attached to the card by the center. If you get one of those, levitation is simple.


Pinch the ends of the strip with two creases in your hand. Then, bend the strip, in a way that looks natural for your hand. For the best effect, you may want to utilize a substance that is clear and will look invisible to your audience.
Once you have done this, you can tape/glue the center of the strip to the center of your card. You have now created your own special levitating card.

, Levitating cards is all about the effect. A good angle can give an illusion to someone close that the card appears to levitate 1/2 an inch for a split moment. Practice in the mirror.When performing this trick with an audience, try to hold your hand lower so they cannot see the plastic underneath. It's best performed with good lighting, so the shadow can be seen.The real magic of levitation is playing the angles to make the spectator's mind see the card as levitating. This comes from rehearsing various levitation methods on friends and in the mirror in order to learn how to position your angles correctly.

Grip the deck with three fingers.,
Place your thumb on top of the deck.,
Flick the top card with your thumb.,
Practice until the move is consistent.,
Catch the card.",How to Flick a Card," Place your index finger and ring finger on opposite, long sides of the deck, and your middle finger on the short side between them. You're now holding the deck with the sides of your finger, between the first and second knuckles. Keep your palm and pinky finger off of the deck.






;
, Tuck your thumb back into the space between your three fingers. Press the tip against the deck with moderate pressure. Some magicians keep the thumb near the middle of this space, while others pull it back to the corner near the ring finger.







, Move your thumb outward across the card, toward the far corner. Flick your thumb off the card as it moves. This motion should pivot the card around your index finger and send it flying and spinning.









Make sure your thumb is moving along a curve. If you flick it straight, the card may flick the wrong direction or fail to flick.

, It can take some time to figure out exactly how this motion works. Experiment with the following until you can get it every time:









Your thumb and the grip of your fingers should apply moderate pressure. Adjust if the card keeps slipping, or buckles too far to move easily.
Speed up the movement of your thumb for better results.
Rotate your wrist as you flick for additional force.

, Catching the card can actually be more difficult than flicking it, in terms of how much practice it takes. Once you can flick consistently in the same direction, try to catch it with your other hand. It may help to watch the card as it leaves your hand, and follow it with your eyes.








If you're not confident you can catch it, flick the card directly at a spectator instead when you perform. This won't derail the act in the same way dropping the card could.

Buy a hummer card.,
Use invisible thread.,
Try using fishing line.,
Poke a hole with a needle through the center of a card.",How to Levitate a Card2," You may find this special card at a magic shop or some other store. It requires a playing card, along with string. The black string comes in thick threads.You have to carefully pull out a strand of string about arm's length. One end of the string is taped or stuck to the back of your (dominant side) ear, and the other end is taped or stuck with putty to the top face of the card.
With the card in your hands, all you must do is spin it in order to make it look like a flying saucer card. From there, you can lift the string with the inside of your thumb to move it around making it look like you are levitating the card. It is ideal to wear a dark shirt (preferably black) to better hide the string from the audience.

, Many people levitate a card using a magic trick tool called Invisible Thread. You can find this thread online or at magic stores.All you have to do is wrap the thread around your wrist. Then you can bring it out when you need it with an easy twist of the wrist.
Nobody will notice, and then you can just wrap the string around the cards and make them fly into the air and levitate. The key part about this trick is to make your audience buy it. So you have to be pretty good at acting.<

, Tie the clear fishing line around your finger, and tie the other end around the card, and practice.


Use a clear string that is also strong, and tape it to the card.
Then tape the other side of the string to your ear and move your hands around to make it look like it is levitating.

, Then find a very fine thread, put it through the hole, and tie a knot on the bottom.


Tape the top of the thread to your hand. From a distance, use your pinky or thumb to lift up the last (or second to last) card.
This will make it look like it's levitating. Again, take care to watch your angles, and don't stand too close to the audience when you do the trick.

Use your fingers to levitate the card.,
Make static with straws.",How to Levitate a Card3," When levitating a card, you would face the deck of cards so that the audience sees the front of the cards.


Hold the deck of cards so that your index finger is behind the deck of cards, hidden from the audience. Simply use your index finger to lift the back card (the one closest to you) up.It helps to use your other hand to pretend you're ""levitating"" the card to add to the visual effect. From an audience point of view, it looks like a random card in the middle of the deck is levitating, not the back card.

, Get two straws. Take the wrapper about 3/4ths from the top and tear it around so you can take it off, but do not take it off yet.


Rub the majority part of the paper on the straw to create static friction, and quickly take the majority paper off. Absorb the static in your hands by putting the charged straws on them (Note: this will create a positive and negative charge on your hands, which will create force in between them the closer you put your hands together.)
Hold the card on one hand, and push the other hand over the card. If done correctly, the card will react to the forces of the charge, and will levitate!

, Tell him to take one last look at it before it goes through to the other side of the table.

, Slap it to demonstrate, then pound it to demonstrate. When you slap it, let go of the card you have hidden in your right hand and leave it on top of the middle deck.Slapping the deck is just a decoy to get the hidden card from your right hand onto the middle deck. Tell your friend it is part of the magic.

, Your friend will think this is his card, but it is the card you had hidden in your right hand. Move this card to the top of the pile on your right.

, Add the middle deck to the top of the deck you just picked up.


Your friend’s card will now be on the top of the deck you are holding.

, Put the deck in your hand under the table with your left hand. Simultaneously slap the deck on the table with your right hand., Have you friend lift card from the top of your deck to reveal his card.

This move is intended to throw off anyone watching you shuffle the deck., While still holding the bottom half of the cards, spin your hand in a circle so the bottom half of the deck does a full 180-degree motion around the top half of the deck. This will look like you made a circle around half of the deck with the other half of the deck., Now throw the bottom of the deck onto the table. Even though it's always been the bottom side of the deck, an untrained eye will become confused and think that you threw down the top half of the deck first because of what you did in the last step., Now you'll complete the illusion by slapping the top half of the cards over the bottom half of the cards. The cards are now in the exact same order, but people will think that you cut them."

This is to store the card in your wallet, and brag that you'll bet a dollar on your ability to do the trick.,
In a large venue or somewhere where betting is not appropriate, take the pre-arranged card from a jumbo deck (available at most joke stores) and tape this card to your shirt at the breast or on the back, beneath a sweater or suit coat.,

Hand your friend a stack of twenty one playing cards.,

, You should have three columns of seven cards in front of you. Have your friend tell you which pile contains their card (without telling you which card it is, of course).

, For example if the first pile contained their card, you could pick up the third pile first, then the first pile (containing the card) and then the second pile -- or the second pile, then the first, then the third. It is very important that the pile containing their card goes into the middle.

, When done, you will have dealt the cards out a total of 3 times.

,, You can tell them it was magic... or you could explain the simple math that makes it work. Each time you deal out the cards you are dividing the placement of the card. By the 3rd time you have gotten the card into the middle of the pile. Thus you are able to tell where their card will be every time. The formula is Y=(X + 1)/2, where X is the number of cards and Y is the placement of the card in the pile after the 3rd deal. In this case, since X is 21, Y = 22/2 = 11.

The two aces are removed and put to the side. You fan out the deck and let the participant choose a secret card at random. They then put it back and shuffle the deck. The two Aces are then placed face up on the top of the deck and cut into the middle. Suddenly, with a snap of the finger, the deck is laid back out and the secret card will be face down between the two Aces.






;
, You can use any two cards you want, but the Aces have a little symbolic value that makes them seem more important. Make sure you remember which two aces they are, but this should be easy.








, Have them pull it out and look it, then set it on the top of the deck. For this example, assume they pulled the Jack of Diamonds.








, In order to make the trick look more legit, you'll have to shuffle the deck. But you need to remember where the Jack of Diamonds is, or the trick is useless.

Quickly slide the two aces around the top card to sandwich it. To do so, you'll need to have some separation between the two aces, too. To pull it off.

If you're left handed, you can reverse all of the above directions and hold the deck on the left side.

, You'll basically be showing the card off to the person in front of you, but since you're not really dealing this is no big deal. You want to deal the card ""standing.""








, Only this corner needs to touch. Push from your index finger (on the upper-right corner) to curl the card away from you. As you press, the card will bend, and the piece of the card on the table will start to slip.








, This needs to happen quickly, in one fluid motion, to work. Repetition is key, as you just need to get used to the bend of the cards so you can control it.








, Once you can make the card jump, you need to stick the landing. You should practice the movement so that the card always shoots back face down. From there, work on lowering your other hand (holding the deck) so that the card can easily slide back on. It can help to use the ""jumping hand"" to follow the card back to the deck, allowing you to re-adjust any mistakes and make the whole thing smoother.

When you show your audience the 4 Jacks, you will hide these 3 secret cards behind the Jacks., You will need to tell a story to go along with this card trick. The story typically states that there a 4 robbers who are going to rob a bank. The robbers are unsure of where the safe is, so they split up throughout the bank. One robber goes to the basement, one goes to the first floor, one goes to the second floor, and the fourth robber stays on the roof as the lookout. The alarm tips off the cops, so the lookout needs to send a signal to the other robbers that it's time to leave.

, This will be another one of your secret cards. Explain that this robber went to the first floor of the bank to look for the safe. Make sure no one sees the face of this card.

, This will be your last secret card. Explain that this robber went to the second floor to look for the safe. Like the other secret cards, make sure nobody sees the face of this card.

, This will be a Jack. Tell the audience that this is the look-out robber who will be staying on the roof of the bank.Your audience thinks the cards you just returned to the deck were the Jacks you showed them at the start.

, Explain to your audience that the cops were tipped off and the lookout robber had to send a signal to his accomplices. Then, tap the deck to make it look like you're doing magic.


You don't have to tap the deck. Instead, you can say a magic word or do a special hand movement. The point is to make it seem like you're doing something magical with your deck of cards.

, After you've done your magic move, reveal the 4 Jacks, one at a time, that are on top of the deck. Explain that all 4 robbers escaped to the roof on time, and got away with robbing the bank. Your audience will be blown away that all of the Jacks ended up back to the top of the deck."

Determine the correct length of wood you need.,
Know what wood to look for.,
Find a location to collect wood from.,
Use your pocket saw to balded and cut around the limb.

,
Once you cut completely around the limb, cut through it as straight as possible.

,Alternatively, use a ratchet pruner, which can cut diameters up to more than a inch.,
Remove the bark completely, or leave the second layer.,
Shave off the bumps with a shaving plane if you removed the bark completely.,
If you want to decorate it, do whatever you like.,
Seal it.",How to Collect Wood to Make a Walking Stick," It is recommended that you collect limbs that are equal to your height. This will give a starting stick longer than needed, but this allows for any mistakes made during the cutting. The typical default length for walking canes used for getting around normally in town is 36 inches, longer ones are often preferred for extended hiking.;
, It may be possible to cut at the thicker end just beyond a bend, curve or burl which serves as a hand grip and is highly decorative.


Look for dead wood. An ideal walking stick should be stiff, and living wood may at first be too flexible. In addition, taking wood from a living forest may be environmentally damaging or even illegal in some locations.
The wood from dead Aspen trees make beautiful smooth walking sticks.

,

In the desert, some cactus trunks make great sticks. (Note - there are laws in some areas against collecting cactus limbs or trunks.)
Do not go to your local park and start cutting away. There are laws against damaging public property. In some places it is considered vandalism (exception: you might get permission to trim away a dead branch). Find a forest or heavy wooded area. Be respectful of other people's rights. If you are in a fenced-in area, a lot or behind some one's home be careful. Do not trespass. Consider what may happen if you are reported. Get permission first! Some species of trees are protected.
If taking wood from a live tree, try to collect only a dead branch, or one that is low enough to be a nuisance to persons walking nearby. Take from an area that could tolerate some thinning-- in fact, thinning even promotes growth of the saplings that are not collected. If possible leave a portion of the sapling with at least one branch with leaves.

,,,, The second layer of most bark looks pretty nice on most trees.

Use a soft brush.,
Wipe the wood with a microfiber cloth.,
Perform routine cleaning.",How to Clean Unfinished Wood1," A soft brush is good for brushing away small pieces of debris trapped inside the grooves and ridges of the unfinished wood. Use the soft brush to gently wipe away anything caught in the crevices and then vacuum it up.For best results, use a gentle flicking motion with the bristles of the brush on the surface of the wood.
A soft brush will also prevent damage to the wood because it employs a gentle touch.
Additionally, you can use a microfiber mop or broom.;
, Using a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the surface of a piece of unfinished wood is a simple and easy technique for cleaning the wood. This method is best for surface dirt that is not ingrained very deeply. Just run the microfiber cloth along the surface of the wood to pick up any excess dust and dirt.Make sure the microfiber cloth is clean ahead of time. You can wash it in the sink with soap and water (and then let it fully air dry) or you can wash it in the washing machine and toss it in the dryer before use.

, In order to keep your unfinished wood from needing more aggressive cleaning techniques, it’s best to perform regular cleaning maintenance. If you let the wood remain untreated, you will eventually be forced to do more potentially damaging treatments to get the wood clean.


This means that you should dust or sweep your unfinished wood often (at least once a week), as well as wiping it down with a microfiber cloth a couple of times each month.

Clean with a vacuum and a stiff brush.,
Use adhesive rubber.,
Employ erasing compounds.,
Apply mineral spirits.",How to Clean Unfinished Wood2," Using a stiffer brush on the surface of your unfinished wood may be more useful for wood that has dirt and other debris more deeply ingrained in the grain of the wood. Wipe the unfinished wood and vacuum up any fragments that become loose.Be careful not to rub the stiff bristles on the wood to harshly, as this may damage the wood.
This method is most effective on unfinished wood that is already in good condition.

, This natural rubber product is often used to clean unfinished wood. It is very sticky and pliable, meaning that it can be forced into the smaller crevices on the surface of the wood and the dirt will be attracted to it and stick to the rubber. Apply the rubber to the surface and gently knead it to work it into the grain of the wood. As it becomes darker (this means it is attracting a lot of dirt), you can tear off the top layer to reveal fresh layers to do more work.This method is especially effective for areas that are harder to reach with other cleaning techniques.

, Erasing compounds are elements used to remove dirt from bare wood surfaces. Simply apply a small amount of the erasing compound on the surface of the unfinished wood and use some cotton balls to work the cleaning material into the grain of the wood. Gently swirl the cotton balls in circular motions for best results. Once finished, vacuum up the remnants of the erasing compound from the surface of the wood.Be sure to avoid rubbing the wood too harshly as this could cause damage.
Once the erasing compound turns grey in color, it is no longer effective and you should reapply.

, Mineral spirits are a kind of solvent that painters often use when cleaning their used painting brushes. Dampen a towel with the solution and gently wipe the surface of your unfinished wood. Be sure to wear gloves while you are handling the mineral spirits and avoid directly inhaling the fumes.Because this is a type of liquid treatment, you must be very careful and apply the mineral spirits sparingly to avoid damaging the wood.

Avoid wet cleaning methods.,
Test your cleaning method.,
Be gentle.",How to Clean Unfinished Wood3," Water can be extremely damaging to unfinished wood. Being exposed to water can cause unfinished wood to swell or become warped in size and shape. At the very least, it will most likely leave you with a finished product that is different from what you expected or intended to happen.Using a wet cleaning method can also cause the wood to become harder to finish later, if that is part of your eventual plan for the unfinished wood.

, In order to avoid potentially damaging your unfinished wood, you should try to test your proposed cleaning method beforehand. Choose a small, inconspicuous piece of the wood that won’t be too noticeable if you do accidentally damage the wood.Try to choose a piece that is on the backside of the wood or otherwise less visible for your testing.
Additionally, choosing several small pieces to test ahead of time will also help ensure that your chosen cleaning method will result in an overall consistent surface for the finished product.

, When you are cleaning unfinished wood, it is very important to work slowly and to use a gentle hand. The finish or varnish applies to many types of wood protects it from the elements and from being damaged very easily. Without this, unfinished wood is quite susceptible to scratches and other kinds of destruction.Use cation when brushing the surface of the wood or using the vacuum on the wood. Being too rough can cause visible and lasting imperfections.

Double check your calculations.",How to Calculate Board Feet," Use a stiff tape measure to measure the length, width, and depth of the board. Each measurement should be taken separately and recorded in inches.


Using this method of calculation, you must know the length, width, and depth of each board in inches. Round fractional sizes to the nearest quarter-inch.
Note that board thickness is always expressed in quarter-inches, even when you have a whole number. In other words, 1-inch thick board would be expressed as four-quarter (4/4) board. When calculating board feet, however, you should still use the actual measured number of inches for the sake of simplicity.
If you are buying pre-measured, marked hardwood from a reliable source, you can skip this step and begin your calculations. Measuring the hardwood board yourself is always recommended when possible, though.

Example: Calculate board feet for five-quarter (5/4) hardwood measuring 26 inches long and 4.5 inches wide.

Note that “five-quarter” hardwood is 1.25 inches thick.

;
, Multiply the measured length, width, and depth of the board. Write down the product of all three measurements.


During this part of the calculation, you are actually determining the volume of the board. As such, your answer will need to be in cubic inches.

Example: length * width * depth = 26 inches * 4.5 inches * 1.25 inches = 146.25 cubic inches

, Divide the product you just calculated by 144 cubic inches. Write down the quotient you calculate.Note that 1 board foot equals 144 cubic inches. That is the reason you must divide the board volume—the number of cubic inches—by 144.Example: 146.25 cubic inches / 144 cubic inches = 1.02 board feet

, You should now know the board feet of the hardwood you're looking at. Run through the calculations one more time to verify your answer.



Example: Board feet = / 144 = / 144 = 146.25 / 144 = 1.02 board feet


, Use a stiff tape measure to measure the length of the board. Record this measurement in feet.


When using this method of calculation, you need to know the length of the hardwood board in feet and not in inches. Fractional feet should be written as x / 12, with x equaling the number of inches.
It is always a good idea to measure the hardwood boards yourself before purchasing them. If you intend to buy pre-measured, marked hardwood boards from a trusted source, however, you can technically skip the measuring steps and jump directly into the calculations.

Example: Calculate board feet for a piece of hardwood measuring 2-2/12 feet long.

The fraction here can be simplified, giving you a measurement of 2-1/6 feet.
Alternatively, you can divide the fraction into a decimal, giving you a measurement of 2.17 feet.



, Use the same stiff tape measure to measure the width and depth of the same board. Take each measurement separately and record them both in inches.


Width and depth are both measured in inches, not in feet. Round fractional sizes to the nearest quarter-inch.
Board depth/thickness is referred to by the quarter-inch, so 1-inch thick board would be described as four-quarter board. You will still use the actual number of inches in your board feet calculation, though.

Example: Calculate board feet for 2.17 feet of five-quarter (5/4) hardwood measuring 4.5 inches wide.

Note that ""five-quarter"" hardwood is 1.25 inches thick.



, Multiply the length measurement with the width and depth measurements. Write down the product of all three measurements.


You're actually calculating the volume of the board during this step. Since one of the measurements is not in inches, however, the product will not be in cubic inches. Instead, it will be in feet by squared inch (ft*in2).

Example: length * width * depth = 2.17 feet * 4.5 inches * 1.25 inches = 12.21 ft/in2


, Divide the product you just calculated by the number 12. Save the quotient you calculate during this step.Since the calculated board volume is in ft*in2 instead of cubic inches, you cannot divide the volume by the amount of cubic inches per board foot (144 cubic inches).
Instead, you must divide the volume by a measurement taken in ft*in2. There are 12 ft*in2 per board foot.

Example: 12.21 ft/in2 / 12 ft/in2 = 1.02 board feet

, At this point, you've already calculated the board feet of the hardwood board in front of you. It is still a good idea to work through the same calculations one more time to verify the accuracy of your answer, though.



Example: Board feet = / 12 = / 12 = 12.21 / 12 = 1.02 board feet


, Use either method of calculation to find the board feet of each piece of wood you plan to purchase.


Note that this will only work if there is one consistent cost per board foot for each piece of wood included in your total board footage. Do not include boards priced at a different rate in your cost calculation.

Example: Calculate the cost of three separate pieces of hardwood available at a price of $5.45 per board foot. The first piece is 4.3 board feet, the second is 6.8 board feet, and the third is an even 2 board feet.

, Once you have calculated the board feet of each piece of hardwood, add the amounts together to find the total board footage.



Example: Total board footage = 4.3 board feet + 6.8 board feet + 2 board feet = 13.1 board feet

, Multiply the total board footage by the price per board foot of the hardwood.



Example: Total board footage * cost per board foot = 13.1 board feet * $5.45 = $71.40

, You should now know the cost of the hardwood based on board footage. Verify the accuracy of your answer by working through the calculations again.



Example: Total cost = total board footage * cost per board foot = 13.1 * 5.45 = $71.40

Taxidermists often use larger pieces of driftwood to mount their hunting trophy specimens, or for scenes that have been created to recreate natural animal habitat displays. Driftwood is a popular choice for taxidermists because it provides a natural foundation to showcase their art. Taxidermists can usually buy driftwood through taxidermy supply stores, or they may commission larger pieces from landscapers.;
,


Artists can usually find smaller pieces of driftwood at larger art supply stores, or they can shop at a variety of online stores. Many online stores will show pictures and approximate dimensions of each piece of driftwood, so that you can get a sense of how large each piece is. Each piece of driftwood is unique; seeing a picture can really inspire great works of art.

,


Driftwood is the perfect decoration for fish tanks and terrariums. Fish, lizards, snakes and amphibians love lounging on or around the natural beauty of driftwood. Driftwood pieces, in these sorts of habitats, also provide a base from which you can grow plant life, and they provide a home for the animals. Most pet supply or fish supply stores will carry a selection of driftwood pieces, though larger pieces may need to be specially ordered either through the shop or from an online source.

,


Large pieces of hauntingly beautiful driftwood can also be used as landscape decorations. Many landscape supply stores will carry a selection of driftwood pieces, or they can help you order exactly what you're looking for.

Find a space to work.,
Get acquainted with a Dremel and the attachments.,
Select wood to be carved.,
Make a design for your carving.,
Select a cutting head.,
Transfer design onto the wood to be carved.,
Cut an outline around the desired area.,
Start carving away the unwanted space.,
Remove sawdust frequently.,
Remove any rough spots.,
Retouch any areas as needed.,
Paint or varnish final carving if needed.",How to Carve Wood with a Dremel Tool," Carving wood is very messy, loud, and requires lots of lighting. A workbench is preferable because you might need to clamp your wood down if necessary.;
, To change the attachment, hold the blue lock button located at the cutting end and turn the head lock counterclockwise to loosen, and clockwise to tighten. This can be done either with the wrench that comes with the Dremel, or any other wrench as long as it doesn't strip the lock.

, Pine is very easy to cut and is an example of a soft wood, and is more difficult to detail than a hard wood, such as mahogany. Your choice will also vary based on the project you are working on.

, Make sure to measure the area to avoid running out of space or any other design constraints.

, Dremel cutting heads and tools are sold individually or in kits. The cutting heads generally are very small and have round heads with cutting grooves. A basic carving kit will contain 11 cutting and smoothing heads and costs around $15 in any hardware store.

, You can create a stencil and trace an image, or draw it by hand depending on your artistic ability.

, Holding your Dremel just like a pencil, start cutting around the image. To prevent any bite when carving, keep the speed setting on a higher speed. It's also a good idea to start with a small cutting head first and work your way up as needed.

, Cutting away the negative space is generally the way to carve, and will create an image that contrasts against the background, and how deep you want to go is entirely up to you. With enough experience, you will be able to shape objects three-dimensionally from the wood.

, Make sure to clean away any sawdust often to see what you have carved. Piles of sawdust can build up and appear like areas yet to be cut and mistakes can be made, such as cutting something you didn't want to.

, Depending on how rough or smooth you want your image to appear, sand or buff any unwanted areas or ruts and gouges from carving.

, Make sure any lines that need to be straight are straight. It's better to wait until the end of the carving to address any imperfections than at the beginning, and can be done with either the sanding heads or the smallest cutting heads.

, Sealing or painting your cut really finishes off your work by giving it something extra, and it protects it for longer than natural wood would be protected.

Enjoy your new planter box!








",How to Build a Wooden Planter Box," Your decision should be based on how many plants you want to have in each planter, as well as the size of the area where you will be putting your planter. For this article, we will build a smaller box that is about 4 feet by 2 feet (121.9 by 60.9cm).






;
, Untreated wood or cedar will work well for this project as they are both easy to work with and can hold up against the natural elements your planter will be exposed to. For a small 4x2 ft (121.9x60.9 cm) planter, you can buy a 12-foot (365.76-cm) board, which you will cut down to form the sides of the planter. The width should be at least 10 inches (24 cm).You will also need a piece that will act as the bottom or floor of the planter if your planter is going to be used on a deck or similar surface. If the box will be over soil, you can place a layer of flattened cardboard boxes on the bottom to act as a weed barrier.








Pressure-treated lumber contains chemicals that will kill plants in the box and can things like arsenic to your food if you are growing vegetables. A safe alternative is using ACQ-treated wood, a process which does not use any toxic chemicals., Use a measuring tape to measure out each side. Mark the places where you will make your cut with a pen or pencil. Use an electric saw or standard hand saw to cut the pieces to size (two 2 foot boards and two 4 foot boards), taking care to make the cuts as straight as possible.








If you do not have a saw of any kind, or prefer to not make the cuts yourself, you can ask the workers where you purchased your wood to cut it down to the measurements you need. You may need to pay a small fee, but some lumber and hardware stores will cut your planks down to size for free.

, Pilot holes are holes drilled into the wood to ensure that the wood won’t splinter when you insert the screws into it. You only need to do this on the two end boards (the shorter boards). You should make three pilot holes, 3/4 inch (1.91 cm) from the end edge of the board. The middle hole should be centered in the middle of the width of the board.








, Galvanized screws are better for outdoor planters because the galvanized metal can stand up to the elements and will not rust. Line the boards up so that the boards with the pilot holes are positioned on the outside corners. Use a drill and drill bit to make sure that each screw goes through each hole and into the adjoining board.








You can also use a screwdriver, rather than a drill and drill bit.

, With these measurements, cut your bottom board using a saw. Place the board inside the box. Use a drill and galvanized screws to attach the bottom board through the sides of the box.








Remember, this is only necessary if you plan to put the planter on a deck or similar surface.

, Turn your now fully-formed box over and use your drill to create four or five drainage holes in the bottom of the box. These holes are very important, as most plants will develop diseases if they get ‘soggy feet’, meaning that their roots sit in very wet soil for too long.









If you have constructed a much larger planter box, you should consider adding a few more drainage holes.
Again, if your planter will be over soil, this is not necessary. Simply use flattened cardboard as the bottom of your box.

, Doing this will protect the wood of your planter. Cut the screen so that it is the same size as the board you used for the bottom of the planter. Lay it in the bottom of the planter and fix in place with some small nails. Make sure that you remember to drill drainage holes in the screen that line up with the drainage holes in the bottom board if your box has a bottom.







, Doing this will give your box a nice finished look, but it is not absolutely necessary to do. Take a sander or a piece of sandpaper and run it along the edges and corners of the box. Run it along the sides of the boards to vanquish any potential splinters.







, Pick out some paint that matches your backyard or home’s decor, or stain your planter to really bring out the wood’s colors. You can also choose to leave your wood alone, as cedar is a beautiful wood all by itself.









Do not treat the inside of your planter, as this may contaminate the soil and your plants. Instead, use use a plastic liner (with holes) to protect the wood.

, The gravel will help to drain the planter box. The type of soil or compost you use will depend on the types of plants or flowers you intend to add to your planter box.







, Don't forget to water! For ideas on types of flowers and plants you can add to a planter box, click here.

Hold the knife correctly.,
Carve along the grain.,
Practice a few basic cuts.,
Wear safety supplies.,

Secure the wood.,
Cut the basic shape.,
Rough out the form.,
Add fine details.,
Protect the finished piece.",How to Carve," There are four main types of wood carving: whittling, relief carving, carving in the round, and chip carving.Choose the style you prefer and learn about it in greater detail.


Whittling is an old carving style primarily done with the use of a stiff-handled whittling knife. The knife leaves behind sharp, angular strokes, and the finished pieces are usually small and three-dimensional.
Relief carving is the art of carving figures into a flat wooden panel. The image appears three-dimensional from the front, but the back remains flat. You'll need a variety of hand tools to complete a relief carving.
Carving in the round is probably the most life-like technique. You'll use a variety of tools to create this type of carved sculpture, and the finished piece will be three-dimensional, with softer, more natural lines.
Chip carving primarily relies on the use of knives, chisels, and hammers. You'll chip away at the wood little by little to create three-dimensional patterns on a wood board, but the back of the piece will remain flat.;
, As a general rule, the wood you use should be somewhat soft. Purchase labeled, higher quality wood from a craft store or wood supplier instead of getting it from a generic lumber pile.Basswood, butternut, and white pine are among the best woods to use, especially for beginners. These are soft woods, which makes them easy to carve, but basswood has a fine grain, butternut has a coarse grain, and white pine has a medium grain. Basswood is best for whittling, but you can use butternut and white pine for nearly any carving technique.
Mahogany and black walnut both have medium grains and are somewhat difficult to carve since these woods are a little harder.
Cherry, sugar maple, and white oak are all very hard to carve due to their level of hardness. Cherry and sugar maple have fine grains, but white oak has a medium to coarse grain. When carved properly, however, all three woods can create excellent finished pieces.

, The knife you choose must be sharp, easy to grip, and rigid. Retractable blades are often unsafe since they can collapse under pressure, so a standard pocket knife may not work well.


Chip carving knifes are your best option. The blade is roughly 1.5 inches (3.5 cm) long, and the handle is long enough to sit comfortably in your hand. Choose one made of high carbon steel so that it remains sharp and intact for a long time.If you're just starting out and don't want to make an investment yet, consider using a utility knife or craft knife. Just make sure that the blade is sharp and fixed. You must also be able to hold the handle for prolonged periods without experiencing discomfort.

, Gouges are curved tools used to ""scoop"" the wood instead of cutting it. You'll use gouges to carve, shape, and smooth surfaces.


U-gouges have curved shafts and curved cutting edges. When purchasing u-gouges, note that the cutting edges vary in width between 1/16 inch (2 mm) and 2-3/8 inches (60 mm), and the shape of the shaft can be straight, bent, back-bent, or spoon.
V-gouges have angled tips that meet in a ""V"" shaped point. The cutting edge can range in width between 1/16 inch (2 mm) and 1-2/5 inch (30 mm). The sides can also meet at a 60-degree or 90-degree angle.
Bent and spoon gouges are specialty tools that make it easier to reach certain areas of the wood carving. They aren't always necessary, but they'll be good to have if you get serious about the hobby.

, Chisels are sharp, flat tools used in conjunction with rubber mallets. Good chisels are especially important for wood chipping practices.


Basic carpenter's chisels have flat edges that dig into the wood at a sharp angle.
Skewed chisels also have flat edges, but they tilt back at a 45-degree angle, which allows you to make cuts that are slightly less blunt.
Traditional mallets are technically made of heavy wood, but rubber mallets are less noisy and generally cause less damage to the handle of the chisel upon repeated impact.

, It's always a good idea to practice some basic cuts on scrap wood before working on any major piece. Doing so will give you the opportunity to become familiar with the tools. also, make sure to never cut towards your body, cut away from you in case the knife slips to avoid a trip to hospital.


Always use sharp tools, even if you're only practicing. If the tools are sharp enough, they should make a clean, shiny cut through the wood without leaving any nicks or streaks behind.

, When you need to push a knife, gouge, or chisel through the wood, keep your hands behind the sharp cutting edge. These tools can slip as you work, and if your fingers are in front of the blade, it'll result in an injury.


When working with knives, grasp the wood with your non-dominant hand. Keep the hand behind the blade of the tool, but carefully press the thumb of that hand against the blunt side of the tool to help control it. While holding your non-dominant hand steady, rotate your dominant hand and wrist to make the desired cut.
When working with gouges, hold the handle in the palm of your dominant hand while steadying the shaft by pinching it between the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand. The cutting edge should rest against the wood.
Remember to control the direction of the carving tool with your wrist and not your elbow. This is true regardless of the cut or tool used.

, Always make your cuts along the grain instead of working against it. Cutting up against the grain will cause the wood to splinter.


Examine the wood and find the long, parallel lines running through it. These lines may or may not run parallel to the sides of the board, and they will be somewhat wavy instead of rigidly straight.
Always carve in a downward direction onto those lines of grain. You can also carve diagonally across the grain or parallel to it, but do not carve up against the grain.
If the wood begins to tear as you carve it even though the tool is sharp, you might be carving in the wrong direction. Switch to the opposite direction and check the results again.

, There are numerous cuts you'll need to learn as you practice this craft, but when you're first starting out, you should at least practice a few of the basics.The running cut creates a long channel in the wood. Hold the blade of a U-gouge or V-gouge to the surface of the wood and push it across the grain, keeping the pressure as even as possible.
A stabbing cut creates sharp carvings in the surface of the wood, allowing you to create hard shadows. Push the cutting edge of a gouge straight into the wood, then pull it out without pushing it any further.
Sweep cuts are long arc-shaped cuts. Use a gouge to push across the grain, rotating the handle as you push it forward to create an arc.

, Carving can be dangerous if you aren't careful, so you should consider wearing some basic safety supplies to protect yourself.


Wear a carving glove on your non-dominant hand, or the hand you hold the wood with.
Cover your eyes with safety glasses, too. Wood chips will start flying, and even if the piece is small, stray scraps can still find their way into your eyes if you don't protect yourself.

, When possible, use a pencil to lightly sketch the intended cuts and gouges before picking up any of your tools.


These lines can create guides, which will make it easier to remain precise. You may make mistakes if a tool slips, but you won't make mistakes based on miscalculation.
If you do make mistakes, there's no going back. You'll need to alter your original plan to incorporate the mistake or start over with new wood.

, Ideally, you should hold the wood piece in place by clamping onto the table or inside a vise. Doing so will free both hands, making it easier to work.


Never keep the wood in your lap as you carve it.
For small carvings, like whittled pieces, you can hold the wood in your non-dominant hand as you work. Keep your non-dominant hand behind the cutting edge of the tool.

, Remove as much wood as possible until you can visualize the basic shape of the final piece within the block of wood.


For small pieces, you can cut the basic shape using knives or chisels. For larger pieces, you may need to use a band saw or chain saw.
Don't be afraid of cutting away too much. As long as you do not cut past your sketched guidelines, you won't ruin the wood. You can go slow if doing so makes you feel more comfortable, but it can take a long time to obtain even a basic shape if you're too shy with your tools.

, After obtaining the basic shape, use large u-gouges to remove as much excess material as possible until the overall form of the piece develops.Identify the largest planes and work on those forms first. As the larger shapes come into focus, gradually ease your way to the smaller, more well-defined forms.

, Once the overall form is complete, switch to your smaller tools and add detail to the carving.


While you should always have razor sharp tools, it's especially important during this step. Dull tools can nick the surface of the wood and ruin the appearance of the carving.
Work on one area of the carving at a time. Complete the larger details and foreground details first, then progress to the small details and background.

, If you're satisfied with your work and want to preserve the carving, you'll need to apply a wood finish that can protect the surface from moisture, oils, dirt, and other debris.Paste wax is relatively clear and allows the natural color of the wood to come through. It works well for decorative carvings but can wear off when applied to frequently handled carvings.
Danish oil can tint the color of the wood slightly, but it tends to be quite durable and can be used for frequently handled carvings.
Spray urethane and polyurethane are the most durable finishes and generally last for long periods even if the carving is handled frequently. You'll need to apply the finish during moderate, dry weather and allow it to dry thoroughly in between coats.

Determine the correct proportions.,
Understand that it will need to be strong, heavy and durable.,
Make a level surface.,
Now lay your first sheet of mid grade plywood or MDF on top of the 2x4's.,
Start laying the inside grid of squares.,
Build your outside box frame, use the 1x2 lumber, pre-drill holes or use a brad nailer and glue.,
Cut your 1x2 lumber to the proper lengths for the grid, use long pieces the length of the bench and short 1x2's across the width.

,
Place the short strips at their pre-determined location of the grid against the outside frame along the length of the bench.,
With the short strips in place for the first row, you can now add a long strip in the same manner, glue and screws in pre-drilled holes or brad nails.,
You can now place more short strips into place as you did the first row of short strips, glue and screw or brad nail them in place making sure they are square to the long strip.,
Now you can place another long strip in the same manner as the last long strip and then add the short strips as the previous row with glue screws and or brad nails.,
Let the glue dry overnight before doing anything else.,
When the glue has dried overnight, get help and turn the bottom and grid over placing it back on the 2x4s you used to make a nice flat level surface.,
When the brad nailing on the bottom is complete, you can again turn over the bottom, again check for flatness and square.,
Once the new torsion box is together, you can trim the outside edges of the top and bottom plywood or MDF flush with the outside edges of the outside 1x2 frame.

,
The outside trim is a hardwood of 1"" to 1-1/2' thick and the width of the thickness of the torsion box.,
After rounding over edges and sanding the entire top, you can put a nice oil finish on the torsion box to keep it looking good and prevent any other problems from water or whatever may come in contact with it.,
You should build a nice strong 2x frame with 3 layers of 2x6 material for legs.,
The frame for your top can be very inexpensive and still look like a million dollars.,
Trim the outside edge of the 2x6 and 2x8's, cut the rounded edge off, about 1/4""-5/16"" will square the edges.

,
Cut the 2x6's to length for the legs, this is up to you as to how high you want your bench top.,
Cut one of the 3 2x6 lamination shorter by the width of the bottom trimmed 2x6 foot and the top trimmed 2x8 rail.

,
With the 2x6's cut to length and trimmed to width, glue and screw them together making sure you leave the right amount of space for the foot at the bottom and right amount at the top for the top rail.,
Cut 2 trimmed 2x6's the length of the width of the base frame plus about 3"" over on each side of the legs.,
Glue and lag screw the foot (trimmed 2x6) to the legs at the pre-determined end for the 2x6 foot.,
The next piece to add is the top rail, this should be just the length of the width of the bottom of your base frame.,
Now that the leg assembly is complete, you can attach the long trimmed 2x8 side rails with glue and lag screws.,
A stretcher between the foot pieces can be added if wanted.,
The base frame can also have a nice oil finish after rounding any edges that are subject to splintering and sanding it all smooth.

,
The top torsion box can be placed on top of the base frame and attached with figure eights or you can install cross pieces about 2x3"" at the top rails of the base frame.",How to Build a Torsion Box Workbench Top," To build a workbench that is best for you, it must be the right height, width, and length, strong, durable and have features that make it user friendly. These features are things like a good vise or two, being a face vise or an end vise.


Other elements that make it user friendly are things that relate to your style of woodworking: boat building or just piddling in the shop. Tool tray, bench dogs, bench slave and cabinets or shelves under the bench. One note here: a woodworking workbench is to work wood, so build it to meet that need. If you add shelves or cabinets below the top; be sure you can still use your bench dogs and hold fasts. You should also be able to use a clamp under the top. Tool trays are handy, but get in the way when you need to add a clamp on both sides of the bench to hold your work. Think about how you will use this bench and what you need to make it work with you. Think about your seven ""P's"": ""Prior proper planning prevents pee poor performance"".
One word of caution here: don't build a workbench that is too large for your shop. Be sure you have room to work around the bench. If it is not what works for you, than it's not going to make you happy or productive.;
, All torsion boxes have one thing in common: they have small grids or boxes inside one large box. This grid is what gives the torsion box it's strength. It is also one that will hold its shape and not twist or bend under normal workbench use. But you have to build it to fit the type of work you do and for its intended use. This will determine the size and shape of your torsion box top.

, Making a level surface to start building is the first step. Level a set of boxes or saw horses or an area large enough for your project. Set rails or long 2x4's on top of them and level those.

, This will be the bottom of your workbench top, checking again to ensure that all is still level. This will make for a nice flat top when the torsion box is finished.


The 3/4"" plywood or MDF should be slightly over-size to the top you want. This lets you lay out lines for your grid pattern and have room to trim it's flush with the main inside box. Lay out lines around the bottom plywood or MDF for the top size less the thickness of the outside hardwood trim boards that will rap around the top when done.

, With the outside lines laid down, you can start laying out the inside grid or squares on the side of the outline. These squares should be of equal size along the length and width of the top. Here we will be using 1x2 lumber for the inside squares, so allow for the 3/4"" thickness of each piece, all the short 1x2's across the width of the top should be the same length as should the long strips. This will ensure a strong and square grid pattern. Note: All the 1x2 lumber should be planed or run through the table saw to ensure they are all the same height.

, Lay out the outside edge lines of the bench top on the MDF or plywood. Fit the frame together on these lines you laid out. Use screws or brad nails only long enough to pass through the width of the 1x2 and about 3/4 of the way into the plywood or MDF. Check the outside frame to ensure its square, measure from corner to corner in a diagonal manner. This outside frame will be glued and screwed or brad nailed to the bottom plywood or MDF. From here all is dependent on the squareness of the outside frame.

,, A carpenters square should be used on each short and long strip to ensure its square. Remove any excess glue, neatness is important to good craftsman like work.

, Place the long strip into place making sure it touches all the short strips and touching the outside frame at each end. Brad nail at the intersections of the short strips and the long strips. You now have one row of your grid done, check to ensure that all remaining rows will be of the same width across the bottom.

, Here you will have to toenail them to the long strip.

, Use glue at the intersections where the short strips meet the long strips, this makes everything strong.


Your last row of short strips should fit not too tight but touching the last long strip and outside frame as the first row of short strips. Check to ensure everything is square and the last row does not bow the outside frame member out.

, After the grid has set overnight, attach it to the bottom plywood. This is the bottom of your workbench.

, Check to ensure all is still level and square. Lay out lines on the bottom to match the centers lines of the 1x2's on the underside. On these lines you can add brad nails from the outside. This makes for a very strong box.

, Place the top layer of plywood or MDF onto the grid. If you intend to use the torsion box for a very long time and intend to replace the top piece of plywood or MDF when its worn, than don't glue it in place. This can be done by laying out the center lines again for the grid below the top piece. Using pre-drilled holes, screw the top to the grid below, you can use nice brass or bronze screws and let them show for a nice contrast. Steel screws can be used if counter sunk and the holes plugged. Use enough screws into the grid and along the outside edges to make it very secure. No moment or giving of the top here. With this method you can replace the top plywood or MDF and have a new bench top again for very little money.

,, The corners should be mitered or use a nice box joint here. Glue and screw the outside trim into place, do not glue it to the top plywood or MDF. The hardwood outside frame top and bottom outside edges should be rounded over to prevent splintering. Your torsion box is now done and should be about 3"" thick by what ever length and width you have chosen.

, Oil finishes as 1/2 boiled linseed oil and 1/2 tongue oil,about 3 coats.

, This new torsion box top is not just strong, stiff and durable but heavy and should have a heavy frame to hold it.

, At your local lumberyard, pick out the best 2x6's and 2x8's you can find. The grade and quality of these depend on your budget. Yellow pine is really good for this and still much less than any hardwood.

,, It should be high enough that you don't have to bend over to work and not so high that you have to reach up.

,, You can use scrap pieces for this to ensure proper location of the short leg lamination.

, These pieces are for the foot, they should have a small amount of material removed from the center bottom section of each foot to let it set level.

, Use a framing square to make sure that the legs and foot fit square. This should give you a nice inletted look for the foot. All lag screws should be long enough to pass through the foot/rails and about 2-1/2"" into the legs, just don't let go completely through.

, As with the foot piece it should also be glued and lag screwed into place. This to should give you an inletted look.

, These should be the length of your bench less the amount of overhang used for mounting vises. The long side rails should overlap the end rails at the corners of the legs.

, Two trimmed 2x4's attached to the top edge of the foot will also make a good base to build shelves or storage cabinets under your new workbench.

,, Placing four pieces, one at each end of the base frame and two more evenly spaced from the ends and pre-drilled for screws to attach the top torsion box.


This inexpensive workbench can have lots of extras as, tool tray added to one side of the torsion box. It can also have vises attached to the overhang end as in a face vise and an end vise. You can add bench dog holes, these should be decided on before building the top torsion box. To have bench dogs in a torsion box, you need to install a trimmed 2x6 one row from the outside edge. This trimmed 2x6 is glued and screwed to the bottom inside and out. Placing screws at locations that will not interfere with the drilling of dog holes.
More features as built in cabinets or shelves under the center section of the base frame.

Address the aesthetics of the radiator cover.,
Seal the finish on the radiator cover.",How to Build a Radiator Cover," Measure the depth, width and height of the radiator, taking care to add a couple of inches or centimeters to the dimensions. The idea is to make the cover large enough to easily slide over the radiator.


For example, a radiator that is 10 inches (25cm) deep, 20 inches (50cm) tall, and 30 inches (76cm) wide, you might need 12 inches (30cm) clearance in depth, 22 inches (55cm) clearance in height, and 32 inches (81cm) clearance in width. This will give you a snug but still comfortable cover for your radiator.
;
, Lots of homeowners prefer the warm touch of wood over their radiator, but that doesn't need to be the case. Here are some options you might consider:


Fiberboard. Fiberboard, or MDF (medium density fiberboard) is a combination of sawdust and resins packed tightly together. It is inexpensive, takes paint well, and won't require miters that plywoods require. On the downside, it doesn't take wood stains especially well.

Veneered plywood. Veneered plywood is incredibly sturdy and beautiful unfinished, but also takes a wood stain really nicely. On the flip side, it is considerably more expensive than MDF, and probably requires some mitering on the edges of the plywood so that you don't see the center of the plywood core.


, Because the heat from the radiator needs to escape the box cover, many covers have detailed sheet metal with small holes. Choose a piece of sheet metal, like a stamped aluminum sheet, with a detail that suits both the rest of the cover and the room in which the cover will be placed.

, Cove molding is relatively inexpensive and will go a long way in making your final piece look professional and impressive. If you don't have a miter saw (or a miter box and a handsaw) at home to cut the molding at a 45° angle with, be sure to get your molding cut before you leave the hardware supply store.

, This piece of sheet metal can be galvanized steel, for example. You'll use it on the wall behind the cover to radiate heat back into the room and supercharge the efficiency of the radiator.

, If you don't have a skill or circular saw, a jig, or a workspace that will make cutting your wood and sheet metal easy, an easy way of getting your materials cut is to have them processed wherever you buy them. Most hardware supply stores will cut your materials for free if you supply them with the dimensions.

, Double-check your measurements, clamp your wood down to a workbench, and measure two points at the top and bottom of the panel to ensure a straight line. Place a template or jig across the line to ensure a straight cut. Clamp the jig down to the workbench and move your circular saw across the wood slowly.


If you're cutting from two smaller pieces of plywood or MDF and those pieces are identical, stack them on top of each other so that you only have to make one cut to produce both side panels.


, Again, add 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of extra room for clearance. Clamp your template or jig down and measure a top and a bottom point to ensure a straight line. Start the saw and move it over the panel slowly to produce an even cut of wood.

, Using the same technique, plan on cutting the top ½ inch (1cm) wider than the sides and 1 (2.5cm) inch longer than the width of the front. This will give the top an elegant differentiation.

, Depending on how large your radiator is, draw straight lines that are between 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 cm) away from the sides and top, and slightly more (4 to 6 inches) from the bottom. This will make the screen grating the centerpiece of the front panel.


If you wish to have grated openings on the side panels as well as the front panel, follow the exact same procedure.


, Because the rectangle you want to cut out of the front panel is in the middle of the panel, you'll need to use this trick to preserve the outer framing. Place down your template to guide your circular saw along the straight line. Position the saw onto the template, with the saw's blade elevated in the air. Pull the guide up from the circular saw, turn the saw on, and slowly plunge the saw into the panel, making sure to leave a little bit of space on the corners. Slowly pull the circular saw along the line until you're about 1 (2.5cm) inch from the perpendicular line.


Do the exact same for the side panels if you choose to fit them with grating.


, Use a handsaw to extend each cut until it hits the corner. This will remove the center piece from the front panel.

, Cut two 45° inside miters in each piece of molding, so that the four pieces will form a mitered rectangle (reminiscent of a picture frame) when fitted into the front panel.

, Secure the moldings in place with some headless pin nails.

, Place the metal grating on the inside of the front panel. Leaving at least 1 and ½ inch clearance on each side of the center rectangle, cut the grading using a straight edge and a level as a guide. After placing the rectangular grating over the inside of the front panel, secure in place with some staples.

, Coarse thread drywall screws work especially well if you're using MDF for your panels.

, Finishing nails and screws will hold the sections in place easily, helping to create a sturdy cover.


Add extra support to the back of the radiator cover by screwing a piece of 1x4 to the top back of each side.


, Painting or staining the panels will help the radiator cover to blend into the room with relative ease. The choice of color may be the wall color, which aids in making the radiator cover more or less blend into the wall, or picking up one of the secondary colors in the room can help make the cover look like another accessory.


For a more dramatic statement, consider painting stripes or other geometric designs on the cover to match patterns in the draperies, pillows or other elements within the room.


, Once the paint or stain is dry, use a clear lacquer or sealant to protect the finish of the piece. Allow the sealant to dry before moving the finished radiator cover into position. This will help minimize scratching and wear and tear on the cover from one year to the next, making it possible to get several years of use before needing to repaint the accessory.

Gather your materials.,
Choose a location.,
Create the base.,
Create the wall frames.,
Attach the wall frames to the base.,
Build the roof.,
Finish the walls.,
Shingle the roof.,
Finish your playhouse.",How to Build a Playhouse1," This is the most extensive and time-consuming method of building a playhouse, but it offers the best results. There is quite a long list of supplies though, so make sure you have gathered them all before you start building.









The materials you will need include 2x8 boards, 2x4 boards, ¾” plywood, 3” galvanized screws, 1”x6” decking planks, wood siding, quarter-round molding, shingles, and roofing nails.
You will need an assortment of tools including a circular saw, a jigsaw, a reciprocating saw, a drill, a level, a framing square, a hammer, a straight edge, a utility knife, and tape measure.
An option is to include plexiglass to create real windows rather than open-air spaces in your playhouse.;
, The playhouse will measure 6x8 feet, and will need at least that much space plus a little extra room for an entrance. This playhouse is meant to be outdoors, but could certainly be placed indoors if you desired.








, To build the base of the playhouse, you will be using your 2x8 boards and then covering it with the decking planks. This base will form the platform for the playhouse to sit on, and will also prove a 2’ porch in front of the entrance.









Form a 6x8 foot rectangle by measuring and cutting your 2x8 foot boards. Cut the two side boards to be one inch short so that they can fit between the two longest boards perfectly.
Use your 3” screws to butt-joint the boards together, creating an empty rectangle.
To add stability to the floor, use an additional two 2x8 foot boards to create floor joists. These should be cut to fit the space running lengthwise in the center floor, making the base four boards running the distance of 8 feet (2.4 m), and two boards on the ends running 6 feet (1.8 m). Use your three inch screws to secure these to the sides.
To cover the foundation and create the floor, measure and cut your 1”x6” deck planking to fit the base widthwise (the shorter distance). Use enough that they cover the entirety of the base, with no spaces between each board. Use your 3” screws to make sure they are completely attached.
Cut off any excess boards with your circular saw.

, To build the walls of the playhouse, you must first make empty frames for the sides to attach to. Measure 1” in on the perimeter of the base, because the wall frames will sit on the floor rather than being attached to the outside.









To make the back frame, first measure the boards which will create the top and bottom. These should be cut from your 2x4 boards, and measure 7’11” so that it doesn’t overlap the edge of the floor. Then take five 2x4 boards and measure them to 3’9” so that they will join evenly with the other frames without overlapping the desired 4’ width. Attach two of the 3’9” boards to the edges of the two 7’11” boards, creating an empty rectangle, Then add in the three support beams to the center of the rectangle, evenly spaced between them to create four smaller empty sections.
Create the front wall frame by doing the same process explained above in making the back wall frame. In addition to that, add a cross-board six inches below the topmost board between your choice of two studs. This will create the frame for the door.
Make the side walls by taking your 2x4 boards and cutting four of them (two for each side wall), to a length of 3’9”. Take four additional 2x4 boards and cut them to be 3’4” for the top and bottom of the sides. Use your galvanized screws to attach these, creating two rectangular sides. For each side, cut two 3’9” boards to add to the center of the frames for support. Add these to the centers of each side frame and attach them with the screws.
In each of the side frames, measure 9” from the top and bottom and add a board to fit between the studs here. This will create the frame for two side-windows.

, Starting with the back wall, stand it upright on the edge of the baseboards. Use multiple galvanized screws to secure it to the floor. Then, move to the side walls; attach these to the floor first, and then to the edges of the rear wall with more screws. The last wall to be added is the front wall. Remember, this one will have a two-foot space in front for a porch. Screw it into the floor and then to the two sides, making sure that it fits smoothly with the other wall frames.








, Once the wall frames are firmly attached to the floor, you can move onto making the roof for the playhouse. To do this, first create a frame, and then cover it with plywood.









Measure the ridgeboard, the board that will run lengthwise through the center of the triangle-shaped roof, to 7’11”.
Cut the struts, the supportive edge of the roof, out of 2x4 boards to 14” long. Miter these to the correct angle to fit against the ridgeboard and the top of the wall frames.
Create the eight rafters made from 2x4 inch boards. You will use four of each of these boards in the centers of the roof between the struts to give support to the roof. Miter these to fit the angle of the ridgeboard and the top of the wall frames.
Begin by attaching the struts to the ridgeboard, and then add the rafters. Attach this roof frame to the tops of the wall frames. There should be two empty isosceles triangle shapes at the ends of the frame, above the two side walls.
Cut plywood to fit the roof. You will attach shingles to the top of the plywood, so make sure the entirety of the roof frame is covered (excluding the side triangles). Screw these pieces to the top of the frame once you’ve gotten the correct measurements.
Screw the rafter and struts to the frame directly above the studs to add extra support to your playhouse structure.

, Use your wood siding to add the outer edge to your walls. Measure the wall frames to make sure you get the correct size, and then cut the wood to fit. The two side pieces should be in the shape of a pentagon to include the triangle-shapes formed by the roof.









Screw the walls into the frame along the support beams.
Mark out the space for the windows and door. Use a jigsaw to cut out these pieces, sanding the rough edges when you finish. If you chose to use plexiglass for the windows, insert them now. Finish the windows (with or without the plexiglass) with the quarter round molding around the edges.

, Line up the first row of shingles along the edge, and then have all adjacent rows of shingles slightly overlap each other. Use four roofing nails per shingle to attach them to the plywood roof. Because the ridge board will be exposed, cut the sheets of shingles into individual pieces and turn them sideways. Nail them to the ridge board so that the entire roof is covered. Use your utility knife to cut off any excess shingles.








, At this point, the building-process of your playhouse has been completed. Now you can add the finishing touches to it to make it unique. Paint the outside, add window-box planters, and put small-sized furniture inside. Enjoy your completed playhouse!

Gather your supplies.,
To get fabric that will be big enough to cover the entire playhouse without spending a lot of money, buy sheets or unlined curtains.,
Create the frame.,
Make the tent covering.,
Slide the tent over the pipes.",How to Build a Playhouse2," You will need seven 10 foot (3.0 m) ¾” PVC pipes, ten converter pieces, a PVC pipe cutter, and fabric and a sewing kit or sewing machine to create the cover.









The ten converter pipe pieces all need to measure ¾”. You will need four T’s, four 45 degree angle elbows, and ten 3-way connectors.

, You can buy these new or find them used and give them a good washing before use.









You may choose to use ribbons to sew to the inside of the fabric so that the tent portion can be tied on and removed to be washed whenever you desire.

, The frame will consist of a base and a top, four supporting beams, and a triangular roof piece. They will be put together using the









To create the base and the top, cut the pipe into four pieces that measure 6 feet (1.8 m) long, and four pieces that measure 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Connect them into two large, separate rectangles with the 3-way connectors on each corner.
Slide a t-shaped connector facing upwards on each of the four corners of the top piece for the roof to connect to. You may have to cut 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) off the pipe to make room for these connectors to connect to the corners.
Create the support beams to form the walls. These can be cut at your discretion to meet your preferred ceiling height. You will need to cut four pieces of pipe all of an equal length. Attach them to the two corner slots at the top and bottom of the pipe, forming a large empty cube.
Make the roof. To do this, cut four additional pieces of pipe the same length as the sides. Fit them together at a right (90 degree) angle, creating two large ‘L’ shapes. You will need to use the 3-way corners to fit them. Then, cut another piece of pipe 6 feet (1.8 m) long, and run this down the center between the two L’s. Attach the entire roof structure to the base by putting them in the T-shaped slots on the top rectangle.
Make sure all the connections between the pipes are strong, and you are finished with the structure!

, Using the fabric you got, take a measurement of all the sides and the roof. Cut these pieces, and use a sewing machine to stitch all the sides together in the same shape as your playhouse.









It may be easier to attach the tent to the playhouse if you make it a little larger than the real size. This way, slipping it over the pipes and removing it for cleaning will be a cinch.
Sew 6-inch ribbons to the inside of the tent perpendicular to the seams, so that when the tent is placed on the pipe-frame they can be tied on to allow movement.
Cut a slit from the bottom till ¾ of the way up one of the sides to create a tent-flap style door.
If you want, you can cut holes in the sides to act as windows. Feel free to use a thick, clear plastic as play-glass to fill these holes.

, Once you have completely sewn the tent pieces together, you are finished! This can be used indoors or outdoors, and the fabric covering can easily be removed to wash.

Pick a consistent conversion factor for converting cubits to modern measurements.,
Buy or cut lots of cypress wood.,
Build a curved wooden hull to fit the dimensions of the bible.,
Add flooring inside the ark and a door on the side.,
Add a roof.,
Coat the wood of the hull with pitch.,
Fill your ark with animals.",How to Build an Ark," The Bible tells us that God commanded Noah to build the original Ark to certain exact specifications. Said God to Noah, ""This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high"".Today, these measurements are somewhat problematic because we don't know exactly how long a cubit is. Cubits are an ancient unit of measurement based on the distance from the elbow to the tips of the fingers, so different cultures had different values for the length of one cubit. Generally speaking, most ancient cultures had cubits that were between 17.5 and 20.6 inches (44.5 - 52.3) long.The most important thing is to be consistent - pick one cubit length and stick to it to ensure the proportions of your ark are correct. For convenience's sake, this guide will assume we're working with a type of cubit called ""common cubits"", so our conversion factor will be 1 cubit = 18 inches (45.7 cm).;
, The Bible tells us that the original Ark was made exclusively from cypress wood.Today, ""cypress"" refers to a number of coniferous trees and shrubs in the family family Cupressaceae. Noah may have used Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervixens), a variety of cypress tree native to the Mediterranean and Levant. Whichever type of cypress you use, you'll need enough to build the hull of a ship three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high in addition to the deck, roof, and flooring below deck.


If, for convenience, we assume a box-shaped Ark and 18-inch (45.7 cm) cubits, our 300 × 50 × 30 cubit Ark will require at least 114,750 square feet of cypress wood. The actual amount will likely be more than this, as you'll need to build a hull that's more than one layer thick, as well as a roof and flooring inside the Ark.

, For your ark to be able to float in the tumultuous waters of a world-destroying flood, it will need to be of very sturdy construction. You'll want to build a thick hull with a wide, gently curving cross section that tapers at either end. Add a keel (a vertical ""fin"" running the length of the bottom of the hull) for added stability. After you've built the main hull, add horizontal and diagonal cross-beams stretching across the inside of the hull to increase the strength of the ark's walls.


The ark is truly a massive undertaking. Assuming 18-inch (45.7 cm) cubits, the hull of your ark should be 450 feet (137.2 m) long, 75 feet (22.9 m) wide, and 45 feet (13.7 m) high. The process of building the hull can be sped up greatly with modern tools and construction methods, but if you're using only ancient tools, it may take months or years!

, The Bible tells us that God commanded Noah, ""Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks"".Adding multiple decks will allow you to make the most of the vertical space within the ark, storing as many animals as possible, while adding a door to the side of the ark makes it possible for land animals to easily board the ark.


The Bible doesn't specify dimensions for the different decks within the ark, so use your best judgement. You may, for instance, want the bottom deck to be taller than the others to accommodate the biggest animals, like elephants and giraffes.

, A firm, sturdy roof is an important part of your ark. The original world-destroying flood was caused by forty days and forty nights of rain- in the event of a similar situation, it's important to have some way to keep the rain from gathering below deck and sinking your ark! The Bible tells us that God commanded Noah to ""Make a roof for , leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around"".Be sure to build your roof so that the edges of the roof reach over the edges of the upper deck. You want any rainwater to drain away from the upper deck and into the waters of the flood.

, It's (obviously) extremely important for your ark to be as waterproof as possible. God knew this and commanded Noah to ""coat with pitch inside and out"".Pitch is a thick, viscous, resin not unlike tar that, in ancient times, was used to waterproof boats. Pitch can be made from natural plants (especially pine trees) or from petroleum - naturally, Noah probably used the former.

, Congratulations, you've built a modern-day ark based on the original specifications given to Noah by God! Now, all you need to do is find male-female pairs of every major species of bird and land animal to repopulate the Earth after the apocalyptic flood. However, according to the Bible, some animals are more important than others. Consider God's original advice to Noah when gathering animals: ""Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth"".""Clean"" and ""unclean"" refer to ancient Jewish customs governing the suitability of certain types of animals for eating and sacrifice. The distinction between which animals are ""clean"" and which are ""unclean is somewhat complex, but, in general, ""clean"" animals are:Quadrupeds that chew cud and possess a cloven hoof.
Fish.
Most birds, excluding birds of prey and most waterfowl.
A few select types of vermin and insects.

Start with tools that are needed.,
Buy the thickest plywood you can afford.,
Buy your hardware.,
Make your frame.,
Make your legs.,
Fasten your legs to your square and to the wall if you decided to do so.",How to Build a Simple Workbench," You will need a drill, a drill and screw bit set, a saw and a carpenters square to make sure that all your cuts are not crooked, and something to haul materials to and from the lumberyard.
, At least 3/4"" is suggested. You will need to buy 2x4s for your frame, and 4x4s for your legs., You will need 3 inch (7.6 cm) wood screws to hold together your frame and top. Using outdoor deck screws for durability is suggested, even if its for indoor use. If desired, put a shelf below the counter top 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the ground. If you have young ones and/or dangerous chemicals around, you may buy an extra sheet of plywood, some hinges, and hasps to build lockable doors for the middle shelf. You can also use these to keep tools out of the weather like grinders, skill and jig saws, wrenches, clamps, metal fabrication tools and supplies, etc. It is suggested to put a 2x4 lengthways, width-ways, or both if it's for heavy duty uses, underneath your countertop every 18 inches (45.7 cm) for reinforcement., You will need to build a square out of 2x4s. this will be your countertop. Put a L-bracket in each corner for strength. The size and amount of materials all depends on the size of your workspace and table size, but you may prefer a countertop 36 inches (91.4 cm) off the ground. Also, if possible, fasten it to a wall if there is one that's sturdy enough to do so. While its still just a square, this is the time when you want to put in and fasten your reinforcement 2x4's., You may prefer 4x4s for this, but if you're not using it for heavy duty uses, you can use 2x4s. Next, lay down your sheets of plywood on top of the square. This is your countertop. Fasten them to your square using your screws., Using some L brackets for the legs to resist wobbling is suggested. Paint the table and add pegboard if desired."

Sew the fabric pieces together.,
Decorate the fabric.,
Finish off your playhouse.",How to Build a Playhouse3," For this project, you can choose to use a table that is of use in your house, or to procure a table especially for this project. You will also need several yards of fabric (enough to cover all sides of the table), scissors, and decorations (optional).








, In order to get an accurate cover for your table, you must have a list of all the measurements. Take a measurement of the length, width, and height. Make sure to write these down to keep track of them.








, You will be making the playhouse out of five pieces of fabric. You need one to fit the top of the table (length x width), two to fit the long sides (length x height), and two to fit the short sides (width x height).









When you’ve gotten all the measurements done, cut the pieces of fabric out.
At this point, cut out rectangular sections to act as windows and doors in the playhouse. These can be as numerous as you desire, placed wherever you want.

, Lay the pieces of fabric out in their correct shape/order on the floor, to make sure you are sewing them correctly. They should make a large cross-like shape. Then, use a sewing machine to stitch the fabric together along the seams.








, If you want your playhouse look a little bit more exciting than just some fabric over a table, use sharpies, embroidery floss, or other pieces of fabric to give the fabric the appearance of a house. Draw on gingerbread trim, flower boxes under the windows, and a wood-grain texture on the walls.








, When you have done all the decorating you desire, throw the fabric tent over the table to complete your playhouse. Feel free to fill the inside with small pieces of furniture or toys, and enjoy!

Gather your materials.,
Prepare your box.,
Add color to the sides.,
Cut out the doors and windows.,
Create a roof.,
Put your house together.",How to Build a Playhouse4," For this, you will need 1-2 large cardboard boxes, all-purpose glue, wrapping paper or wallpaper, packing tape, and a box cutter or scissors.








, Start by cutting off extraneous pieces so that the box lies upside down on the ground and has no bottom (or top, if it is right-side up). Tape all the seams and loose areas to make sure that it won’t fall apart.








, To give your playhouse a better appearance than just a cardboard box, cover the sides one at a time with an all-purpose glue and a wrapping paper or wallpaper of your choice.








, Use a box-cutter or scissors to cut a small door from the bottom of one of the sides, and as many windows as you would like.









You can choose to cut only three sides of the door, leaving one “hinged” side attached so that the door can be open and closed instead of just an empty space.
You can add clear plastic or cellophane on the inside of the box to give the appearance of windows on the outside.

, To do this, cut two large triangle pieces of cardboard out from another box or a spare piece, making them the width of the house Then, cut out two large rectangles the same length as the box and height as the triangles.









Attach the four roof pieces together with glue and tape.
cut out cardboard “shingles” in small rectangles or semi-circles and glue these in an overlapping pattern over the top of the triangle. Cut off any extras that go over the edge.
If you want, you can use spray paint to give the roof a bit of color.

, Once the roof is finished, glue and tape it to the top of the cardboard box. You are finished! Feel free to add any further decorative touches, or enjoy it as-is.

Install the window box.,
Add soil and flowers, plants, and/or herbs.",How to Build a Window Box," Look at varieties of window boxes online or prefabricated models in stores to get an idea of the design you would like to use. (The instructions that follow are for a basic rectangular box. They can be easily modified to fit whatever specifications you are looking for.)


In particular, you may want to think immediately about how your window box will be attached to your house. Many designs employ wooden brackets or braces to hold up the box, and this should be taken into account in your plans. You can make these simple braces yourself, or there are a number available for purchase in home and garden stores.;
, This will determine how much lumber you will need to purchase.


If you want your window box to run the full length of the window, add twice the length of your window box plus twice the width that you are planning to determine how much lumber you'll need for the 4 sides of the box.
The bottom will be the same length as the sides.

, Your need to select a type of wood that is resistant to the elements (after all, this will be hanging outside). In making your selection, you need to think about the specific requirements that must be fulfilled. How harsh is the weather in your location? How big is this window box going to be, and how much weight will the boards have to bear? Every type of wood has unique qualities, and you should keep that in mind as you make your choice.


Fairly typical boards for projects of this sort are 1X6s or 2X6s--that is, its dimensions are one inch by six inches or two inches by six inches (the heavier boards may be useful for the bottoms of the box). These come in a number of lengths, so consider which one will be most appropriate for this project.
There are a wide variety of grades of pressure-treated lumber that can stand up to outdoor conditions, each designed for specific environments. Learn something about the grades and think about which one will suit your requirements.Though pressure-treated boards are no longer treated with the same toxic chemicals they once were, they are still treated with some peculiar substances. Additionally, new pressure-treated lumber will contain some moisture, and so it cannot be painted until it has begun to dry or weather.For those who would prefer natural woods that are relatively weather resistant without treatment, certain varieties of cedar, cherry, locust, or others may be appropriate., As noted above, this is something to consider when thinking about lumber as well. But the exterior coating will also affect both the appearance and durability of your window box, so strike the appropriate balance when making your selection.

, As most of you know, there has been an accumulation of home improvement stores throughout the country in recent years. Most have lumber, and nearly all have the additional supplied you will need (a complete list follows at the bottom of the page).


It is recommended that you talk to the people who work at the home improvement store to get any quick tips or advice they might have for the project. They often know something about that lumber or paint they are selling you (usually due to customer complaints following failed projects). Understand that they are interested in making a sale, but know that they may have useful information to share.

, Always remember, measure twice, cut once. You only get one chance at cutting before you make a mistake and discover that you have to make another trip back to the hardware store. And they will immediately know why you are there.

, Cut the longer pieces first, then use remaining pieces for the shorter sides or to create braces.

, If you can apply a sealant or paint before final assembly, do so. The purpose is to coat the wood, and so why not make sure that it is properly covered before screwing all of these joints together forever?, Though there are devices that will allow your to drill the screws directly into the lumber, doing so can stress the wood and cause splits near the end. It is also easier to maintain control when drilling guide holes than it is to screw directly into the wood, especially when using hard woods.,


Use a screwdriver bit with your drill to attach the ends of the window box to the bottom using rust-proof screws. Be sure to support the wood against something sturdy or have someone hold the lumber while you are screwing the pieces together.
Place the front and back sections onto the bottom section to make sure that all of the pieces are cut to fit (the ends should all be flush with each other) before attaching the front and back pieces of the window box. Screw the front and back pieces to the bottom and sides of the window box.

, You'll need several holes in the bottom of the window box to allow water to drain out of the window box.

, Let the sealant or paint dry completely before final installation.

, This will prevent the soil from rotting the wood.

, Use them to cover the drainage holes to keep the soil from coming out of the bottom of the window box.

, Drill holes into the exterior wall where you're going to hang your window box. Additionally, if you have left lumber to serve as a separate brace, drill holes for that as well. Attach the brace first, then the window box, screwing them in tightly but without damaging the wood.


When screwing the window box to the brackets from the bottom of the window box, use screws that are slightly shorter than the thickness of the bottom of the window box.

, Your project is complete.

Diorama
Blueprints
Cad design;
, If people are going to be standing on it you need to get your design approved and get a builders permit. Building this platform without it can cause some serious damage to your performers or crew members.,(this article uses measurements but feel free to use your own.) You are building this outside you are going to dig at least 11 holes vertically and 13 horizontally.

Always map out a location and any metal framing before building, when you find the location you need to build the frame to help support the beams when you add concrete into the ground. In total you will have 143 holes for a 11 by 13 stage in which you need to place a beam to support the weight and then add a quick drying cement in to keep the beam secure to the ground and won't move when performers are on it.

, From the beams you are going to go up by at least 24 inches (61.0 cm) and will add measured 2x4s to the frame for extra support. Remember if your lumber is not long enough to cover one side of the frame use small pieces and connect the beams one beam at a time. 4 nails in each corner where the piece of the wood connects to the beam., Another 12 inches (30.5 cm) that will be closer to the main stage shall do for now. Refer to step 4., Be sure to section the inside. Have 13 rows vertically and 11 horizontally. Why is this step needed? It is to be sure that the stage will be steady just in rough conditions.for every row make a v with spare pieces of wood or with metal and connect the sections carefully. this will help keep the rows from collapsing from excess weight., You know how supermarkets have forklifts that lifts up huge quantities of food the pieces of wood under it are called pallets. They throw those away after stocking the shelves you can ask the manager for the pallets or they will be in the back of the store in the trash.

Collect them or you can ask friends or family who recently renovated for excess material. If all those fail go to a habitat for humanities center they will have wood scraps on sale.

, Just begin laying the wood across the beams and be sure to leave enough room for you to get in and out. You should do the first layer with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap in between the main frame until it is all covered., This will help make the wood support stronger and will be able to keep the main support and lower layer protected from when your heavy falls or slips. It really depends on how much weight is going to be on the stage itself. Its better safe than sorry., Using wood and a trusty power drill you will need to drill into the concrete or metal with a nail. Put the wood closer together no gaps should be on the last layer of the stage., Using a base coat will make colors pop out more but the color must be white or grey. Then the next one should be the color that you want the stage to look like you can use any color for this one. Afterwords use a weather resistant clear coat to gloss the stage and make it water and storm proof., Use excess wood to hide the framework of the wood. paint it any color but remember if you want people to take interest in your stage use colors that complements the stage color., With the lighting, its good to have an electrician help you a lot of beautiful stages have been set a flame with faulty do it yourself wiring. Then finish off with curtains and add a staircase so your performers can get up on stage and off."

Hold the knife from the safe side.,
Flick your wrist back.,
Flip the knife back forward.,
Open your thumb and flip the knife up again.",How to Flip a Butterfly Knife1," Make sure you start with a closed knife. If the knife is already open you should find someone who understand a Butterfly Knife to close it for you. The knife has a dull side and a sharp side and you always want to keep your fingers away from the sharp side. Look at the anatomy of the knife and determine which direction the sharp side would close into. The knife slips into a groove inside the handles on both sides.You want to hold the handle that would house the dull side of the knife.


Even if you are not using a sharp knife, this is the proper technique.;
, Hold the knife directly out in front of you pointing forward. Now flick your wrist back. The flick of your wrist should be similar to the reverse motion of casting a fishing line.









When you flip your wrist back the knife will open and the handle of dangerous side will hit you between your thumb and your forefinger. Keep your hand where it is. , This time flick your wrist downward so that the knife closes again. The knife should be a similar position to when you started now.








, The last time you flipped the knife up the handle hit you on the thumb and forefinger. Flip the knife up in the exact same way but open your thumb and move it to the side this time. This will allow the handle of the dangerous side to smack into the handle that you are holding, engaging the knife. 








Once you have flipped the knife up into place close your thumb over both handles.

Verify that your home has room for a playhouse.,
Determine the cost for building a playhouse.,
Gather the materials needed to build the playhouse.,
Verify that you have the proper tools to build the playhouse.",How to Build a Playhouse for Toddlers1," The manner in which you build a playhouse and choose your materials will depend on the style of playhouse. For example, if your family plans on moving to a new home soon, buy a playhouse kit that allows you to assemble and disassemble the playhouse using little or no tools.;
, Although you can choose to build a playhouse of any size, you must verify that a playhouse will fit comfortably in your toddler's room, or outside in your yard.


Use a measuring tape to help you with determining whether a playhouse will fit comfortably in an area inside or outside of your home.

, The costs of playhouse kits made by manufacturers will differ significantly from one another; however, the supplies needed for building your own playhouse will usually cost between 450 and 500 dollars (344 and 382 euros).

, The materials you need will depend on the style of playhouse you want to build. For example, if you are building a stationary playhouse in your yard, you will need to buy lumber, plywood, nails, screws, truss brackets, and more.


Read the instructional manual for your playhouse if you purchased a kit to determine if any extra supplies are needed. For example, you may be required to buy paint for the exterior of the playhouse if none was provided.

, Common tools you may need are a hammer, screwdriver, saw, saw horses, measuring tape, a pencil, or a level.

Figure out the object's acceleration.

,
Then, through the force exerted, you should be able to figure out the mass by dividing the acceleration by the force exerted (by Newton's second law: force equals mass times acceleration).",How to Find the Weight of an Object Without a Scale2,",


For example, if a cube has an acceleration of 1000 millimetres per second squared (always measure in millimetres) and the force exerted is 2 kilograms millimetres per second squared, then the cube must weigh 2 grams.

Use your dominant hand.,
Curl your thumb under the catch.,
Flip the catch to your dominant hand.,
Flick the first blade up, letting the safe side hit your fingers.,
Flick the second blade up.,
Re-curl your fingers holding the back piece in place.",How to Flip a Butterfly Knife2," Start with a closed knife to avoid cutting yourself and to complete the trick. You'll be flipping the knife open so you need it closed to start with. Hold out the hand that you use when someone hands you something or when you throw a ball. When holding the knife, stick out that hand.

, Place the knife, lengthwise, along the second joint of your fingers. Now curl your hand in, placing your thumb just under the catch. Flick upward with your thumb against the catch to open it.


Make sure to maintain not a necessarily strong grip, but a firm one as it is easy for the knife to fly out of your hand when flipping it quickly if you have no practice. Do not crush the knife in your grip, but do not hold it loosely either.

, Flip the catch to your right if you are right-handed or to your left if you are left-handed.

, You only need to make a slight jerking motion Pinch the back half of the knife against your thumb and fingers, letting the front half and the blade drop down. Now give a flicking motion and let the front half fly up and hit the back of your fingers.









Knives that are heavier may require more than just a slight jerking motion and you will have to rotate your hand as you flick it to bring the piece up quickly and fluidly.

, Remove all but your forefinger from the knife as it moves up by holding them straight out.The front piece will fly up and hit the back of your forefinger. It is now the back piece.









If you do it wrong, when you flip it closed, the blade half will hit the back of your forefinger. It is recommended practicing with a dull one. Once you get good at it, sharpen the knife., Slip your forefinger out the top and re-engage the latch with your thumb. Repeat the flicking motions to practice.

Attach each wall to the flooring or foundation of the playhouse.,
Build a roof for the playhouse.,
Secure the roof to each wall of the playhouse using nails or screws.,
Add trimmings, accessories, and other personal touches to the playhouse.",How to Build a Playhouse for Toddlers2," In most cases, this step will require you to lay out floor bond boards on the ground, which will help support the overall structure of the playhouse.


If you want the playhouse elevated from the ground, lay out wood blocks in every corner of the foundation, then lay the floor bond boards on top of the wood blocks.

, You can either use sheets of plywood, panels of wood, or any other material of your choice for the flooring.


Verify that your flooring is flush and even with all edges of the foundation or frame.

, To ensure that the flooring will support foot traffic, use nails or screws that are 2 inches (5.08 cm) long, and spaced 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart all throughout the flooring.

, Each wall of the playhouse can be constructed similarly to the way you built your flooring. For example, if you built your flooring using strips of wood, you can fashion each wall in the same manner.


Leave spaces in one or more walls for windows or doorways based on your preferences.

, 90 degree brackets are ideal for firmly securing each wall to the foundation of the playhouse.


Install 90 degree brackets made from wood or metal approximately 6 inches apart along each wall to ensure that the walls are strongly supported and attached to the flooring.

, The style of roof can vary according to your preferences. For example, you can either fasten a flat layer of plywood to the top of the playhouse to achieve a box-like appearance, or build an angled roof using truss brackets.

, All edges of the roof should be flush with the outermost edges of each wall.

, Examples of decorations you can place on the playhouse are roofing shingles, paint, a real door with a doorknob, flower boxes beneath each window, and more.

Observe how the mirror is installed.,
Check out the lighting.,
Consider where you are.,
Try to peer through the glass.,
Shine a light on it.,
Sound it out.,
Perform the fingernail test.,
Consider the extreme measure of breaking the glass.",How to Tell if a Mirror Is Two Way or Not," Notice if the mirror seems to be hanging on the wall or if it's part of the wall itself. If it appears to be hanging, try to look behind it and see a wall. If the mirror seems to be part of the wall itself, there's a good chance it's a two-way mirror, which must be set into the wall rather than hung onto it. That way, people standing on the other side of the wall can observe someone looking in the mirror.A two-way mirror is a piece of glass coated with a substance called micro pane. If you stand on the treated side, you see your reflection but the untreated side looks like a tinted window.
If you see a wall behind the mirror, it's a good bet that it's nothing more than a regular mirror.;
, Look around and determine whether the lighting seems extraordinarily bright. If so, you might be looking at a two-way mirror. However, if the light in the room is relatively dim, and you can't immediately see through the mirror, it's probably just a standard mirror.For a two-way mirror to be effective, the light on the mirrored side needs to be 10 times brighter than the light on the other side. If the lighting is any dimmer, it's possible to see through the glass to the observation area.

, If you're in a public place and in an area you'd expect privacy, such as a restroom, it's unlikely and illegal to have a two-way mirror. On the other hand, two-way mirrors are frequently used by law enforcement. For example, two-way mirrors are used in interrogation rooms and for lineups.


The use of two-way mirrors is closely tied to issues of personal privacy and Constitutional rights. Most states have passed additional legislation preventing the use of two-way mirrors in rest rooms, locker rooms, showers, fitting rooms and hotel rooms.If a location has chosen to use two-way mirrors or surveillance, they are required to post signs that notify you.Many places, such as gas stations, will use one way metal mirrors because glass mirrors can be destroyed by users. If the mirror in question is metal, then it is not a two-way mirror.

, Press your face up to the mirror and cup your hands around it, creating a dark tunnel to block out as much light as possible. When you do this, if the light in the observation room is at all brighter than the light on your side of the mirror, you should be able to see something beyond the glass., If you're still not convinced, turn off the lights, then hold a flashlight to the mirror (it can even be the ""flashlight"" on your smartphone). If it is a two-way mirror, the room on the other side will be illuminated and you'll be able to see it.

, Tap on the surface of the mirror with your knuckle. A normal mirror will produce a dull, flat sound, since it's placed in front of a wall. An observation mirror will produce an open, hollow and reverberating sound because there is an open space on the other side.


The sound of tapping a two-way mirror has also been described as bright or sharp as opposed to a thud from an everyday mirror., While not completely accurate, you can use your fingernail to determine if the mirror is a first or second surface mirror. Simply place your fingernail against the surface of the mirror. When you touch your fingernail to a second surface mirror, you can't to touch your own reflection; instead, you will see a gap caused by a second layer of glass over the mirrored surface. When you touch your finger to a first surface mirror, you can touch your own reflection, since there's no additional layer of glass in between. First surface mirrors are very rare, so if you find one there's likely to be a very specific reason and it's very possible that it's a two-way mirror. Second surface mirrors are your ubiquitous everyday mirrors.Due to variables like lighting and the material with which the mirror is manufactured, it can be really difficult to tell whether you are truly touching your reflection or not. You might think you're touching a first surface mirror when you're actually not.
Also, it's possible for a two-way mirror to be a second surface mirror. If other aspects of the situation, like the mirror's setting and lighting, have indicated that what you're seeing is a two-way, don't let the fingernail test be the deciding factor.

, If it's a regular mirror, it will shatter and you'll see the mirror's backing or a solid wall. If it's a two-way mirror, you'll see the room behind the mirror. You should probably only consider this option if you feel threatened or are in danger. Breaking the glass will cause damage and create a safety hazard.

These benches had large heavy single slabs. Modern Roubo workbenches are built with laminated slabs of wood for tops with leg vices. The original design also had a bench hook on one end of the front side and dog holes for hold downs. Planing stop, through dovetail and tenons, were standard. Todays Roubo's workbenches come in many different styles and types, allowing you to choose a style appropriate to your needs and workspace.
, The woods most commonly used by the large companies are maple and beech. Other woods used include oak, cherry, walnut, poplar, southern yellow pine and Douglas fir. It doesn't have to be an expensive hard wood; choose a wood which fits your budget or which is available locally., This gives it time to adjust to its new environment movement wise. Cut your lumber to rough size, stack and stick it; this lets it move before you start milling it., Use the drawings of your bench to find the sizes and number of pieces you need before cutting. This will maximize lumber usage., It is as simple as surfacing all the stock to be laminated and squaring the glue side of all your stock. Apply an even smooth layer of glue to the stock to be laminated and use a good even clamping pressure and lots of clamps. Don't glue more than two or three pieces at a time, unless you're very fast and accurate at aligning and clamping. Trying to glue and align these heavy pieces of stock all at one time is difficult and can result in misalignment if you overdo what you can handle alone., Cut your lumber for the legs about a 1/4-inch wider and longer than needed so you have room to smooth and finish the legs to size. If you're using lumberyard 2xs laminating three or more pieces together makes a nice heavy leg., Use a good bevel gauge to layout the angle, typically 12 degrees, for the back legs. Cut any mortises and drill all the holes in the legs. Cut and smooth to size.

If you want a knock down workbench, one that is easy to take apart and move, you can use threaded rod or long lag screws to put it together. If you want to make it a knock down bench then don't glue the long stretchers into the mortises, just use lag screws about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long. Assemble the legs and short stretchers with glue and pins.

, These will require one end of them being cut to match the 12 degree angle of the rear legs - if you're angling the rear legs, that is. The short stretchers can be one piece boards or two or three laminated together to form a heavy leg assembly. Take your time here and get a good fit. Dry fit the legs and short stretchers together to ensure they fit properly. You can then disassemble them and do your final glue up for assembly. Dry fitting before final assembly will help prevent mistakes and gives you a chance to see the base before glue up. This allows you to make any changes as needed. However you design your bench be sure that all the parts compliment each other. As don't have a 4 inch (10.2 cm) tick top on 3 inch (7.6 cm) legs. If your top is 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) thick then the legs should be about 4 to 5 inches (10.2 to 12.7 cm) square with stretchers about 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick and as wide or wider than the legs are square. But this is just one opinion., When making your base assembly, build it so the top overhangs on the ends for attaching vises or other hardware you want. Make the front edge of the workbench even with the front face of the front leg. With the 12 degree angle of the rear legs you should have about a 6–8 inch (15.2–20.3 cm) overhang to the rear of the bench top. The base size must be set so these overhangs can give way to the vises and whatever you want to add.

Leave to set.

, These sections are four pieces laminated together to make up one section. These are long pieces and help with alignment would be highly beneficial as laminating the top pieces four at a time can be difficult. Use as many clamps as you need here and get an even clamping pressure. Ensure that you have an even layer of glue on each piece to prevent gaps and delaminations later. Leave each section overnight to let the glue cure. Repeat this step until you have enough laminated sections to equal your workbench top width. If your workbench is 24 inches (61.0 cm) then you need 4 sections., Allow each of these laminations to cure overnight. Wiping off dripping glue will be a plus when it comes time to flatten and smooth the top on both sides., Starting your flatting and smoothing on the bottom side of the top is a good way to learn to use your hand plane and being the bottom side of the top will hide your learning curve. Use a #5 to scrub the top and a #6 or #7 to flatten and smooth. If you don't have the #6 or #7 plane, you can get the surface flat and smooth by just using your #5 and adjusting it to the type of planing you're doing, scrubbing, flattening and smoothing. Take your time and get the bottom side of the top flat and smooth. This won't happen in just a few hours - you will know how to use your plane correctly by the time that you are finished! Once flat and smooth, you can attach to the base., Attaching the top is done with a mortise and tenon joint. You can use a short tenon or a through tenon and dovetail which is the way this workbench was originally designed. However, you are free to use any method you want; be sure to research this method well before starting it. If it's a knockdown type bench, keep in mind how you will remove the top if ever needed to., Using a plane and wending sticks will help get the top very flat., Using a chamfer bit on the edges or a round over bit helps prevent chipping and splitting of the edges and on the legs. Don't chamfer or round over edges where you're going to attach vices.,, The finish on the workbench is a matter of personal taste. Boiled linseed oil is commonly used. You could even mix other finishes in with it or over it. Keep in mind that whatever you do to the bench top, you must also do to the bottom side of the bench top. This will help prevent the top from warping or moving unevenly."

Your index fingers (also called pointer fingers) should be right against the sides of the fold your thumbs have created.








, Keeping your thumbs (and the crease) in position, begin to bend the corners of the book down while also pushing inward on the crease. You'll feel your chest (pectoral) muscles being used if you're doing it right. The crease in the book will become more accentuated, and if you look carefully at the crease, you'll be able to see pockets of air form between the pages.








, Twist the right side of the book up with your right hand while twisting the left side down with your left hand (this can be reversed depending on what's comfortable for you). Maintain a firm grip on the book at all times, and use your pectoral muscles to keep firm inward pressure on the book. The book should begin to tear.








, If you're strong enough and maintain a good grip on the book, you may be able to rip the book all the way down the center of its length in one shot. Otherwise you may need to reposition your hands and continue ripping less gracefully. Either way, it will be impressive.









Now, if you want to be able to rip ANY paperback glued book in two, then just rip it vertically along the spine! If it´s a bit thick, break the spine by knocking/kicking the book backwards along the spine.

Catch your knife by the handle as it comes back down.",How to Perform a Trebuchet with a Butterfly Knife," It is possible to cut yourself while performing the trick so you’ll want to decide if you will use an actual butterfly knife. Training knives without blades are also available and are a great alternative to use when learning knife tricks. Another option is to wrap the knife blade with electrical tape to minimize the risk of being cut., If you want the blade downward, start out with the safe handle. If you want it facing towards you, start out with the bite handle. The bite handle is the one that closes on the sharp edge of the blade.Starting out with the safe handle will be more dangerous because you will soon be switching your grip to the bite handle. This is how the trick is usually performed.
You can start out by holding the bite handle until you perfect the trick.
Your grip should be relatively close to the tang (pivot area) throughout the trick. Holding the knife here gives you more control while performing the trick.

, Overall, the trick to performing a trebuchet is to use the momentum of the knife as you flip your wrist. The momentum will keep the knife spinning so that you can perform the trick smoothly., As you do this, simultaneously wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the bite in preparation for the next step.


Other than the possibly the aerial portion of the trick at the end, this first part of the trick requires the most practice. It tends to be the most awkward or unnatural movement for many people.
Practice with either a dulled or taped blade or with the opposite handle so that you don't cut yourself starting off.
When starting off with the safe handle there are several points where your finger will come between the blade and the bite handle, which you're going to be snapping the blade back into.

, While pinching the bite, rotate the two gripping fingers around so you begin to get the latch on the bite pointing up and the blade hanging down.


During this portion of the trick, it is sometimes easier to avoid a cut if you shift your blade outwards.
Shifting the blade out will change your plane. This will need to be corrected during the aerial portion of the trick. Shifting your plane at high speeds can cause instabilities, which you do not want during the aerial.

, Note that before shifting position, you were holding the handle between your index finger and middle finger.


The middle finger can be curled back to be used as a plane for the handle to rotate on.
It is extremely beneficial to grip the handle between your index finger and the back of the second digit of your middle finger.

, Your middle finger will still be curled back in the same position as in the previous step. It can remain there until you nose over for the aerial portion of the trick.


This step is where a large portion of the speed must come through for the trick to look as cool as possible.
It also must be kept on one plane with the tang rotating around the index finger.

, Your middle finger should still be holding the handle with the thumb by the second digit on top of the handle. This allows you to use the momentum of the blade being thrown out to carry both the blade and the safe handle around into the opposite position from where they were before.


The best way to describe this motion is to take the 'V' formed by your index finger on top of the bite and the middle finger beneath it and completely flipping it over so that the middle finger is on top.
Be sure to flip it in the direction that the momentum is taking the safe handle and the blade.

, You are know beginning the aerial. For this portion of the trick, the blade is launched into the air and then caught with the same hand. This is the most difficult part of the trick to teach and learn. It is also the most dangerous part.
If you are using a sharpened butterfly knife, it is best to angle the bite down. Otherwise, you are likely to be cut. It is highly recommended that you practice this step with a trainer or a taped blade.

, The blade should begin to nose over and start falling by itself.


Note that the bite handle will be angled downward.
All of the momentum carried in this nose-over portion of the trick is now swinging the blade back towards your fingers.

, Note that the blade was moving down toward you in the previous step. In order to toss the knife up in the air for the aerial, you will move your hand up so that the blade begins moving away from you in the opposite direction.Once the knife is in the air, it should flip over before falling back down.

, You have just finished the trebuchet trick. You now know how to open a butterfly knife in style.

Find a piece of wire.Chances are you don't have a key in your pocket, unless you're performing your escape as a magic trick.,
Place it into the keyhole.,
Bend it.,
Now bend it the other way.,
Insert the ""key"" in the hole.,
Twist it and spring the cuffs open.",How to Escape from Handcuffs1," Not a problem; you can fashion a key from many small, wire-like materials. Look for one of the following:


A paperclip. This is probably the easiest item to use for a homemade handcuffs key, and the easiest to come by. Straighten it out so you can bend it into a key-like shape.






A hairpin or bobby pin. Again, you'll need to straighten this before you can use it. If it has a plastic covering, remove it before using.
A length of stiff wire.;
, Find the keyhole on the handcuffs and place the straight piece of wire inside of it.

, With the wire placed inside the keyhole, bend it about 70 degrees.

, Put it back in the hole and bend the end again. You should end up with an angle shaped like a squiggle.

, Find the hole again and wiggle the bent part into the hole so that it points toward the locking arm. It should be at a 90-degree angle to the keyhole., Just like you would with a key, twist the piece of wire. It should lift the locking device inside and click the cuffs open.


You may have to practice twisting the key in both directions before it springs open. Be patient.






If you're unlocking the cuffs from behind your back, be very careful not to let go of the pick you're using.

Squeeze a large amount of superglue all around the edge of the lid. Replace the lid quickly. After a few seconds, the super glue will dry and the lid will be impossible to remove.If you get any super glue on your fingers, use nail polish remover to get it off.

, Find a dry bar of soap and a bottle of clear nail polish remover. Paint the bar of soap with a few thick coats of clear nail polish. Allow the soap to dry for five to ten minutes between each coat. After three or four coats, the soap will be completely sealed in the nail polish. When someone tries to use it in the shower it won’t create any lather at all.

Create your workspace.,
Apply spray paint to the bottle.,
Let the first coat dry.,
Add fun designs using painter’s tape.,
Paint freely.,
Finished.",How to Make a Beer Bottle Bud Vase," Fill the bottle with hot soapy water to remove all residue, then rinse thoroughly to remove all traces of soap. Let air dry before proceeding.


If the bottle has a label, it's usually easiest to soak the bottle in hot water for a short time to soften the glue and lift the label.






Carefully scrape any remaining glue from the bottle to ensure a clean, smooth surface. Using an oil like tea tree oil or rubbing alcohol will remove any last residue of glue.





;
, This is where you get to complement the vase with your personal decor.


Select spray paint that can be applied evenly and is washable. Your local hardware or craft store should be able to provide you with a sizable selection of paints. If not, check online.
If you're planning to create a design on your bottle, you’ll need a complementary color, and if you're painting multiple bottles, you may want to use different colors to display throughout your home.







, Since you’ll be using spray paint set up in a well ventilated area (an outdoor area is ideal if it's practical and humidity is low). Use plenty of newspaper around and underneath your bottle to protect furniture, soft furnishings and anything else in the area.


Find a flat surface for your workspace. Since you’ll be spraying your bottle while it’s standing up, the bottle should stand firm.
Clear the area of pets and small children to avoid mishaps. Dust the area too––errant pet hair could get stuck to the paintwork. (It also helps to tie back your hair if it's long.)

, For even coverage, spray a layer of base coat over the entire bottle. Don't worry about perfection––aim to cover as much as possible and keep it as even as you can.

, Next, apply a second coat to ensure complete coverage. You should really see the color pop during the second application.

, Once the paint has dried, you can add designs by marking off areas using painter’s (or masking) tape. You can take two different approaches to this craft––either by using the tape as part of the bottle's actual design (as shown in this image) or marking off areas on the bottle itself and painting over the tape, using it as a stencil.



As the actual design: Cut strips of quality tape (in a complementary color) from the roll and apply to the bottle. For shapelier designs, use your scissors to round out the tape.

As a paint stencil: If you plan to paint over the tape, you will have needed to select one paint color for your design and another color for the base. The design color will be the first coat you’ve applied before adding the painter's tape. Be sure the tape is fully adhered to the bottle before painting; any slip will spoil the design. Then paint over the entire bottle, including over the tape (the tape protects the painted color underneath, producing the design from that layer). Once that paint has fully dried, decide whether another layer would improve the finish. Once satisfied, carefully remove the tape, pulling slowly so as to avoid compromising the design.

, Freeform design painting is also a great way to improve the look of the vase, such as the hearts shown in this image.


If you don't want to paint designs, consider gluing items on the vase, such as rhinestones or costume gems. This will ""bejewel"" your vase.

, Place your fully dried beer bottle bud vases on display anywhere they'll catch the eye.

Gather a group of friends.,
Pick a house to ding dong ditch.,
Plan your escape route.,
Find a hiding spot.",How to Play 'Ding Dong Ditch'1," The fewer people you bring, the easier it will be to run away and hide without being conspicuous. However, you might find that a big group is a lot of fun. Go on foot, if possible, or bring bicycles for a quick getaway. You can all go in a car, if you have access to one, but make sure that you don't park it right in front of the target's house.


If you don't want anyone to find out that it was you, make sure to bring people that can keep a secret. If one person tells, then your cover is blown!;
, Target someone that you know – ideally, a friend on whom you want to play a prank. Make sure that he/she is home. Pick a house that's easily accessible and that doesn't have much in the way of security systems. Avoid ding dong ditching people that you don't know or don't like.


Be aware that your friend's parents might open the door instead of your friend. Assuming that you want to prank your friend and not bother anybody else: try to pick a time when your friend is home alone without his/her parents.
Make sure that the house has a doorbell. If not, you can always ""knock ditch.""

, The most important part of the game is the ""ditch."" Scope out the house from a distance and decide which way you're going to run. The exact route will depend on the house, the time of day, and the number of people. If you don't plan it out, then there's a higher chance that someone will get caught.


Consider using a getaway car. Consider hopping onto bikes to pedal away. It will almost always be easier to get away at night.
If there is a long driveway or large yard in front of the house, then you might want to ditch into the bushes or jump into a neighbor's yard.
If you are ding dong ditching at night, then you have the cover of darkness on your side. Look out for motion-sensor lights. If you're playing during the day, then you'll need to pick houses with a quicker, shorter escape route.
If you're playing with only one or two other people, then it might be most effective to all run in the same direction. This way, you can stick together and hide in a secure space. If you have a lot of people in your crew—say, more than five—then you might want to scatter after each ding dong ditch so that it's harder to track down the group.

, Scout out a secretive spot from which you can see the reaction of the person you've ding dong ditched. Pick a space that is far enough away to avoid detection, but not so far that you that you can't clearly see the doorbell-owner's reaction. Hide in the bushes, or in a tree, or underneath a car.

However, make sure the home you choose doesn't have low windows (especially near the door), a dog outside, no trees or bushes, and anything else you may think is hazardous. Try to play this game at night. During the day, it is pointless for two reasons. One, the point of the game is to get someone mad, and it won't be too bad for the person at the house if they just answer the door and no one is there; it will be just a slight annoyance, unlike when you do it at night when you wake someone up. Two, it is easier because it would be harder to see you at night.

, If you are caught, remember that if the person doesn't know you, don't talk to them, just run. If playing by yourself, ring the doorbell a few times and run. If playing with one friend, one of you rings the doorbell, one knocks. If playing with more than one friend making a group of three or more people, one person rings the bell and everyone else knocks on the door. A good plan is ""I wanted to ask you something, but I forgot so I don't want to take up your time"" and smile.

Buy your supplies.,
Prepare your pies.,
Now take the pie(s) and gently push it into your or someone else's face.",How to Pie Someone in the Face," You should buy paper plates or pie tins. If you use pie tins use crust. Then buy some whipped cream (cool whip is good) no spray cans such as Reddi-Wip or Cool Whip in a can. Shaving Cream can also work really well but make sure you use sensitive skin so it doesn't burn your eyes.;
, Place a whole container of Cool Whip per pie. If using shaving cream, use as much or as little as you want. The more the merrier. If you are on a budget, Shaving cream is the cheapest way to go for the maximum number of pies

, You can do a ""pie sandwich"" which means the person gets two pies on the sides of their head at once. So your head is 'sandwiched' between the two pies. Or if you have cardboard, you can cut two large circles in it and make it stand up. Get your victim to put his or her face in the hole. Have pies and cameras ready. Throw those pies! Or they can sit in a chair and you can throw them.Once you placed the pie on the face, mush it around even move it upwards into the hair. Once you put the pie down you can then clean the person up. Then for added effect, after the face is clean, do it again! When that happens its unexpected and really funny. Clean up with a shower.

Decide who is going to ring the doorbell.,
Ring the doorbell.,
Run!",How to Play 'Ding Dong Ditch'2," Usually, someone will step up to do it. Switch off at every house to make sure that it's fair. The person who actually rings the doorbell is taking on the most risk – but that's also why this job is fun. Everyone else can wait at the car or the hiding spot.

, Have the ringer creep stealthily up to the door and ring the doorbell. Ring the doorbell once, casually, for a subtle ding dong ditch. Ring it many times to really raise the roof! Keep in mind that the prank may be more effective if the person actually thinks that there is someone at the door. If you ring their bell obnoxiously, then they might just get annoyed.


Start running as soon as you ring the bell. Don't stand in front of the door for longer than a second or two. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to get caught.
Knock if there is no doorbell. Don't hammer obnoxiously on the door. Knock like you're a visitor or a delivery person so that the owners of the doorbell think there's actually someone there.

, After hitting the doorbell, the ringer sprints away at full speed. Regroup in the hiding spot, if you want to see the person's reaction. If you're worried about getting caught, then just run to safety.

"

Ring the same doorbell again for effect.,
Choose more houses to prank.,
Don't take it too far.,
Make a plan for if you get caught.",How to Play 'Ding Dong Ditch'3," If you want to really seriously prank someone: wait until the owner of the doorbell closes the door to go back inside. Then, sneak back up to the door and ring the bell again – even more obnoxiously this time! Remember: each time you re-ring a doorbell, you run a greater risk of getting caught.


Don't take it too far. If you ding dong ditch one house more than two or three times, then the owners will begin to get frustrated. They might wait by the door to catch you – and they might even call the police!
Do not be malicious. At some point, you are just being cruel by endlessly tormenting the same person or family. Remember that you're disturbing everyone in the house, not just your friend.

, Once you're satisfied with your ding dong ditch on the first house, move to a different street and locate your next target. Pick another friend or another person you know. Bike, walk, or drive to the next location and repeat your procedure. Have fun, but don't be careless! If you let your guard down, then you might get caught.


Play until you've had your fun. Remember: the longer you stay out playing ding dong ditch, the more likely you are to get caught – especially if you are repeatedly hitting houses in the same neighborhood.
On one hand, it's easier to get from house to house if you stay within a single neighborhood or a few blocks. However, if you hop around and hit several different neighborhoods, you and your friends will be harder to track down.

, Remember that this game is all in good fun. Ding dong ditch can bring you and your friends together, but it also impacts the lives of the people whose doorbells you ring. Do not use this game to harass or target anyone. Have a good time, but don't get too carried away. If you take it too far, then you might damage friendships, get in trouble, get the police called on you, or worse., Depending on who catches you, you might choose to play it cool or to own up and apologize. Read the situation and know when to give yourself up.


If you're standing on someone's porch and they open the door before you can get away: just pretend that you are visiting them, or that you are coming to ask about something. Pretend that you are distributing fliers, or delivering a gift, or coming to borrow some sugar.
If you get caught in the act by your friend, your friend's parents, or a neighbor: play it cool if you can get away with it, but know when to own up to the prank. This is when you should apologize and say, ""We were just trying to play a dumb prank. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.""
If you get caught by the police, it's usually best to just be honest. You might be able to get away with a cover-up lie – but the officers have probably seen this before, and there's a chance that they'll see through your story. If you are sincere and show that you've learned something from the experience, then they'll usually let you go with just a warning.

, Trees, and on top of houses are great, because of something I call the 3-D Hiding Theory. This theory takes into consideration that humans are naturally 2-D animals, we live on the ground. Therefore, it is unnatural for us to look for each other hiding in elevated positions. If you decide to take this approach to hiding, remember that you need to be able to get down quickly in case you are spotted. Lighting, check for porch lights, street lights and possible motion sensing lights. Check for dogs in the back yard and possible signs of dogs, like chewed up tennis balls and bones. You could also draw a map of the area to make infiltration points and escape routes.

",How to Moon Someone," Obviously, you might want to just moon someone because you think it's a funny practical joke. Well, it's also extremely crude, and insulting, so don't moon someone that you don't wish to be insulted by it. A good thing to remember also, at this point, is to look around. Is there someone you are attracted to nearby? What about family members? If so, it is generally advised to walk away at this point, pants remaining buttoned.;
, This is optional, if you are running short on time. If you don't have time to figure out where you are going to run to, just run for the nearest bush, or, if you are in a city, alley. If you are indoors, run for the door.

, Keep one hand on your fly, so you will be able to pull and zip up your pants again as quickly as possible after mooning. There is nothing more humiliating than attempting to make a moon n' dash- mooning someone, and then running away, than finding out that you are unable to pull up your pants on time. If this is the case, you will fall. With your pants down around your ankles. That is the only possible way that your mooning will actually backfire, making you the ""butt"" of the joke.

,, The time between these two steps should be kept to an absolute minimum. People will be tempted to actually kick you, in the butt, when you moon them. The best way to avoid this is to not give them time. About a second or so of mooning is plenty to make your point.

,, If you followed step two, you already had an escape plan prepared at this point. You don't need to stick around and argue- there is no comeback to a mooning, and you should hope that whoever you mooned does not chose to run after you. At this point, you should be trying to put whatever possible between you and the person you mooned.

A nail file
Nail clippers
Tweezers
A plastic bag
A notebook
A paint brush
A bottle of loose, nude colored powder
A bottle of white paint
A bottle of red paint;
, Choose a medium length nail and use the nail clippers to trim it down so it is the appropriate size and shape for a tooth.

, Keep in mind you will need four larger teeth to make two front teeth on the top and two front teeth on the bottom, as well as 12 smaller teeth.


You can also draw the shape of a tooth on the nail and cut it out based on the drawing.

, You just want to make the teeth look round and smooth so don’t file them too hard as this could make them appear uneven.

, If you are using a large Ziploc bag, simply slide the notebook into the bag and place it on an even surface.

, Use the non brush end of the paint brush and dip the tip into the latex.

, Use the latex covered paint brush to draw out a flat triangle shape that is about the size of your mouth.


Do several layers of the latex in the flat triangle shape on the plastic bag and then fill in the triangle with the liquid latex.

, Lay the teeth out one by one onto the long side of the latex triangle, forming a top row of teeth.


It’s important to get the teeth onto the latex before it dries so try to place the teeth on as carefully and quickly as possible.
If the latex triangle is not long enough to fit all of the teeth, use a latex covered paint brush to extend the length of the triangle.

, This triangle will be for the bottom row of teeth. Use tweezers to add the teeth to the latex one by one, just as you did for the top row of teeth.

, It should take about 15-20 minutes to dry completely. The latex may turn a slightly yellowish color once it dries.

, Using a make up brush, dab powder onto the latex.

Gather the ingredients.,
Mix the ingredients in a large bowl.,
Shape the mix.,
Set aside to dry.",How to Make Fake Poop for a Prank1," For this method, you’ll need 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, ⅓ cup of peanut butter, ⅓ cup of cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon milk. You won’t need any cooking supplies besides a large bowl in which to mix the ingredients. The ingredients will form a dough that you mold into fake poop.The peanut butter you use can be creamy or chunky. Chunky peanut butter can add a little texture to the eventual product.
If you’ve only got creamy peanut butter, but want to add some texture, you can include some chopped nuts of any kind.;
, There’s no special order in which you need to add ingredients. Just throw them in as you’d like. Spend about 2 minutes stirring with a large spoon until all the ingredients are well-mixed. The color should be a dark brown and you shouldn’t be able to spot any constituent ingredients.


If the mix seems too thick for shaping, add more milk until it feels malleable enough to mold into pieces. If it seems too runny, consider adding a bit more cocoa powder or peanut butter.

, Once all the ingredients have been combined and mixed in with one another, you’ll want to begin to mold your fake poops. The size is entirely up to you, though it’s important to keep it reasonable if you’d like the fake poop to be believable. Depending on the size of your mold, this mix should yield six to eight separate pieces., Once you’ve molded all the individual pieces, set them aside on a large plate, uncovered, to dry. Due to the milk used in the mix the pieces will still be a little moist for use. There’s no precise amount of time you ought to wait; continue checking the pieces until you feel they’re dry enough to handle.


These fake poops contain dairy products. You’ll want to make use of them within the day.
If you want to make them last longer, refrigerate them.

The seedpods look like brown wings or helicopter propellers.During the spring and summer, the seedpods are immature. Consequently, they are green and still attached to the tree’s branches. Pluck them from the tree and bring them home. Place them on a windowsill to ripen and dry out until they are brown.

, The paper will be used to catch the silver hairs that are attached to the wing part of the seedpod. The silver hairs are what cause the itching sensation.To protect your hands, put on a pair of rubber gloves.

, Use scissors to detach the wings from the actual seed. Also, cut away the spine that runs along the edge of the wing., Take two wings and rub them against each other until the silver hairs begin to fall off. Do this until the majority of the silver hairs have fallen off. Repeat this process for all of the wings until you have about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of silver hairs.Alternatively, you can use a razor blade to remove the silver hairs. Run the blade against the wings to remove the silver hairs.

, Pick up the piece of paper and slide the hairs into a sealable plastic bag. Store the hairs in a dark place, like a cupboard, for two to three days to dry them out further. This will increase their itching intensity.You can also store the hairs in a glass vial.
For cautionary purposes, place a label on the bag that says, “CAUTION. DO NOT TOUCH OR THROW AWAY.”

Buy plastic cups.,
Draw the shape of the teeth on the cup.,
Cut out the teeth.,
Attach them to your mouth.",How to Make Fake Teeth2," Choose cups that are made out of white, thin, disposable plastic, as you’ll want white material that is easy to cut.

, Take a permanent marker and draw the desired shape of your teeth on the outside of the plastic cup.

, Get a sharp pair of scissors and cut along the lines you've drawn to cut out the teeth.

, The best place to attach them is behind your upper lip and in front of your teeth, where they can't fall out.

Check the teeth out in the mirror to ensure they are the desired size and look secure in your mouth.
If the fake teeth start to split you can use dental floss to tie them back together.

Fill a bowl with water.,
Open the cardboard roll.,
Submerge the paper roll.,
Mold your fake poop.",How to Make Fake Poop for a Prank2," In this method, you’ll need only a cardboard toilet paper roll (with the toilet paper gone) and some water. To begin, fill a relatively large bowl with water. Be sure the temperature of the water is comfortable enough to put your hands in. You could also fill a sink for quick drainage later.

, On your toilet paper roll, you should see that it is formed by a spiral glued to itself. Generally the ends of the spiral will be pointed tips at either end of the toilet paper roll. The cardboard should be soft enough that you can rip it yourself, undoing the glue and unfurling the paper roll into a cardboard sheet.If the cardboard doesn’t seem to want to budge, don’t hesitate to get scissors and simply cut the roll lengthwise in half.

, Take the now open cardboard roll and push it to the bottom of the bowl of water. You’ll most likely need to hold it at the bottom with your hand. Allow a minute or so for the cardboard roll to fill with water. Once soaked, it will be pliable and capable of molding into your fake poop.


Don’t fret if the cardboard ends up ripping. Once you begin the mold, you can simply stick the fallen pieces back on. The only concern is pieces falling off once the mold dries.

, Remove the cardboard from the water. You may need to hold it above the bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess water to fall off. The cardboard is best molded by laying it flat in your hand and squeezing into a closed fist. This will compress the cardboard into your fake poop.Like the previous method, this fake poop is also used best shortly after its creation. Otherwise, the cardboard may dry out and begin to crack and fall apart.
You may be able to make your fake poop last longer by sprinkling a bit of water over it as it begins to dry.

"
"
Collect your ingredients.,
Combine your ingredients.,
Knead the mixture for about a minute.,
Form your fake poop.",How to Make Fake Poop for a Prank3," For this method, you’ll need a 1/2 cup of white glue. Elmer’s glue is the go-to here, or any other white school glue. You'll also need a small amount (about 1 teaspoon) of brown paint or brown food coloring, 1/2 a cup of warm water, and 1 teaspoon of borax powder. You’ll need two containers for mixing, at least one of which is fairly large for the final mix.If you have neither brown paint or brown food coloring, use chocolate syrup. You will need a slightly higher amount of chocolate syrup than you would brown paint or food coloring.
This is not the method to use if you think there’s any risk of anyone or any pet eating the fake poop. Borax, while not deadly in small amounts, is still harmful and very upsetting to the stomach.

, First, in the large bowl which will eventually contain the entire mix, combine the 1/2 cup of white glue and whatever you’re using as brown coloring. Add color until you have your desired hue. In another container, mix your borax and water until the borax is visibly dissolved.


Once both individual mixes are complete, combine them in the larger bowl, stirring constantly as you do so.
You should immediately notice the mixture begin to thicken and become more viscous, almost like pudding.

, The mixture, once combined, quickly becomes too thick to be mixed by hand and must be kneaded like dough. Using your hands, take the borax dough and push into it, pull on it, and remove it from the walls of the bowl. It should be ready for molding once you’ve formed it into a ball, with no mixture remaining on the sides of the bowl., Again, the ultimate size of the fake poop(s) will be up to you. This one can be used altogether as a single lump or broken into individual pieces. Prank-wise, this fake poop is best to be stepped in, as it matches texture with the real thing closer than many other methods will allow.

Gather your materials.To make this runny diarrhea that you can leave in a toilet, you’ll need to gather the following materials:


A large bowl and a spoon
Soda water (or any other clear, fizzy drink)
Jarred queso
Cocoa powder or mix
A packet of instant oatmeal
Kibble, like dry dog or cat food
A large ziplock bag;
,
Crush kibble into a rough powder.,
Combine the kibble with the other dry ingredients.,
Stir in your jarred queso.,
Add about a cup of soda water.,
Pour your fake diarrhea into a toilet bowl.",How to Make Fake Diarrhea1,", You want to make about 1.5 cups of kibble powder. If you have a mortar and pestle in your kitchen, you can use that to grind the kibble. Many people don't have one, though. If that's the case, just pour the kibble into a ziplock bag and seal it, making sure to get as much air out as possible. Put it on the ground and step on it, crushing the kibble until it becomes a powder.

, Pour the kibble powder into a large bowl, then add about a cup of cocoa powder or mix and a packet of instant oatmeal. Stir the dry ingredients together with a spoon to mix them all together.

, Start with 3-4 tablespoons, but you can adjust that amount. Look at the consistency and decide if you want to thicken the mixture up at all. Keep in mind, though, that diarrhea is supposed to be very thin. You'll add soda water to get the perfect consistency in the next step.


If you don't have queso on hand, you can use mashed up ripe bananas or a thick mustard. Grainy mustards can work well to give the diarrhea an especially gross appearance.

, As with the queso, start small and add more liquid as necessary. You can always add more water, but you can't take it out once you've poured it in. Keep mixing the ingredients together with a spoon until it reaches a runny consistency that look like diarrhea.


If the mixture gets too runny, you might add some more dry ingredients to give it back some texture.

, Get ready to make a mess! Pour the diarrhea from a little bit of a height — just above the rim of the toilet bowl. This will cause it to splash a bit, spreading the fake diarrhea up the sides of the toilet bowl. It'll look both gross and realistic.


Make sure to clean up the fake diarrhea from any places that would be unbelievable. If someone actually had diarrhea, it couldn't get on top of the toilet seat or on the lid.

Watch other roasts for inspiration.,
Think about odd habits or quirks.,
Recall notable memories.,
Stretch the truth, but don't ignore it.,
Get information from other people.,
State the obvious.",How to Roast Someone1," If you don't have much experience with roasts, take some time to do research. Watch roasts of other people and figure out the techniques people use to get the most laughs. You can find roasts of celebrities on comedy channels or on the internet.Keep in mind that professional roasts may go a bit farther than you should, depending on your situation. For instance, if you're roasting your boss, you may need to tone it down a lot.;
, Write down anything the person does that's a bit crazy or silly. Maybe the person has a habit of only eating food on separate plates or only getting in the elevator if there are fewer than five people on it. These little habits can be great for filling out a roast.For example, if the person you're roasting loves peanut butter and bologna sandwiches, that's a little outside of the norm and people may find it funny. However, if the person likes to send mean messages to people, that's not as fun. It goes against the norm, but it also causes emotional harm to people., Another good source for a roast is interesting interactions you've had with the person. Everyone has days where they're a little off, and how that person acted on an ""off"" day could be a source for a roast. Alternatively, if you have any memories where the person did something truly goofy, that could be a great story for a roast.For instance, maybe a person jumped into the pool (fully clothed) at an office party to save a box of donuts. You could use that to tease the person a bit.

, Often, the roast jokes that get the most laughs have an element of truth in them, but don't cross the line into being outright mean.


For instance, you might turn a mention of the one pair of pants that Joe wears to work that are just a bit too short into a riff on his Steve Urkel-esque fashion sense. But don't just attack the person's sense of style without any context, or berate them for wearing clothes that make them look fat.

, If you're having trouble coming up with enough material on your own, feel free to ask other people if they have anything they'd like to add. You may find they contribute something you'd never have thought of, making the roast that much richer.You could also use stories that have gone around in your social group over the years. For instance, maybe the person is notorious for always burning dinner when guests come over, and so it's joked about in your group:

""Everyone knows Joe’s misadventures around the grill. So when he invites me over for a cookout, I skip a step and bring the fire department with me. OK, honestly I just make up an excuse and get take-out instead. There’s really no punchline here. Joe’s just a terrible, terrible cook.”



, Don’t drive yourself crazy looking for obscure joke topics. Focus first on things that everyone who even barely knows the person being roasted will quickly recognize. Is the person really tall? Do they have a shockingly deep voice? Are they bald? As long as it’s something you know they can laugh about, aim several of your jokes at this kind of easy target.Is the person getting old?: “Larry doesn’t need to go to the theater to see ‘The Mummy’. He was there when they wrapped and buried it.”
Is the person bad with technology?: “Larry is a decent nurse, but terrible with computers. He’s introduced more viruses into the office than the patients have.”
Is the person a spendthrift?: “Larry’s so cheap, the shops in town all had to change the notes on the change dishes by their cash registers to read ‘take a penny, LEAVE A PENNY LARRY!’

Find a friend who will appreciate the joke and/or love seeing a rainbow appear on his or her windshield.,
Choose a suitable day to create the rainbow.",How to Make a Windshield Rainbow Prank1," Don’t try this prank on a someone who is likely to totally lose it and never do it to someone who is learning to drive or uncertain about driving. Choose that good buddy who will totally enjoy the prank.


Consider creating the rainbow to cheer up a friend or someone who has been sad or depressed. It might be a fun, sunny way to let that person know that everything will be okay.;
, It's probably best to do this on a day when you know it might rain (so that the windshield wipers will be necessary). However, avoid days where the rain is bucketing down; it's a fine balancing act to get a day with light rain!

Buy a bottle of Axe and the rest of your supplies (listed below).,
Choose your target.,
Don't create a massive fire.,
Make holes in the can.,
Take off the nub from the top of the can.,
Soak the paper with the Axe.,
Put the pieces of paper in the soda can.,
Spray a whole bunch more Axe in the can.,
Get the bomb and the lighter ready.,
Bring a friend (optional).,
Hold the bomb out in front of you sideways and LIGHT!,
Throw it in the room!,
Run!

",How to Make Axe Bombs," Any Axe aerosol spray will work, since it is flammable.


The bomb will work great with any fragrance. But the stink will last a while, so pick the fragrance that you think is most offensive.
Make sure you get a long neck lighter. You don't want to ignite this sucker with a tiny match. That's a good way to get burned.
The rubber gloves are not required. But you don't want Axe all over your hands if you are covering your tracks.;
, The ideal target is someone you want to mess with, that gives a good reaction, but won't be smart enough to track you down.

, This is serious, folks. You don't want to throw this bomb onto a big rug. In the big city, that is called Arson. Don't choose a flammable target!


Many successful bombs have been thrown in camp cabins (that have dirt floors).
If its your first bomb throw, you may want to practice in an empty field.

, Take the empty soda can and poke a few holes in the bottom with the screwdriver.


Make like 4 or 5 holes. Doesn't matter if they are next to each other or not, just needs to be enough to let the smoke spray out the bottom.
Best to be careful to make holes in the bottom only. Don't destroy the can.

, The nub can go completely, just toss it out. The sharp part inside the can near where you put your mouth can be just pushed back all the way. You just want to make sure you don't cut yourself on it later when you are stuffing Axe soaked paper inside the bomb.

, Spray the Axe onto the paper. Use up a ton till its soaked. Then, rip up the paper, rolling up the pieces that will fit inside the can. Make sure the paper is ripped and rolled into pieces that are small enough to fit.


Your hands will smell like Axe if you do that, so if you are worried about getting caught, use rubber gloves.

, The ripped up pieces of paper should now be small enough to fit. Just stuff them in the hole you drink from. Ram them in there till it is full, but don't be afraid to mush it down pretty dense. As long as there is air between the paper, it will burn just fine.

, Soak up the inside of the can with the Axe. The paper will absorb most of it, but you will get some leaking out the other side. That is OK, but may leave a trail.

, If you have more than one Bomb, get 'em all ready. Be careful they don't leak all over you. As long as you keep them sideways, there won't be any leakage.

, You can bring a friend to be a witness, record for YouTube, and generally laugh and be impressed with your cleverness. Note however, the more people watching, the better chance the secret will leak.


Some friends are idiots, and can't keep a secret. Don't invite them.
Generally, when fire is involved, you want your friends to be sober.
If you have many bombs, you will need something to carry them. You can use a friend to do the carrying.

, You may need to tip the bomb a bit to its side to get the fire to go inside the can.


It will light pretty quickly. No need to get that lighter all the way inside the can.

, If you have a few bottles do the same process as you did with the other cans.


If you are highly irresponsible, are in the middle of a desert, or just like devious crafts, you can use a water balloon catapult.

Spoon some peanut butter into a bowl.You can make as little or as much fake poo as you’d like.,
Cover the peanut butter with chocolate syrup.,
Microwave for the mixture.,
Scoop the mixture into a ziplock bag.,
Snip off a corner of the ziplock bag.,
Squeeze out your fake poop.",How to Make Fake Diarrhea2," For a small amount, use at least 2 tablespoons of peanut butter.


Though you’ll add chocolate syrup in the next step, the amount of peanut butter you use is about how much fake poop you’ll have.

, Drizzle the syrup over the peanut butter until it's completely covered, but not drowning. Mix them together well. The peanut butter should become darker, taking on a more ""poo-like"" color and texture.


Add more peanut butter or syrup as needed to get the color and texture you want.

, Start with about 30 seconds, then add time 10 seconds at a time until the peanut butter gets loose and pliable. You don't want to burn the peanut butter, or else the fake poo won't look realistic.


You might want to cover the bowl with a paper towel or microwave lid to keep it from splattering and making a mess.

, The fake poo will be pretty hot at this point, so be careful not to burn yourself.


Depending on how thick a consistency you made, you might not even need to spoon it. Turn the bag inside out, grab the mixture, and pull the bag back right-side out.
Seal the peanut butter/syrup mixture into the ziplock bag so it doesn't spill out and make a mess.

, You're going to use it as a spout to squeeze out the mixture in a poo-like shape. The larger the corner you snip off, the thicker the fake poop will be.

, The mixture might still be warm, but do this step before it cools down too much. Once the peanut butter cools down, you won't be able to squeeze it through the bag easily.


Squeeze the fake poop out onto a plate or paper towel.
If you know where you want to place it, you can squeeze it directly into that spot.

Complain about stomach pain ahead of time.,
Don't complain immediately after eating, though.,
Say you feel nauseous.,
Speculate about the cause.,
Don’t eat in front of the person you’re pranking.",How to Make Fake Diarrhea3," If you're going to leave your fake diarrhea in the toilet for someone to find, set up the prank ahead of time. Make sure the person you're pranking overhears you talking about how bad your stomach hurts.


It may help to hunch over like you're in pain, or wince from time to time.

, Food poisoning usually doesn't kick in immediately. If you start faking symptoms right after a meal, people might get suspicious. Wait about half an hour before you mention anything's wrong.

, Stomach pain isn't the only symptom of food poisoning. Say you feel nauseous, too. Act like you don't know whether you need to poop or throw up.

, If you've eaten the same thing as the people around you, ask them if they're feeling any of your ""symptoms."" If you didn't eat with them, list the things you ate earlier in the day that might cause food poisoning. Maybe you ate leftovers that sat around for too long in the fridge. Maybe the restaurant you ate at earlier looked and smelled unclean.

, Nobody will believe you feel sick if you're chomping happily away at snacks. If someone offers you food, say ""Thanks, but I don't feel good right now. I don't think I should add anything more to the mix in my stomach right now!""


Instead, make a big show out of drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated.

Create note cards that give you multiple punchline options.,
Use the element of surprise.,
Get the timing right.,
Focus on detail.,
Say it with confidence.",How to Roast Someone2," Put one story or joke setup on one side of the card. On the other side, write down the punchline(s), including different directions you could take the joke (less insulting, more insulting, totally different direction). That way, it makes it easier for you to adjust your jokes based on audience response. For instance:""Just look at him over there, slouched in that chair. Let me tell you, my brother is so lazy …”

“... he can’t even summon the energy to laugh at these hilarious jokes.”
“... that when his ex-wife said ‘That’s it — I’m leaving,’ he said ‘Could you grab me a beer on your way out?’”
“... that no one even bothers to ask him to do anything anymore — oh, wait — i just realized — my brother is a genius!”



, The element of surprise can often help you create the punchline of the joke. That is, people often expect a story to go one way. If it goes a different way, that can often produce a laugh. Use the person's quirks to create the element of surprise. Alternatively, use a line of your own to surprise your audience.


For example, say the person has an obsession with tea. You could tell a little story this way: “One time, I saw Charlie lugging a box of like 200 tea bags into the office. I said, ‘Charlie, how can any person drink that much tea?’ He said ‘I’ll tell you a secret — I soak my feet in it under my desk to help with foot odor.’ And when I asked ‘Then why are your teeth stained brown?’ he answered ‘Well, I’m not going to waste it — this is expensive tea!’""

, Part of being funny is pacing yourself. If you rush through a story and the punchline, you're probably going to leave people in the dust. Instead, include pauses so that your audience can keep up, especially when you're delivering the punchline., What will really make your roast funny is putting what you have to say in perspective by using stories to drive the point home. If you just say, ""Haha, isn't Fred a joke? He's always running late,"" that's not very funny. However, if you put the same point in a story, people will find it more amusing.For example, you could say, “Fred has never been on time for a staff meeting. In fact, when it came time for him to lead one, he thought he was supposed to start it with ‘OK, any questions before we finish?’ And for the ‘continental breakfast’ he brought lukewarm decaf and half an onion bagel for everyone to share.”
While providing detail is good, make sure you don’t waste excessive time getting to the point of the joke., If you're not confident in your jokes, the people around you won't be either. The jokes will fall flat. You've got to believe in your jokes--or at least act like you believe in them--for people to actually come along for the ride.Look around the room, and catch people's eyes. Also, stand up straight, and try not to fidget. Speak in a clear, engaging tone.
Practice in the mirror a few times. And remember that you’re putting on an act.

"
"
Make sure the person is a good sport.,
Figure out where the line is.,
Give your more sensitive material a test audience.,
Watch the person's body language.,
Skip jokes about past relationships.,
Avoid jokes about taboo topics.,
Don't be truly nasty.",How to Roast Someone3," You don't want to roast someone who will be seriously offended by what you have to say. Think back: have you ever poked fun at the person? If they reacted badly, they may not be a good candidate. You could even ask the person if they'd be comfortable with being roasted, as long as it's not supposed to be surprise.While people who can’t take a joke are often the ones you feel are most deserving of a roast, they’re also usually the worst ones to actually roast. Stick with people who can laugh at themselves., Whenever you roast someone, you'll find there's a line you don't want to cross. If you cross that line, you could seriously offend the person. The problem is, that line is in a different place for every person, so it can be hard to gauge.Use your own experience with the person to decide which categories are fair game, and which are off limits.
For instance, bringing up the eating habits of someone you know has struggled with an eating disorder or body image issues is not a good idea. On the other hand, bringing up eating habits for another person may be perfectly fine, but they may have an issue if you talk about the way they dress.

, If you have jokes that you think may go too far, try running them by someone in the social group first. For instance, if you're roasting a co-worker, ask another co-worker what they think. If it's a family member, ask someone else in the family. Usually, someone can tell you if you've gone too far.Pick someone who will be discreet about the material you're testing. If it does go too far, you don't want it to get back around to the person.

, You should be able to tell if you're going too far by the person's body language. If they're laughing along with everyone else, you're probably doing okay. However, if the person looks uncomfortable, you may want to move on to another topic.For instance, the person may have a fake smile plastered on. They may even look upset.
They may have their arms or legs crossed, leaning away from you, which is an unhappy position. They may also get restless and move around in their seat a lot.

, Past relationships are often a touchy subject for people, particularly if the relationship isn't that far into the past. It's probably a good idea to skip jokes about particular relationships, especially. Also, think about who the person will be with when you're roasting them. If they're in a different relationship, you could end up causing trouble without meaning to by bringing up the past.That said, some people can handle these jokes just fine — maybe even if you were the one in the past relationship with them!

, That is, you may want to use “better safe than sorry” in deciding to leave some topics off limits. For instance, you probably shouldn't joke about someone's dead mother. Similarly, poking fun at political beliefs or religion is likely to ostracize people, including the person you're roasting.But again, there’s no hard and fast rule here. You have to know your target and your audience.

, It's hard to know exactly when a joke crosses the line into being nasty or mean, but you'll usually get a feeling. If one of the jokes you're thinking about making has you feeling uncomfortable, it's likely best to just skip it. Roasting is supposed to be fun, not truly mean.If you can’t enjoy yourself while telling the jokes, then why bother doing it at all?

Execute your puns without being excessive.",How to Make a Pun," Puns take a variety of shapes and forms. Some revolve around same sounding words, while others are more oriented toward meaning.Several puns can be used in tandem to make a compound pun, or compunned. Some puns involve words that sound similar, such as the imperfect rhyme formed by ""orange"" and ""door hinge.""Homonyms, or words that sound the same, are especially useful for the purposes of making puns.
Homographs, words that are spelled similarly, can be like a present to gifted punners.
Figurative language puns, where the figurative expression creates humorous double meanings.

Some examples of puns include:
""I wondered why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.""
""I knew a guy who had his left side cut off, He's all right now.""
""I used to be a banker, but I lost interest.""
""Two silk worms got into a race and ended in a tie."";
, This doesn't have to be a rigorous study of academic texts and dusty tomes. Simply take note of the words and phrases you hear or read daily and thoughtfully consider what makes them interesting or humorous. Even reading novels for fun, daily newspapers, or magazines can provide you with a treasure trove of words and phrases upon which you can build.


Carry a note pad and pen with you wherever you go. You never know when you'll hear a great set-up for a pun, or when an idea for a good pun will occur.
Learn sayings and proverbs like ""All that glitters is not gold"" or ""There's more than one way to skin a cat."" These figurative expressions can be intentionally misinterpreted to create a winning pun.
Consider subscribing to a daily vocabulary building service, like one that sends you new or interesting words by email.

, Especially if you have a target phrase or concept that you are trying to mold into a killer pun, a rhyming dictionary can be helpful for generating ideas. Take the word or phrase you are punning on and search it in an online rhyming dictionary. Write down your word(s), all the terms that rhyme, and then think of how to combine or juxtapose those words in interesting or humorous ways.

, Free association is where you link terms together that have a similar sense, but aren't necessarily logically connected. Words have emotional, historic, and intellectual components that can be humorous in the right situation. Comedian Brian Regan artfully does this when relating a conversation he had with a teacher:


Teacher: What are you speaking? German, Brian?
Brian: German? Jermaine! Jermaine? Jackson! Jackson five -- Tito!
Teacher: Brian, what the hell are you talking about!?
Brian: I don't know. I don't know, really..., Though we string words together one after another, the concepts represented by words form a mental structure that is sometimes unclear.These ambiguous sentences are often marked with prepositions (at, with, on, near, opposite, etc.), and pointing out that ambiguity can get a chuckle from the people you speak with.An example of this might look like:


Friend: So, at the party, I saw this crazy person dressed in a tiger suit with the binoculars.
You: Your precious bird watching binoculars? What was the tiger-man doing with those? You don't even let me use them!

, Rest assured, even naturally talented comics have to work hard to become great punsters. To help your punning skills grow, you might want to practice punning through writing by:


Listing common clichés and creating puns from these.
Inventing a character that frequently uses puns and putting her into interesting situations/conversations.Writing down favorite phrases and giving these a twist with a near-rhymes or like-sounding words.

, Every year, the O. Henry Museum in Austin, Texas, holds a contest to see who is the punniest of all.By watching online videos of the O. Henry Pun-Off, you can develop your comedic timing, train your punning sensibilities, and maybe even be inspired with new material.

, Careful listeners can best recognize the opportunity to make a pun when it arrives. But a true pun expert can, with enough creativity, make a pun in almost any situation. While listening, allow your mind to freely associate and consider potential homophones that you might use to get a laugh.


To help you get into the swing of punning, you might try rhyming in your head as you listen to conversation. This can be distracting at first, but with practice, can allow you to quickly think of a near-rhyme pun.

, Conversation between even talkative people is littered with pauses. People tend to pause for a slightly longer interval at the end of a phrase or while grasping for the next thing to say, and these moments are ideal places for you to make your pun.You might also wait until something humorous occurs or your conversation partner tells an amusing story. Then you can use of the light atmosphere to your advantage and make your pun., As quickly as you can, think up as many synonyms, homonyms, or near-rhyme words. Most of these will likely be poor options for the pun you are trying to construct, but you'll have to dig through the duds to find your pun diamond. Some examples of suitable situational puns are:


When a friend is struggling with foil wrapper, you can interject with, ""I haven't seen a wrapper that obnoxious since Kanye.""
When eating a meal with pork, you might ask your dining companion, ""Do you want some cheese to go with your... swine?""

, An important element to a well-delivered pun is its sense of surprise. Most puns twist well known words or phrases in a way that is unexpected and intriguing, which is what gets laughs from listeners. This is one of the dangers of puns; sometimes your audience will miss your joke, in which case, you may want to cue your audience. You might do this by:


Ending the pun with a large, over-exaggerated smile and a wink.
Take an exaggerated pause after the pun to give listeners time to comprehend the joke.
Repeating the punned elements. To use the previous pun on Kanye West as an example, you might say, ""Get it? Wrapper/rapper? Obnoxious? Kanye West, the famous rapper???""

, Bad puns are usually those that are too obvious or have been repeated excessively. However, there is a phenomenon in punning where, if the pun is bad enough, it becomes funny again. Some examples might look like:



Bad puns:
""Denial is not just a river in Egypt.""
""Put that down, it's nacho cheese.""
""Make like a tree and leave!""

Funny bad puns:
""A ham sandwich walked into the bar and ordered a beer. The bartender replied, 'Sorry, we don't serve food here.' ""
""Why did the Clydesdale give the pony a glass of water? Because he was a little horse.""
""What time did the man go to the dentist? Tooth-hurty.""

, Punning is all about plays on words, or, to phrase it another way, about making jokes that connect things not obviously connected. Thinking in this way and seeing those connections, however, is rarely natural, and must be trained through effort. To train your mind to connect unrelated topics and be more aware of opportunities for pun, you might:


(1) Make one list of things you've experienced throughout the day and another list of things you've heard about from the news, other media, or conversation.
(2) Between the two lists, try to draw a connection between the first item on each. Then draw a connection between the second items.
(3) Continue relating items until one, or both, lists are exhausted.

, Take an event that has happened to you recently and consider it in terms of another, unrelated event. For example:


""I went out to eat seafood last night. It was rough. I've never had to work so hard at a restaurant in my life! When I reached into a dish of clams, I think I pulled a mussel.""
""Every day, I walk my dog. And every day, when we walk by this hot dog joint, he just goes crazy! I guess that's what they mean when they say dogs are territorial.""

, While you may have just met the person you are speaking with, it's likely that within a few minutes you'll have some information about him, his family, and his background.In other cases you might know the person you are talking to quite well, which can turn into ammunition for your puns. Keep these things in mind, and when trying to make a pun, see if you can work this information into your joke.


Knowing a little about guitars, you might make a pun on guitar names with your more musical friends. For example: ""Did you hear about the woman on trial for beating her husband with his guitar collection? The judge asked her, 'First offender?' She said, 'No, first a Gibson! Then a Fender!' "", It's true, you can love a thing too much, and if this is the case with your romance with puns, you might want to choose your punning moments carefully. Unless you are a pun genius, the people around you may become annoyed or frustrated at constant punning. You may want to postpone making a pun until you have an exceptionally good one, like comedian Colin Mochrie, who said:


""Today, well-known mob hitman Johnny Two-Shoes admitted that he was once hired to kill a cow in a rice field using only two small porcelain figurines. Police reports indicate that this is the only known incident of a Knick-Knack Paddy Whack."""

Joke about yourself.,
Crack one about your spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend.,
Target a group of people.,
Joke about a place or situation.,
Home in on a specific person or current event.",How to Make a Joke1," Using yourself as the butt of your own joke is a sure way to get people cracking up. There's something about self-deprecating humor that triggers schadenfreude, the act of taking pleasure in someone else's pain, and this forms the foundation of many famous comedians' jokes. Figure out what's sadly hilarious about you and offer it up for laughs.



I’m really good in bed. I can sleep for like 10 straight hours without waking up once. — Jen Kirkman

The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how much I play, I’ll never be as good as a wall. I played a wall once. They’re relentless. — Mitch Hedburg;
, We've all seen comedians use their SOs as funny joke fodder. So many people can relate that you're bound to get a few hearty laughs. If you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you can make fun of boyfriends and girlfriends in general.



Straight guys will never know how expensive it is to be a woman. And that’s why you pay for dinner. — Livia Scott

, Hipsters, rednecks, politicians, lawyers, rich people, kids, elderly people, men, women . . . the list goes on and on. Jokes about groups of people get some of the hardest laughs of all, but be careful not to go to far - you might offend people.



Everyone knows hipsters are like human bedbugs. You see one, there are probably 40 more under your bed, judging your music. — Dan Soder

, At a bus stop, high school, sports dugout, airplane, office, coffee shop, bathroom, and so on are all excellent fodder for jokes. Figure out what's quirky, annoying or surprising about somewhere you've been or something you've seen.



I grew up near Newark, New Jersey. If New York City’s the city that never sleeps, Newark, New Jersey is the city that watches you sleep. — Dan St. Germain

I will never understand why they cook on TV. I can’t smell it, can’t eat it, can’t taste it. The end of the show they hold it up to the camera, ‘Well, here it is. You can’t have any. Thanks for watching. Goodbye.’ — Jerry Seinfeld

, Talk about someone or something famous, like the president, a Hollywood celebrity, a sports figure, or someone else who's often in the news. Jokes about famous people are great, since most people will know what you're talking about and enjoy laughing at the expense of the rich and famous.



I wonder if Jeremy Irons ever quietly laughs to himself while he’s ironing. — Jon FriedmanI’ve been wearing so many scarves lately that I wonder if my ancestors were part Steven Tyler mike stand. — Selena Coppock

Choose a work area with some ventilation.,
Sand the surface of your wooden object.,
Rub the entire surface of the wood with tack cloths.,
Apply a primer or a stain to your wood.,
Grab a piece of paper and draw out a design of what you would like to do with your wooden project.,
Use a paper plate as your palette.,
Dip your flat brush into an acrylic color and begin painting your design.,
Blend colors by painting a color, washing the brush in the bowl of water and then dipping into another color while both paints are still wet.,
Allow the paint to dry completely before turning the project to work on other sides.,
Allow the entire project to dry completely.,
Spray or paint on a sealant or varnish.",How to Paint Wood Crafts," The fumes from certain products can be harmful, and it will help the paint to dry more quickly.;
, Always work with the grain of the wood. Use a fine grit sandpaper, from 140 to 180 grit.









If you purchased a woodcraft object from a craft store, you may not need to sand it. If the surface area is completely smooth, skip this step.

, These are sticky cloths that pick up dust and other debris from objects. They can be found at hardware or craft stores.








, Many tole painters use spray-on primers because of the ease of application. It is essential to prime your wood in order to ensure that the pores are filled and the paint is absorbed evenly.









You can alternatively choose to stain the wood instead. There are many types and colors of stains. You should choose those available at craft stores, rather than at hardware stores for small crafts. This is a great option if you want the primary surface to still have the appearance of wood.

, Even if you are going freehand, without a stencil, this will help you know what colors of acrylic paint to buy and help you stay on track.


If you choose a pattern with a stencil, you will also need to pick up graphite paper, tracing paper and a tracing instrument along with your paints and primer. You will need to place the tracing paper over the pattern and trace the design onto your tracing paper with a pencil. Place a piece of graphite paper, with the graphite face down, and place the tracing paper on top. Use your tracing instrument (usually a smooth metal ball at the end of a shaft), to trace it onto the top of your primed wood.

, Squeeze small amounts of colored acrylic craft paints onto the plate so that you can dip your brushes into them. Place a small bowl of water and a paper towel nearby, so you can wash the paint off your brushes.









If you plan to paint a base color onto the surface of your wooden craft project, then you can start by squeezing a large amount of the acrylic color onto the paper plate. Use a small sponge brush to apply the paint all over your project. Allow it to dry before painting further designs onto it, unless you want to blend your paints. Do this before you stencil your design on, if you are going from a pattern.

, Use an angular flat brush to paint around curves. Use a small round brush to make straight lines, dots or other precise figures.









If you are interested in learning the many different strokes of tole painting, it is a good idea to take a class. Ask at the local craft store if they know of tole painting classes, or you can take a course online.

, Use the paper towel to dry the brush completely when there is too much water on your brush or you want to start with a new color.









If you make a mistake, acrylic paints are easy to paint over, because they are water based. Simply paint over the mistake with the original base color and try again after it dries.

, Many wooden projects have at least a front and a back, if not more sides. Some projects can be turned to work on more than 1 side.


Many people choose to paint the underside the base color before starting on details. It can dry and you will not need to return to it until it is time to seal it.

, If there are many layers of paint on it, you may want to leave it for at least 24 hours.

, If it will be used often, you may want a very hard varnish or shellac. You can apply the sealant on with a sponge brush.

Pay close attention to the joke.,
Make random remarks and outbursts, such as ""Wait, I think I've heard this joke before somewhere"".

,
Right before the person gets to the end, start laughing really loudly.,
If the person telling the joke says ""This is so funny"" before they start telling the joke, then halfway through the joke, start laughing hysterically, and say "" Oh, that is funny!"",
If it is a knock knock joke, do not reply to ""knock knock"" with ""who's there"" instead reply with one of the following: ""Come in"" ""what"" ""how did you find my house"" ""no""

,
Use over-estimation to deflate the joke or story.",How to Kill a Joke," Try not to get distracted by anything else.;
,, Try not to make it too early, or you will look like a complete idiot. If you do it too late, it will seem like you are laughing with everyone else.

, It annoys people terribly.

,, If it goes something like ""Guess how much I paid for these shoes!"", respond with wild over-estimation to kill it dead. For example:


""Guess how much I paid for these shoes!""
""I dunno... like £800?""
""Well... no. £150.""
""Wow, yeah that's a lot."" (Said with little enthusiasm.)
The high point has been swatted effectively and all enthusiasm has been successfully removed.

Add an element of the absurd.,
Make it dirty.,
Say something shocking or unexpected.,
Fall back on an old standard.,
Make it relatable.,
Tell a joke so stupid it's funny.",How to Make a Joke2," Create a bizarre contrast between your target and something else. This brand of humor is especially appealing to kids, teenagers, and fans of slapstick.



If toast always lands butter-side down and cats always land on their feet, what happens if you strap toast to the back of a cat and drop it? — Steven Wright

, Some comedians make dirty jokes the base of their lineup, while others just sprinkle them in here and there. A dirty joke or two helps the audience feel relaxed, piques their interest, and helps them feel they're ""in on"" something. It's an easy way to create rapport - after all, everyone can relate.



My wife wanted to name our baby girl, Anita. I had to remind her that our last name was Cox. — Bryan Cox

God gave men both a penis and a brain, but unfortunately not enough blood supply to run both at the same time. — Robin Williams

, What hasn't already been said? What unique angle do you have? You can also get people to laugh by saying something that wouldn't normally be said about a group or person that's perceived as innocent, like kids, your grandma, nuns, kittens . . . you get the picture.



A friend will help you move. A best friend will help you move a body. — Dave Attell

If God had written the Bible, the first line should have been ‘It’s round.' — Eddie Izzard

, Certain types of jokes seem to consistently elicit laughs even though we've all heard them before. Think ""your mama"" jokes, jokes about nagging girlfriends, and jokes about messy boyfriends.



Men want the same thing from their underwear that they want from women: a little bit of support, and a little bit of freedom. — Jerry Seinfeld
A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says, 'Hey, we have a drink named after you!' The grasshopper looks surprised and says, 'You have a drink named Steve?'

, You're not going to get people to laugh unless they can see a bit of themselves in the joke. If they don't identify with either you as the joker or with the target, you're going to have some blank looks on your hands. When people relate to a joke, it gives them a cathartic release - and that's why people like jokes in the first place, isn't it?



Roses are red, violets are blue, I’m a schizophrenic, and so am I. — Billy Connolly

Ladies gotta say no to their husbands at the movies. They gotta say: 'No, we are watching back-to-back cancer movies. And then this movie about a cat.' — Tina Fey

, Puns fall into this category, as do blond jokes, baby jokes, and knock knock jokes.



I will not talk to someone who has less than 10 toes. I am LACK TOES INTOLERANT. — Gilbert Gottfried

Know your audience.,
Keep it simple and short.,
Master the deadpan expression.,
Get the timing down.",How to Make a Joke3," The target of your joke has to be funny to your audience, or you'll be facing a stone-faced crowd. Don't plan to target high school girls if you're trying to make a room full of them laugh. Tread carefully if you're targeting a political or celebrity figure in his or her hometown. A joke that would be hilarious to one group of people might cause another group to start throwing rotten vegetables.

, Telling a long story that takes more than a minute or two will likely bore your audience. Practice telling shorter jokes so you can get a sense for how to best deliver them before you move on to telling full-blown stories. Remember that the best jokes aren't always the smartest, most detailed jokes; you've got to hit people in the funny bone.


Watch the people you're talking to. If you see their eyes start to wander, wrap up the joke.
You can tell more than one joke in a row if the first one gets some laughs. Build on the energy you created.

, If you've got a big grin on your face when you're telling a joke, people will get distracted. Plus, smiling at your own joke sort of gives away the ending before you have a chance to get there. Instead, keep a straight face, make eye contact, and deliver the joke as if you were saying something as mundane as ""I'm going to the store for a gallon of milk."" Your delivery is as important to the humor of your joke as the content.

, After you deliver the setup of your joke, pause for a moment before giving the punch line. This gives people the chance to ponder and guess for a moment before you surprise them with your hilarious insight. Don't wait too long, though, or the energy of the joke will die.

Break it down to the leading line and punch line.,
Swap a few words around to give it more detail and direction.,
Create an image.,
""What would happen if you gave a suicidal person a jug of gasoline and you asked them to fill up your car?"",
Now we know that there are three parts to a joke.",How to Analyze a Joke," For the sake of the article, we're going to use: ""Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.""


""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" is a leading line. It directs and points the joke. The more detailed the leading line is, the more velocity it actually gives to the joke. This particular leading line can go to a lot of places in the punch line.
""To get to the other side."" is the punch line to the joke. This is where the joke explodes. This part needs to be timed right, have relativity to the leading line, and shouldn't be too literal.
This particular joke isn't very funny, but many people don't get why. Well, there could be multiple reasons a chicken would want to cross the road, and why on earth does it want to get to the other side? Maybe it saw another chicken and wanted to hang out, or maybe the chicken was near a chicken farm and wanted to run away. Or, just maybe the chicken got shot in the butt with a B.B gun. Who knows, but the thing we will always know, is that the chicken crossed the road for the same reason everything else wants to cross the road, which is to get to the other side. The reason it isn't funny is that there is no reason to get to the other side. We get to the other side for a reason, and that is not defined. How can we make this joke more powerful and thus, funny?;
, This will make it your own. Change ""Why did the "" to ""Why did the "" That sounds a lot better already! It's narrowed down to grandmas and Heimlich. It now has more direction because there's only one reason to get a Heimlich. Obviously, if one were to guess, she was choking on something. But there is NO way to guess just what exactly she is choking on, and that's where the funny power can come in. Now look here, she can't just choke on any old thing, right? If it were an apple she was choking on, it wouldn't be funny. (It would be funny if johnny apple seed choked on an apple. That's relevant to an apple. Or maybe a pig with an apple shoved in its mouth, but you'd have to make sure the audience knows the cook forgot to kill the pig first!) The punch line has to have a relativity to the main nouns and verbs of the leading line(s). Therefore, we will do this... ""To get to the other side"" changes to ""she swallowed her dentures.""


Now we have: ""Why did the grandma get a Heimlich? She swallowed her dentures."" Notice something, here, if you would please. What makes it funny is that she is choking on the dentures. The word ""choking"" is nowhere to be found in the joke. The word Heimlich takes care of that. If the punch line were ""she was choking on her dentures"" people probably wouldn't find it funny, because HOW the dentures got there in the first place is missing, and people could think, ""Well, that's stupid! I've never heard of a granny choking on her dentures! That just can't happen. It's improbable."" That's why the joke needs to force down the fact that yes, the grandma did swallow her dentures. How did she swallow her dentures? We'll save that for later.







, The secret part is the third part, and it is the most important part even though it isn't the main part. The secret part is the idea or image put into the audience's head that is not actually said verbally, like the fact that grandma was choking. You don't have to choke to get a Heimlich, now, do you? An idiot could just walk up and give you one! BUT, the word Heimlich had relativity to the third part of the joke. It pointed out that the grandma was probably choking. The fact that she was choking was confirmed with the punch line, and what she was choking on exactly made it a lot funnier because it added the idea of choking on dentures to the third part. Punch lines usually bring up something unexpected without actually stating the unexpected thing verbally. Let's look at some more.


""What makes a strange grinding sound in a car when you turn the key?"" ""A stupid critter"" Notice how detailed the leading line is. It gives a lot of direction to the joke. The word ""strange"" takes a big part of it, too. This isn't any old grinding sound, it's the grinding sound of something caught in your engine. It's strange. The word strange gives the hint that it's not the vehicle making the noise on its own. There's a little raccoon in there munching on a half eaten grilled cheese sandwich you threw out last night. The word strange is an about averagely powerful word to use, which is perfect. Abnormal would work too. But if you were to use the word ""morbid"" it would be too powerful and give away the fact that there's an actual biological critter creature in the engine with its legs wrapped around the engine propeller and it's tail near the engine belt. (See how just enough detail puts funny images in your head and I don't even have to say them? The detail makes half of the third part of what actually happens but is not said. That's the funny part.) The punch line, ""A stupid critter"" is short, simple, and powerful. The word ""stupid"" lets the audience know that the stupid animal didn't know any better, therefore it would crawl up into the engine and hang around. ""Critter"" lets the audience know that it wasn't a dog, it was something smaller. The word ""canine"" would work if it were a tractor you were starting up. But in this case, it's just a car.

, ""Nothing. They'd drink the gas."" Analyze this one for yourself. It's obvious.

, The lead, the punch, and the indirect idea.

, Just as you did in step one, continue to slice three more corks in half so that each has a rounded and flat side.You should have a total of eight cork pieces.

,, Place the piece of cork directly in contact with the previous piece, lining up the edge of the cork with the edge of the felt or cork board. The two pieces should be directly in contact, parallel, and aligned with the edge of the felt.


The pieces of cork should now be arranged in a square.

, These two pieces of cork should lay perpendicular to the pieces that you already arranged on the felt or cork board.Be sure that the edge of the cork piece is lined up to the edge of the felt or cork board, inline with the previous pieces.

, Place two additional pieces of cork on the felt, just above the the very first ""cork square"" that you made. Be sure to line up the edge of the cork with the felt or cork board, and that you lay them perpendicularly to the original cork square.

, Just as you did with the previous three cork squares, lay these final pieces of cork down so that they are perpendicular to the adjacent cork squares.


Once you are happy with the arrangement, you can go ahead and begin adhering the corks together to form a coaster.
Try experimenting with different sizes, shapes and patterns.

, Being careful not to disturb the other pieces, lift one of the pieces of cork from the felt or cork board and apply glue to its flat bottom.Begin with one of the pieces of cork that is along the edge of the felt or cork board. This will help you maintain a straight edge.

, Now that you have applied hot glue to the bottom of the cork, all you need to do is place it back down on the felt in its original position.

,  (These are the warps.)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it.  Smaller projects may use as few as 4, whereas larger projects may use more than 12.  It is ideal that the warps be the same color.

,  Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material.  Don't fret if you do. It happens.

,,  Keep the material snug, but not tight.  Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp.  This creates an odd number of warps.  As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time.  Continue this method until your spiral is about the size of the bottom of your basket.

,  Begin pulling the material tighter, making it pull on the weaving. By doing this, you make the sides pull up, little by little, into a basket shape. As you work, the sides should start to bend up.

Begin treating each warp as 2 separate ones, dividing each individual loop.,
Continue weaving and adding warps.,
When the mat is the desired size, cut you last weft loop.,
Cut the warps one at a time.,
Finished!",How to Use Embroidery Hoops for Crafts4,"  Use a round one for best results.  Any size will do.  Just remember: the larger the hoop, the larger the finished project, and you want the mat to fit on the seat of your chair, so size it accordingly.  


You can also use a hula hoop to make an even larger mat. A hula hoop also gives you more space to work with.

,  These will be your warps and wefts.  (See tips for definitions.)

,  (These are the warps)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it.  Smaller projects may use as few as 4, whereas larger projects may use more than 12.  It is ideal that the warps be the same color.

,  Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material.

,, Form a tight spiral, keeping the material snug, but not tight.  Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp.  This creates an odd number of warps.  As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time.  Continue this method until your spiral is about 5-8"" across.

,  It is very important to maintain your odd number of warps.

, Take care not to pull the weave tighter as you go, or you'll end up with a basket shape; just stay consistent.

,  Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly.  Tuck the ends in.

,  Tie the ends in pairs.  Trim to make a fringe or tuck in, depending on the desired look.

, Put the mat on the chair's seat and sit on down.

Lay the coaster display side down.,
Apply a bit of hot glue to each of the cork discs.,
Lay a piece of felt over the cork coaster.,
Trim the felt.",How to Make Wine Cork Coasters2," Using a sharp knife, divide your cork into five equally sized slices.Slice the cork horizontally as you would a cucumber or piece of salami. You should have five cork discs.

, Once you are done, you should have a total of 15 cork discs.

, This will create the fractal design of your coaster., Once you are happy with the shape, place a bit of hot glue on the sides of the cork discs to glue them together.Set this pentagon aside and allow it to dry.

, Use five more cork discs to create another pentagon shape.

, Apply glue to each piece of cork and reform your pentagon. Try to be sure that your pentagons are matched as close to possible, the way a real fractal would appear in nature.

, Using the last pieces of cork, glue together the final fractal just as you did the previous two. Again, try to get each of the fractals to match in shape as close to possible.

, Place glue on one of the sides of the cork fractal and adhere it directly to the side of another.

, This last piece will come into contact with both of the other cork fractals, so you need to be sure to apply glue to two adjacent sides.Once you have applied the glue, slide the final fractal into the other two so that it roughly forms a triangular shape.

, Both sides may look identical, or not. The side you want to be displayed once the coaster is complete is up to you.

, After you have decided which side of the coaster you would like to be displayed (or up), go ahead and lay it down on a flat surface display side down.

, Not just each cork fractal, but each individual disc. You will need to work rather quickly so that the glue does not begin to dry before you are finished applying it to each disc.

, You should do this before the glue dries to make sure that the cork pieces properly adhere. Once you have the felt in position, use your palms to apply a gently amount of pressure to the felt. This will make sure the glue fills any gaps between the felt and the uneven surfaces of cork.


The felt will help maintain the form of the coaster., Once the hot glue has dried you can trim the excess felt. Using a pair of sharp scissors, cut along the edge of the corks to remove any excess felt.

Learning and playing an instrument
Painting
Model making;
, You will likely have to practice a trick many times before you master it and can perform it in front of others. Strength will help you persevere, even when your muscles grow tired, and reflex will help you correct errors while practicing and performing. So ways you can train strength and reflex are:Cross country running
Dodgeball
Video games (reaction/precision based games, especially)
Racquetball

, Your mental strength emulates your physical body in that it can be strengthened through training. When you're onstage, you don't want your focus or concentration to slip, resulting in a botched trick. You may want to:Meditate
Regularly exercise
Practice memorization

Use concentration exercises


, In addition to physically mastering your magic trick, understanding a little psychology can help you to have the greatest success when performing. Your tricks will be more effective if you understand the psychology behind group dynamics, perception, and illusions., This might be a book, video, or website that gives you insights to the mechanics behind the magic. You can locate the magic section of your local public library in section 793.8 (Dewey Decimal system) or section GV 1541-1561 (Library of Congress system).


Most bookstores stock magic books in the hobbies or games section.

, You can browse the contents of your study material until you find a trick that captivates and intrigues you. This interest will motivate you through the drills and practice you will need to do before mastering the trick.It may help if you start with a trick that uses common items, otherwise you may need to invest in the components for a more complicated trick. Some common items used in basic magic tricks include: playing cards, coins, and toothpicks., Using the objects instructed (also called props), you should try to follow the instructions as closely as possible while practicing any supplied lines or wording (called patter).Repeat the instructions until you have memorized the movements and patter.


Even if you don't like the patter provided, speaking while committing the actions of your magic trick will prepare you for interacting with your audience after you have mastered the trick.

, Remove your instructions from view, and pretend there is an audience in front of you. Continue practicing your trick in this fashion until you can do it smoothly and seamlessly.


Try your trick from a variety of positions, like while standing or sitting.
Practice in front of a mirror and watch your expressions. Do you seem natural? Can you see any areas where you can tighten up your execution?

, You may be left-handed and your trick might call for a right-handed pass. Don't be afraid to change up the handedness if it helps you do the trick more easily.


You should also consider changing the patter to suit your personality and delivery. Experiment with wording that's conversational, formal, humorous, or you could eliminate patter altogether and perform in silence or to a musical selection.

, To perform this simple trick, you will need a few props to give the illusion that you are levitating a spinning card. This will trick will require:


A playing card
Clear tape
Clear elastic/fishing line (a few feet in length), You will need to attach the line to the back of your playing card with your clear tape for this illusion. For it to work best, try to make it so that the line threads up and away from the center of the back of your card.

, For you to be able to execute this trick quickly and without raising suspicions, you should make a loop, or a simple adjustable knot, at the loose end of the line. This can be slipped over a button on your shirt, attached to your belt buckle, or attached somewhere else on your body, like up your sleeve.


Take time to work out the best length for this trick. You will need enough line so that you can launch the card from your hand, leaving it hanging beneath and spinning.

, Depending on your hand, there might be a better way of hiding your fishing line from view, but you may want to try running the line through your pointer and middle finger, along the back of your hand parallel to the crease between your thumb and pointer finger, and then to your shirt button or belt., Taking care to make sure you don't get tangled in your invisible line, shuffle a deck of cards until you are ready to make your card float. Then, raising your hand with your fingers splayed, catch your invisible thread between your pointer and middle fingers. Hold your deck of cards loosely as you do this, and as you raise your hand, the card will be raised, as though it is floating, on your invisible thread.Alternately, you can shuffle until you are ready, take your trick card in hand, and launch it in a gesture similar to that of throwing a Frisbee. This will cause your card to spin rapidly and hang in the air. Try not to use excessive force! If your card moves too much, your audience might realize the pivot point from which it is hanging., If possible, you should try to do your trick it for a stranger or a casual acquaintance, as these people will be more impartial. Whatever the reaction, by gauging your audience, you can better know how to improve your performance.

, It's easy to forget details, especially after the rush of a performance. Keep a small diary or notebook backstage and jot down the reactions to your performance once you're finished.


You should also note any personal critique. Areas where you stumbled should be smoothed with more practice, awkward pauses or other difficulties can be improved by refining or thinking up patter.

, Make changes according to your notes and rehearse your trick until you are comfortable again. Now you're ready to try your trick in front of another test subject, or maybe even a small test audience.

, The atmosphere will always be slightly different when you're on the spot doing your magic. You'll have prepared yourself physically and emotionally for your test audience, but now you need to return to your stage, even if it's only a classroom or the break-room of your office.

Get familiar with different ways of holding a deck.,
Learn how to shuffle and cut cards.,
Experiment with the displaying of cards.,
Get comfortable with the basics before moving on.",How to Learn Cardistry1," This shouldn't be much of a problem to get used to. But before doing any flourish you'll need to be completely familiar with your deck of cards and how you properly handle it.


Dealer/Mechanic's grip. Simply hold the deck horizontally in the palm of your hand with your index finger on the front short edge of the deck and the other three fingers on the long side of the deck. Your thumb is simply resting on the opposite long side of the deck. A variation to this is the straddle grip. The concept is the exact same except the pinky, which will be on the rear short edge.
Biddle grip. Hold the deck in straddle grip and raise the deck with your thumb.;
, When needing to mix the card the cards around, everyone will expect a cardist to be able to do not just flashy moves, but simple things as well. For later uses, search out and learn these basic shuffles and cuts.


Shuffling cards. The most common way of doing this for most people is the overhand shuffle. But there's a lot more than that which aren't so complex either. The hindu shuffle, table riffle shuffle/riffle shuffle and strip shuffle should get you going.
Cutting cards. These are ways of shifting a packet of the deck and mixing them. Some easy ways of doing this is the swing cut and the Charlier/one handed cut.

, Wether you need someone to pick a card or you need to look at your cards. A few thing that would be beneficial to learn here is the simple card spread, card fan and ribbon spread.


Card spread. For the card spread all you need to do is while you're holding your deck in dealer's grip, push the cards a little to the side with your thumb and push out the top cards with the same thumb. When you push about three to four cards out catch it with your other hand and keep spreading them while forming a bridge.
Fanning the cards. The fan starts the same in dealer's grip and pushing the cards to the side with your thumb. But after pushing it to the side you pinch it(not too hard or too soft) between your thumb and index finger. And with the middle or index finger of your other hand you push the cards in a clockwise direction. The newer the cards, the better success you'll have with the fan.
Ribbon spread. This simple yet beautiful spread is a really nice little flourish to know. When spreading your cards down on a table, place/keep your fingers under the corner left/right and flip it. It will create a wave motion till the opposite end of the spread.

, Before jumping on to other more advanced moves, practice the basics until you can do them without even thinking about it.

To play this trick, you must take one of your friends into your confidence.,
Borrow a watch and put it in your pocket, and then ask your audience to sit at the end of the room, blindfold your friend, and lead him outside.

,
Now say: ""Ladies and gentlemen, if you will give me some small object to hide, I promise that the blind man will find it, although I shall not even tell him what he is to look for, and I shall dim the lights, so that if the bandage should slip, he will still be unable to see."",

Color in the tab of the can.,
Drain half of the soda.,
Crush in the sides of the can.,
Plant the soda for the trick.",How to Do the Soda Can Magic Trick1," With black dry erase marker, color in the tab so that it appears to be opened. You want to give the illusion that the tab of the can has been opened. Any other easily removable ink is also a good choice.


The black coloring on the tab will be wiped away as part of the act, so make sure the ink can be wiped away quickly and easily.

Paint pens are also widely available and can easily be removed, depending on when they were applied to the can.;
, Using a tack, needle, or other pointed object, punch a small hole in the can. Drain the soda through the small hole until roughly half of the contents remain.The soda will naturally drain to below wherever you placed the hole, so make sure you place the hole high enough to properly pour out the can when performing the trick.
If you place the hole too low, position the can such that the can does not leak when you get ready for the trick.

, Give the can a used, beat-up look by slightly crushing the sides of the can. Make sure you can crush the sides without soda draining out of the hole.


Don’t crush the can too hard, as this can make restoring the can more difficult.

, Put the can somewhere that gives the appearance that it has been used and emptied. The trash bin is a good spot, but the recycling bin or simply laying around in a messy room is a good idea as well.


Make sure to place the can down so that the remainder of the soda does not leak out through the hole you created.
The soda should stay carbonated for a long period of time, provided the can is not jostled or moved too much prior to performance."

Wait for the right time to grab the soda.,
Give the soda a shake.,
Wipe off the dry erase marker.,
Open the can of soda.",How to Do the Soda Can Magic Trick2," You want to convince someone of the authenticity of the act you’re about to perform. Plant the can ahead of time and wait for the right moment to reach for the soda. Approaching a friend with the soda can in hand is less impressive!Try remarking: “Man, you thirsty? I could use something to drink.”
Or say surprisingly: “I can’t believe someone threw away a perfectly good soda!”

, With your thumb over the hole you used to drain the can, shake the soda up. The pressure buildup will restore the sides of the can as if they had never been crushed. It will appear as though the soda can is refilling with liquid.


Make sure your finger is firmly over the pinhole you created. If you've ever dropped a soda or shotgunned a beer, you know that the carbonated beverage will find any way possible to relieve pressure.

, Sell this as an act of “restoring” the can to its original state. Give it a little “magic” hand wave as you rub the ink away. Make sure your audience can see the can’s tab prior to and after the removal of the ink so they can witness your magic.


This part isn’t strictly necessary, as you could simply open an already “opened” soda can. However, it will save you from getting a mouthful of ink.

, Give the soda a nice long swig. You can also pour it into a cup to better show off the fact that you “magically” refilled the can with liquid. Make sure to pour out all of the soda so that you can remove your finger from the drainage hole.


Depending on how much soda was drained from the can, you might have to deal with a little soda spillage due to the overflowing carbonation.

Place one hand resting under your chin and one hand ready to rub the coin into your elbow.,
Begin rubbing and ""accidentally"" drop the coin.,
Shift the coin to your other hand.,
Continue ""rubbing."",
Expose the vanished coin!,
Tell your audience to pick a number between 1 and 10, but not 1 or 10.,
Have them multiply this number by 2.,
Tell them to add 5 to that number.,
Have them multiply that number by 50.,
Tell them to either add 1763 or 1764 to their number.,
Have them subtract the 4-digit number of the year they were born from the number they have.,
Have them tell you their final number.",How to Do Magic Tricks," People are much more likely to believe someone who is confident than someone who is unsure of themselves, especially when it comes to magic. Even if your trick isn't that great, a little confidence can keep an audience from noticing.


The best magicians are charming. It's often just simple sleight of hand and misdirection techniques they're using to fool their audiences. If you keep a smile on your face and make your personality mesmerizing, they'll be paying less attention to your hands and more to your charisma.
Have good patter. Good patter makes the audience wonder even more how your trick worked. For instance, if your assistant is taking something out or writing something, distract the audience by making up a cool story or playing a little game. That way, your assistant gets time to do what he/she has to do and you have fun.;
, Learn the simpler magic tricks first and gradually work yourself up more advanced tricks. Some tricks are explained in full following this part but here are some simple tricks that are worth including in your repertoire:


How to Do a Basic Sleight of Hand Magic Trick

How to Perform a Simple Bar Hustle is a simple, corny magic trick that will have your friends hooting with laughter.

How to Make a Quarter Disappear –– this is one of the most basic magic tricks, and one of the first a new magician should learn.

, When you pay attention to your audience, they eat it up. They start worrying about what they're going to say and do instead of thinking about what you're saying and doing. Classic misdirection. Here are a few articles to get you started:



How to Read an Audience’s Mind will teach you how to guess what your audience is thinking - most of the time.

How to Play Light as a Feather is a fun way to involve a friend by lifting them as if they really were as light as a feather.

How to Cold Read will have your audience convinced that you are psychic.

, Don’t be afraid to use tools - the scarier, the better. Make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. Props are a great spectacle that, again, can aid in misdirection. It's all about drawing their eyes to something else other than what you're actually doing. Try these on for size:


How to Make a Magician's Tool Box
How to Bend a Spoon
How to Connect Two Paper Clips without Touching Them
How to Make a Harry Potter Wand

, A good magician always becomes completely immersed in his or her shows. Don’t be afraid to take risks! When you get really good, you can start doing physical tricks that are pretty mind-boggling:



How to Escape from a Straitjacket is sure to make the audience hold their breath.

How to Levitate will also confuse and stun the audience.

, Don’t be afraid to throw in random explosions or to use fog machines. Some other impressive effects include the following:


How to Make Smoke Come Out of Your Fingers

How to Create a Fire in Your Hand is a great special effect that will give your audience a scare.

How to Light a Candle Without Touching the Wick will show you how to light a candle seemingly by magic.

, You're gonna need a second away from your audience to set up this trick. Grab a deck of cards and make it so the Ace of Diamonds is the first one on the top of the deck and the Ace of Diamonds is the fifth or so card in the deck. Hold 8 or 9 cards in your hand.


Place the Ace of Diamonds perfectly behind the second card so it can't be seen. It needs to be aligned perfectly or else the trick will fail.
Turn the Ace of Hearts upside down and adjust the cards to the left and right of your hand so that they cover the two semicircles on the heart and the As on the card. The middle card (the Ace of Hearts) should now look like the Ace of Diamonds.

, You're not actually going to read their minds, though. You're going to do absolutely nothing of the sort. But you're going to tell them that to divert their attention away from your actual trick.


Or you could tell them something else. Set up the trick however you want. If you want to say you're going to turn these few cards into a bunny rabbit, go for it. They'll understand why you said that by the end of the trick.

, Ask them to confirm what cards are there. If you did the trick right, they'll just gloss over the ""Ace of Diamonds."" Have the volunteer go back to their seat.

, This is part of you ""reading their minds,"" and, again, is all just setting up a different trick. Tell them to think long and hard so you can penetrate their mind vibes.


If you'd like to make it a little more challenging, tell them to try to memorize a few of the cards in your deck. You'll be able to read every card they're thinking of (which is more impressive) – or their memorization helps you power your bunny-transformation skills, whichever.

, Examine the cards in your hand as you're ""thinking of their numbers"" and claim something looks wrong. While you are saying this, nonchalantly shift the cards so that the Ace of Hearts clearly looks like a heart. Be sure no to move them too much or they will know something's up.


Ask the audience if they remember all the cards that were in your hand. They should start rattling them off. When they get to the Ace, say something along the lines of, ""Exactly – that's what I thought, too."" Then show the audience the new hand with the Ace of Hearts and not the Ace of Diamonds. Whoa – it changed?
All this time, make sure the actual Ace of Diamonds is still snug under the second card in your hand. It should not be visible yet.

, Which one of your audience members was trying to mess up your trick? Who has a thing for the Ace of Diamonds? Accuse someone (in a friendly way, of course) of stealing it and demand it back. When everyone says they had no part in stealing the card, say you're going to get it back anyway. Through magic.


Be confident and fun in this part of the trick. The more you make it a spectacle and divert their attention away from the cards and more into the moment, the more successful your trick will be. They're there to enjoy themselves, not to see real, bonafide magic.

, You can do this however you want. You could sing to the cards, get the audience to perform a jig, or simply tap the deck a few times, calling the card to the top. Tell your audience you have control over the cards and they do whatever you say.


Then, after you've completed whatever it is you want to do to ""draw out"" that card, flip it over. You could also have a skeptical audience member flip it over, too. Ta. Da. Too bad you're out of energy now to turn the cards into a bunny. Maybe some other day.

, You're a little low on iron and your doctor said this was a good idea. Your audience doesn't believe you? Just watch.


This is best done sitting at a table with no one sitting on your side. You want your audience to be across from you. If they're on your sides, they may see your sleight of hand.

, Whichever is your dominant hand will be holding the coin. Take the other hand and rest the same elbow on the table, with your hand clasped into a loose fist under your chin.


This positioning is very important to the success of the trick. You'll see why in a second.

, Start rubbing the coin into the elbow that is resting on the table. Rub, rub, rub. Then, whoops! You got a little carried away and the coin drops onto the table. No problem – you'll just resume rubbing.


Try to be as believable as possible with this step. If you don't act it well enough, people will realize this is part of the trick. You want them to think it was a genuine mistake.

, As you go to grab the coin, you have two options:


Grab it with both hands, making it look as if you deposited it into your dominant hand. In reality, you made a subtle switch to the hand beneath your chin.
Grab it with your dominant hand, but then just sort of drop it off the side of the table into your non-dominant hand waiting beneath. You then lift up your arm to resume the positioning with the coin in your non-dominant hand.

, Resume the trick, rubbing the non-existent coin into your elbow. Rub, rub, rub. Oh, you can feel it vanishing! Just a few rubs more. There it goes...and tada! Coin rubbed into your skin. You feel healthier already. Where'd the coin go? You already told your audience – they'll demand another answer, but you don't have one to give them. Wink wink.


Can you get the coin back? Hmm. Maybe eventually. You're awfully worn out from all that rubbing though. Magic is so exhausting – your audience just wouldn't understand.

, When you find the right moment, you can choose to do the second half of this trick (or you can leave it at that – whichever). Tell your audience that the coin didn't rub into your elbow after all. With your non-dominant hand, casually slip the coin into your fingers. Then, grab an audience member and get the coin out of their hair, the collar of their shirt, or from behind their ear. Do they have magic powers, too?


When they ask how you did it, don't tell! Otherwise, you'll never be able to do the trick for them (or their friends, probably) again. A good magician never reveals his secrets.

, Why? Tell them that you have mathematical powers – you'll not only be able to tell them through math the number they chose, but you can tell them how old they are, too.


Alright, so this isn't really magic, but what is? If you make it fun, you can amaze your friends with how you can manipulate numbers to work to your advantage.

, If the number was 9, it is now 18. Act like you're picking out numbers from the top of your head. Say something like, ""Okay...now, why not add – no, wait. Multiply by 2.""

, 9 turned into 18, and 18 + 5 = 23. Now, 23 is the number to work with.

, You may need to bust out a calculator at this point. For our example, 23 x 50 = 1150.


This is a good point to really emphasize that you're doing this at random. You're just going to make the number huge and a little ridiculous for even you to keep track of. Whatever pops into your mind, you're going with.

, Why? They're the first two numbers that ""magically"" came to you. How do they choose which one? If they already had their birthday this year, add 1764. If they haven't, have them add 1763.


Let's say we've already had our birthday in our example. 1150 + 1764 = 2914

, Now it's time to make the equation personal. If their number was 2914 and they were born in, say, 1988, that would be 2914 - 1988.


What's 2914 - 1988? 926.

, With that information, you can tell them the number they thought of and how old they are. The first number is the number they chose in the beginning and the other number(s) is/are their age.


So for our example, our guinea pig was 26 years old – and they chose the number 9 (which we already knew).
How did you figure their answer out? Because you're a mathematical wizard, that's what.

Ask the audience to follow along with you.,
Point your thumbs down in front of you.,
Cross your arms and clasp your hands together.,
Let go with one hand to point at someone.,
Rotate one arm and clasp your hands again.,
Rotate your hands.,
Pretend to get irritated and repeat.",How to Do Magic Tricks That Require No Equipment2," As you do this trick, ask the audience to copy your hand motions. Do each step slowly, and explain to the audience what you're doing. You'll actually be doing one extra step you aren't telling them about. The audience will end up with tangled hands and arms, while you will be showing them two thumbs up.

, Hold your arms out in front of you, and point both thumbs downward. Remember, tell your audience to do the same thing you do. Wait until everyone has made this hand motion before you keep going.

, Move one arm over the other, still with both thumbs pointed downward. Clasp the fingers on your left hand and right hand together. Your wrists – and the wrists of your audience members — are now twisted around each other, with your fingers interlocking.

, As your audience figures out how to copy you, keep talking to them to distract them from what you're doing. Say, ""not like that, cross your arms like me. Remember, your thumbs are pointing downward and you're holding your hands together. There! Look at her, she's doing it right."" Keep your arms crossed over each other, but let go of your hands so you can point at the audience member you're talking about., Quickly, while the audience is still looking where you pointed, turn over the hand you pointed with. Flip that hand over completely, so your palms are touching again, then grasp your hands together. This will look similar to the position your audience members are in, but it is much less twisted.


If you're trying to practice this and don't understand it, stop and put both hands in front of you with the thumbs facing up. Clasp your hands together, then turn them so the thumbs are pointing down. This is the position you want to end up in after this step.
Keep talking and looking at your audience while you do this, not at your hands.

, Tell your audience to copy you, so everyone will give each other thumbs up. Move your hands up toward your chest, turning your hands so your thumbs are facing up. The audience will try to copy you, but because they're in a different position, they'll end up with their hands twisted, their arms still crossed, or other tangled gestures.

, Tell them they must be doing it wrong, and repeat the trick from the beginning. You can usually do this several times, while the audience laughs and wonders why they can't get it right. Use different distraction methods each time, so the audience doesn't get suspicious:


Pull your hands apart to hold an audience member's hands, and guide them in the ""right"" position. Clasp your hands together again in the fake position only you know.
Wave your hands around while clasped, shout ""Abracadabra"" or other ""magic words,"" then spin around while changing the position of your hand.

"
"
Use this for one person.,
Ask the person to hold their hands close together.,
Put your hands around his.,
Ask him to push against your hands.,
Stop pushing.",How to Do Magic Tricks That Require No Equipment3," You can use a single volunteer from a large audience, but only one person will really feel the strange effect this magic trick results in. This is a better magic trick to use on one friend or family member, or when you can repeat it for each person in a small group.

, Ask the other person to hold his hands together as though he were about to clap, with palms facing each other. If you want to ham it up, ask him to start applauding to welcome the amazing magician (yourself), then grab his hands and stop them in this position after a few claps.

, Hold your hands in a similar position, palms inward, on either side of his hands. Pretend you're about to clap in the same place he is.

, Push inward on both his hands as hard as you can. At the same time, he should be pushing outward with his hands against yours. Do this for about 60 seconds.


Optionally, chant ""magic words"" while you do this.

, After about a minute, ask him to stop pushing. Remove your hands, and ask if he feels anything. He should feel an ""invisible bubble"" pushing his hands outward, even though nothing is touching them.

Practice this in advance.,
Wear long pants.,
Stand back from the audience.,
Stand at an angle away from your audience.,
Stand up on the toe of your right foot.,
Drop your feet back onto the ground.",How to Do Magic Tricks That Require No Equipment4," This is a difficult trick to pull off, since the audience needs to be looking from exactly the right angle. Find a friend who's willing to take a look while you practice, and help you figure out the best way to position yourself while you try the steps below.

, Pick a pair of pants that has pant legs that hang down partly over your foot or shoe. The best pants will hide your heels, but keep the toes and center of your feet visible., Tell the audience you need space to concentrate, and to avoid falling on them when the levitation magic ends. The audience should be about 8–10 feet (2.5–3 meters) away.Make a big deal of ""finding the right spot"" to convince your audience that this is difficult.

, This is where a friend will come in handy, since you might have to experiment with this at different angles to find out where the illusion looks most convincing. Usually, the magician stands about 45º away from the audience, so the audience can see the back of your heels and your entire left foot, but cannot see the tip of your right foot.You can also think of this as standing on a clock face. Your toes are pointed at 10:30 or 11:00, and the audience is standing at 6:00., Make a big show of how difficult levitation is, and raise your arms into the air slowly as though your were pulling yourself up. Push up on the toe of your right foot only, where the audience can't see your foot. Raise your right heel, and your entire left foot, trying to keep them even with each other. Keep your left foot parallel with the ground. ""Hover"" for just a few seconds in this position.

, After a few seconds, drop back down to the ground. Bend your knees and ankles as you hit the ground, to make it seem like you fell from a taller height than you actually did.

"
"
Tell a friend you can make her move without touching her.,
Walk around her slowly.,
Walk around her a second time.,
Walk away.",How to Do Magic Tricks That Require No Equipment5," Tell your friend, ""I bet you will move before I finish walking around you three times, without anyone touching you."" If she won't agree, reassure her that no one will be helping you, and she won't need to do anything but stand still.

, Walk around her while pretending to concentrate very hard. Leave at least two ft (60 cm) between you. Turn to her and say ""one"" the first time you circle around her.

, Continue to circle around her slowly. Pause and wipe imaginary sweat off your forehead, and say ""Okay, you're a tough one, but I can still do this."" Finish circling her a second time, and say ""Two.""

, Quickly turn and walk directly away from her, before she realizes what's happening and tries to grab you. Wave to her and promise you'll come back in a year or two to walk around her the third time!

If all else fails, pack up and move on.",How to Do Street Magic," You've already narrowed it down to street magic, but think about which props you want to work with. If you have a specific area in mind you'd like to perform in, consider the limitations of space, lighting, and noise. You'll probably want to start out in an area without large crowds or other magicians so you can practice commanding a smaller audience's attention.


You'll have a more interesting routine if you learn several different types of tricks, but start by focusing on what drew you to the magic tricks in the first place. There are several suggestions below you can use as a base for your performance.;
, A foundational skill for magicians is the ability to manipulate small objects in unexpected ways. Practice the disappearing coin trick until you can perform it without looking. Continue to practice in front of family and other friendly audiences so you can develop your misdirection skills, directing the audience's attention away from your hands.


If you enjoy that coin trick, spice it up with variations such as the coin falling through your head. Expand your coin act with knuckle rolling. Once you're a real expert, try advanced sleight of hand tricks such as putting a coin in an audience member's pocket.
A coin is a simple and traditional object to use while practicing sleight of hand, but you move on to all sorts of objects. Make an audience member's watch (briefly) disappear as a simple lead in, or practice other tricks that involve sleight of hand, such as the missing card illusion.

, Almost everyone is familiar with card tricks, but with hundreds of variations out there, you can still find ways to surprise and delight your audience.



The four of a kind card trick involves no sleight of hand and only minimal audience distraction, making it a good first choice. This type of trick involves stacking the deck beforehand, so it won't work on a tough audience that tells you to shuffle the cards.

Card control techniques are vital for ""guess the card"" type tricks.
Use sleight of hand to make your card tricks seem more astonishing. For instance, make a card rise to the top of the deck or make a card disappear behind your hand.

, Add more to your bag of tricks by practicing specific tricks that make ordinary objects seem to do impossible things. Do you want to fool your audience with sleight of hand, or specially prepared objects? Here are several tricks to practice so you can decide which you enjoy:



Make two rubber bands pass through each other. Use rubber bands of different colors so the audience can tell which is which.
Refill a crushed soda can with your hands.

Bend a spoon with your psychic powers.

, Some types of tricks will get more attention than others. If you're aiming for fame, or if you're not great at attracting people with your announcements alone, consider some of these flashy tricks:



Escape from a straitjacket. You can make this more impressive by adding handcuffs as well, but that will take significant practice and sleight of hand ability.

Appear to levitate if you have the space to keep distance between you and the audience. There is at least one more variation on this trick. See if you can develop your own alterations to make it more convincing or astonishing!

Create smoke from your fingers. Bring along water and soap to wash this off your hands afterward.

Create a fire in your hand. Enlist a competent ally to help you practice this trick safely, as you can seriously burn your hand if you perform it incorrectly.

, Whether you seek out a mentor, or simply watch street magic techniques in slow motion on DVDs, to do street magic effectively you'll need training. Peruse the library for old magic trick books, or surf the Internet for fresh ideas. Learn the basics first, and take the time to develop your skill. Over time, you'll combine the techniques you most enjoy to create your own unique style.


Consider using trick cards and coins, which you can buy from a local magic shop or websites devoted to magician supplies.
Many cities have magic clubs, where you can meet other amateur magicians and exchange tips and ideas., Try them out in different orders and think about how you can transition from one to the next. For instance, tricks involving the same prop might make sense to do one after the other. Never repeat a trick in the same routine, and keep these guidelines in mind:


Start with a short, flashy trick that gets people excited.
Put your longer, more involved tricks in the middle, when people are already invested due to your first couple flashy tricks.
End with your best trick to make your act memorable.Keep your routine to about 3–7 minutes to avoid boring your audience.

, What you say and how you act can be just as important as your tricks for creating a memorable act. If you like to joke around, develop a ""patter"" that lightly makes fun of yourself and audience members without offending anyone. You could pretend to be surprised by your own tricks, or act mysterious and powerful, or pretend a trick causes great physical exertion. Try out different styles of acting and things to say and do while you set up and perform your trick.


Watching professional magicians perform is a great way to get ideas for your style.Confusing your audience members will probably cause them to leave. You can distract them by talking quickly or making jokes, but don't speak incoherently or change topics too quickly for them to follow.

, Regardless of your ultimate intentions, it's a good idea to maintain a disciplined routine, but especially important for the career minded magician. Strangers on a street corner might be cordial, but you won't hold their attention for long with an amateurish magic act. The best place to hone your skills is under your own roof. You might also try a few quick tricks for an acquaintance, like a teacher or co-worker.


Certain skills require an audience to practice. While you have their attention, practice your tricks that require the most misdirection, or keeping the audience's attention away from your sleight of hand trick to stop them seeing it.
When you mess up, try to recover by cracking a joke, moving to a different trick, or pretending you were intentionally failing as part of a setup. This is difficult to plan in advance, since you don't know when you'll mess up, so take advantage of a friendly audience to practice this skill., This maneuver allows you to scrutinize your act objectively. Correcting a mistake or perfecting a difficult magic trick is made easier by watching your hands in slow motion. Analyze your performance with the goal of perfecting it. Watching your tricks in a mirror will also help. Review your body language and facial expressions to rehearse showmanship.


Record your act from several angles for sleight of hand tricks to make sure they are convincing no matter where the audience is standing. You may need to practice them more, or use different variations. Hiding an object in your sleeve can conceal it from every angle, for instance, while hiding one behind your hand convincingly could take more practice.
Consider posting your videos to online forums for amateur magicians and ask for feedback.

, Start slowly with a shortened version of your routine using only the tricks you're most comfortable with. Then move on to longer routines with more variety and complexity. Besides the caliber of your technique, you should also be practicing the art of attracting a crowd, then keeping them interested and happy.


Be considerate of your fans' time. Avoid using a volunteer or bothering a passerby longer than they're comfortable with.

, It's imperative to remember that magic is a people centered activity, so to do street magic well requires people skills. Keep developing your style by practicing on the street, and take note of which stories and chatter attract attention or leave people bored. Ask basic questions of your volunteers, like their name, and speak loudly and confidently to attract a large crowd. Learning how to do street magic is all about the show.


Consider your dress and appearance as well. Some magicians, especially ones who perform for kids, enjoy absurd over the top costumes. Many street magicians prefer to dress well, but not appear too different from other people on the street.

, Street magic illusions have fascinated spectators on busy city streets for centuries. Innovative tricks have always been the best way to hold their attention. Without a unique blend of classic and cutting edge street magic techniques, you'll lose an audience fast.


It's difficult to invent a new trick from scratch, although with enough experience you'll start to get some ideas. Until then, combine two tricks you already know. (See below for a suggestion.)
Any trick that involves a prop can be combined with a sleight of hand routine. Make the prop disappear and reappear before you finish the trick to get more laughs from the audience, or replace it with an object that looks similar but has different properties, such as being flammable, able to float, etc.

, If someone interrupts you during a trick, or tries to shout out answers of guesses to how the trick is done, they want to appear cooler than you. There are several ways to deal with this type of heckler, and you should decide which to use depending on your personal preferences and the exact situation. Here's the method which requires the least adjustment to your act:Ignore them until they get bored. If they aren't getting attention, they may give up. If they persist, address remarks to the audience, not the heckler. Use indirect remarks such as ""Does anyone hear a bird calling?"" An audience member may be motivated to help kick the heckler out, without you having to interrupt your performance.

, If you need a volunteer, call them up. If you don't, try to keep a quick conversation going while drawing audience attention back to yourself. Make comments like ""I can see you're clever, which is why I'm going to reward you with your very own bent spoon.""

, It may look great when you see a professional entertainer insult a heckler, but it takes experience and confidence to do it properly. As an amateur, only resort to this as a last resort, or if the show is going to end soon anyway.


Keep the crowd on your side by not escalating the confrontation until the heckler does.
When you have a crowd on your side, you have a lot more leeway in what you can say to someone, but it's still a good idea to keep your insults silly and joking. Pretend to read them off the underside of your prop, or find another way to make it still look like part of the performance.

, Some people will focus on your hands no matter what, trying to figure out how the trick is done. The best defense against this is to perform tricks you know extremely well, that you're confident you can do even under scrutiny.


If someone does notice something and reveals it to the rest of the audience, quickly perform a more spectacular trick with the same prop to regain their awe.

, If a volunteer starts examining a prop thoroughly, or moving out of position during a trick, keep them focused with repeated commands and movement. Physically grab their arm and put it in the correct position whenever they move, acting comically exasperated for the benefit of the audience. Treat them like a disobedient child if they continue, scolding them in a silly manner.


If audience members who aren't volunteers try to touch your props, warn them away with a playful message. ""Don't touch that – there's a terrible curse on that hat!"" will get the message across without starting an argument., You don't want to drag someone completely unwilling out of the crowd to help you, but someone who is too enthusiastic might try to steal the show with a performance that doesn't match yours. Follow these tips to choose a good volunteer:If the routine involves you playing around with the volunteer or getting a reaction from them, don't pick someone too shy. This character trait can be hard to identify in advance, but attractive people and people in bright clothing are less likely to have this problem.
If your routine involves ""play flirting"", it may be wise to pick someone much older than yourself. This way, it's clear to the audience that you're joking around and not actually hitting on someone.
If you pick someone who is physically incapable of doing the trick, switch to a different trick, congratulate them, and call on another volunteer for the one you meant to do.
Don't pick someone the audience will pity or make fun of. The volunteer should have a fun time. Avoid picking drunk volunteers or people covered in food stains.

, If you can't control a heckler, you can't continue your act. But you can show them what the end result of heckling is by closing your bags and walking away. They may or may not regret driving away their fun, but at the least you've probably turned the audience against them.


If someone ""steals the show"" with a legitimately cool act of their own, such as juggling your props, let them have the attention for a couple minutes, then return to your act. The audience will love the surprise of a volunteer upstaging you, so be gracious and let everyone have their fun.

In reality, you'll keep the coin in your left hand the whole time while tricking your audience into thinking you moved it. Here's how you do it:Hold the coin between the thumb and first two fingers of your left hand.
Move your right hand towards the left, pretending to reach down to pick it up with your three middle fingers, while really letting it ""drop"" into the left hand.
Pretend that you're holding it between the index finger and thumb of your right hand.

Here's how you do it:Hold your hand with the index and pinkie fingers up and the other three fingers touching each other, doing the old ""Rock n' Roll"" symbol.
Place the card so the last inch or so (2.5 cm) tucks into the area between the middle and ring finger and thumb.
Gently snap your fingers and straighten out your hand. The card will be clipped between the first and second finger and the third and fourth finger, and will appear to have disappeared. Just make sure you're facing the audience with your palm and they can't see the card on other side of your hand.

Buy water gel powder.,
Collect the materials.,
Set up your trick.,
Gather your audience.,
Pour the water into the cups.,
Perform a little show.,
Reveal the missing water.,
Hide the evidence.",How to Do Simple Magic Tricks2," This powder, also called solid water, is available at magic shops and hobby stores. It will allow you to perform the trick.You may want to get more than one “dose” of the powder so that you can practice before trying your trick on another person.
You can substitute the material inside of a baby diaper and a tissue or another cloth to cover the gel and wedge it in. Use extra caution that these materials do not fall out during the trick.

, In addition to the water gel powder, you will also need a small pitcher of water and 3-4 cups that are not see-through. A cup that has a narrower mouth than the bottom works best, but regular colored plastic cups may also work.

, Set your cups side-by-side next to a pitcher of water. Pre-fill one cup with the water gel powder, and be sure to remember which cup it is.


Mark a small dot on the cup with the gel powder in it, but be sure the mark is facing you, not your audience.
Be sure to read the instructions on the gel powder about how much water to use with the powder. If you use too much water, the gel won’t be able to harden all of your liquid.You can color you water with a little food dye if you want it to stand out more while you pour it.
Hide all evidence of the water gel powder: discard of any packaging, and be sure your audience doesn’t look into the cups before you start your trick.

, A magician is nothing without her audience, so gather a few people around. Have them sit in front of you, if possible at eye-level with the cups, not above the cups so that they can see in.

, Let your audience see you pour the water from the pitcher into the four cups. You could even dip your fingers in the water and flick it towards them so that they see that it is not a trick pitcher or fake water.

, Your goal is to pour the water from all of the cups into the cup with the gel powder in it, but you don’t want it to be obvious that this is what you’re doing. You can create a little misdirection by using some cup-switching and distracting your audience with a good story or a few jokes.


Swap the cups back and forth.
Pour water into the regular cups too, but be sure in the end all of the water goes into the special cup.
Try pouring half from the water into one cup and half of the water into another cup, for show.
You can wave your hands over the cups or say some magic words.
Be sure you buy enough time to let the water absorb into the gel powder.

, This is it—your big moment! Make a show of revealing that each cup is empty. You may want to throw a cup or two towards the audience, just knock them over, or hold them over your head and pretend to drink out of them.


When you reveal that your special cup has no water, be sure not to throw it at the audience—try just holding it upside down for a moment or flipping it over on the table.
Be careful that you don’t allow the gel to fall out of the cup in the view of your audience.

, When the trick is over, be sure to carefully discard of the cup with the water gel in it so that your audience does not figure out the secret to your magic. The fun of magic is not knowing how it is done.

Guess a magic number.,
Guess a magic vegetable.,
Guess the name of a famous person.",How to Do an Easy Magic Trick2," This is a simple trick where you ask a person to perform some easy math that leads him to the same answer almost every time. This is what you should tell the audience member:Think of any number.
Multiply it by 2.
Add 8 to the total.
Divide it by 2.
Subtract your original number from the total.
Remember this new number--it's your secret number!
Count on the alphabet until you get to the letter that goes with your secret number. (Number 1 is A, Number 2 is B, and so on.)

, This silly trick works almost every time. All you need is some paper and pens, and several gullible audience members. First, place one scrap of paper in your left pocket that says ""celery"" on it, and place another scrap of paper in your right pocket that says ""carrot"" on it. Remember where you've placed this paper. And you're ready to begin your trick:First, hand out paper and pencils to all of your audience members.
Ask them to complete several easy mathematical tricks, about ten of them, such as multiplying 2 x 2, dividing 10 by 5, adding 3 and 3, and so on. You can say that this is getting their minds ready for mind reading.
Then say, ""Quick, write down the name of a vegetable!"" Make sure that people do this as quickly as possible; don't let anyone ""think"" about it for too long.
Call on a random audience member to say what vegetable he wrote down.
If he says ""celery,"" pull out the piece of paper in your left pocket that says ""celery."" If he says ""carrot,"" then pull out the piece of paper that says ""carrot."" Tell the audience that you have such strong mind-reading powers that you were able to predict what they were going to write down before the trick even began.
People in the US and Canada pick one of these two vegetables 80-90% of the time. If the person doesn't say one of the two vegetables, then oh well, you'll have to move on to another trick! If you're in a different country with different popular vegetables, then you have to try to find your own ""magic vegetable.""

, This trick is pretty simple but it can take a little while to master. All you need to get it done is a hat, around 10 audience members, a pen, a slate to write your prediction on, and as many scraps of paper as you have people. Here is what you have to do:Ask an audience member to shout the name of a famous person.
Write the first name down on a scrap of paper and throw it into your hat.
Ask the audience to keep shouting out names.
Pretend to write each name down, when really, you will just be writing down the first name, over and over. This is the part that takes practice.
Once the hat is filled, ask an audience member to volunteer to help you.
Say that you will predict which name he will draw out of the hat. Of course, you will predict the first name. Write it down on the slate so that everyone can see.
Have the audience member reach into the hat to pull out any scrap. Since they all say the first name, lo and behold, you have correctly predicted the name he would pull out!

Reveal your empty hand.,
Make the coin reappear.",How to Do a Basic Sleight of Hand Magic Trick1," Place the coin between your thumb and first two fingers. You want to be holding the coin on the ridged sides.


Make sure your entire hand is slightly tilted towards you. Spectators should be able to see the face of the coin easily, but turning your hand to you will make the trick easier.
Use a larger coin, especially if you are a beginner. A quarter or half dollar works well.
You can hold the coin in whichever hand feels more comfortable. For the purpose of explaining the trick, the coin will be in the left hand.;
, Take your right hand and reach in as if you are about to grab the coin. Position your hand as if you were going to grab the coin with your thumb coming in under the coin. Bring your four fingers over the top of the coin.

Make a coin disappear.,
Do the ""four robbers"" card trick.,
Do a mind reading trick.,
Do a basic string joining trick.",How to Do Magic1," This classic trick is the entryway to advanced magic for many magicians, and it's the foundation of other tricks that involve making objects disappear. Once you get the basic version down, try it with other small objects. Here's how to do it:


Display a coin to your audience. A silver dollar can add a touch of flash to the trick, but a quarter works just as well. Hold it in view of your audience between your thumb and forefinger.
Use your other hand to cover the coin. Bring your hand over the front of the coin and obscure it from view with your fingers, making as if to take it between your fingers and your thumb. While your second hand is covering the coin, let it slip down the fingers of your first hand until it rests on your pinky and is held in place with your middle and ring fingers.
Move the second hand away from the first. Your first hand should now look empty, though the coin is secretly obscured on the inside of your fingers. Make a show of clenching your second hand as though you're grasping the coin, then unclench it and show the empty palm to your audience.
While the audience's attention is on your second hand, let the coin slip to the palm of your first hand, and hold it there comfortably, making sure it is still obscured from view.
If you did the trick successfully, it will look as though the coin has simply disappeared.;
, This card trick is easy to do, and when it's done correctly it completely baffles the audience, as do most good card tricks. It requires that you distract your audience slightly by telling a story.Before you perform the trick, place the four jacks at the top of the card deck. Place three more random cards on top of the jacks.
Begin the trick by fanning out the jacks in front of your audience to make it look as though they are on the top of the deck. The three extra cards should be obscured behind them. Tell the audience that the jacks decided to rob a house together, and the deck of cards represents the house. After the audience has seen the jacks, fold them back into the deck.
Tell the audience that the first jack entered the house through a basement window. Take the top card from the deck; the audience thinks it's a jack, but it's really one of the random cards you stacked there. Don't let the audience see its face. Place the card low in the deck and push it in.
Tell the audience that the second jack entered the house through the back door. Take the top card from the deck; the audience thinks it's a jack, but it's really the second of the random cards. Place it in the middle of the deck and push it in.
Tell the audience that the third jack entered the house by climbing a tree to the second floor window and breaking in. Take the top card from the deck, which is the last random card, and push it in high in the deck.
Tell the audience that the fourth jack stayed on the roof as a lookout. Take the top card from the deck, which is the first jack, and show it to the audience before placing it back on the top of the deck.
Tell the audience that the police came and found the four jacks huddled on the roof together. Now deal the four jacks one by one so that the audience can see them. They won't be able to understand how the jacks ended up in the same place.

, In this trick, you ask three people to write a name on a slip of paper. Two of the people are to write the names of living people, and the third person should write the name of someone who has died. Announce that you have the power to pull the dead person's name out of the hat.If this content is too morbid for your audience, have people write the names of two cats and a dog, or the names of two movie stars and a politician. Here's how to do it:


Tear a sheet of note paper into three pieces. The top and bottom pieces will have a smooth edge and a rough edge, and the middle piece will have two rough edges.
Give the top and bottom pieces to two audience members and ask them to write the name of a person who is alive. Give the middle piece, the one with two rough edges, to a third person in the audience, and ask him or her to write the name of someone who has died.
Ask the participants to place the names in a hat, then leave the room.
Come back into the room once the names are in the hat. Lift it high above your head and make a show of not seeing the paper or the names. To build extra suspense, you could have someone blindfold you before you touch the hat.
Place your hand in the hat and feel for the paper with two rough edges. Pull it slowly from the hat. Place it on your forehead between your eyes, to give the appearance that your mind is absorbing its contents or somehow connecting with the dead person whose name is written on the paper.
Finally, pull off the blindfold and read the name. People will gasp to hear the dead person's name, and wonder how you performed this easy trick.

, You'll need a piece of brown twine and some beeswax, sometimes sold as magician's wax, to complete this trick. Get the string ready by working a liberal amount of wax into either end of the string. Ask an audience member to come forward as a volunteer, then perform the trick as follows:


Present the audience member with a scissors and ask him or her to cut the string in half. Hold both ends of the string so that the participant doesn't see that it's waxed.
Hold your hands far apart with one piece of string dangling from each hand so that the audience can see it has indeed been cut in half.
Bring your hands together so that the waxed ends meet. Using your fingers to hide what you're doing, rub and squeeze the ends together with your thumbs. The waxed ends will stick together.
Announce to the audience that the string has been restored, then hold it by the ends and let the newly joined center drop into view.

, It doesn't matter which one they choose. When they've seen their card, have them place the card on top of the deck.

, Really you are placing the three cards you had hidden in your hand on top of the deck. Now, the chosen card should be the fourth card in the deck.

, Of course, you are only taking one of the miscellaneous cards that are on top of it. Without showing the face of the card, put it somewhere towards the middle of the deck, claiming to be losing their card.

Grab a nickel and a dollar.,
Show the dollar bill.,
Fold your bill around the nickel.,
Balance or “levitate” the bill.,
Give the dollar back for inspection.",How to Do a Basic Sleight of Hand Magic Trick2," For this trick, you need to do a little bit of preparation. Grab a nickel and palm it. Then grab a dollar from your wallet, or ask someone for a dollar bill.


The nickel will be used to balance the folded dollar on your thumb. Your audience shouldn’t know that you have the nickel. This is a simple trick to do pretty much anywhere.
A nickel works well because it’s small and heavy enough to provide a counterbalance.

, Pinch and hold the bill between your thumbs and first two fingers. When you grab the bill, place the nickel on the back of it, holding it in place between your thumb and forefinger. Fold the bill in half, hamburger style, away from you. Then unfold the bill from the back to show the other side of the bill.









What you are doing here is showing that this is an ordinary bill. While you are unfolding it, you are flipping the bill while keeping the nickel in place with your thumb.
This is a simple flourish move. While doing this, talk to your audience explaining that there is nothing magical or special about this bill.

, Fold the bill in half the long way, hot dog style. With the nickel still placed on the backside of the bill, fold the bill up. Keep the nickel in place with your thumb and middle finger while you fold the half of the bill down and toward you with your index fingers. Then fold your bill in half again. You will now have a bill that’s folded into fourths.









Keep the nickel pinched between your thumb and middle finger, sliding it down to the lower half of your bill. This will allow you to fold the upper half over it.
Once you’ve folded the bill in half, position it so the crease is on the bottom and the two open ends are at the top. Let the nickel slide down into the crease.
Then, using the same folding method, fold the top of the bill down toward you again. Pinch and crease the folds with your free hand. This will help to trap the nickel in place.

, With the nickel at one end of the bill, pinch the ends of the bill between your thumbs and forefingers. Slowly release your grip on the bill with the hand that is not holding the nickel. While you do this, release your forefinger that is pinching the nickel. The nickel will balance on your thumb, making it look like you are slightly levitating the bill.









You can turn your hands slightly and position your other fingers to block the view of your thumb which is balancing the bill for more of an effect.
If you have a good sense of balance, you can also move your hand up and down slightly to give some motion to the trick.
Keep talking to help distract your audience. Explain how you are using your magical energy to float or levitate the dollar.

, After you’ve levitated the bill for a few seconds, let the audience inspect it. Pinch the bill on the side with the nickel and tilt the bill up vertically. Let the nickel fall out and into your palm. Keep the nickel hidden and hand the bill off.









You may have to loosen the folds on the bill slightly to get the nickel to drop.
When you hand the bill over, quickly slide the nickel into your pocket while the audience is distracted.

Grab a deck of cards.,
Set the cards up.,
Ask the first spectator to cut about a third of the deck.,
Ask the second spectator to cut half the cards.,
Place the cards back into a single pile.,
Fan the cards out and slide out the Jokers.,
Place the piles back into a deck.,
Find the Spectators’ cards.",How to Do a Basic Sleight of Hand Magic Trick3," This is a simple card trick that uses math and has even fooled some of the most talented magicians like Penn & Teller. To start grab a regular deck of cards.


This trick does involve a bit of preparation. You will take the two Jokers and place each in the deck facing the opposite direction from the rest of the deck. To help you with practicing, you can write the number 43 on one Joker, and the number 18 on the other.
During the performance of this trick you don’t need to have these numbers written on your Joker cards, you just need to remember each number.

, You are setting your cards up in positions 9, 18, and 25. Deal out 9 cards and place the higher Joker, number 43 face up, on the bottom of that pile. Then deal out 18 cards, placing the number 18 Joker face up on the bottom of that pile. Place your pile of 18 with the Joker under your first pile. You will now have the 25 remaining cards. Place that pile on the bottom. 








You have now placed the Jokers in the 10 and 29 positions in your deck. This allows you to ask a spectator to cut a third of the deck. It is unlikely that the spectator will cut before the 10th card, your first Joker, and after the 29th card, your second Joker.

, You can lay the deck on the table and ask your fist spectator to cut a third of the deck and remember the bottom card. Once the deck is cut, place the pile that was cut from the deck down on the table.









If you don’t feel confident that your spectator will cut the deck correctly, you can hold the deck and run your thumb along the edges of the card asking the spectator to say stop. This will give you control over how fast you go, ensuring that when a third of the deck is cut, it is after the first Joker and before the second.

, Using the remaining deck, have your spectator cut this portion of the deck in half. It is unlikely the cut will be made above the second Joker as it is now toward the top. Ask your spectator to remember the card and place the cut portion of the deck on the table next to your first cut.









Once again, if you want to ensure that the cut is correct, run your thumb along the edges of the cards and have your spectator tell you to stop at about the halfway point.

, You will now have three piles of cards, roughly of equal numbers. Take Spectator One’s pile, the first one you cut, and place it back on top of the remaining deck. Then take Spectator Two’s pile and place it on top of that.









You are now taking the first third that was cut and placing it in the middle of your deck while taking the second cut and placing it on the top of the pile.

, Fan the cards out horizontally. Take the Jokers and slide each out, creating a break after each one. You will have three separate piles again.









The Joker should be the last card in your break. So when you separate the cards, the card to the right of each Joker is the bottom card on the first two piles.
You will once again have three piles of cards. The pile to the far left is Spectator Two’s pile. The pile to the far right is Spectator One’s pile.

, Take the far left pile, Spectator Two’s pile, and place it on top of the middle pile. The take Spectator One’s pile, on the far right, and place it on top.


When placing the cards back into one deck, leave the Jokers out.
Your deck will now be in the original order it was, minus the Jokers.

, Point to the Joker on the right. Say that this Joker knows where Spectator One's card is, and has whispered the location to you. Count out 18 cards, flipping the 18th card over. This last card will be Spectator One’s card. Point to the other Joker and say this one will tell you the location of the second card. Continue counting up from 18 to get to the 43rd card, which is Spectator Two’s card. Flip it over to reveal.









This trick uses simple math to help you find the cards. The Jokers mark the number of cards you will count to find the right ones.
The way to remember the positions of cards is simple. The first position, 9, when doubled is 18. 18+25=43, which is the position of the second card.
During the trick, keep your audience engaged by spinning a story about two tricky Jokers who have been spying on the cards. These Jokers have been speaking to you, telling where to find the spectators’ cards in the deck.

Practice every day.,
Add more tricks to your repertoire.,
Examine the work of great magicians.",How to Do Magic2," Most magic tricks are very simply. It isn't complicated trickery that excites audiences, but the illusion that the magician has somehow defied physics, even though the audience knows it's impossible. All it takes to shatter the magic is a dropped coin or a misplaced card. That's why magicians really do have to practice until their tricks are perfect.


Practice in front of a mirror. Pay attention to your hands, and make sure you're effectively hiding the coin when it needs to be hidden, obscuring the string when you're sealing the wax, and so on. Practice until you're practically fooling yourself with your own tricks.
Practice in different settings. You should get comfortable enough with the tricks that you're able to do them in different rooms, outdoors, and in a variety of situations.

, Once you've mastered the classics, branch out and incorporate a few more. Challenge yourself to perform tricks that are more complicated or that require greater skill. The more tricks you have up your sleeve, the better, since the magic wears off quickly when you start repeating tricks for the same audience.


Buy books on magic tricks and view online tutorials to learn more tricks.
Learn variations on the classics. For example, if you enjoy making a coin disappear, try a variation that involves making the coin disappear and replacing it with a feather. (To do this, start the trick with the feather already concealed in the palm of your hand.)

, If you start getting serious about doing magic, study the tricks that great magicians perform. Many magicians use pyrotechnics, special equipment, and skilled assistants to help them perform amazing tricks. However, all tricks have the same fundamental purpose: to create pleasure by deceiving the eye.


Attend as many magic shows as you can. Watch carefully to see if you can figure out how the magicians perform their tricks. What can you learn from them?
Try to strike up a relationship with a professional magician. Many magicians won't reveal their tricks, but you may be able to get an apprenticeship if you show you're serious.

Choose a persona.,
Perfect your ""patter."",
Craft your program carefully.,
Perform in public.",How to Do Magic3," Magicians, like other performers, tend to stick to a consistent persona that entertains their audiences. The magic tricks are enhanced by the magician's personality and delivery. Figure out what type of performer you are, and start using your strongest personality traits to your advantage.


If you're naturally funny, add some clownish comic relief to your magic show. You might want to concentrate on tricks that involve physical comedy, like disappearing acts, pulling great lengths of scarves out of your sleeve, pulling a rabbit out of a hat, and so on.
If you're smart and slick, consider taking on a grifter's persona. Learn how to pickpocket a wallet and present it to the shocked audience member. Perform casino-style card tricks with a knowing smirk.
Some magicians have an air of mystery that completely enraptures the audience. If this is you, perform your tricks quietly and adeptly. Incorporate tricks that make you appear to have psychic abilities.

, When magicians perform, they tie their tricks together with what they call ""patter,"" the stories and chatter that distract the audience from their hands and make the transition from trick to trick more entertaining. Without patter, a magic show would be a quiet, rather boring series of tricks without context.


Consider writing out a script and memorizing it. Rather than just winging it during your show, you might want to practice with scripted patter first. Just make sure it sounds natural by the time you perform.
Speak clearly and make eye contact. Follow the same rules that apply to other types of performance and public speaking. Exuding confidence and charisma will make your show that much more entertaining.

, Start with a trick that instantly captures your audience's attention and showcases your skill. Don't do similar tricks within the same show; the audience will get bored. End with your best, most flashy and exciting trick, then bow and leave the stage., You can practice all you want in front of the mirror at home, but to craft a great show, you've got to test it out in public. During your first few gigs, pay attention to the audience's reaction to your tricks. Which ones elicit oohs and aahs? Which ones seem to fall flat? Tweak your program as needed and keep trying until you're happy with your program and performance.

Turn over the top card while saying ""Voilà!""",How to Do Easy Card Tricks1," Every card trick practitioner out there knows how to wow an audience by “magically” revealing a top card that had seemingly been shuffled into the middle of the deck. This trick is a good introduction to the combination of quick hands, skilled fingers, timely audience distraction, and showmanship that card tricks require. Start by practicing the following two skills:









Take two cards from the top deck while keeping them together (so it looks like only one card was drawn).
Slip a card directly below the top card in the deck while the deck is behind your back for only a moment.;
, Tell everyone to look at it. Show it to everyone. Put it under the top card, while the deck is behind your back for a magic moment, where no one can see.









If some protest your having the card behind your back, say it is part of the ""suspense"", and ""it's a magic moment"".

, Show only the bottom card to the audience, as if that pair is one card.








, After they confirm ""Yes!"", put the tricky pair back on top of the deck.








, Remember, the picked card is now moved to the top, unknown to the audience. The audience will think that this was their card.








, You could make a fancy gesture with your hands to really play into the dramatic aspect of the trick.








, It will be the chosen card. This trick usually requires only a little bit of practice, but is puzzling to the audience nonetheless.

Get a deck of cards, and cut it so that only 21 cards remain in it.,
Tell him/her to choose a card, and NOT show it to you.

,
Then, tell him/her to put it anywhere in the deck.

,
Now, put all cards in 3 rows (7 cards per row, although put one card per each row then repeat, otherwise it won't work).

,
Now the tricky part, tell him/her to tell you which row he/she sees his/her card.,
When he/she tells you which row, ALWAYS make that row the middle one you take.,

,,,, For example, if he/she had chosen the King of Hearts and he/she sees the King of Hearts somewhere in the 1st row, he/she will say something like ""My card is in the 1st row.""

, So if he/she chose the 1st row (or any other row, it doesn't matter), take any other row, then take the chosen row and put in AFTER the other row and then take the remaining row.

,,, But ALWAYS remember where you put the 11th card, so just count them (in your mind) until you reach 11. Then stop counting and keep on throwing or putting all the remaining cards down.
, Ask him, ""Is this your card?"" Amazingly, he will say yes!

Spread through the deck and have a spectator select a card.,
Perform a Marlo Tilt while you are distracting them with the story.,
Ask them to snap their fingers, and perform a double-lift.,Ask them to snap their fingers once more, and simply reveal the top card.,
(Optional Step) If you can perform the pass, riffle your thumb down the side of the deck and tell them to tell you when to stop.,
Catch a thumb break (hold your hand palm down with the deck between your fingers, and have the bottom card separated from the one above it by your thumb).,
Place the top card of the left deck on top of the right deck, but off center, and place the left deck on top of the right deck.,
Get their card to be the second one from the top again.,
Ask them to snap their fingers, and you double-lift the top two cards, revealing that their card ""is on the top"".,
Repeat step 6.,
Wait for them to snap their fingers, and if they see you with the card in your mouth, they laugh.,
While they are surprised at the whole card-in-the-mouth thing, bring the deck (which should be in your left hand) down to your left thing, and use your thumb to push the top card against your thigh and flip it over, so it's face-up.,
Grab one end of both cards, and fold the cards gently.,
Ask them to snap their fingers again.,
End the trick with something astonishing, something that demonstrates your prowess as a magician.,
Take this packet out, and set it on the table.",How to Do the Ambitious Card Routine," If you've got a lot of decks, have them sign it. Anyway, tell them that the card they chose is a ruthlessly ambitious card that will always jump to the top, but only when he/she snaps his/her fingers.
, When you finish the story, take their card, poke around the middle, and then insert their card above the third card. The angle of the first card makes it appear as if you have inserted their card into the middle of the deck. This is how to perform a Marlo Tilt:

Take the top card and lift up one end, the end closer to you
They shouldn't be able to see it.

, (A double is a sleight in which you lift two cards instead of one, giving the impression that the second card from the top is actually the top card). You will of course be revealing their card. Then, flip the two cards that seems as one over, and slide the top card into the middle of the deck. This top card is not their card, since their card was second from the top.,, Cut the deck where they tell you to stop, but keep a pinkie break on their card. As soon as they look at you, perform the pass and tell them to snap your fingers, followed by the reveal., Cut half the deck over to your left hand using the right index finger. Using the deck in your right hand, flip over the top card of the deck in the left, which is of course, their card. As you flip their card face-down, casually drop the bottom card of the right pile-the card you were holding separate- onto their card., Now, there should be a card sticking out from the deck, which is not their card, but they think it is. Push the card in, and have them snap their fingers. You them reveal the top card, which is once again their card., An easy way to do this is:

Say ""It only works when you do it."" and ask a nearby person to snap their fingers.
Double-lift, so their card is hidden behind the second card, which is what the spectator will see.
Hold the packet of two cards in your right hand, and the deck in your left.
Snap your own fingers, and use the packet to turn over what would be the third card from the top.
Say something like ""See?"", and flip the packet of three back onto the deck.
Their card is now second from the top once more.

, Flip the two cards over, and place the top card on a surface like a table. If you are outside, place it on the ground and step on it. Ask them to snap their fingers as you dribble the deck on top of the card you just placed on the ground/table. As you get to the top, refrain from dribbling that card, and snap it face up to reveal that their card, even though it was buried beneath a deck/stepped on, has returned to the top., Then, you say something like ""You might be skeptical because I was the one doing everything, so I'm going to let you push the card in this time."" This time, slide the top card in the left deck into the middle of the right deck, with about one inch protruding. Then, push the right packet as far away from you as possible (preferably past them, so they have to half-turn) and tell them to go ahead and push it in. This is crucial, because it allows you to bring the left deck up to your mouth, and stick the top card in the corner of your lips, letting it hand there. This card is their card. Tell them to snap their fingers, but to be careful about it, because sometimes the card jumps higher than you want it to., It's even better if they don't look at you right away. You flip over the top card of the deck, which is not their's, and they are confused. You then repeat that the card must have jumped too high, and make a sort of gesture that gets them to look at your face. This creates an even better affect., Then, take the card in your mouth from your right hand, and casually slide it face-up, on the top of the deck. Now, you have two face-up cards on the top of the deck., Not so much that it creases the card, but enough that it bends. They think that you are just folding their card, but you are folding both their card and the top card on the deck. Once you are done folding it, flip the cards over, and cut half the deck from the bottom and slide it into your left hand. Take the top bent card (which is not their card) and put in on the left deck, and hold it at eye level so everyone can see the bend. Then, place the right deck on top of the left and hold the top card (their card) flat with pressure from your thumb and middle finger., Timing is everything for this part. As the snap, relieve the pressure from your fingers on the top card so it snaps up, showing the bend to everyone. This is extremely stunning, as they can ""visually"" see the card rising to the top., For this step, you need to have previously folded a card into quarters, and paper clipped it together. Place this card in your pocket. Distract them by re-affirming that they chose the card among 52, and how you didn't force them to take it, etc. While doing this, slide the top card to the bottom, and using the fold you've already made on it, fold it in half, and then in half again, until it looks like the card you folded into quarters before the trick., Say that you had already predicted what card that they would pick, and had already paper-clipped that card into a packet before the trick even began. Hold their card, now folded up nicely, in your left hand loosely. Pass the packet into the left hand, and hold against your palm with your thumb so that the paperclip protrudes above your hand, so the audience can see it. Then, with your right hand, slide your fingers between the card with the paperclip and your left hand, and remove it upwards, now with your right hand hiding the card and with the paperclip still showing. You still have their folded card in your left hand. Place the card with the paperclip in your right pocket. You did absolutely nothing with the folded card and the paperclip, but it will seem as if you removed the paperclip from the folded card and you now hold the folded card which was in your pocket in your left hand. Of course, you do have a folded card in your left hand, but it's not the one that was in your pocket- it's their card. You then unfold the card agonizingly slowly, with the back towards them the whole time, then flip the card over and show to them. Sure enough, you had guessed exactly what card the spectator would choose, folded one up from another deck, and paper clipped it, to be revealed at the end of the trick."

Using an elegant, smooth shuffle like the Riffle Shuffle shows your spectators that you are skilled at handling the deck. To do the Riffle Shuffle:Take the deck and split it in half into two packets. Hold one packet by cradling it in your hand. Place your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers on the corner and bottom of the cards. Place your pointer finger on the upper top of the cards. Place your thumb on the top horizontal side of the cards.
Grip both packets in each hand in this position. Press your fingers so they move against the inside of the packets, almost like you are trying to squeeze both packets in your hands.
Turn the packets over with your hands. No cards should fall out as your hands should have a solid grip on the packets.
Use your thumbs to riffle the deck together. Lift the cards by your thumbs and let them fall one on top of the other.
The cards should shuffle together an inch or two. Push the two packets together and square them up. Or, use the cascade finish.
To do the cascade finish, bend the cards while keeping your thumbs on the top of the cards.
Gently release the pressure from your thumbs. The cards should cascade into a nice dome shape and then lay flat. If the cards go everywhere instead, don’t panic. Put the deck back together and try the cascade again.
Square up the deck and shuffle again if necessary.;
, This is another common shuffle technique used by card magicians. It is easy to perform and looks less sloppy than the Overhand Shuffle. To do the Hindu Shuffle:Hold the deck of cards by the end with your thumb and middle finger. Rest your index finger on the top of the deck for support.
Move your right hand underneath the deck. Keep your thumb, middle finger and ring finger on the side of the deck.
Use your right hand to take packets of cards from the top of the deck.
The removed cards should fall onto the palm of your right hand. Use your index finger to stop the cards from flying forward as you move them.
Move your right hand underneath the deck again and remove another packet.
Repeat this shuffle several times until there are only a few cards left. Place the remaining cards on the top of the deck and square off the deck.
The key to this shuffle is to form a trap with your fingers so the cards fall neatly into your palm.
Practice this shuffle slowly at first and gradually it speed up so you can do it with ease.

, This grip is the most basic and common way to hold a deck to set up for a magic trick. It’s important to use this grip because more of the deck will be covered by your hands, making it harder for spectators to see what you are doing. To form the Mechanic’s Grip:Hold the deck in your hand with your palm facing up.
Take your pointer finger and move it to the side facing away from you.
Take your middle finger, your index finger, and your pinkie finger and position them on the side of the deck.
Your thumb will hold the deck together on the opposite side of the other fingers.
Hold the deck of cards with this grip daily to get the feel for the grip. You want your hand to relax and get used to the grip so it seems natural.
The Mechanic’s Grip is an essential element to pulling off many basic magic tricks like the Double Lift, Forcing a Card, and more.

, This is another simple grip used in many card tricks. You can use a Biddle Grip to hold a deck of cards, multiple cards, or single cards. This grip is commonly used when doing tricks that transfer cards or show cards to spectators. To do the Biddle Grip:Hold the deck of cards in your right hand using the Mechanic’s Grip.
With your left hand, reach over and grab the top card in your right hand.
Your left hand thumb should be on the short side of the deck, facing towards you. Your middle and index finger should be on the opposite short side of the deck.
Place your pinkie on the corner of the deck.

, The double lift is a simple but clever sleight of hand. Two cards are lifted on the top of the pack at the same time, without the spectator realizing this is happening. The spectator is then shown the face of the second from the top card, which they believe is the top card., The first two to four cards should move a little off the top of the deck. It should look like you’re about pick up the first card and deal them out.

, Once you feel the second card, use your middle finger and thumb to slide the two cards off the deck. Try to keep them stacked together so they look like one card instead of two.

, Hold them against the base on your thumb. Bend the cards toward the spectator so they appear as one card.


Continue practicing this technique until it looks natural and the spectator really can’t tell you are moving two cards instead of one.

, A false cut is a way of cutting a deck of cards. The purpose of a false cut is to convince your audience that the cards are randomly mixed in the deck. When you do a false cut successfully, the cards will remain in the same order as they were before you did the false cut. Without your spectators being aware of this, of course., Place them on the back of the deck and slide a portion of the back of the deck out, about a quarter of the deck.

, Holding the packet on the top of the deck, use your ring finger and your thumb to pinch up the top quarter of the deck.

, Then, place second packet, between your ring finger and thumb, on top of the deck.


Using this cut, the top card on the deck should remain the top card on the deck, even after you have “cut” the deck.

, Make sure all the suits are together as well, in order.


A false shuffle is when you appear to shuffle the cards correctly. The idea is to convince your spectator that the cards are thoroughly mixed and you do not know the order of the cards. Like a false cut, doing a false shuffle properly means the order of the cards will remain unchanged., Place your index finger, middle finger, and ring finger on the bottom of the deck. Place your thumb on the top of the deck.

, Your thumb should be on the top side of the deck. The rest of your fingers should be on the bottom side of the deck.

, Hold the third of cards in your hand, underneath the rest of the deck.

, Pull down a second third of cards with your thumb again. As you drag down the second third of cards, move the first third of cards in your hand so it fits behind the deck in your other hand.


Use your ringer finger and the inside of your thumb to hold the first third of cards behind the deck.
You should now have two quarters of the deck in your dominant hand and one quarter of the deck in your non-dominant hand.

, Release the ring finger on your dominant hand so the back quarter of the deck falls in front of the quarter of the deck in your non-dominant hand.


As you do this, peel one card from the front quarter in your other hand with your thumb and drop it so it falls in front of the back quarter of the deck.
Peel off two more cards with your thumb so it falls on top of the cards in your non-dominant hand.

, Use the ring finger on your dominant hand to grab the packet.


Essentially you are shifting the packets around so the order does not change.

, Then, throw the rest of the cards on the packet in your non-dominant hand.

, If not, repeat the shuffle until the cards remain in the same order.

, This trick is the art of hiding a card in the palm of your hand while keeping the hand in a natural looking position. When done correctly, the spectator should be unaware you hid a card in your palm. You should be able to move the hand around normally., Check that the width of your hand is greater than the width of the card.


In the rare case you have very small hands and it is obvious that there is a card in your palm, practice this trick anyway. Especially if you are younger, as its possible your hands will develop and get larger.

, Apply pressure with your pinkie and with the base on your thumb so the card stays in place. #*Your other fingers are there to cover the top of the card, but they should not be applying any pressure on the card.

, It should look like you are simply holding your palm on the table. Notice how you are holding the card in place with your pinkie and the base of your thumb.


Keep your other fingers together so there are no gaps between them, and they are loose and relaxed. You should be able to lift your other fingers up without dropping the card in your palm.
Make sure your thumb also remains relaxed. Don’t let it stick out to one side.

, With more practice, your hand will get comfortable with the position and look more natural.

Remove the four aces from the deck and place them on top.,
Split the deck into four even piles by dropping cards from the bottom.,
Pick up the first pile and move the first three cards to the bottom.,
Deal the top three cards onto the other three piles, one card per pile.,
Repeat this with the other three piles.,
Turn over the top card in each of the four piles and reveal the four aces.",How to Do Easy Card Tricks2," Don't allow your spectators to see this step.









The best way to do this is to place the four aces on top of the deck beforehand. Bring the deck out of your pocket and transition directly into the trick without letting viewers shuffle it.
Do this as inconspicuously as possible. Ask, ""Hey, do you guys want to see a magic trick?"" and then transition right into it. The more fluid and natural you make it seem, the less the audience will question the trick.

, Your four aces should naturally end up on the top of the fourth pile.









Distribute the piles from left to right so that the fourth pile is to your far right.
Don't focus too hard on the fourth pile. Magic involves misdirection, and tricks can easily turn sour if your audience catches on to where the aces are really being kept. Keep talking to distract them a bit.

, This gives the illusion that you are shuffling the deck and randomizing cards.








, Start with the pile farthest away from the aces and do the pile with the aces last.









Deal only one card per pile. This is especially important when you deal the aces pile, since you will need exactly three random cards above the aces for it to work.

, You should end by dealing the aces pile last.









By placing the top three cards of the aces pile on the bottom, you have now brought the aces back up to the top of the deck. When you deal them onto the top of the other piles, the top card will always be an ace.

, If the audience reacts with disbelief, offer to perform the trick again.









Once you perfect this trick, switch it up by having the audience members perform the steps. Provide specific instructions for cutting the deck (don't shuffle!), shuffling piles (only the top three cards), and dealing (one card per pile). The outcome will effectively be the same. The difference is that the audience will believe your trick more because they will be duped into thinking they control the outcome."

Take out a standard deck of cards and ask an audience member to shuffle it.,
Ask the audience member to name any two cards.,
Position your hand over the top of the cards and pretend to concentrate hard.,
Tell the audience member to flip over the deck of cards and fan through it.,
Find the two cards and point them out to the audience.",How to Do Easy Card Tricks3," Encourage the audience member to shuffle it as many times as he or she likes. This trick is based on probability, not misdirection.








, Request just the name of the card, not the suit.









For example, just ""king"" and ""ten"" will do. Saying ""king of spades"" and ""ten of hearts"" is more specific and significantly reduces the probability of this trick working. If they mention suits, say something like ""Hey, I'm new at this, let's just stick with ""king"" and ""ten"""" with a smile.
When the audience member says ""king"" and ""ten,"" she is actually naming four cards of each kind since the suit is not specified. Combined, the two cards create eight total possible cards: king of diamonds, king of clubs, king of hearts, king of spades, ten of diamonds, ten of clubs, ten of hearts, ten of spades.
The theory is that of these eight possible cards, at least one of the kings will be next to one of the tens., Wait about 30 seconds to a minute before continuing with the trick. This helps build the illusion that you actually have something to do with the cards being drawn to each other.


This is the only real physical gesture you will make during this trick. Try to have as little to do physically with the trick as possible. This will strengthen the notion that you really performed the illusion.

, Amazingly, the two cards will (hopefully) appear together somewhere in the deck!









Sometimes, there may be a card separating a king and a ten. If this occurs, simply tell the audience that you didn't concentrate hard enough. Perform the trick over and take your chances that the two cards will end up next to each other., Don't actually touch the cards, otherwise the audience may think you've secretly placed a hidden card next to another.

Hold a deck of cards face-down in one hand.,
Glance at the bottom card of the deck before holding the cards face-down again.,
Ask the audience to stop you as you skim through the cards.,
Slide cards off both the top and bottom of the deck in one motion.,
Show the audience the bottom of the pulled deck while holding it away from you.,
Ask the audience, ""Is the bottom card the Ace of Diamonds?""",How to Do Easy Card Tricks4," Show the audience that the deck you're holding is just a normal pack of cards.


Show them all the cards to help them believe. You can also shuffle the deck or allow audience members to shuffle the deck before you start the trick.

, Make sure it's just a quick peek that no one will notice. You will need to remember this card because you will recite it as you show the audience later.


Say to yourself in your head, ""Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Diamonds"" (or whatever the card is). This will help you remember the card as you proceed with the trick.

, This reinforces the illusion that they are in charge of the trick.









Hold the deck face down in one hand. Place the thumb of your other hand underneath the deck. Use the first two fingers of that same hand to pull the cards from the top slightly towards you.
If you’ve gone through more than about one fourth of the deck without being stopped, slow down a bit and joke with the audience to see if you can get someone to stop you. This will make drawing the card from the bottom easier.

, Use your index and middle finger to pull the selected cards from the top of the deck into your hand.








At the same time, use your thumb underneath the deck to draw the bottom card into that hand. With practice, it will slide unnoticed into the bottom position of the pulled stack of cards.
Remember, this bottom card is the one you memorized earlier and will soon reveal as the “guessed” card.

, For a better effect, close your eyes or look away as you show the audience the bottom card.








, They should be bewildered that you successfully guessed their card.

Fan out a deck of cards while holding them face-down.,
Ask a volunteer to pick any card out of the deck.,
Cut the deck into two stacks after the card is pulled.,
Tell the volunteer to remember the card and place it on top of the pile in your left hand.,
Look at the bottom card of the right-hand half of the deck very briefly.,
Sandwich the audience member's card between the two halves of the deck.,
Spread the cards out on the table face-up.,
Pick the card out of the spread deck and ask the volunteer, ""Is this your card?""",How to Do Easy Card Tricks5," You don't have to shuffle the deck, although doing so may put the audience members at ease.

, Be patient, because the longer you give the volunteer to pick a card, the more confident they will become that you won't be able to guess it.









To help convince the audience, avert your gaze away from the cards as they select. Many audience members assume that guessing tricks are dependent on fancy card counting tricks. While some tricks are, this one is much simpler.

, Place one stack in the right hand and one in the left. Your audience member will most likely choose a card from the middle, so split the cards in a slightly different place from where that card was.








, Speak slowly, confidently, and clearly.









Don't rush the volunteer, otherwise the audience may think you've memorized the card beforehand.

, While you won't be reciting this card, you will be using it as a reference to find the volunteer's card.

, Be sure that you place the right-hand half of the deck on top, as this will be the card that is right next to the volunteer's card.








, Try to spot the reference card as quickly as possible.









Spread the deck out sequentially. The best way to do this is to set the deck down on the left and use your right hand to gently guide them over to the right. The end result should resemble a rainbow.
The reference card should be on the left-hand side of the volunteer's card. Whichever card is immediately to the right of the card you memorized should be the audience member's card.
Avoid spreading the cards quickly and sloppily. You might accidentally ruin the reference card's position, throwing off the entire trick.
You can use your fingers to sort through them, but try not to stop and stare at each card. This might clue in the audience members to what you have actually done.

, Although this is a question, ask confidently, almost in a cocky manner.









Make the audience think you knew exactly which card they were going to pick before they did. This will make it seem like you have psychic prediction powers when really you just have a really solid memory.

Before starting, hold the deck from the back side to show to the audience that you are not seeing the numbered side of the deck.

,
Say to the audience that you are making a card prediction by choosing a random card and you choose the card at the 10th position(make it look like you are choosing a random card).

,
Now flip the deck and now the numbered cards are facing you.

,
Start sliding the cards from the top one by one.,
After they say stop, flip both the remaining deck of cards on your hand(deck 1) and the slid off deck of cards (deck 2) and keep the two decks on the table.

,
Now, tell the audience to choose any one deck.

,
If they choose deck 1, reveal the 1st card of that deck (which will be 8 and act like you didn't know that it was 8) and tell them that you are counting that number of cards on deck 2 and split the deck after the 8th card.

,
If they choose deck 2, say that you are going to count this deck with the help of the first card of deck 1 (which will be 8).,
After splitting, you have 3 decks and your prediction card.

,
Reveal all the 1st card of each deck and at last reveal your prediction card.

,
Finished.",How to Do the 'All Eight' Card Trick2,",,, While doing this tell the audience that they can say stop whenever they like before the deck gets over. While you are giving this instruction ,quickly slide the cards of 8 at the 8th and 9th position without them noticing it so that they don't say stop before it.

,,,, After counting 8 cards, split the deck.

,,, All the cards which you revealed will be 8.

Look at the top card of the deck and memorize it.,
Set the deck face-down, then place a handkerchief over it.,
Turn the deck face-up as you place the handkerchief over it.,
Ask an audience member to cut the deck in half while the handkerchief is over it.,
Bring the real top half of the deck out of the handkerchief while turning the cards face-down.,
Ask the audience member to pull the top card from the deck you pulled out.,
Say the name of the card after everyone has seen it.,
Pull the rest of the deck out of the handkerchief while turning them face-down.",How to Do Easy Card Tricks6," For example, ""ace of spades"" or ""seven of hearts.""Do this part of the trick out of sight of the audience. It will be more convincing if you pull the cards straight out of your pocket and go directly into the demonstration.

, Make sure your audience sees the cards facing down before you place the handkerchief over it.









For the best effect, make sure the handkerchief is as opaque (non see-through) as possible.
Using a handkerchief is a means of distraction. People will assume that the trick is based on visual cues and will dismiss the possibility of you having memorized the card prior.

, Be sure you do this while the cards are concealed. Turning the cards too soon will reveal the truth behind the trick.









Try to do this as stealthily and quickly as possible. Make placing the handkerchief and flipping the cards one fluid motion so that people only see what is happening on the surface.

, The volunteer will place the top half of the deck on the other side of the bottom half. Be sure you keep track of which is which and keep the cards concealed.









Ask the audience member to only cut the deck in half, not shuffle it.
Turning the cards face-up makes the bottom half of the deck become the top. This is important because when you ask the volunteer to cut the deck in half, they will mistakenly believe they are removing the top half when actually it is the bottom.

, The real top half should contain the top card that you memorized earlier. This is slightly tricky but should be convincing if you make the focus all about the handkerchief.









Only remove the top half of the deck. Leave the handkerchief over the bottom half of the deck, which will still be face-up.
Wave the hand that will be holding the handkerchief. Try to use fancy gestures to distract the audience from your other hand, which will be turning the cards over.

, Instruct them to show other members the card without showing you.









This is secretly still the top card of the deck, but the audience will think it came from the middle.

, Listen as people gasp in disbelief.

, Do this while the audience is still figuring out how you did the trick.









Chances are people will want to inspect the other half of the cards after the trick is done. Give them no reason to question whether or not you flipped them under the handkerchief.

Pull out the tenth card (one of the eights) and place it face down on the table. Tell them this is your prediction card.

, Tell the audience you will be counting through the cards. Pass beyond the two eights in the eighth and ninth positions before telling an audience member “Now you can tell me when to stop.”








, Place them face down on the table. Place the bottom half of the deck (where the eights are in the eighth and ninth positions) to the right, and the top half of the deck (with the eight on top) to the left.








, This will be the eight you placed originally. Look at this card and identify it: “Look, it’s the eight of .”









Then, tell the audience that the eight indicates how many cards you should take from the deck on the right

, Keep the deck face down. Place these cards in a third pile. Put the third pile on the table (along with the pile that was on the left). Keep the other pile in your hand, face down.









Make sure the audience is following. Count out loud “One, two, three, …” as you create the new pile. Remind them that you now have three piles and that one eight is visible.

, Turn over the top card of the pile you just put on the table. It will be an eight. Place it on the table next to the first revealed eight.









Then, turn over the pile in your hand and reveal another eight. Place it on the table with the other two.
Finally, after building up a bit of anticipation, dramatically flip over your prediction card (which has been on the table face down this whole time). Or, have a spectator make the flip.
Expect to see some priceless reactions; this trick fools a lot of people!

Shuffle the deck and memorize the bottom card.,
Ask your audience member to pick a card.,
Cut the deck.,
Announce that you will now find your spectator's card.,
Search for the original card you memorized.,
Reveal the card.",How to Do a Magic Card Trick1," Make a show of shuffling your deck. Part of a successful magic trick involves drawing your audience’s attention somewhere specific. Shuffle the deck once, then let your spectator shuffle the cards or cut the deck to show that the arrangement of the cards is completely random. After they shuffle the deck, memorize the bottom card.


One way to do this is to cut the deck as the very last shuffling action you do, then sneak a peek at the bottom card as you tap the cards on the table.
Another option is to glance at the bottom card before you go to shuffle the cards one last time.
Two methods for making sure the card on the bottom stays on the bottom when shuffling are:

When performing a Riffle shuffle, make sure that you always start the shuffle with the hand that has the bottom card in it.This way, your bottom card stays the same as it hits the table first.


In an Overhand shuffle, angle the face of the cards away from your audience.Cut the deck, but grip the bottom card with the pads of your fingers. While you separate the deck to shuffle, pull back on the bottom card so it doesn’t get pulled up, but stays on the bottom.;
, Have the person memorize it and place it on the bottom of the deck. When your spectator puts the card at the bottom of the deck, it will be right next to the bottom card you've memorized.


Make a show of looking away as your spectator memorizes the card. The less it looks like you’re trying to figure out what the card is now, the better your trick will look in the end.

, You can cut the deck yourself, or have the spectator cut it. Your original bottom card which you’ve memorized and your spectator's card will end up somewhere in the middle of the deck. When you turn the deck over and fan them out, the person's card should be on top of, and to the right of the card that you memorized.


If you have good sleight of hand, you might want to cut the deck a few times. If you know where your two cards are roughly placed in the deck, you can further cut it, keeping the two cards together.

, This is your time to bring out the “magic” of the trick. The more you can sell your performance, the more fun the trick will be for your audience.


Have fun fanning out your cards, running your hand over the deck as you look for your spectator’s card.

, Fan through through your deck face-up, so that both you and your spectator can see your cards. When you find your original card, you'll know that your spectator's memorized card should be the one on top of it.


Once you’ve located it, don’t pick it out right away. Study your spectator as if you can read the answer there.
Play around with almost picking other cards, then deciding to move on. Finally, once you’ve built suspension, pick the card your audience member chose.

, With a great flourish, show your spectator her card.


Ask your audience member if the card you are holding is her card. If it is, congratulations! You’ve performed a basic magic trick.
If for some reason it is not her card, you can say something like “There must be an interference in the magical realm.” And attempt the trick again.

Shuffle the deck and fan it out face up in front of the audience and get someone to pick a card.,
Remember the card they picked and ask them to put it back in the deck and shuffle.

,
Tell them you are going to pick out a card that feels magic and look for the card before their card.

,
Pick up the card before and their card.,
Ask the volunteer to look through the deck and check that their card is near the middle because it can't be too close to the edge for the trick to work to lead them believe that the trick is something else.

,
When they say their card isn't there, say ""That's strange.,
After they've checked for the second time say some magic words (or whatever you want to do to add tension), then take both the cards out (One on top of the other again) and only show them their card.

Insist that they don’t let you see the card, but tell them to show others if they want., Place the bottom half on top of the card placed on top. This puts the card you memorized directly on top of their card. You can do as many cuts as you want, as long as they are single cuts.

, Pretend to look for jokers and take them out, but also find the card you memorized. Their card is resting directly on top of it. Cut the deck again so that their card is on top.


Cutting the deck a second time may take a few trials and errors before doing it seamlessly., Have them pick a number between ten and twenty. Deal that many cards off the top of the deck. Take that amount of cards and hold them between your thumb and pointer, have them slap the cards and the one farthest to the left should be their card.


Make sure you hold that one tightly so that it doesn't fall out.Adding the card slap and additional shuffling adds to the showmanship of the card trick. These additional steps also help distract the audience of how simple it really is.

Extract the all four Jacks from the deck.,
Present the Jacks to the audience.,
Place the stack of seven cards on top of the deck, face down.,
Repeat the process with the next two cards.,
Show the top card as the last Jack.,
Reveal your four Jacks.,
Tell the story.",How to Do a Magic Card Trick2," Then take three more random cards from the deck as well. This trick requires that you gimmick the deck a little bit before you start.


For the Four Robbers, you're going to make your spectators think you’ve put the Jacks into the middle of the deck. In reality, you’ll place the three other cards you've taken into the deck.
These three other cards will be stacked on top of three of the Jacks during the trick.
This trick involves a story, begin your story by telling your audience about four Jacks that decided to rob a bank.

, Hold the four Jacks, fanned out vertically in your hand. All four Jacks should be able to be observed by the audience at the same time. Hold the three random cards behind the Jack that’s on top so the audience cannot see them. This is essential to the trick.


If you are having trouble hiding the other cards, hold them in place by putting your index finger on the top edge of the cards.
Once you have given your audience a bit of time to see the Jacks, square the cards together.
For this part of the story, you can say that the four Jacks helicoptered into the bank, or simply snuck in through the roof.

, Your audience will now believe that the four Jacks are at the top of the deck, which they are. However, your audience will not know there are three other cards on top of the Jacks. Pick the top card off the deck and place it towards the bottom of the deck.


This part of the story involves the first Jack running down to the basement (the bottom of the deck) to clear the basement and keep an eye out for cops.
Make sure that your audience can’t see the face of the card you are picking up as it is not a Jack. When you pick the card up, do it so the face of the card is toward you and the audience only sees the back of the card.

, As you grab the next top card, move up the deck as you place it back in, continuing the story.


You can say that the second Jack went to take the money from the tellers, placing it in the middle of the deck.
The third bank robber went a little higher up to steal the money in the vault.
When you place the third card toward the top of the deck, just make sure not to place it too high so you don’t separate the Jacks.

, Say that this Jack stays up on the roof to look out for a helicopter. You can show your audience this Jack as it is supposed to be on top of the deck.


Note that this will be a different Jack than the one that would be on top if you truly moved the other three somewhere else in the deck. It’s best to match the color of the top and bottom Jacks for this reason.

, To finish the trick, explain how the Jack on the roof saw the police coming and radioed for his friends. Or, the Jack at the bottom saw the police down in the basement and ran up to the roof, taking his friends with him. As you do this, reveal the three other Jacks on top, saying that the Jacks have run up to the roof to escape.


Obviously, you know the Jacks have been there the whole time, but the spectators will think the cards magically returned to the top after having been inserted into the bottom and middle of the deck.

, This trick relies on some good storytelling. You can tell the story as if the Jacks are robbing a bank, or about how four robbers entered a house to rob different floors. Take the top three cards of the deck off one at a time, inserting them into the different levels as you tell your story.


Tell the story dramatically. The more detail you provide concerning what the Jacks are looking for and what the robbers are planning to do with the cash, the more engaged your audience will be. An immersive story will distract your audience from what you’re doing with your hands.
This trick can be performed with any set of face cards, not only Jacks.

Shuffle the deck thoroughly and memorize the bottom card.You can even let an audience member shuffle or cut the deck to make them less suspicious.,
Let your spectator choose any card.,
Cut the deck.,
Start dealing the cards out.,
Start running your mouth.,
Flip over your spectator's card.",How to Do a Magic Card Trick3," Feel free to cut the deck as well. At some point when you're squaring up the deck, sneak a peek at the bottom card and memorize it.


If you let an audience member shuffle the deck, just take a quick look at the bottom card of the deck before moving on.
This trick is similar to finding someone’s card in the deck, with a slight variation.

, Fan out the deck slightly and ask your audience member to pick a card and memorize it. Then, cut the deck from where the card was drawn and separate it into to two piles. Have your audience member place the card on top of the pile that doesn’t have the bottom card you’ve memorized in it. Then place your memorized card on top of your audience member’s card.


If you are more advanced, you can perform a swing or false cut which gives the illusion of shuffling the deck without actually doing so., You can either cut the deck yourself, or have your audience member cut the deck once. Now the bottom card you memorized is right on top of your spectator's chosen card. At this point, you may want to do a few shuffles, but if you do, make sure to remember where the two cards are so you don't mix them up.


The more places you find to let your audience interact in your trick, the more the audience feels in control. This will make the reveal at the end of the trick more rewarding.

, Deal your cards out in a row from one side of the table to the other. Don't stop when you see the card you memorized and your spectator's chosen card, which is the one right after yours. Keep dealing as if everything is normal. Deal out most of the deck except for the last several cards in this manner.


This trick involves you acting as if you already know what your audience member’s card is. If you stop when you do get to it, it will ruin the next parts of the trick.

, Magic tricks, especially this one, are enhanced when you tell a story. Start talking about how you're so convinced you'll find your spectator’s card that you're going to bet money on it. You can even add a bit about how you made a lot of money in Vegas by knowing how to manipulate a deck of cards.


Bet a dollar that the very next card you flip over will be the spectator's. Because the spectator already saw the card go by, he might take the bet, thinking that you're about to turn over the final card in your hand.
If the audience member doesn’t take the bet, offer a dollar up if you’re wrong.

, Instead of flipping the next card in the deck over, hunt back through the pile of cards you've already turned over and find his card, which should be right next to the card you memorized. To really sell this move, pretend as if you're about to turn over the card in your hand before flipping over your spectator's card.


Don’t actually take anyone’s money. If your audience member did bet you, take your dollar back and tell him that you’ll give him this one for free. You can even make a joke out of it by telling him it wouldn’t really be fair since you’re magic and already knew which card was his.
If you do mess up the trick, you may have to give your audience member the dollar you staked.

Have your spectator place the card on top of the cut and then stack the rest cards into a pinky break.


Have the spectator place the card on the bottom half of the deck, keeping a pinky break between her card and the cards you're laying on top. This way, you'll know where the card is.
A pinky break is performed by using the padding of your pinky finger to keep a slight cut in the back of the deck that your audience can’t see., Use your pinky break to separate the cards you stacked on top of the spectator's card and cut the deck so your spectator’s card is on the top. This might be an obvious re-cut, so to distract your audience, ask your spectator to concentrate super hard on the card which was drawn, explaining that you’re going to attempt to make the card show up in your spectator’s hands.


If you plan to shuffle any more, make sure that the top card stays there.

, A double lift involves taking the top two cards off the top as if you only took one. It is an essential sleight-of-hand skill to learn if you want to perform magic card tricks. Show your spectator the face of the card you just took off the deck in the double lift. State that you want your spectator to sandwich this card in between her hands, and that you’re going to magically change it with the one she picked. As you say this, place both cards back on top of the deck.You may need to practice taking the two cards off the top, and showing the face of the second one, as if it were one card before attempting this trick.

, Place the top card which is the one your spectator originally picked on top of her hand, and have her then place her other hand over it.


Once you've got the double lift down, put the two cards back on the deck, taking the top card (the spectator’s original card) and putting it into their hands, face-down, sandwiched there. Tell your spectator to hold onto the card tightly, applying a good amount of pressure.
At this point, the card your spectator picked is sandwiched between her hands, but she will think it is the card you just showed her. This card is on top of the deck.

, Tell your spectator that you're going to switch the card she’s holding right now magically with the card they selected initially.


Go hunting around the deck as if you were looking for their card, all the while knowing your spectator already has it.
Settle on the card that's already on top of the deck which your spectator thinks is in between her hands.

, Finally, reveal that you have the card your spectator believed was in her hands. Ask your spectator to look at the card she has, revealing that it is her original card.

Then use tape to join the ends of the severed card together. Don't tape in front of the inside of the card.


Your card should now be able to be folded without tape showing., Fold the numerical card on top of one of the jacks. Hold the cards so that the masked jack is in the middle of the other jacks. When showing the hand to people it should look like a numerical card in between jacks., Once you have the prepared cards in your hand, you're ready to try it on someone. First show your audience the ""three"" cards. Make some type of line about how one card is being sandwiched between two jacks. You want to get them thinking about the two jacks in your hand., Now you're ready to finalize the trick. Turn the cards over so they are face down and pull them onto a surface starting with the bottom card. The masked jack will look like any old face down card. It is important to grip and conceal the sleeve card. Have someone from the audience flip the cards over.


When finished successfully, the audience will see three jacks.
Practice concealing the ""mask"" and work on preforming this trick quickly. The faster you can do the trick, the more convincing your act is."
"
Understand the trick.,
Palm your cards.,
Practice the move.,
Preform the trick.",How to Do Amazing Card Tricks5," This is a simple trick that requires much practice and control of the cards to be successful. You are not really pulling cards out of thin air, but you are making it look like it. The whole time you are ""pulling cards from the air,"" you are really holding them in your palm., Take a small stack of cards out of a larger deck. Choose an amount of cards that you feel comfortable holding concealed. Use a mirror to see how concealed the cards appear to the audience., This trick relies on your thumb controlling a card to appear from thin air. Grip the edge of the deck with your fingers and use your thumb move the top card. Continue moving the top card with your thumb until it is in the audiences view. The card will be held in place by your thumb and forefinger. This will take a lot of practice.


After trying the move a few times, you should understand how many cards to hold in your hand., You should only showcase this trick after extensive practice. This is a simple technique that is very difficult to preform seamlessly. Once you understand the rhythm for the trick you can produce card after card out of ""thin air.""


To better convince your audience, rotate your hand as you shift the card out with your thumb.
Again, do not bring this trick out to the public if you aren't ready."

Build upon a sturdy foundation.,
Erect your posts; about 10' apart, in a grid.,
Get your posts plumb.,
Choose the right dimension boards for your beams.,
Decide your beam height.,
Attach your 2x6 cleats vertically to the posts.,
Raise your first horizontal board for the beam.,
Use rope to raise the board if the beam placement is high, and the board is very heavy.,
Fasten the board.,
Do the same on the other side of the posts - 2 more cleats, and another horizontal board.,
Put in studs to help support the beam if you have a perimeter stem wall.,
Notch out the top of the studs so they interlock with the boards in the beams.,
Continue framing around the corner, with cleats, parallel boards for beams, and doubled studs if possible.,
Follow this framing pattern throughout the perimeter.,
Run 2x6 bracing in the opposite direction of your beams.,
Make sure the center posts look like this, with 2x6 bracing run underneath the beams, all of it tied together with fasteners and metal angles.,
Tie the 2x6 bracing into the perimeter framing like this:

,
Continue to work square by square .,
Place an X-frame over a garage or barn doors to support the weight.,
Follow the same techniques of cleats, beams, and blocking, until the majority of the structure is stabilized.,
Put in the joists, once the frame is finished.",How to Build a Modified Post and Beam Frame," A modified post and beam will work with pier, perimeter wall, and slab; even better is a pole foundation, where your posts are embedded deep in the ground (about 4'), and transfer the full weight of the building directly underground. This has great lateral stability.;
, Use 6x6's - 4x4's are too flimsy, and almost instantly twist and split in the sun. If there happens to be an old structure you can build upon, simply remove all the rotten horizontal members and keep the treated posts. Remove and replace boards a few at a time so they remain up for bracing as you go.

, If you're putting them up new, brace them once they're plumb. If you're dealing with old posts, that have fallen out of plumb, use rope to straighten them. Attach the rope to the top of the post, with a nail nearby to keep the rope from slipping, and pull until it's plumb. Tie the rope off on nearby posts, trees - even your car if necessary and there's nothing else around.

, The size of the boards used for beams depends on how far apart the posts are. 2x12 is typical for posts 10' apart with no other vertical support. If you have a stem wall and perimeter foundation, and you can put in additional studs to support the beam, 2x12 is unnecessary. 2x10 will be more than sufficient.

, Use a laser level to mark each post. Set the laser level on a raised level platform (like a portable saw station), and shoot and mark the red dot on each post, keeping the laser level perfectly level as you turn your aim from post to post. Once each post is marked, measure up exactly the same distance on each post that you've decided should be your beam height. Use a torpedo level to get a perfectly level line. This is where your vertical cleats will top out at, as they support the horizontal boards for the beams.

, If it's a freestanding pole foundation, make the cleats about 2' to 3' in length. The cleats will help carry the weight of the beams, and provide a spot to set your large-dimensioned horizontal boards before you fasten them. If you have a stem wall, run the cleats all the way down to the block for extra stability, and to further beef up the posts. If the cleat is touching the block, it should be treated (borate is fine). If this isn't possible, tack a piece of flashing to the bottom of the board. A small piece of foam insulation like 'seam sealer' could go in also.

, Make sure the board goes 'crown-side' up, like joists, so that weight straightens the board and doesn't cause it to sag. The longer lumber is, the more likely it is to have a crook, and be slightly arched. The top of the arch goes up.

, Set one end of the board up on a ladder, attach rope to it, and tie this to the top of the post it will be fastened to. Go over to the board end on the ground, walk this up a ladder, attach rope to it, and tie this to its post. Go back and forth raising the board until you get it up on your cleats. Use a rubber mallet to move the board into the correct position, and hold it there with either bungee cords or clamps.

, Try a combination of big nails (16d, 3 1/2""), and long screws - 3"" if possible. Clamp the board end to the post first so that it's tight and won't move as you fasten. However, hammering in large nails will cause a board to move even when it's clamped. So one trick is to clamp it, put a screw in to hold it in place, then put a nail in. Once the nail is in, withdraw the screw, then pound the nail so the board is all the way down and fast to the post. Then come back with screws. Stay away from the edges of the board with these large fasteners, and avoid the same grain in the wood, or the board will split. You want enough fasteners to hold the board in place, permanently, but not too much that it will stress the wood. For a 2x10 with a 2"" to 3"" overlap on the post, 5 staggered fasteners is fine, with no 2 fasteners in the same grain.

, These two horizontal boards placed parallel on either side of the posts will compose the beam, with additional blocking. To find out where your cleats should top out at on the other side of the post, use a torpedo level to mark a level line from your original line around the post to the back. Attach boards with a variety of nails and screws, always clamping first so the boards are flush. If screws are cost-prohibitive, try ring-shank nails for serious hold . . . but they must be driven carefully, or they'll bend.

, Doubled 2x6's are very strong, and can be sistered (joined flush) with drywall screws and inexpensive spiral nails. Measure the sill plate and mark out where the studs will go. If your posts are 10' to 12' apart, try 2 doubled studs evenly dividing the space into thirds. This will leave you plenty of room for windows. Use metal angles to anchor the studs to the sill plate - it's much better than toe-nailing. Get the studs plumb, clamp them, and fasten. Bar clamps are the easiest to work with, though C clamps and pipe clamps will work also.

, This way the wood and not just the fasteners take the weight. Use a jigsaw to finish the cuts.

, Where a horizontal board butts in to another board, and can't be attached to a post, use a joist hanger:

, But for stability, work at one square at a time, tying 4 posts together in a square. Run parallel beams through the center posts of the structure. Joists will be hung from these parallel beams. Blocking composed of doubled scraps of 2x6 is placed every 24"" o.c. within the beams to stiffen them. Joists will tie directly into this blocking.

, Joists simply sit in hangers, and take weight from above - they do not pull the structure together. Run the braces just under the beams so they can double as cleats for the center beam boards, and provide additional nailing surface, as well as spots for metal connections such as metal angles.

, Both the bracing and the beams will get blocking.

,, . .

, The diagonal bracing is 2x6 and the bottom header is composed of 2x8's.

, If additional studs were not compatible with your design, use diagonal braces and/or girts to strengthen the walls, and to provide surfaces to nail sheathing.

, 2x10's spaced 24""o.c. with bridging will easily take the weight of an upper story. The frame will look like this:

Consult your local building authority to learn about building codes.,
Measure the rise and the run of your stairs.,
Decide on the style of railing.,
Shop for a handrail at your local hardware store.",How to Build a Handrail1," Learn whether you need a permits for handrail construction and whether there are standard specifications for handrails in your area. It is important to ensure that your home improvement projects are compliant with codes set in place for residential buildings.If your work requires a permit, make sure to obtain one before adding onto your home in any way. This prevents any issues that may come about with inspections, potential penalties or violations, and issues that could come about if you ever tried selling your home in the future.
If it does not require a permit, move forward with your building project.;
, The run of the railings should be measured from the top step to the bottom step of the stairs, along its diagonal. For a wall-mounted installation, add an additional 2 to 4 inches to each end to use as returns (also called the ends) for people to grab during use of the handrail.


The rise of the railing should be measured according to local building authority codes; this is usually between 30-36 inches, or alternately at 36 inches,at the average height of people.
Measure the rise at 36 inches from the same place at each step, and mark its position with a pencil or chalk.
Use a tape measure to draw a straight line on the wall, connecting the 36-inch marks you placed at the top of the stairs in descending order to the very bottom step.
Measure where you intend to place brackets that will later be screwed into the wall. Mark the bracket locations using a level to make sure that the brackets are plumb., If you’re choosing to incorporate a handrail indoors, chances are it is an extension of the staircase you already have and will hang on the wall opposite the stairs.


Wood is the most commonly used material for indoor handrails. Wood is sturdy and attractive, making it a good fit for indoor use. Wood is also an option for an outdoor handrail, but it may be prone to rotting in humid climates.Untreated wood will need an oil treatment before installation. Use tung oil, linseed oil, or a product based in one of those oils to coat the wood. Avoid water-based products because although they make wood water and moisture resistant, with time it peels and degrades.Metal railings are decay resistant and great for areas frequented by termite pests.Synthetic railings can be shaped and molded to your style needs and can even be made to look like wood. This option is expensive compared to other handrail options, but also more durable.

, In most hardwood stores handrails come readily available, depending on the type of material you want to use. Bring your measurements with you so you can buy the right size. If you have trouble locating the size you need in a ready-made manufactured style and size, request a custom railing.


Stores like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon are common sellers of handrail and stair products.
If you're installing a wood railing, you can bring home wood samples from your local hardware store to match them to the wood fixtures in your home. Bear in mind that wood does not have to match perfectly, it just has to coordinate."

Simultaneously lunge the hand forward in a grabbing motion.",How to Do Card Tricks," This is the most basic grip you will need to know, and most tricks will require you to hold the deck in your hands using this grip. It is essential for lifting and peeking, among other moves.


Grab the deck in your hand with your palm up.
Place your index finger and move it along the top edge, to the side opposite you.
Your middle, ring, and pinkie fingers should be on the side of the deck opposite you.
Your thumb holds the deck together on the side facing you. The thumb itself will lie at an angle over the card deck, pointing toward your index finger.;
, This grip can be used on a full deck, a smaller stack of cards, or on a single card. You usually use it when transferring cards or revealing cards to the audience.


Hold the cards in your right hand using the mechanics grip.
Grab the top card in your right hand using your left hand.
The left thumb should be on the bottom side, or the short side facing you.
Your middle and ring fingers should be directly opposite of your thumb, on the top side of the card.
Your pinky finger can linger on the upper corner of the card, and your index finger is not needed.

, Grab the deck in your hand using the mechanics grip.


When you grab the deck, the cards should be face up, allowing the audience to see.
Upon grabbing the deck, turn your entire hand over, causing the cards to be face down.

, Carefully glide the bottom card down by a fraction. Move the card toward you, not away.


Use your ring and pinky fingers to accomplish this. Your index finger is too far away and your thumb needs to keep the deck steady. The middle finger is also difficult to move without being caught by the audience.

, Use your other hand to pull this card off the bottom of the deck and place it on the table.


If you turn the card face up so that the audience can see, this in itself can be a trick, since you can insist that the bottom card has changed.
Note that this technique can also be used as part of a larger trick since it allows you to keep track of the bottom card.

, Use your pinky finger to straighten out the deck so that it looks as though the bottom card had never been altered.


This completes the technique.

, All four fingers should cover the top edge of the deck and your thumb should be on the bottom of the deck, near the inside edge.


This is not a trick in itself, but the ability to palm a card is an essential element of many tricks and manipulations.

, You will act as though you are grabbing the deck with your left hand. The four fingers of your left hand will spread out across the back of the deck but the thumb should sneak in between your right hand and the cards.


With your thumb on the top card, glide or pivot the card around the middle finger on your right hand.
The outer corner will pivot outside the stack but will be hidden by your right hand.

, Grab the deck of cards so that the left thumb releases its grip and causes the top card to rotate into the palm.


Position the left pinky finger so that it presses down on the outer right corner of the top card.
Lift the pack using your right hand, bringing it up the tips of your left thumb and fingers.
The left thumb will need to get out of the way, and as soon as it does, the top card will automatically slip into the palm of your right hand.
This completes the technique. The card will be in your right palm and the deck will be supported by your left fingertips.

, Typically, you would have an audience member select that card, and if you want to use this as a whole trick instead of merely a technique, having an audience member choose the card works best.

, Split the deck into two halves and place the card you plan to control on the top of the bottom half.The card and the rest of the deck should be face down.

, Hold the position of the selected card using the tip of your pinky finger.


Practice in front of a mirror so that you can determine whether or not your break is obvious. The audience should not be able to tell that you have a finger placed on the card, nor should they be able to see the gap that results from slipping your pinky in between the deck.
This break is an essential part of the technique, though, since it will allow you to return to the selected card.

, This is a simple way to reveal the selected card.


Cut the top part of the deck in half. The top part consists of the entire portion above the selected card.
Cut the remaining top part off the deck. You are cutting to the break, meaning that the new ""top"" card after the cut will be the selected card.
Reveal the selected card to complete the trick.

, Transfer the break from your pinky to your thumb, and shuffle the cards to the break.


Transfer the deck of card from your right hand to the left. Your thumb should be placed on the break and the rest of your fingers should be supporting the deck from the other side.
Use an over-hand shuffle to transfer the cards back into your right hand. Keep the selected card (the card at the break) secured by your thumb, making sure that the cards above it are all shuffled first so that the selected card ends up on top after all the cards have been shuffled.
Reveal the selected card to complete the trick.

, The bottom of the card should be roughly parallel and aligned to your pinky finger. The thumb should be toward the bottom middle of the deck, and your remaining fingers should be supporting the back.


Flourishes play little role in the manipulation of cards, but they do serve a valuable purpose. Well done flourishes can help misdirect the audience, and they can also keep the audience engaged and impressed before the trick itself even begins.
A fan flourish works well when you want to demonstrate to the audience that you are holding ""a normal deck of cards.""

, Place your right thumb on the upper left corner of your deck, near the bottom of the deck. Push this upper left corner to the right, gradually lifting your right thumb as you do so to bring fewer and fewer cards to the right as you move along.


Move the thumb in a slight arch so that the fan looks smooth.
Make sure that you have a firm grip on the bottom of the deck with your left hand, but make sure that there is room for the cards to glide around in between your fingers.

, Bend the middle and index fingers of your left hand so that they are directly over the center of the top card beneath them. ""Walk"" the bottom cards up to the top using your ring fingers.


This takes a bit of practice to master. You need to pull the bottom cards up by gripping onto the upper cards with your ring finger while simultaneously pushing down on the top cards with your index and middle fingers.
This move completes the technique.

, The pinky finger should be on the top right corner and your thumb should be on the bottom left.


Your middle and ring fingers should be spread over the top of the deck.
Your index finger should be bent back and supporting the back of the deck.
Note that, as with other flourishes, dribbling the deck is not often used in card manipulation itself. It is important in creating the right sort of ambiance, though, and it can help set your image as a master card magician.

, Push the middle of the deck forward slightly with your index finger. Pull the ends of the deck back using your thumb and pinky finger.


Meanwhile, move your left hand just below the deck in preparation of the dribbling cards. Your two hands should not be held together. Instead, they should be close enough to prevent the cards from flying everywhere but far enough so that the cards will have to travel in the air a bit before reaching your left hand.

, Slowly move your thumb up along the side of the deck, riffling off or releasing one card at a time into your left hand. Continue gliding your thumb up until all the cards have been released.


The stack in your left hand may not seem especially neat, but the cards should all be facing the same direction and in a pile.
Straighten the deck out when done.
This completes the technique.

, Place the cards so that the stack is hidden by the length of your hand, and hold them in place using the inner top knuckles of your fingers and the base of your thumb joint.


Your thumb should be bent slightly inward in a gripping position so that the base of the thumb joint extends forward into the palm. The thumb itself will not touch the cards at this point, however.
Only work with a small number of cards and not an entire deck. A smaller number will be easier to hold and hide in your palm.

, Push down on the edge of the top card to separate it from the rest of the stack.


Meanwhile, you should reposition your pinky finger so that it can come in between the top card and the rest of the stack while supporting the entire stack. The tip of your ring finger will also need to grip the stack.

, With your pinky finger separating the top card from the rest of the deck, ease your thumb to the innermost top corner of the card. Pivot the card around this position to ease it above your hand.


The back of your hand should face your audience, so at this point, only this top card is visible.

, You need to make it look like you snatched this card from nowhere, so move your hand forward as though you were grabbing hold of something in the air.


If you need a visual, think of the motion you might use to pick an apple from a tree.
You can continue grabbing cards from ""thin air"" until you exhaust your stack. This will complete the trick.

Ask the audience to pick two cards, if one of the two is the forcing card (the ace of spades), then keep those two and ask the audience to pick another card, if they pick the ace of spades, then give it to them.,
However if they do not choose a pair with the ace of spades, then discard those two leaving the ace for the audience.

,
Ask the audience to look at their chosen card and then to give it to you, next you place it on top of the deck and the sellotape meaning that the forced card is stuck to the previous top card meaning that you only see one card giving the illusion that the card has disappeared.

Cut the ends off of your railing.,
Install the brackets.,
Place the railing on top of the brackets.,
Install the returns.",How to Build a Handrail2," In addition to the handrail, you will need at least two sets of brackets and screws. You will also need a drill to complete the installation, and a saw if you intend to cut your own returns.


Remember that for a wall-mounted installation, the handrail should be 8 inches longer than your measurements, to account for the 4-inch returns you'll cut off on either end.
If you buy a ready-made handrail, it will likely come with brackets and screws, too. If not, purchase brackets intended for a handrail installation.

, Use a saw to cut the ends (approximately 4 inches from each end) from the railing at a 45-degree angle.Once you've installed the handrail, the returns will be attached to either end to serve as hand grips.
/images/thumb/3/35/Build-a-Handrail-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Handrail-Step-6-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/3/35/Build-a-Handrail-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Handrail-Step-6-Version-2.jpg









Reverse the placement of the cuts so that the pieces will be able to face the wall at the top and bottom of the rail.
You may want to ask an employee at the hardware store to cut the returns for you if you aren't handy with a saw.

, Line up the brackets and use a drill to mount them to the wall Repeat until all brackets are securely installed.Be sure that the brackets are vertically plumb before drilling them into place.

/images/thumb/6/62/Build-a-Handrail-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Handrail-Step-7-Version-2.jpg









It's important to make sure that the brackets are installed securely. If they seem loose in the wall, the handrail may not be sturdy enough to support people's weight as they use it.
You may want to purchase extra brackets to ensure that the handrail will be held securely in place.

, Hold the railing in position against the wall along the length of the chalk line. Secure the handrail into its position on the brackets by placing screws into the holes drilled on the railing’s underside.

Loosely-secured railings are a serious hazard issue, so be sure that the rail can bear the weight that will be imposed on it daily.
If the railing is loose, reinforce the railing from below by applying a metal corner bracket there., Place the angled edge of the return against the end of the rail. The flat end of the return should rest against the wall, forming a hand grip. Use wood glue and apply it to the cut edges before securing the return to the rail. Hold it in place for a few minutes to ensure it is securely attached. Repeat with the other return on the other end of the rail. For extra enforcement, hammer in 2-3 nails to connect the returns to the rails.
You may need to shorten the returns by an inch or two to ensure that they fit securely against the wall.

Prepare your deck or porch for building.,
Buy your materials.,
Install the newel posts.,
Install the balusters at the appropriate point on each stair.,
Attach the handrail to the newel posts and balusters.,
Apply an exterior primer to your finished handrail.",How to Build a Handrail3," Inspect the condition of your foundation. If repairs need to be made to floorboards, do so now. The less work done after the rail installation, the better in order to make sure the handrail stays intact for as long as possible.

, To install a handrail using balusters, rather than installing one on a wall, you'll need quite a few materials in addition to the handrail you have chosen. If you're installing double handrails, one on either side of your set of stairs, double the quantity of supplies you purchase.


Your handrail should be a 2x4 piece of wood that is no longer than 8 feet long, according to most building codes.
Purchase two newel posts, the supporting posts that hold up the rail; you'll need one for the top of the stairs and one for the base. The standard size of a post is 4x4 inches and 5 feet long.
Purchase one baluster per stair step. Balusters are the spindles that connect the rail to each step. The height of the balusters should be between 30 and 36 inches, depending on how high you want the railing to be. If there are already posts and/or balusters in place, count the total numbers of pieces you will need to replace, if any.
For secure installation of newel posts, you'll need a post-hole digger and concrete mix to pour into the holes.Purchase sure-tite fasteners for secure installation of balusters in the steps.
You'll need wood glue or epoxy glue to fasten the handrail to the posts.
Depending on the style of railing you install, you may need additional reinforcement supplies, such as a finish nail gun and a screwdigger.

, If you're replacing an old handrail, your set of stairs may already have newel posts at the top and bottom that you can use to support your new handrail. If not, you'll need to install posts before you can install your rail.


To install a post in the ground, use a post-hole digger to dig a hole least 18 inches in depth in front of the bottom step. Fill the hole halfway to the top with mixed, wet concrete. Stand a newel post in the hole. If you're installing two posts, use a 4-foot level to stand on the top of both posts to ensure that they posts are perfectly aligned with one another vertically. Use the same level to ensure that the posts are horizontally aligned and level, too. Wait 24 hours for the concrete to set before installing the handrail.
To install a top post to a wooden deck, place post over the stair stringer in a plumb position. Use four timber lock screws and wood glue to secure it into place. Finish it with finishing nails., Balusters should be spaced no more than 4 inches apart. Use a pencil to mark the place where each baluster will be installed. Make sure the balusters are lined up with the newel posts at either end of the stairs.


Drill holes into each step, then thread the holes with sure-tite fasteners.
If your balusters don't already have holes, you'll need to drill them. Drill a standard sized access hole into the bottom of the balusters. Into the side of each baluster, drill another access hole horizontally to intersect the first hole.
Set each baluster, or spindle, onto the sure-tite fasteners on each step. Tighten them down with a wrench.

, Apply wood glue or epoxy glue to the top of the posts. Fit the handrail into place. Wait 24 hours for the glue to dry before using the handrail, then secure the handrail and balusters together one at a time with a finish nail gun.


For extra reinforcement, you can screw the handrail to the post with a Screwdigger, using a wood screw of 100-120 mm in size.Position the screw behind the post and make sure that it is going through both the posts and the handrail.

, If the handrail is unfinished, finishing it is the last step. After allowing the glue to dry completely, use a sturdy paintbrush to apply a topcoat of primer onto the railing from the top down, ensuring that all surfaces and nooks are covered. After the topcoat dries, apply a second coat.If you wish to paint your stairs and railing, use an oil based paint because it preserves the wood grain while protecting the wood against harsh weather conditions. Use the same technique as the primer and topcoat when making the application.
If staining is more your preference than painting, choose a wood stain that contains a deck sealer to preserve the look and feel of the wood.

Use a stout piece of lumber, at least 3m long, preferably between 4m and 5m.,
Attach another piece of lumber of a similar type but 1-2m long to the top of the first piece of lumber to make an 'L' shape.

,
(Optional) - Attach 4 pieces of lumber to the end of the long piece of lumber opposite to the 1-2m long piece.,
Add a brace to the 'tail' of the 'L' (the 1-2 m long part) at about 45º to connect to the main pole.,
Notch a grove onto 'tail' of the 'L' part, about half a metre from the end.,
Dig a hole deep enough and stand up your gallows.,
Make the floor out of planks.,
Make the floor elevated 2-3m by making legs and braces for it, so it resembles a stand or a large table.,
Take two 3m long posts/poles that are fashioned into square diameters (similar to that as described in the inverted 'L' design) and attach a third pole 2m long across the top of them both.,
Cut a notch into the top of the third post for your noose.

,
Attach the posts to the top of the stand.,
On the floor of the stand, directly underneath the cut notch, cut out a 1m by 1m square.,
Attach hinges to the trapdoor, and attach a ratchet and lever to it and the floor of the stand so it can be lever released.",How to Build a Gallows," Make sure that it is at least 20cm (8"") wide, and is fashioned as a square or rectangle.;
,, The 4 pieces can be as long as you want, and attached in the form of a cross, with one on each side of the square diameter of the pole. This is for stability, and can be used as a stand when braces are attached, or as an anchor when buried deep enough.

, This helps brace it and prevent it from breaking.

, This is where you will loop the noose.

, The optional 'cross-bar anchor' while help greatly in providing support for it.


Operation - Your victim stands on a stool/chair, and the noose is looped around the neck. When the time is ready, the stool is kicked away.

, This floor should be around 3m by 2m for a one person gallows.

, Add a staircase for convenience, or you can keep it as is and use a ladder every time.

, You can add two braces from the center of the third post attaching to the other two posts at a 45º angle.

,, If you use longer 5m posts, you can run the posts through the floor of the stand to the ground. Make sure that they are still attached though.

, This will be your trapdoor.

,


Operation - The victim stands on the trapdoor of the stand, and the correct length of rope is run around the notch, tied into a noose, and looped over the persons neck. When the time is right, the lever is pulled, releasing the ratchet, and the persons weight causes the trapdoor to fall.

Before you start, wet the card on top of the deck.,
With a friend watching, take a deck of ordinary playing cards.,
Hold up the two cards together, making it look like one card.,
Put the two cards back on the top of the deck.,
Take only the very top card and put it in the middle of the deck.,
Snap your fingers and have the spectator take the top card of the deck.,
Have the spectator turn over the card and find it is their card.",How to Do a Cool Card Trick1," The easiest thing to do is to lick it. But make sure you lick the side that has the number and suit, not the back side. Once dampened, align it with the card below it, and place the two cards (which will look like one) on top of the deck.


This trick does require a second of set-up. Make sure you're alone for this part (you also likely don't want someone to see you licking a card).;
, Rifle through the deck until you get to the last 2 cards of the deck – the cards you preset. They should still be stuck together.


Take this moment to show your audience that this isn't a trick deck – it's a normal deck of playing cards with all 52 cards in random order, etc.

, Show the card to your audience, telling them that this is their card. They should memorize it and keep thinking about it throughout the duration of the trick.


You yourself should not look at the card(s). The back of the cards should face you at all times.

, Say that you will take the card and put it in the middle of the deck and make it appear on top. What? Crazy talk. Does your audience want to take any bets? Make it a grand gesture and try to get your crowd smiling.


In fact, they could take the top card and make it appear on top – but you'd just have to be sure they didn't look at the top card in the process.

, Not the two together, but the card that's stuck on top (it shouldn't be difficult to pry up). This was your dummy card that your audience doesn't know about.


What's left underneath the dummy card? The card your audience thought was on the very top, but actually wasn't.

, Have them say the magic word, do a dance, or count to five to get the card to ""magically appear"" at the top of the deck.


This is the funnest part, so take your time. Start asking them random questions, sitting back and stewing in the suspense. You know it's there, but they don't. Let them fester for a second in the suspense – all in good fun, of course.

, How'd you do it? You'll never tell. Maybe you really do just have magic powers?


If they ask you to do it again, say you're spent. You can only do so much magic in one day. Either that or you'll need a second to sneak away and line up two cards again.

Sketch out your desired dimensions of the crate in advance.,
Buy your wooden planks.,
Cut your wood to the dimensions of your box, plus 1"".,
Sand the wood down on all sides.,
Alternatively, use a single piece of wood for the two ends.",How to Build a Crate1," You need to know how big your crate is going to be in order to make the cuts perfectly. You can make any size crate you want, so long as you ensure that the two ends are the same size, and your slats between the ends are the same length. For this lesson, the crate will have the following dimensions (using 1/2"" thick planks -- yours may vary slightly).










Height: 9-1/2""

Length: 16""

Width: 12"";
, They should be roughly 1/2"" to 3/4"" thick, depending on your preferences. You'll want solid, untreated softwood, though the exact kind doesn't matter much -- you could easily use scraps or wood from old pallets. Pine and cedar are generally your best budget buys. As for the lengths and widths, you should procure:









Six feet of 4-3/4""-wide planks for the ends.

Twenty feet of 2-1/4""-wide planks for the slats on the side and bottom.

You can adjust this width depending on how big you want the spaces on the side of the crate to be. You can have lots of thinner slats or fewer wider ones.



, Unless your hardware store will automatically cut your wood for you, it's time to get the saw going. The best way to get perfect, even cuts is to make a rough cut in each piece first, leaving it 1/8"" longer than it should be. Then bunch 4 of these rough cuts pieces of wood together, holding the stack together with tape. You can then cut all the pieces at the same time to get identical lengths.










The Ends (4-3/4""-width): You want each board to be 12-1/2"" long. There should be 4.

The Slats (2-1/4""-width):' You want each slat to be 18"" long. There should be 13.

, Make sure that all the planks are smooth on all sides. Remember, these specifications are for a 16x12x9.5"" crate. After sanding, double-check all of your cuts to make sure you have the right amount of wood.










Four 12-1/2"" x 4-3/4"" planks for the ends. Two of the pieces will be joined together to form each end.
Thirteen or more 18"" x 2-1/4"" planks for the slats on the side and bottom.

, For a quicker, easier crate, simply cut a piece of plywood or other wider wood right into the size of your ends (here, 12-1/2"" x 9-1/2""). It will look less professional, but it will work fine as a crate.

You can also use uneven slats of wood if you're using wood scraps or junk pieces -- they just need to be an even length. However, for a professional crate you should cut even slats.

The heating element electrical connections must be enclosed in a waterproof box at the end of the ""T"" area of the santee and have a cord with a grounded plug and wire (green wire) grounded at both ends of the cord.,
In addition to the boiler, it is important to have the proper water supply feeding the boiler as water is boiled/steamed away.,
Build the supply stand with a ¾” plywood deck on top the stand about 18” square with a 3” hole in the center for the tank connector to pass through.,
Having a water supply to feed the system without interrupting the heating and steaming process makes all the difference.,
As with most wood steaming systems, the steam box is a big problem.,
Use treated lumber or treated plywood covering it with foam/glass insulation.,
The steam box stands over the PVC boiler/steamer and water supply tank supported by legs.,
This boiler, water supply tank/stand and steam box above, sets on a ¾” plywood platform with a 2x4 frame under it.,
Note, never move the steam system when plugged in (in use), keep safety your biggest project!

",How to Build a Complete Wood Steaming System," The PVC is in the form of three main parts, a (90) degree fitting at the bottom for the inlet of the water supply, a (T) fitting or santee (sanitary fitting) in the middle with the heating element attached and third, a 14” straight section on top with the steam hose attached to provide steam to the steam box, this is the riser. The location and size of parts in relation to each other along with the element size makes for a boiler that works very well or one that turns into a white sticky ball.;
, A 5ga. plastic container works fine. The 5 gallon (18.9 L). container is large enough to supply water for several hours without having to constantly watch the water level. The supply tank sets on a supply stand next to the boiler. The stand is built of 2x4’s and plywood and is about 14” high, this lets the water level in the boiler be the same as in the supply tank.

, The supply tank sets on the stand and has a hose running from a through the tank connector to the bottom of the boiler, use a ¾” diameter clear braided PVC hose. You will use about ¾” of water from the 5 gallon (18.9 L) container per hour. Mark a line at the full point, that which is the same level as the water inside the PVC boiler when the boiler is full or within 2” of the top of the boiler, and then another line about 3” down from that on the supply tank. This gives several hours of steaming without having to refill the tank. It also give you a bit or room for not refilling the tank if you're in the midst of bending a piece of wood when the water level reaches the bottom mark, this helps protect the electrical element and still give you lots of steam until you can add water to the supply tank.

, You can refill the supply tank and not interrupt the boiler or steaming process.

, You want a box that will stand up to the water, hold the heat, and move steam from back to front in an even flow. Also, provide the space for several pieces of wood to be steamed at one time and be able to be of many different lengths of say 3 feet (0.9 m) to as long as 20 feet (6.1 m).

, It should be noted here that other woods will work just fine, woods as cedar and Cyprus, but they cost a lot more. The box has an outside size of 11-1/4” x7-1/4”x 3 feet (0.9 m) to 10 feet (3.0 m). It is possible to use a steam box up to 20 feet (6.1 m) if you use the larger 4” PVC boiler, same system, just using 4” PVC in place of 3” PVC. The steam box must also be set at a slight angle to induce good steam flow from back to front inside the box, the back side of the box sets lower then the front. This tilt helps keep the condensate to the back where the drain hole is and off the wood being steamed. To steam wood in a box it is necessary to keep the wood up as close to the top of the box as possible; this is where the heat and steam are. Another problem with the steam box is that most people try to seal it up. However, if you seal ALL the holes, the box becomes a steam bomb.One of the ways to prevent this is to not use latches or locks on the door. The door also should have a 1/4"" gap at the top of the door to induce slow but safe steam flow through the box. What you want here is a steam box that is safe and will not fall apart after a few uses, while giving you good bendable wood time after time.

, Each set of legs have a cross supports for the box to set on. The support on the back set of legs is about an inch lower than the one on the front legs. This give the steam box the upward tilt at the front for good steam flow form back to front. The legs can be of any length, but they should be tall enough so it is easy to add water to the supply tank when necessary and to have good access to the steam box door and the wood being steamed.

, Adding locking wheels makes it quite portable. This makes it easy to roll out of the way and store when not in use and when you are ready to steam some wood, you can roll it right over to the job area. Being portable and moving it close to the job means that when removing wood from the steam box, you lose less heat and bending time is extended, seconds count at this point.

Fan out your cards face down to a spectator and ask him/her to point to one.,
Pinch the bottom right corner with your index and middle finger.,
Put the card back in the deck or ask a spectator to.,
When the cards are all back in your hands, discreetly look for a card that is slightly bent.,
Show the spectator his or her card.",How to Do a Cool Card Trick2," Take it out yourself and hold it facing the audience. At no point in this trick do you see what this card is.


If you don't have a surface in front of you, have them simply take the deck and pick a card. This way then verify themselves that it's not a trick deck, too.

, As you're holding it up, lightly pinch the bottom corner, bending it just slightly. The back of the card is still facing you.


Don't make the pinch obvious to the unassuming eye. It should be something only you can see because you're looking for it.
This works best with a set of cards that has been used before. A brand new fresh pack may make a bend a little too obvious.

, Getting someone else to do the work will make your trick seem more viable. Once the card is back in, shuffle the deck or have them shuffle it themselves.


If someone else is shuffling your cards, have them hand them back to you when they're finished. Any direction is fine.

, Scan the cards or fan them out, telling your audience you need to get a read on the cards. Ham it up, making the trick truly entertaining. You have a couple options from here:


Find a way to get that card to the top of the deck. You can then put the cards back in the package making sure the top card is between the box and the closing flap so you can pull it out.
Start throwing out the cards that aren't theirs. Pick them up acting like you're going to say, ""This is your card!"" but then at the last minute you change your mind and say no. This can be done half a dozen times before you actually approach their card.
Make it so the card is on the bottom. Than you can pretend to be frustrated as you go through the deck, not seeing their card. At the very end, there it is, waiting to amaze your friends.

, Whichever method you choose, make a show of it. Grin smugly, knowing that you just fooled them with simple magic. And remember not to reveal your trickery!


The traditional pickpocket method is to place the packet in your pocket or in a spectator's pocket and amaze people by pulling out the specified card on top of the deck when the packet is reopened.

Dry fit two of the wider boards together along the long side.,
Determine how you're going to adhere the two boards.,
With the wood pressed together, use a pencil to mark three spots for dowels or biscuit joints.,
Use your biscuit joint drill to make notches at each mark.,
Apply wood glue to all three biscuit holes on one of the planks.,
Insert a biscuit into each hole and firmly push it into place.,
Add a little more glue to the top of each biscuit, then attach the two boards together.,
Optional -- add handles to the ends.",How to Build a Crate2," Take two of your four wider boards and place them together along the long edge. You'll end up with a square 9-1/2"" wide, 12-1/2"" long. Do this try run to make sure the cuts are even so that the boards come together to form an even rectangle. Repeat with the other two boards.









These wider planks will be used to create your ends.

, Building this crate requires that you to adhere the two boards to make the ends. You have several options, including:










Biscuit joints. The remainder of the tutorial will be using biscuit joints.
Dowels
Wood glue. Know, however, that this will not make a very strong box.

, Mark where you're going to adhere the boxes together on both blanks. For this tutorial, you'll use biscuit joints, though you can use any method you're comfortable with. Make sure you have three wooden biscuits as well as a biscuit drill.









Three biscuit joiners for each end should be more than enough. If you're in a pinch, two will do.

, Like up the drill with your pencil marks and make a clean, quick cut with the drill. Repeat for the other 5 marks.








, One solid line of glue along the entire edge should be fine.








, Make sure each biscuit is snug inside the hole.








, Simply slot the biscuits into the slots on the other piece. Let the wood glue dry and your ends are finished. Use a rubber mallet to hammer the ends gently, but firmly, together.









For the cleanest results, use a set of clamps to hold the two boards together as the wood glue dries., Now that the ends of the crate are finished, you can decorate them or add handles. You have several options:









Using a table drill with a wide 1-2"" drill bit, ""punch"" holes into each end to make a handle. Simply drill 3-4 holes in a small line to cut a handle in the wood.
Using a power drill and some small screws, install two metal handles, like those found on cabinets, into the ends. If adding these handles, wait until the end to install them, as you'll need to lay the box down flush to the ground to finish it.

"
"
Turn the ends upside down so that they are resting on their top edge.,
Place a line of wood glue on each end of the slat and attach it to the ends.,
Use 1"" brad nails to firmly adhere the slat to the end.,
Add four more slats to the bottom of the crate.,
Repeat the process on each side to finish the crate.,
Optional-- Stain and finish your crate.",How to Build a Crate3," The handles, if you added them, will be on the bench. You want the other long edge (12-1/2"") facing upwards. Lay 4-5 of the slats on top and adjust the ends so that they are the right distance away. The ends of the slats should be flush with the outside edges of the end pieces.








, This will make up the bottom of your crate. Start with the slat closest to the end so that you're making the corner of the box first.








, The glue is there to help you get the slat in position and keep it in place as you hammer. You'll need nails to make the crate sturdy. Thin, 1"" brad nails work well. Two in each end of each slat should do it.









If you don't want to use nails, a thin screw or heavy-duty wood glue may also work., Add a little glue, adhere the slat, then nail it in. Start with the other end to make the other corner, then work inward. You should have five slats total on the bottom of the crate.








, Use your last eight slats to finish the crate up. Turn it on its side and attach four slats to each side, spacing them however you'd like. When you're done, let the wood-glue dry overnight.








, If you want a professional looking crate, get some stain out or paint the sides. You could use a wood burning kit to etch a design in as well. No matter how you choose to decorate your crate, make sure you wait a day for the glue to dry and the crate to settle before proceeding."

Install the doors.",How to Build a Cabinet," Standard counter depth is 25"", which the cabinets themselves being 24"" to allow for a 1"" countertop lip. Standard counter height is 36"", with the cabinets usually being around 34.5"" tall to allow room for the countertop material. For upper (or wall) cabinets, add 18-20"" to the 36"" counter height. Any space left over between that distance and your ceiling is fair game for upper cabinets. The cabinet width can be anywhere from 12-60"", but always should be made in 3"" increments. The most common sizes are 15"", 18"", 21"", and 24"". Always account for the size of the doors you want and can buy when planning the width of your cabinets.;
, Cut out the side pieces out of 3/4"" MDF, plywood, or an appropriate type of laminate. As the sides will not be seen, the material appearance does not matter, only the strength and durability. These panels will be 34.5"" high and 24"" wide. Clamp the two sides together and then use a jigsaw to cut a 3x5.5"" toe-kick in one corner of the panels. This will be your bottom front corner.


If making upper or wall cabinets, the measurements should reflect your personal tastes. Standard depth is around 12-14"". Height depends on how tall you want them to be and how high your ceilings are. The toe kick is obviously unnecessary in this case.

, The bottom piece will be 24"" deep but the width will depend on the dimensions of your kitchen. Make sure that the width of the bottom section accounts for the width that will be added by the side pieces being added on either side.


Again, for wall cabinets, the depth will be somewhere between 12-14"", not 24"". You will want to cut two of these pieces per cabinet for wall cabinets.

, Use 1x6 lumber and cut two pieces to the width that you cut your bottom panel. Skip this step if making wall cabinets.

, Cut two more pieces at the same width to hold the top ends together. Skip this step if making wall cabinets.

, The facing panels will be assembled like a picture frame and will be the main part of the cabinets that show. Since this is the case, you will want to use dimensional lumber in a wood that appeals to you in order to make these panels. Good sizes to use, depending on the part of the face and the style you want, include 1x2, 1x3, and 1x4.

, Align and glue the base panels so that one flat face is flush with the back edge of the panel and the other is 3"" back from the front end. Then, using butt joints, screw through the cabinet base and into the edge of the panels. Pilot holes are a good idea here.

, Glue and then secure (again with butt joints) the side panels to the base and bottom structure, fitting the toe-kick in with the gap you made. Make sure all of the edges are flush. Clamps and angle measuring tools can make this easier.

, Next glue and secure (so many butt joints) the back brace panel so that it will sit flat against the wall. The front brace panel should be placed so that it will sit flush with the countertop, once the countertop is placed.

, Measure and then screw a 1/2"" plywood back panel into place. A thicker back panel will be needed for wall cabinets, like 3/4"" MDF.

, Now, reinforce all the joints with corner brackets and screws.

, Measure, mark, and level locations for at least four corner brackets (two to a side) and then slide in the shelves. Wait to add the shelves for wall cabinets.

, Assemble the facing panels into one unit like you would assemble a picture frame. You can use flat joints or you can miter them. Pocket holes, dowels, or mortise and tenon joints should be used, according to your skill level, to join the pieces together. Nail and the countersink the nails to attach the completed face to the cabinet.

, Place the cabinets in their location. Screw through the back panel and into the wall studs to secure the cabinet it place. Upper cabinets may require more support, such as L brackets (than can be covered up by a backsplash), if you plan to put heavy items such as dishes in the cabinet.

, Install the doors onto the face panels as recommended by their manufacturer. You can also install drawers, but this can become quite complex and is not recommended for a beginner.

Set up your steam box.,
Set up your form.,
Steam the wood.,
After appropriate time, remove wood from box and place steamed wood in the form.",How to Bend Wood1," The steam box can be a wooden box that you construct to hold the wood to be bent, or it can be a piece of PVC or other kind of pipe. The box needs to have a hole through which you can pump in the steam. It also needs an exit hole so the steam pressure doesn't blow up the box.









For best results, set up the exit hole so that it's turned toward the ground. This will allow the pressure inside the steam box to push the water out of your box.;
, The form is a shaped holder that receives the steamed wood. When dry, the wood will remain in shape of the form.









You will probably need to clasp down the wood to the form with clamps. You can either make your own wooden clamps or purchase them. Try making some circle offcuts into which you drill an off-centre hole; pass a bolt through that and drill another hole through the side which you use to lever them shut. This makes for an effective clamp.

, Turn on the heat. Seal your wood inside the chamber and start steaming. On average, the wood should be steamed one hour for each inch of thickness.








, Do this as soon as possible after removing it from the steam box. Let sit until the wood is completely dry.









Bend the wood gently and carefully. Different kinds of wood are springier than others and different cuts can withstand more force. It would be a shame to break your wood while you're trying to bend it.
Clamp your wood down as soon as you've set it in place. Some prefer to clamp as they form the wood; clamping piecemeal may give you more flexibility and control.

"
"
Select the kerfing method when the inside of the bend will not be visible and when the bent plywood will not be subjected to substantial force.,
Consider steaming the plywood to bend it when both sides of the bend will be visible.,
Consider laminating and bending several thin pieces of plywood when strength of the final piece is a primary consideration.",How to Bend Plywood1,"


This is a quick and easy method of bending plywood.
This method is only appropriate when the concave (or inner) surface of the bend is either not visible or is subsequently laminated.
Kerfing weakens the plywood and should only be used where the bent surface of the plywood will not be supporting weight. For instance, kerfing is not an appropriate method for bending plywood to make a skateboard ramp.;
,


Steaming produces a finished piece that is stronger than one produced with kerf cuts.
This method requires the construction of a steam box and a form. It will also take more time to complete than kerfing and requires care to avoid burns.

,


Like steaming, laminating several thin pieces of plywood together requires the construction of a form. It also takes more time than kerfing and requires more equipment, but it will produce the strongest result.

Have your friend select a card from the deck.,
Ask him to show it to someone else watching.,
Hold the deck out and ask him to slide the card anywhere back into the deck.,
Put the deck behind your back, turn back over the top card and flip the deck around.,
Tap the deck with your middle finger and finger through the deck while looking at the back of the cards.",How to Do a Cool Card Trick3," He should then take the card and look at it, memorizing what it is. Tell him he should keep an eye on his card at all times. When it's in his hands, when it's in your hands – his eyes should always be on it.

, While he does this, turn the deck over and flip over the top card so that it appears as if the deck hasn't been tampered with.


So, say you're holding the deck with the backs facing you. You then turn it over so the faces are facing you, flip over the top card so it's the back again, and get away with it looking like the backs are still facing you.

, Tell him to think very carefully about where to place the card. He doesn't want to mess it up, does he?

, Alternatively, if you're pretty good, you can clasp the deck in your hands (so your friend can't see what side of the deck is showing), take up the top card, and ask him if that's his card. Then you say, ""Just kidding!"" and return it to the deck facing the right direction.


You know what this means, right? When the card is returned facing the right direction, all of a sudden the only card in the deck that's not facing the right direction is your friend's chosen card.

, Scan through until you find his card (flipped over) and he'll be amazed.


Make a show of it. You could tap the deck, say a magic word, have your friend blow on the deck, whatever. Do something that allows the magic to occur. Once the process has been completed, slowly fan through the deck, letting the suspense build and build until your awesomeness comes to light.

Take a quick peek at the top card and the card below that one before you start the trick.,
Get a volunteer to draw the top card.,
False shuffle your cards.,
Take half your deck and put the top half on the bottom.,
Flip over the deck and tell your friend that you are going to find the card just by feeling the tops of them.,
With your hand on her card, say something like, ""This card is your card!""",How to Do a Cool Card Trick4," This is very important for you to remember these (and their order) before you begin. Lets say it's an Ace of Clubs and a 3 of Diamonds for the sake of example.

, Tell her to memorize it and then put it back on top. Does she remember what it is? Is there anyway it was a different card? Act like this is a big deal to begin distracting her.

, This means you ""shuffle"" the cards, but make sure your Ace of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds stay on top. So she doesn't notice your poor shuffling job, maybe ask, ""How's your day?"" or ""Is this your first time being part of a magic trick?"" or something along those lines.


The number one thing to concern yourself with when performing a card trick is to remain as confident as possible. Smile, be funny, and engage. Distraction (and entertainment) is everything.

, In other words, cut the deck. Now the two cards are together and just somewhere randomly in the deck. If you'd like, have your friend do it to increase your credibility and limit the likelihood of you tampering with the deck.

, Keep feeling or massaging cards until you get to the 3 of diamonds. Massage the Ace, getting ready to make the big reveal.


Again, turn it into a production. Draw out the amount of time you feel the cards, making it a little ridiculous and funny. Get excited over certain cards that aren't right, and then brush it off as a false alarm. They're there for a show, not just for a card flip.

, Alternatively, you could do it on the 3 of Diamonds, too, saying, ""This next card will be yours!"" And then take the Ace and show her it. When you ask her if this is indeed her card, of course she'll say yes.


Sometimes it's funny to pass the person's card. You could go through all the cards, flipping them over, exclaiming that you foiled the trick. Then, all of a sudden, you have a vision. You then pull out their card from the discard pile, goading them along this entire time.

Get your deck of cards and take out 8-15 cards that are not mirrored.,
Make sure your 8-15 cards are all upright.,
With a friend now playing along, shuffle up the cards.,
Ask your friend to pick any card from the deck.,
Shuffle up the cards one more time and then expose their card.",How to Do a Cool Card Trick5," For example, the Ace of Hearts can be right-side up or upside down because it's just one heart. Other cards that are NOT mirrored are the 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3.


Be sure to stay away from diamond cards since they are all mirrored.
This is a very simple card trick that anyone can do (there is no sleight of hand whatsoever) and it has a good wow factor. The best thing about this card trick is that you can do it over and over again and no one will know what you are doing. However it does require this tiny bit of set-up.

, If they're not, the trick will never work. This piece of ""magic"" is simply about orientation of the cards. If it's messed up, there's no trick.

, Do not use a shuffling method that will cause any card to turn upside down. Because of this, it's best if you shuffle the cards, not them.


If you are doing the rift and bridge shuffle, be very careful that you don't forget which side is up and which is down

, When they do, ask them to look at their card and memorize it. While they look at their card, casually turn the deck around so that all the cards you are holding go from right-side up to now upside-down. (This is why choosing those select cards was so important.)


Since a majority of people return cards in the same position that they took them, your victim will unknowingly be putting the card into the deck right-side up while all the other cards are upside down.

, Again, do not use a shuffling method that will cause any card to turn. Find the card that isn't facing the same direction as the others and that's their card.

Watch your victim putting the card back in because 1/10 times they will turn the card. Just turn the card back in a joking way by saying something along the lines of ""This isn't my card! Oh! No, it is. Never-mind!""
Don't just expose their card – do it slowly, milking the trick for all its worth. Mess with your friend a little, hesitating sometimes, acting like the wrong card is the right card, and trying to make them laugh. Then you can get to the actual magic.

Prepare the surface where you will be installing the Formica.,
Measure the curved area to be covered using a cloth tape measure that can conform to the curves.,
Lay the Formica out on a clean surface with the backing facing up.,
Don heat resistant work gloves, and use the heat gun to heat the Formica to a temperature between 315� and 325�F (157.2� and 162.8�C) which is the temperature when the Formica will become pliable.

,
Apply the Formica to the substrate, holding it firmly in place for a short time to allow the adhesive to attach firmly.,
Follow manufacturer's directions for drying time, and use a router or utility knife to remove any excess Formica.

",How to Bend Formica," Countersink any nails or screws, and fill the holes with wood putty. Allow to dry and sand the entire surface, removing any paint or varnish. Clean thoroughly. This step is important as any imperfections, dents or high spots in the under surface can show through the Formica after installation.;
, Transfer the measurements to the Formica, don eye protection and cut, allowing an extra � inch (0.6 cm) all around for trimming.


For small jobs, you can cut the Formica with a utility knife and a metal straightedge. Work from the back and score the line deeply. Cut again, and then hit the shorter end of the Formica against a solid surface to break it off.
For big jobs with lots of cuts, use an electric saw, again working from the back. Use a fine toothed blade to prevent chipping.

, Brush a layer of adhesive on the Formica back and on the substrate where you will be applying the curved Formica. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the proper adhesive and drying times.

,, Continue attaching the Formica, pulling it taut and pressing it firmly to the substrate.

Prepare the wood to be bent.,
Line your form with thin cork liner.,
Spread glue on top of one of your wood strips.,
Place wood in the form as soon as possible before the glue has time to set.",How to Bend Wood2," Cut the length of your wood strips to be a little longer than your necessary final measurement. The curve will shorten the length.









Before you cut, make a diagonal line with a pencil and a ruler across the bottom of your stock. This way, if the wood strips get dropped or rearranged, you'll be able to tell which order your strips belong in.
Cut your wood strips through a straight-grained edge, not on the face-grain side.This will help you put back the strips together with minimal interruption.

, Cork with help both anchor the lamination to its form and even out any irregularities in the sawn form so that you have an even crisper bend.








, The glued strips will hold the wood in the bent shape.









Use a disposable roller to dispense the glue onto the wood.
Use the right kind of glue:

Try a two-part urea-formaldehyde glue.This glue sets very hard but also slowly.
Try an epoxy. Epoxies are very effective but also expensive.
Do not use standard wood glue for bent laminations. Normal wood glue sets soft and quickly, making it less ideal for this kind of project.



, Top this with another wood strip lined with glue. Repeat this process until you have obtained your desired thickness. Clamp the pieces together. Once the glue is dry, cut the ends to your desired measurement.








"
"
Prepare your wood.,
Compress the ends of the wood to push the gaps created by the notches together.,
Fix the bend.",How to Bend Wood3," Cut notches, or curves, 2/3 of the thickness of the wood. The kerfs are located on the inside of the curve you are attempting to fashion. Be careful. If the kerfs are too deep, they may break the wood.









The key to kerfing is even spacing. Space all of your kerfs out as evenly as possible. Try to get the kerfs about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) apart.
Always cut across the grain. The chance that your wood splits is much higher if you cut the kerfs with the grain., This will be the shape of the wood when it is finished.








, Face the front side of the wood with a veneer or laminate. This not only will fix, or set, the bend, it will also hide the any cuts that occurred during the process.









If you want to disguise the kerfing, mix together glue and sawdust (or an appropriate wood filler) and fill the spaces left in the bent wood.

Measure and mark the positions on the plywood were the bend will begin and end.

,
Inspect both sides of the plywood between these 2 marks for knots.,
Set the cutting depth of the blade of your circular saw to 1/2 to 2/3 of the thickness of the plywood.

,
Use a large square or straight edge as a saw guide and cut a series of kerfs (grooves) approximately 1/4�inch (6 mm) apart on the back side of the plywood.

,
Bend the wood into position and secure it.

,
Fill the kerfs with wood glue.",How to Bend Plywood2,", A knot, especially on the finished (uncut) side, will likely result in failure when the plywood is bent.

,,,, You can fill them with wood glue before bending the plywood if the kerfs will not be accessible once the plywood is bent and secured into position.

Choose a piece of plywood that is knot free.

,
Build a form by cutting the profile of the bend in several pieces of MDF (medium density fiberboard) or similar material with a jigsaw.,
Build a steam box.,
Place the plywood on the wire supports in the steam box.

Select a glue with a long open time (such as a polyurethane glue or a urea formaldehyde glue).

,
Apply the glue to each plywood piece so the entire surface of each is covered.

,
Stack the plywood pieces and clamp them to the form in the same manner used during the conditioning step.

,
Leave the plywood stack clamped until the glue cures.,
Sand or trim the edges of your finished piece to remove dried excess glue and to achieve the desired final surface finish.

",How to Bend Plywood4,",,,


Stack you pieces without gluing them and clamp them to the form, attaching the first clamp in the middle of the plywood stack.
Attach additional clamps working from the middle out to each end.
Use enough clamps to eliminate any spaces between the plywood and the form. This will condition the plywood pieces so they bend more easily during the final bending.

Determine your reasons for becoming a Luthier.,
Learn about the materials used for the instrument.,
Demo first.,
Take advanced courses in woodworking.,
Consider the following:


Time.",How to Become a Luthier," Decide what kinds of stringed instruments you want to create. A luthier may custom build a variety of stringed instruments spanning from violins and violas to mandolins and guitars. What instrument are you inspired to build? And what is your motivation for learning this craft?


Recognize terms. Learn the names of the parts of the instruments you're working with, nobody wants to resort to a luthier who doesn't understand their own job.





;
, This is more important for guitars and basses due to the variety of shapes, scales, woods, etc. There are types of materials which affect the ambiance, tone, and durability of the instrument. First, you must know what types of wood to use for each diverse part of the guitar. For example, the fretboard requires a wood that is hard enough to keep frets in for years. Indian Rosewood and Ebony are divine choices of quality wood to use for the fretboard because they last. There are a wide array of woods to select from all over the world and most woods you are going to use are going to be most likely imported. Do some research on the suitability and sufficiency of commonly used woods for guitar making. There are many wood combinations to choose from, and you may discover a new combination which will produce the most appealing of sounds for acoustics and do well for electrics!, Contemplate purchasing a kit or individual parts to see if you truly enjoy the craft. You can also purchase a cheap guitar and try to customize it., Making instruments generally requires a knowledge of all the various means of selecting, shaping, and finishing wood, especially when you build carved top guitars and many acoustics. Luthier schools are definitely the best way to go instead of a youtube video.]

, You will need to gain years of experience in the craft of making stringed instruments. If you are fortunate, you can find an apprenticeship with an already established Luthier (or two, or three.) However, actually going out there and building them even n your own is a good way to start.






Money. This is not a profession which pays well quickly, you cannot expect to earn a living wage during apprenticeship and likely will need another job before pursuing this as your main source of income. Having this experience on your hands may help you obtain a music related job. Most of your money will be put into purchasing woods if you already have the tools and many people would rather pass up buying your guitar for something made inside established factories.






Connections to established Luthiers with whom to apprentice. Understand that what you know in the business is far less important than who you know. People will be a huge asset to you. Begin cultivating those friendships as soon and as diligently as possible, they will help in the long run to get popularity and get your builds sold.

Lay out the plywood boards.,
Attach the framing.,
Attach optional nailing blocks.,
Place the feature wood.",How to Build a Bar1," Lay out the 60” x 42” and both 24” x 42” plywood boards. They should be in a space and at a level which is safe and comfortable to work in.;
, Glue and then nail the framing into place.


The 60” pieces go across the bottom and top of the front wall
The 24” pieces go across the top and bottom of the side wall
Two 37” pieces between the top and bottom pieces on all three walls
One 37” piece at the center of each side wall, and the remaining 37” should be evenly spaced on the front wall.
Mark the placement of the 37” boards at the top edge of the wall boards, so that you can find them again if necessary.

, If you intend to install a footbar, place two 6” blocks on the front wall, between the 37” framing pieces (at whatever distance is necessary for the width of the footbar, so long as they can fit between the 37” pieces). Be sure to mark on the bottom edge of the plywood where these are located.

, You will need to buy whatever type of wood you want to be visible, so it should be fairly high quality. Lauan is recommended. Glue it to the frame and then very carefully nail it into place.

Get some essential tools.,
Get a hold of some nice wood for the pyrography, preferably wood on the softer side.,
Handle your pen with care.,
Sand your wood before you begin.,

Go with the grain for the easiest time with the wood burner.,
Get some practice wood and experiment.,
Draw a design directly onto the wood free-handed.,
Transfer onto the wood with graphite paper.,
Transfer with a transfer tip.,
Start by positioning your wood in a comfortable place, so you can reach it easily with your pen.,
Consider starting off on the bottom or outside edge of the outline.,
Depending on your wood, don't be afraid to burn the same part of the outline three or four times.,
Finish the outlines first.,
Next, try experimenting with texture and shading.,
Move on to adding color.,
Periodically clean your tips to make sure they're delivering maximum heat.,
Consider using an exhaust fan while you're burning.,
When you're done, put a wood finisher on your project.",How to Woodburn," In order to practice pyrography, you'll want a few basic tools to get you started. After you've successfully completed a couple of drawings, you may want to expand, although you're be perfectly able to get by with the following:


Wood burning pen. These basically come in two varieties: the 'every-man's' soldering iron style machine with one heat setting as well as interchangeable brass tips, and the higher-end wire pen with two styluses and different heat settings. You can get a decent soldering iron style pen for $20+, while the more versatile wire pens sell for hundreds of dollars.Assorted wood burning tips. These will allow you greater leeway to produce lighter/heavier marks, as well as different patterns.
Strop and aluminum oxide to periodically clean off the brass tips of the wood burning pen.
Pliers.
Clay pot or pen holder (for safety when element is still hot).;
, The hardness of wood is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the softest wood (like Balsa) and 10 being the hardest (like Padauk). For beginners, especially, the softer the wood, the better. Hard woods are expensive, resistant to heat, and generally on the darker side. Soft woods, on the other hand, are cheaper, easier to burn, and lighter, providing a good burn contrast. Try getting your hands on these soft woods as you start off wood burning:









Pine
Basswood
Birch
Ash
Maple

, Your pen will get quite hot quite fast, so attach the tip you'll be working with before you turn on the machine. Always attach and detach tips with your pliers. Give your pen two or so minutes to get hot. As it heats up, let your wood burning pen rest in a pen holding device or a clay pot to minimize the risk of accidental burning.

, Take some 320 grit sandpaper, wrap it around a flat wooden block or attach to a paddle sander, and lightly hit all areas of the wood equally. Details will come out sharper and crisper when the surface of the wood is very smooth.









When sanding, sand with the grain. The grain is the direction of the wood fibers. Sanding with the grain will minimize any tiny burrs or scratch marks that result from sanding against the grain.
When you're done sanding, wipe the surface with a damp towel. This will remove any sawdust and make the outline transfer easier.

, Many beginners make the mistake of pressing down too hard on the wood with the pen, thinking that lots of pressure is needed to make an impression. It's not. In fact, using light strokes is preferable to pressing down hard. It's easier to guide the pen, reduces errors, and all but eliminates the possibility of accidental burning.








, You're not going to win any awards for racing through the design in record time. Wood burning, regardless of the material you're using, is a slow process. As you familiarize yourself with the pen, remember:









Steady pressure is best. For most beginner designs, you'll want the indents etched by the pen to be even all around.
The longer you hold your pen in one area, the darker and deeper it will get.

, Turn your piece of wood until most of the grain is pointing downward. This will make your job much easier, as you will be moving your pen in a downward direction most of the time, thereby burning with the grain. Burning against the grain will offer up more resistance.








, Once you have got your materials and you know the basics, get several pieces of practice wood and practice with the various tips that will come with your wood burner. Once you have a good idea of what each tip does, then you will know which ones to use for various projects. The tips you will use will depend upon what type of picture and how much detail you are going to put in the picture.








, If you are a killer artist and drawing is your thing, you may find it fun to draw directly onto the wood you're using with a graphite pencil. It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image.

, Make or print out a sketch of your image. Place the graphite paper, face down, on top of the wood, secure it to the wood with a bit of masking tape, and your sketch on top of the graphite paper. Then with a 2B pencil, trace over the sketch with medium pressure and fluid lines. Remove the graphite paper and deepen the outline on the wood with the same 2B pencil.

, A transfer tip is a flat tip that uses heat to transfer the ink of a printed image directly onto the wood. Scan or find an imagine online that you'd like to use. Print out the image, preferably with a laser printer. Next, fasten the printed image to your wood with a clamp and begin to head up the transfer tip. Slowly, methodically, brush the back side of the paper — above where any ink is — with the transfer tip. Remove the paper and inspect your newly-transferred design.

, This only takes a second, and should be done often. If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn.

, This way, if you mess up, your flaw won't be pointing you straight in the face. Rest assured though — you can correct most mistakes by simply sanding them out.








, Remember, easy does it. You only want to apply light pressure so that you can stay nimble with your pen. Try to move the pen towards you, not away from you, as you begin to burn, with your wrist resting on the wood if possible.

, Burn over the outlines of your design first to get them set.








, If you want to try to make a wood burn image 3D instead of the customary 2D, you'll want to experiment with different tips — tips that express shades and textures. As always, a few hours of practice on the back of a scrap piece of wood will be invaluable when it comes to shading on the real deal.







, You are now ready to start adding color to your image. Color is optional and may look better on some images then on others. You will want to use water colors and a brush of your choice. (Watercolors pencils work especially well.)

, You can run your tips over a sanding block for a quick fix, or you can clean your (cooled off) tips on a strop using aluminum oxide. This removes excess carbon that sticks to the tips.Submerge your tips in cold water for a minute or two before touching if you're unsure how hot they are. Remember to use your pliers to safely detach any and all tips.

, Some woods give off more smoke than others, smoke which can be breathed in and become irritating to your lungs. To counteract this, put on a fan if you're working in an enclosed area.

, The last step is to put a wood finisher on your product. Let this dry thoroughly before your wood burning project is completely finished.

Locate some mature pine trees that you can obtain access to.,
Identify the best species of pines for this purpose.,
Gather the necessary tools for your project.,
Choose a tree to make your tap into.,
Hack the bark away from the sap (live) wood about 3 foot (0.9 m) above the ground, and about 10 inches (25.4 cm) wide, by chopping the bark away with your machete, hatchet, or other chopping tool.,
Fit your collecting bucket tightly to the sapwood, so that when the sap begins to seep out, it will drip into it.,
Hack some shallow notches in a ""V"" shape, with the point of the ""V"" directly above the center of your bucket.

,
Leave the bucket attached to the tree until the sap begins to seep out and drain into it.,
Remove any nails or other metal fasteners when you are finished your project and take down your collection pot.",How to Tap a Pine Tree," You will need to have the landowner's permission before proceeding, and you must make it clear what you intend to do. Tapping the trees will not seriously injure them if done properly, but may decrease the value of them as timber if they are harvested in the future.;
, Because in general, different species of pine have similar appearance, you may need to talk to someone familiar with the pines native to your area. Southern pines that are suitable for tapping include these:


Southern Yellow Pine
Black Pine
Loblolly Pine
Improved Slash Pine

, You will have to have a tool for cutting the bark of the tree, a catch pan, and a container to gather the collected sap into. If you choose to catch the sap in a plastic container, you will also need some lightweight sheet metal to form a funnel with to decrease waste of sap. Here is a basic list of tools and materials with a description of each one.


Hacker. This is a short, machete like tool for hacking the bark and sapwood of the tree. A special tool commonly made by local blacksmiths until early in the 20th century, you may substitute a hatchet or small axe or use a very sharp machete or other large knife.
Turpentine pots. These pots were made of tinned steel or terra cotta ceramics, and are largely unavailable today. The two unique features they shared was a thin, curved rim at the top, and a hole for the hanging peg just below the rim on the concave edge. You can make your own turpentine pots from large metal cans such as institutional food containers. Simply remove the top completely, dent one side in to make it concave, and drill a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) hole in the lip of the can.
Lugging buckets. This is not a technical name, just a description of the use for the bucket the turpentine used to carry the sap from the collection pots to the still or the location the product was sold as a raw material.
Hammer and pegs. Any hammer suitable for driving nails will work, and if you don't have hardwood pegs, you can also use a large nail to peg your collecting pots to the tree. The advantage of using hardwood pegs is that the tree could safely be harvested later for saw logs without the risk of a steel pin or nail damaging the sawmilling equipment.
Turpentine still. Obviously this is a large and complicated assembly of equipment, and will not be discussed in detail here. Pine sap (called resin) is gathered and distilled to produce turpentine, used for paint thinning, varnishes, and cleaning solvents.

, Look for large, tight-barked trees to have the best results, since shag barked trees will be difficult to get a tight fit on with your collecting buckets.

, Scrape away the bark to expose about a 6 inch (15.2 cm) tall section of sapwood.

, If you use a bucket that cannot be conformed to the shape of your tree, use a piece of metal flashing to form a funnel into the bucket.

,, Rainwater will not affect the sap, since it is fairly waterproof, but you will want to collect the sap into a clean container with a tight-fitting lid every several days to keep debris from accumulating in it. Hack additional notches in the sapwood if the sap flow decreases, as the sap may begin to harden or crystallize, sealing the wood grain closed and preventing sap from seeping.

, Driving a wooden peg into any penetrations may help prevent the tree from suffering further damage from insects or diseases entering through the hole.

Determine the size of table needed for your child.,
Choose your workspace and set up your tools on a large enough space.,
Make the legs.,
Make a dowel joint with a dowel jig.,
Firmly attach dowel jig to joint surface and drill a depth that is half the length of your dowels.,
Insert the metal dowel points into the holes.,
Dry-fit and label your parts.,
Assemble the table.,
Attach tabletop.,
Finish your custom table.

",How to Build a Child's Activity Table," The height of this table is approximately two feet high. This should be a suitable height for children up to four feet tall.;
, Allow for enough space to cut boards that are approximately eight feet long.

, The legs will be assembled with finishing nails then later reinforced with joint brackets. Line up the two pieces of a leg making a right angle. Then use the nail gun to join them.

, Dowel joints help reinforce butt joints. A dowel jig makes drilling accurate dowel holes a breeze. Evenly space out the dowel locations. They do not have to be an exact distance.

,


Most dowels are an inch long. So the depth drilled should be 1/2 inch.







, Line up the joint and press firmly. Now simply drill the marked points to the required depth.


Double-check to make sure the joint is flush to your liking. Then repeat this step with all remaining butt joints.







, The importance of dry-fitting cannot be overstressed. It is better to discover a problem right away than to continue working through it and compound the error. Do your best to dry-fit your project exactly as you will after gluing. Once that you have dry-fitted your table, label all the parts before disassembling, especially all the parts that are similar.

, Apply small amounts of glue to each dowel and assemble. Once assembled, apply clamps, then ensure everything looks right.


Allow 24 hours for the glue to dry.







, Once the glue has dried and the clamps are removed, attach the table brackets to the legs. You want them slightly lower than the table top. The reason is it will tighten the tabletop to the base more securely.

Mark the position of the corner stiles.,
Place rails on front panel.,
Place stiles on front panel.,
Insert panel molding.",How to Build a Bar2," The corner stiles of the front wall will need to be offset in order to form the corner joint and give the walls a solid look. The stile should overhang the panel by ¾”, such that the side of a similar board will be covered. Mark this placement but do not attach the stile.

, Place the top and bottom 54 ½” rails on the front panel, glueing them and then nailing them into place. Be sure to place the large rail at the bottom (where the nailing boards are located, if you chose to use them).

, Place three of the the 31 ¼” stiles on the front wall, evenly spaced, between the rails.

, Using molding which is no wider than the stiles are thick, line the inside edges of the recessed panels with the moulding to give it a more seamless look (or go without if you’d prefer a craftsman feel). These will need to be mitered and then nailed into place with 1 ¼” nails.

"
"
Attach side panels.,
Add corner stiles.,
Finish side panel details.",How to Build a Bar3," Standing the front wall and a side panel, glue the edge of the side panel to the back of the front wall. Be sure that the nice wood is facing outward and that you have the front wall the right side up (with the 6” nailing blocks at the bottom). Clamp these together, draw a line on the front wall where the center of the side panel is located and then drill pilot holes and place 3” screws along the line, joining the walls together. Repeat with the other side panel when complete.


This step works best with two people.

, Attach a 42” 1x4 to each end of the front wall with glue and then nails, remembering to leave the overhang. Using the cut 42” 1x4’s, glue and nail those onto the side walls where they meets with the front wall, completing the corn stile.

, Glue and nail the remaining stiles and rails into place. The two remaining 42” 1x4’s will need to be placed at the other edge of the side walls, with the same ¾” overhang as with the front panel. The 42” 1x2’s are then placed next to these as endcaps for the wall. The rails will need to be measured and cut to fit between the side wall corner stiles and then the two remaining 31 ¼” stiles can be centered on the side panels. Place the remained of molding into the recessed panels when the stiles and rails are in place.

Measure and cut the bar-top base.,
Install the base.,
Measure, cut and set the bar-top.,
Install the molding.",How to Build a Bar4," You will need to determine the measurements of the bar-top for yourself, as it will depend heavily upon your needs and preferences. Form the base from three pieces of plywood, the front piece wedge between the side pieces. The overhang should be at least 6”. Dimensions of roughly 12” x 50” for the front piece and 12” x 33 ½” for the side pieces is recommended.

, Use 1 ¼” screws to attach the bar-top base to the walls, being careful to center your screws in the top edge of the wall.

, You will then need to cut to size a bar-top from whatever material you wish to use. The measurements will depend on the dimensions of your bar-top base. For the bar-top, the front piece will need to be longer than the side pieces, fitting in the opposite way to how the base was constructed (this will give it strength). The bar-top will also need to be narrower in order to fit the bar-top molding. Check the depth between the two slots on your molding to determine how much narrower the bar-top will need to be. Measure and cut the material accordingly and then place it using 1 ¼” nails. Try to place the nails in such a way that they will be covered by the lip of the molding (if it is wide enough to allow that).

, Once that is done, measure your molding to fit and then miter the three pieces together at 45° (leaving it flat at the back ends so that it sits flush with the edge of the end cap). Nail it into place with 1 ¼” nails from the underside of the plywood base. You’re done!

Add storage and workspace.,
Attach the optional footbar.,
Consider alternative surfaces.",How to Build a Bar5," You will want to add some kind of storage and counter space behind the bar, as the included instructions don’t provide any. You can do this in a number of ways. You could add a counter supported by brackets. You could find a stand-alone kitchen which fits in the space. You could build a series of shelves which fit into the space. It is also possible to simply leave it like it is. The decision is entirely up to you.

, If you want to add a footbar, you can do that. Simply be sure to add the additional 6” support blocks when building the frame, as described in the instructions. Attach the footbar using whichever method is recommended by the manufacturer. Get advice from your local hardware store staff.

, You may want to consider various ways to customize the appearance of your bar. You can do this by using a unique bar-top surface (such as one made from stone or colored glass) or by painting or staining the wood. The recessed panels are another opportunity for customization, since you can add contrasting material (like tile) to add interest to the bar.

Prepare a work table or other flat surface large enough to lay out a full sized wagon wheel on.,
Mark the center point of your work surface, then use this as an anchor point to scribe a line giving you the circumference of your wheel.

,
Divide the circle you have scribed into four equal segments, either by using a framing square working off the center lines of the table, or by measuring the circumference and dividing it by four, then measuring these lengths around the arc of the circle.

,
Split each of these arcs once more, so you now have the circle divided into eight equal sections, being careful to be as precise as you can be...

,
Measure in from the circle toward the center the distance equal to the width you want your rim to be.,
Measure the length of each segment on a straight line from one side of one arc to the other.,
Set a miter saw to cut each end of 8 boards of the length you determined in the previous step with an angle of 22.5 degrees on each end, with the long points on the same edge of the board, and measuring from the long point of one angle to the long point of the other.

,
Lay these pieces of lumber around the circle you have scribed, making sure each end fits tightly, and the joints between the boards are aligned with the angles you scribed in the earlier step.,
Build a hub for the wheel by cutting boards large enough for the diameter you desire, and center it over your original center point on your work surface.,
Center the eight sided (octagonal) shape you created earlier on the outer circle you scribe, and fasten it down temporarily, as well.

,
Set a point on the center mark to scribe the outside and inside circles that form the rim, and to scribe the hub circle as well.

,
Use a jigsaw or bandsaw to cut these circles, giving the hub and wheel rim their final round shape.

,
Place the rim and hub back in their centered positions and rotate them one half the length of one segment.,
Mark each end of the spoke location, on the wheel and on the hub.,
Drill holes through the rim of the wheel large enough for the spokes to fit through.,
Cut dowels long enough to go through the rim and into the hub.,
Insert the dowels through the rim into the hub, gluing them in place.,
Sand down any rough edges, trim spokes (dowels) flush with the outside diameter of the rim, and finish the wheel as you desire.


",How to Make a Replica Wagon Wheel," For a 36 inch (91cm) diameter wheel, you will need about 40 inches (101cm) of width and length.;
,,,, If you are using 2X4 nominal width lumber, you can figure the maximum width your rim can be at about 2 3/4 inches (7cm) for reasons you will see as you proceed.

, For a 36 inch (91cm) diameter wheel, you will find this length to be about 13 inches (33cm).

,, When you are satisfied the cuts fit, and the overall shape is as desired, fasten each board together either with biscuits, or with wood glue and countersunk wood screws.

, Then, fasten it down with a screw to temporarily hold it in place.

,,,, This will be the position you will mark the spokes at, and they should be centered between the joints in the rim of your wheel.

, Making sure these are in line will help keep the spokes straight when the wheel is assembled.

, Drill holes in the hub about 1 to 1/2 inches (2.5-3.5cm) deep.

, You can cut them a little longer than necessary and trim them after the wheel is assembled.

, Make sure each fits correctly so that the hub stays centered in the rim.

Choose some straight-grained sound lumber suitable for the project.,
Rip the wood to yield two 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) by 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) boards about 66 inches (167.6 cm) long.,
Drill a 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) hole through the center 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the mark at the end of the rip cut in the previous step.,

Sand or smooth any rough surfaces of the crutches for a more comfortable and attractive crutches.

",How to Make Simple Crutches," Oak, poplar, ash, or hickory are good, strong, bendable hardwoods, but even a softwood like white pine used in the illustrations will do in a pinch.;
, Mark these 12 inches (30.5 cm) from one end and rip them down their centers from the end to the mark so the two limbs can be separated.

, Insert a 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) hex bolt through this hole with a flat washer on the head of the bolt, place another washer on the threaded end, and then install the hex nut, tightening it snugly.

, The sides should each bow out symmetrically and form a ""Y"" shape.

, Sand or shape these blocks round so they are comfortable to hold.

, For an adjustable grip, a series of holes can be drilled so the grip can be raised or lowered for persons who are different heights. For a crutch being used by one person, the single mark you have made is all that needs to be drilled.

, Tighten the nuts securely, and cut off any of the all-thread rod that extends beyond the nuts.

, Cut the limbs off at these marks.

, Glue and nail the ends of the limbs in these notches to form the tops of the crutches.

Collect your supplies.,
Stuff your sock(s).,
Tie a simple, sturdy knot.,
Check bean bags occasionally.",How to Make No Sew Bean Bags1," The most important thing you'll need for this craft is a sock. Socks that are missing mates are ideal candidates for making bean bags. The weave of all potential socks should be close-knit enough at all points to prevent stuffing from passing through. Additionally, you'll need:


Sock(s)
Spoon or scooper
Stuffing (like beans, rice, popcorn kernels, etc.);
, Use your spoon or scooper to evenly distribute stuffing between socks. Be careful not to overfill socks. Larger socks might be able to fit a lot of stuffing, but if the stuffing is heavy, it may cause the sock to rip and make a huge mess. Aim for a texture that is floppy without the bag being so large that your stuffing is spread thin.


Bean bags roughly the size of a normal adult fist will be ideal for most young children.
Avoid over stuffing your sock(s) with beans. Overstuffed bean bags will be harder, and could hurt someone., Take the sock by its open end, so the beans are in the toe of the sock. Hold it above the stuffing with one hand so that your pointer finger, middle finger, and thumb meet to encircle the sock. Then:Hold position with the hand encircling the sock. With your free hand, take the open part of the sock and wrap it around your pointer and middle finger.
The mouth of the sock should now be positioned so it is oriented in the same direction as the toe of the sock. Take the mouth of the sock behind and through the loop it has formed.
Pull the mouth of the sock through the loop firmly to tighten the knot. You can leave the mouth of the sock as a handle, or you can trim it off with scissors., Your homemade beanbags might not stand up to wear and tear as much as store bought ones. In some cases, the material of your sock might stretch over time and stuffing come free.


If you pick up a no sew sock bean bag and the knot feels tight and there are no holes in the fabric, your bean bag yet has life in it!

Get two balls.,
Find an open space to juggle where you won't break anything.,
Put both balls in your dominant hand.,
Throw the first ball upward near the center of your body.,
Throw the second ball up when the first is near the top of its arc.

,
Alternate the balls, tossing one into the air just as the other nears its peak.,
Develop a backwards juggle.,
Practice the easier forward juggle.",How to Juggle With One Hand," They should be appropriately sized so that two can fit in one hand. Bean bags, hacky-sacks, baseballs, or rocks all work fine.;
, Juggling over a bed or couch works well because you don't have to keep picking them up off the ground.

, One ball should be on the palm; the other on the fingers. You will throw the ball on the fingers first.

, Angle it a bit to the outside in a plane parallel to the front of your body.

,,


Each ball should travel in an arc, rising near the center of your body, and falling near the outside by your dominant hand. They follow each other and, as you develop consistency, they will track the same trajectory. Strive to keep the balls the same distance from your body, the heights consistent, and the trajectories very close to the same.

, The release will be farther away from your body and the catch closer. Use your fingers to toss the forward ball backwards slightly, and simultaneously, with the palm of your hand, push the ball in your palm forward into your fingers, and catch the ball in the air with your palm., For this, toss the ball in your palm up and slightly forward and, simultaneously, with your fingers, push the ball in your fingers back into your palm, then catch the ball in the air with your fingers."

Plan your work.,
Place your table over the drop cloth.,
With a damp cloth, wipe off all the sawdust.

,
Now is the time to inspect the surface for potential problems.,
Cut the Masonite to fit your table.,
Using the same thinset mortar that you will use for your tile, cover the table top.,
Grab your design and lay your pattern out on the floor.,
You are now into the most critical portion of the project - laying out, cutting and setting the tile.,
Some tilers prefer to put their thinset mortar on the surface they are tiling and place the tiles into the mortar.,
An alternative approach is called ""buttering"" the tile.,
Place your ""buttered"" tile on the Masonite at the center where your two lines intersect.,
To help to keep your tile spacing even, place three of the tile spacers at the same time you set your first tile.,
At this point, things will really start to roll.,
If your design calls for a grout joint all the way around the edge of the table, this is the time to attach the edge molding.,
On a project like this, use a simple batten.,
Attaching the edge molding requires some thought on how you want it to look.,
Measure the short end of your table and add the thickness of your molding.,
Using a straight edge, check to be sure the molding is level all along the edge of the table.,
You will repeat this process on the long side of the table next.,
Finish this phase by putting masking tape along the top edge of your molding.,
Okay, you are ready to grout.,
Your grout will either be sanded or not, depending upon the width of your grout joint and the type of tile you are using.,
Mix the grout to a fairly stiff consistency, something like a batter.,
Next, dampen your sponge and wipe off as much excess grout as possible.,
Now you need to exercise a little patience and let the grout set up somewhat.,
Rinse your sponge often.,
Let it set for a few hours then finish the wipe down process.,
Almost there!,
Apply as many coats as recommended, more for an outdoor table.,
The last step is to finish your edge molding.,
Check your corners where the molding butted together.,
If you used the nail versus adhesive attachment method, fill the nail holes with wood filler.,
One thing to consider here is the use of a stain and top coat combined.,
Congratulations!,
Just remember, nothing bounces on tile like it might on a wood table so glasses will almost always break - a small price to pay for a fine tile table.

",How to Tile a Table Top," A drawing of your design is very helpful. It allows you to create a pattern you like and determine how much tile you will need and in what colors. Graph paper is perfect for this or you can create your design with a drawing program. Take a trip to your local tile store and find the tile you like first, then create your design. You'll also need some tools and materials which listed elsewhere in this article.;
, Remove the old finish or at least rough it up with sandpaper. Take your coarse grit sandpaper and work the finish good. The objective is to create a rough surface for your thinset mortar to grab onto. Unlike finish woodworking, a smooth surface is NOT the objective.


If you do not have sandpaper in your home kit, look into a sanding block at your hardware store. These are stiff foam covered with various grades of sandpaper and work like a champ.
If you do have sandpaper, wrap it around an old chalk eraser to get a better grip and save your hands. A small block of wood also serves but the eraser is more comfortable.

,, If you have large cracks or the table is made of several independent pieces such as a picnic table, consider an underlayment that will span these cracks. Why? Movement of the wood can cause your tiles to crack. Schluter Ditra makes one such product. But, it may not be available in the small quantity you need. Another option, and the one I will use for this project, is simple Masonite, 1/8"" to 1/4"" thick.

, If you do not have a proper saw for the project, take your table measurements with you to the hardware store and ask them to cut it for you.

, Place the Masonite on the thinset, smooth side down and apply a light even pressure over the entire surface. A rolling pin makes a nice tool for this purpose. Clean excess thinset from the edges of the table.

, This step allows you to make adjustments to your design and to get a feel for how it will look. With a ruler and your pencil, draw a line to divide the Masonite down the center and across its middle so you have four equal squares or rectangles.

, For new tilers, develop a design that does not require cutting. You can accomplish this with the size tile you buy and the width of your grout lines. This said, you learn by doing so if your design does not allow for full tile only, rent a tile saw for the project. Most tile stores offer them for rent. For this project, it is assumed there's a symmetrical layout that flows along the two lines you drew and does not require cutting. A tutorial on cutting tile is available here: How to Cut Tile.

, They do this by spreading the thinset over a small area of the project and placing the tiles onto the mortar. You must be careful not to apply the thinset over such a large area that it dries out before you get to it.

, Sounds appetizing, doesn't it? This technique has you take some thinset, apply it to the back of a tile like you are spreading it with a butter knife then spread it over the entire tile back with your notched trowel. Take a regular trowel, grab some thinset with it and scrap it onto the tile at one edge. Take your notched trowel and spread it across the tile then run the trowel over it again at a 90 degree angle. The objective is a smooth, even and complete covering of the back of the tile. Thickness is important here. You want each tile to have a consistent thickness of mortar for an even top later but you don't want it so thin that you have poor adhesion. Have enough so that when you have made my two passes with the notched trowel, you cannot see any of the back of the tile and the total thickness of the mortar is the depth of the notches plus about 1/8"".

, With a modest amount of pressure, wiggle the tile horizontally so you seat it firmly onto the Masonite. The buttered tile approach has two benefits - no dried out mortar and you can always see your lines that guide tile placement.

, These little plastic plus signs should go at the corner where the tile meets the two intersecting lines and at the corners of the tile along the other lines. Span the lines with the spaces so the line goes through the center of the spacer. If you are using a butted pattern where you have no grout joints, simply line up the edges of your tile along the lines you drew.

, Work your tiles as described in the buttered step and place them firmly, adding in your tile spacers. You can without the spacers but they make life a lot easier and make your grout joints much more precise. As you reach the edges of your table, be sure to remove all the thinset from the edges so you have a clean edge for your molding later.

, Before you begin, allow the tiles to set. Your thinset mortar instructions will tell you how long.

, This is a flat piece of wood about 1/4"" thick and wide enough (tall, if you prefer) to cover the entire edge of the table and the thickness of the tile. For example, if your tile is 3/8"" thick and your table is 1.5"" thick, you would need a strip 1 7/8"" wide. If a 2"" piece is more readily available, that is fine, allow the excess to project below the bottom of the table top.

, The most precise method is to miter the corners like a picture frame. For this you need a miter box and saw. Since this can be tricky (and frustrating), let's use an easier method.

, Mark this carefully on your molding. Take the marked piece and hold it along the short edge of the table with the end flush to the side. Make sure the mark you made is at least the thickness of the molding beyond the other edge of the table. It can be longer but not shorter. Carefully cut the molding. Start one of the finishing nails about 1"" for the end of the molding in the center of the molding (but low enough to not hit your tile). Hold the molding along the short end of the table so that it's top is level with the top of the tile. Use masking tape to hold the molding in position. Drive the nail halfway into the table.

, Add another nail at the center of the molding, driving it in halfway. Check your level then add a third nail at the far end of the molding. If all is level, drive the nails all the way in. Hammer carefully as you do not want to dent the molding. Add more nails so that you have them spaced about 6"" apart. Have an eye for a pattern as you go. Using the nail set, drive the nails slightly below the surface of the molding. You will fill in over them with wood filler later.

, Butt the end of the molding next to the molding that overhangs the edge of the table. Holding it in place (again, masking tape works well), measure so that the molding has a similar overhang at the other end. Mark your molding and cut carefully. Remember, a little too long is fine - a little too short is not. Carefully cut the molding, start a nail and proceed to attach it along the long side of your table as in the preceding step. Repeat this for the remaining two sides.

, This will protect it during the grouting process. The tape should not interfere with the grout area, being exactly even with the inner edge of the molding. Fold the excess down the outside face of the molding.

, Step number one here is to remove the tile spacers. They may stick. If so, use a sharp, pointed object like a straight pin or knife to grab then and pry them out. You can save them for future projects.

, Consult with your tile seller for specific recommendations. It is possible to scratch a glossy tile with a sanded grout so choose wisely. Plus, sanded grout can scratch your edge molding or stain it (hence the masking tape treatment in the preceding step).

, If it is too wet, it has less strength. If it is too dry, you cannot work it into the grout joints. When the grout is the proper consistency, trowel a goodly size amount onto the tile surface and work it into the joints with the squeegee / float. Use even pressure and steady strokes to be sure you fill the joints completely. Squeegee off excess.

, Be careful here that your sponge is not too wet as it will strip out too much grout. Most tile has a slight bevel or drop around the edges where the finished surface drops down to the raw tile edge. Keep the grout right at that level so it is slightly below the surface of the tile.

, After about 15 minutes, take your damp (not wet) sponge and using a circular motion, start cleaning the tile surface. This is where you can add some profile to the grout joint by how you smooth it out. Use a slight bit more pressure along the joint to make is concave and get it to the level you want relative to the tile.

, If you see the grout smearing heavily when you wipe with your sponge, give it another five minutes. This may be the most tedious stage as there seems to be an endless amount of the dull grout residue. Your goal is to get your grout lines where you like them and remove most of the grout and its haze.

, Use a dry towel in between wipes with the sponge to remove the haze. Note: The grout will have excellent directions about the timing of all this so follow their guidelines for best results.

, With your spanking new tile surface and fresh grout joints, it is time to seal the joints. You can try everything from flooding the whole surface and spreading the sealer with a disposal sponge brush to carefully applying it to just the grout itself. Your technique will depend upon how you want to proceed. If you need to seal your tile as well as your grout, do the tile first so you have no risk of staining the tile with the grout sealer. It isn't a stain so much as a difference in color as you have sealed the small portion around the joint before the rest of the tile and that might be hard to reverse.

, Let this dry overnight.

, Remove the masking tape and apply a reverse treatment to your table's top. You want to protect the grout and tile from your finish applied to the molding. Tape carefully along the edge between the grout and the molding so that no grout is showing. At the corners of the table, use a knife or razor blade to get a nice square end. Carefully stain the molding and let it dry.

, You should have a nice square joint with not excess molding. If there is a bit of excess, carefully sand it down with a fine sandpaper, say 100 grit.

, With a putty knife, wipe off the excess. Some filler is water based and can be wiped off with a damp paper towel. Approach this like your grout clean up – not too wet! Sand it smooth with 200 grit sandpaper or fine steel wool. Wipe down the molding with a slightly damp paper towel and let it dry.

, Minwax makes a nice product as do other manufacturers. This saves you the step of putting the clear finish over the stain. If you are going to use your table outside, do NOT go this route. You can also simply use a good grade paste wax (non-automotive) over the stain or an oil finish such as linseed. This depends upon the look you want and where it will be used.

, Your new tiled table is ready for its grand debut. Adorn it with snacks and drinks, invite over some friends and show off your handiwork. After all, it’s the satisfaction of a job well done being well appreciated that counts, right?

Gather project necessities.,
Create the bean bag core.,
Cut felt to fit your cores.,
Glue your felt at three seams.,
Insert and glue your core into your bean bag.",How to Make No Sew Bean Bags2," This bean bag looks a little more finished than the no sew sock bean bag, but it also requires a little more equipment. The key here is hot glue and felt, which, when stuffed properly, can look professionally made. For this project, you'll need:


Felt
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Plastic baggie(s) (re-sealable)
Scissors
Stuffing (like beans, rice, popcorn kernels, etc.)
Tape, For most medium sized plastic baggies you can expect ½ cup of stuffing per baggie to be sufficient. Each baggie with stuffing will form a core around which you'll glue your felt. After you add your stuffing, seal your plastic baggie and:


Fold the baggie so it is in the shape of a square. The square should be moderately sized, so the beans aren't too far spread out, but aren't packed close together either.
Use tape to fasten loose flaps of your baggie until it holds the shape of a square. To prevent leaks, you might also want to reinforce the seal with tape.
More or less filling can be added to the baggie to create different sized bean bags., Now that your cores are made, you can use these to measure and cut your felt. Each core should have at least two pieces of felt that are an inch longer than it in all directions.


Don't worry if you don't cut your felt perfectly. Once the felt is glued together and dried, you can trim edges to even them up.
Depending on the amount of filling, you may need more than an inch of felt in all directions, though in most cases, an inch should be enough., Plug in your hot glue gun and insert a stick of glue. Allow the glue to warm for a few minutes, then use it to join each pair of felt at three seams, leaving one side open.


In most cases you can create a firm bond by gluing your felt together ½"" (1.27 cm) from its outside edges., Take your bean bag core and slide it into the felt pocket created by your two felt pieces glued together at three seams. Once the core is inside the felt, use the hot glue gun to glue the final seam closed.


Much like the other seams, gluing your felt together ½"" (1.27 cm) from its outside edges will create a sturdy bean bag.
Continue in this fashion until you either run out of bean bag making supplies or stockpile an adequate amount of bean bags."

Decorate and enjoy your bean bag.",How to Make No Sew Bean Bags3," Any kind of plastic baggie will do, though a hearty baggie will has less of a risk of splitting and spilling stuffing. You can use many different kinds of material for stuffing, like beans, rice, or popcorn kernels, to name a few. About ½ cup of stuffing will yield a bean bag about the size of an adult fist, which is a great size for young children.


Larger baggies will be able to fit more stuffing, but if the stuffing is heavy, it may cause the bag to burst or burst more easily.
The no frills no sew bean bag will be reinforced with a layer of durable tape, making this one of the sturdier varieties of no sew bag., If the baggie has a seal, close this now. After that, hold the baggie so the stuffing collects in a corner of the baggie. Then tie a simple knot above the stuffing, so it isn't packed too tight or too loose.You can gather your stuffing together and fold excess parts of the baggie to form many shapes with your no frills bean bag., If you don't cover the plastic baggie, over time the plastic will wear down and it will break. This will cause stuffing to go everywhere, but you can help prevent this from happening by using a durable tape, like duct tape or electrical tape, to completely cover the outside of your no frills no sew bean bag.Other kinds of tape can also work to form a protective barrier for your plastic baggie. However, the more durable the tape, the more durable the barrier will be.
Some tapes may form a stiff barrier on the outside of your bean bag that is not suitable for very young children, although this bean bag should be soft enough for most grade school children.

, Many kinds of tape are easy to draw on, so why not break out some markers and give your no frills no sew bean bag some color? You could also personalize your bean bags by painting each one, or by adding stickers."

Fill a freezer bag with one metric cup(51 US teaspoons) of rice or sand.

,
Squeeze the air out, then twist, tie and cut the loose ""tail""of the bag.add another bag to the outside and do the same.

,
Cut the neck off of the balloon, put your fingers in it and try to cover as much of the freezer bags as possible(without the balloon breaking).

,
When that is complete, cut the neck off of another balloon and cover the opening of the balloon and about 3/4 of the way to the end.

,
For this balloon, cut two small holes opposite each other, then cover as much of the other balloons as possible.

Gather the supplies.,
Create your outline.,
Cut the sponge.,
Tie the sponges together.,
Repeat to the other sponges.",How to Make a Water Bomb2," Get a pack of sponges from your local convenient store. The cheaper sponges will do just fine. Look in the cleaning or cooking section and pick up a pack of five dish sponges. You'll also need a pen, ruler, scissors and string.


If you're not as confident tying knots, you could use wire ties., Outlining with a pen will help you create even strips. These strips will come to make the ball. Orient your sponge so that it is in a horizontal position. Using your pen and ruler, mark five lines across your sponge, 1/2 an inch apart.If you don't have a ruler, you could just divide five lines with your pen, and use your best judgement.

, Using your scissors, cut along the lines you created with your pen. You should have five strips of the sponge afterwards.Be careful not to cut yourself. Watch over children handling this process.

, Prepare the strips of sponge together by creating two stacks. One stack will have three strips and the other will have two. Position the stacks so they are touching each other. Use your sting or wire ties to connect them. Once they are tied together, fluff the strips out to form a ball shape.Use a standard knot. Don't use the knot you tie your shoe with because this could become undone.

, Repeat this process to however many sponge balls you wish to create. For a colorful effect, combine two different colored sponges. Take three strips of a yellow sponge and two strips of a blue sponge. Get creative and have fun!

Have a water bomb fight.,
Play water bomb tag.,
Play water bomb toss.,
Try water bomb volley.,
Set up a target range.",How to Make a Water Bomb3," Divide a group of people into two teams. Be sure there is plenty of water bombs for each team. Once you begin, the objective is to hit an opposing team member with your water bomb. If someone is hit, they have to sit out until the end of the round. The last team standing wins.


If you're only playing with water balloons, someone could catch a water balloon without it breaking to get the thrower out. This would also allow someone who is out from your team to come back into play.
The rules are parallel to dodge ball.

, Gather a group of friends and either one sponge ball or several water balloons. Nominate someone to be ""it"" and hand her the bomb. Then the point is for her to run around and try to hit someone. Once she hits someone with the water bomb, that person becomes ""it."", You'll need to use a water balloon for this game and it requires two people. Start with the two people close together. One person must toss the water bomb to the other person. After each successful catch, each person takes one step backwards. The objective is to see how far you and your teammate can go.


For a twist, pierce a hole into the balloon using a thin needle., You'll need at least four people, two beach towels, and some water bombs. The point is to place a water bomb in the center of the towel and try to volley it to the other teams towel. After each successful catch, each team must take one step away from the other team.This game is more exciting with water balloons because they have the potential to break.

, Prepare a challenging target practice with everyday objects like empty cans or bottles. Prepare the target range somewhere outside away from people. Position yourself about 20 feet (6 m) away. If you hit more than three in a row, move back a couple of feet.


Challenge your friends and see who has the best aim.

, Then clean up the sawn edges with a fore plane.

, You can cut these by hand using a bench hook and shooting board combination jig.

, You can cut these with a router with a 12mm (0.4 of an inch) straight two-flute cutter and a guide rail to keep the grooves straight.

,, Aim to have a slightly tight fit and pare back with a shoulder plane or paring chisel.

,


Part 2







, Mock up the separate components into a rectangle then mark with part triangles on each front edge as a reminder of their finished position.

, Remember to allow for a half pin at either end.

For aesthetic reasons, you may want to keep the spacing between tails to a minimum because machine cut dovetails on the best commercially available dovetail jigs can't cut much below a 6mm gap between tails, translating into a fairly wide minimum pin width. You can use this to your advantage! If you see a set of dovetails with very narrow pins you'll know, and others will know, that they must have been cut by hand.






Vary the width of the tails. You can create the tails wider in the middle and narrower the closer they get to each edge. The theory is that this creates more support where the stress is greatest, meaning that those dovetails nearer an edge will have more stresses exerted on them because they're not so supported by the next in line. This rule also makes for a more interesting layout and emphasizes the fact they're cut by hand.







, Leave the marking gauge set because you'll need the measurements for both your tails and pins.

, A Veritas dovetail marker makes life easier.


If you're using a sliding bevel it should be set at a ratio of 1:8 for hardwoods and 1:6 for softwoods.

,, These saws have fine kerfs with rip set teeth which are ideal for this kind of work.

,,, When chiseling, remember to cut no more than about halfway, then turn your workpiece over and work from the other side so that both external cuts are clean. It can help to secure your workpiece with a clamp.

,, Hold the timber in the vice with the end grain facing upwards, then place the finished tails over the end grain. Pack this up on the workbench to allow downward pressure to be exerted with one hand, while your free hand scores a line with a craft knife along the tail sides.

,, It's so easy to cut on the wrong side of the line, so be careful! Here's what to do: With the tail positions clearly marked, use a pencil to crosshatch these areas as a reminder of which parts are waste and which side of the line to cut.

,,


Part 2







, You can use a keyhole cutter; it's a great solution to an age-old problem. You simply plunge the cutter to a set depth, move it along for a short distance then switch off the router, wait for the cutter to stop spinning, then carefully pull the cutter back to the initial plunge location and remove.

, You can use a small round-over bit in a quarter inch (6.3mm) router to soften the shelf fronts. It's surprising how these subtle touches add up to a pleasing whole., When all is done, try partially assembling everything dry just to make sure nothing has been forgotten.


Note: Only ever push the dovetails halfway home during a dry assembly; this ensures the best possible fit when gluing up.

, You really don't need that much; it's better to avoid squeeze out by using just the bare minimum. Use a glue brush for best results as these ensure a thin even coat over the gluing surface.


Immediately wipe away any excess glue that oozes out upon assembly. This will prevent it from drying in an obvious lump.

, Dovetails don't need clamping but housings do, so make sure you have enough clamps ready to go.

,,, You can use a shellac-based sanding sealer, then wax with a beeswax and pure turpentine mix. It's an easy finish to apply and looks great against the wall.

, Place where you want the cabinet on display and add your objects to it.

Get some good quality clubs to start with.,
Start like you started juggling three balls.,
Try to get one good solid flip, and aim for consistent throws.,
Practice with just your dominant hand until you get good, consistent throws.

,
To add in the second club, hold it in your left hand between the middle and ring fingers, and just leave it there.,
Once you are again getting good consistent throws, add in the second throw just like you did with balls.,
STOP!,
Once you can reliably catch both clubs, add in the third.,
Now for that third toss.,
Now you have done three throws!,
Once you have some success with three throws, try four, then STOP!,
That's it!",How to Juggle Three Clubs," Don't try to learn with the plastic one-piece toys you can get cheap in some hobby stores. They hurt your hands after only a few minutes and the balance is poor for beginners. On the internet you can get good clubs from jugglenow.com or Brian Dube Juggling. (See External Links for one of each.);
, Don't try to hold all three clubs in your hands at first. Just start with one. Hold it in your dominant hand (right, for this article) and practice tossing it to your other hand.

, You want the apex of the toss to be just above eye level. Any higher and your throws will be out of control. Any lower and you won't have time to get that second toss in.

,, Now continue your single throws, getting used to having a club in the other hand.

, Toss the second club when the first begins its descent from its apex. Throw it under the first club, and aim for one good flip, then catch it in your right hand.

, Don't try to do 100, or even ten tosses. Just do two, then see how you did. You're going to drop a lot. We all did. It will come. Be patient.

, Put it in your dominant hand and just hold it there, again between the middle and ring fingers to start with. Now continue your two tosses until you get comfortable again.

, By now you are beginning to feel the rhythm of juggling the clubs so this will come easily. After you have caught the first throw, and as the second club is at its apex, throw the third club to the left hand, then catch the second throw in the now-vacant right hand, catch the third throw in the already-holding-one-club left hand, and STOP!

, Hand one club back to your dominant hand, and start over until you can catch all three throws several times in a row.

, It's one step at a time. Don't try for long runs until you can do four, five, and six throws with some regularity.

, You're now juggling the clubs! With some practice you will only get better and better.

, Use your dominant hand. Your fingers should be between your arm and chest, and your thumb should be on the outside, pointing up.If you want to do this with a shirt on, the easiest way is with a button down shirt. Just undo one of the buttons a few down from the collar, so that your can stick your hand through the opening in the shirt.

, Press your hand firmly into your armpit. There should be as tight of a seal as possible between your hand and your armpit.

, Rotate your shoulder downward, the shoulder of the armpit your hand is in. Do this quickly, while maintaining the tight seal by pressing upward with your hand.You don't have to move your arm much for this to work. It should be a small movement, starting with your upper arm near your side and your forearm across your chest.

Flip your paper over so you don’t see the fold lines.,
Grab the popper at the back tip of the folded bar on the top of your paper.,
Make sure you’re not pinching any of the unfolded portions of the paper.,
Snap the popper down.",How to Make a Paper Popper1," If you don't have printer paper handy, you can also tear a piece of paper out of your notebook. A standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 x 11 inches (216 x 280 mm) in size works best, but you can use larger or smaller paper if you wish. Just make sure you are using rectangular paper.
Notebook paper will not be as sturdy as printer paper and won't make as loud of a noise, but still works well.
The paper doesn't have to be this exact size, but it's a good size to start with as it is easier to fold.
Lay the paper flat so the longer sides are on the top and bottom.;
, Fold about 2.5 inches (64 mm) of the paper up on a horizontal fold and then apply a crease.









Fold the paper away from you, toward the top.
Run your finger along the bottom edge to create the crease and keep the fold in place.

, You should have about 2.5 inches (64 mm) of unfolded paper remaining.









If you have a little less than 2.5 inches (64 mm) on unfolded area left, that's okay too. As long as you have at least 1 inch (25 mm) remaining, your popper will be in good shape.

, You want to flip your paper so that the unfolded portion is now on the bottom, closest to you. Then fold the paper in half lengthwise on a vertical crease.









When you make this fold, the folded part, or bar, should be visible again.
You will now have a square shape with your folds on the outside.

, Find the folded edge of your top bar (the part of the paper you folded up earlier) and pinch it with one hand. Then grab the bottom corner with your other hand. Pull the bar up and out as you push the unfolded portion of paper in and down in the opposite direction. 








You will now see that you’ve created two open loops, or pockets, from the folded bar. Pinch the bottom corners of your looped paper.

, You shouldn't pinch the paper too hard. Don't hold down the unfolded part in the middle, or you won't be able to snap it. You can think of this as a bit like holding a paper airplane upside-down.


Look through the outside of the popper inward. You should have created two almost diamond-shaped air pockets.
When you're snapping the popper open, you'll be releasing the unfolded section of paper. Make sure you're not holding the bottom edge of the unfolded paper and that it has freedom to move.
For extra noise, you can try to stretch out and open the air pockets a bit to take in as much air as possible.

, Raise your arm and then bring it down like you're cracking a whip or bouncing a ball. 








The air pockets should whip out, creating a cracking sound. You can snap the paper down on a desk, or just snap it in the air.
As you bring your arm down, snap your wrist down as well to give it extra force.

Place your paper on a table so that the longer sides are on the top and bottom.

, Fold the paper in half lengthwise on a horizontal crease then unfold it. Now fold it in half widthwise on a vertical crease and unfold it again. 








At this point, you should have four creases in your paper, both vertically and horizontally. The creases will look like a cross.

, The edge of your folds should line up with the horizontal crease.









When you are done with these four folds, there should be two triangles on either side of the paper.
Think of folding each corner down like you would for a paper airplane.
You will have a vertical, open section of unfolded paper in the middle between your folds.

, You now want to fold the paper in half along the horizontal crease.









The popper should now look like a trapezoid or a triangle shape with the tip cut off.

, Position your paper so that the shorter flat edge is facing down closer to you. Take the top two corners on the left and right side and fold downward.









Make sure to line the edges up with the vertical crease.
This should create two triangular flaps which meet in the center and together make a diamond.

, Flip the paper over and fold it in half on the vertical crease.









Once you have done this, the popper should be in the shape of a triangle with the two flaps on the outside.

, Hold the bottom corners of the popper between your thumb and index finger. Raise your arm above your head, and quickly snap it down to create the popping sound.

, A small, portable laptop gives you the flexibility for this trick.

, The remote control should be small enough that you can hold it in your hand without anyone noticing. Make sure the remote is connected with your laptop and allows you to control it from a distance.

, If you don't have one already, download and install an application or other program on your computer that allows you to record your voice. The program should export the result as a .mp3 file.

, These recordings should be suitable answers to the question ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"" Each answer should be a separate .mp3 or recording. Record some compliments and some insults, but keep it believable and try not to overdo it with the insults, as this could be rude or offensive.


Be sure to alter your voice, as you won't want the mirror to sound just like you do. Either change your voice when you speak, or download a program to alter your voice in the recording.

, Windows Media Player, iTunes, or any other music player will work. Create a new playlist and import into it all your recordings. Save the list. Select the shuffle option on your player, so that a random response plays every time. This will make it less obvious that the answers are recorded, as they won't be the same every time.

, If it doesn't already, you may need to configure it using the settings. The most important functions that you should set up on your remote control are: Play, Pause and Stop.

, If possible, place it behind the mirror, so that the sound actually comes out through the mirror. Make sure that no one can see your laptop, and that it's loud enough to be heard from in front of the mirror.


You can also connect your laptop to speakers wirelessly or using Bluetooth. Then hide the speakers, which may be smaller and easier to disguise, near the mirror while your laptop remains wherever it is safe and inconspicuous.

, When your friend comes over, tell her that you own a magic mirror. She will likely think that you are crazy, but offer to prove it. Holding the remote control in your pocket or hidden in your hand, go near to the 'magic' mirror and ask loudly: ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?""

Get a white sock that you don’t mind cutting apart.,
Mark the sock where the cast should end.,
Cut the sock to the correct size.,
Put the sock(s) back on.,
Wrap the area in adhesive gauze.,
Decorate the cast.",How to Make a Fake Cast1," This method works as an arm, wrist, or ankle cast. You could conceivably make it work as a leg cast, but it would take several socks or a couple of the very tall thigh-high socks. Find the sock that fits the “cast"" you intend to make., Pull the sock onto your arm or ankle and mark it where the respective cast would usually end. You can check pictures of real casts to find the perfect spot.









For a wrist cast, you’ll mark both at the edge of your hand where your fingers begin as well as around your palm where your thumb need to exit.For an ankle cast, the mark should be approximately where your foot ends and your toes begin.

, Based on the markings you made with the sock on, cut the sock to the correct size for your cast. Don’t worry if the heel of the sock makes a small bubble around your wrist because you’ll cover it up later.









If you want to give your fake cast the proper thickness, you can cut two or three socks to the same size and layer them to give it the proper bulk.

, With the sock(s) cut to the proper size, you can now put them back on over the spot you want to make the cast. Now is the time to align the sock(s) as well, so place them in the correct spots both around your digits and further up your arm/leg.









If you have multiple, layered socks, then you should also fold the topmost one down about a quarter of an inch, so you can tuck it beneath the other layers. This will give the edges of your cast a rounded look like the real thing.If you by chance have a relatively smooth wrist or ankle brace in your possession, you can also place this under the sock to gives the “cast” added bulk without ruining more socks than necessary.
Yet another option is to wrap the area in a thick Ace bandage before putting on the sock. Not only will this option give the area the necessary thickness, but it’ll make it more difficult to move the wrist/ankle if you are afraid your movements might give it away that the cast is fake.

, You may see the material labeled as sticky gauze, self-adhesive bandage wrap, or by another name. The material is a breathable gauze that has a slightly dry, sticky feel and texture that allows it to stick to itself. Start at one end of the sock and wrap the gauze in a tight layer down the entire length of the sock.








You want to make sure that you’re completely covering the sock except for roughly 1/4” at the edges where you tucked the sock under. You also want to make sure that the gauze is tight to give it a perfectly smooth surface with fewer obvious lines of the gauze overlapping itself.
You may have to do a couple layers of the gauze to give the “cast” additional bulk, especially if you only used one sock.
The gauze comes in a wide variety of colors, so you can easily fake a colored cast.

, Once you’re done wrapping it, your “cast” is ready to go. For added effect, you can decorate it like people do actual casts. Have someone who’s in on the joke sign your cast with a couple of names and “get well” remarks to help sell it.









If you made an arm “cast” and really want to push the joke (and make it harder for people to examine it in the process), you can also keep your arm in a sling. This also helps to keep your arm in one place if you’re worried about your movements giving away the fact that your arm isn’t broken.
For a leg or ankle “cast,” consider adding a pair of crutches to the costume. You can usually find old crutches at a yard sale or secondhand store for a reasonable price.

Plan accordingly.,
Inform your friends and family.",How to Make a Beginner Boobie Trap1," Do you want to play a joke? Alert yourself to a possible intruder? Injure the intruder? Scare someone? All of these questions will determine what kind of booby trap you end up making.;
, Design your booby trap before you start making it. You want to be very familiar with the construction and location of the booby trap so that you don’t accidentally spring it on yourself.

, If you’re hoping to prank your friends and family, then obviously disregard this step. However, you don’t want to accidentally surprise or injure an unintended target. Let people know if you’re building a booby trap and show them exactly how to avoid it. Try to ensure that they don’t forget.

If this is something you have done to your victim before, then it's likely that he or she will be on the lookout, so you have to be extra careful. If your victim's underwear is extra-visible, then you're in luck!;
, There are two tactics that you can take. You can just sneak up on your victim and reach for your victim's underwear, or you can casually approach your victim as if you just wanted to say hi or chat about something, and then trick your victim into turning around. Though the complete surprise wedgie can be deviously fun, it can also be pretty fun to pretend that you just want to be friends and then give a killer wedgie in the middle of the conversation.


If you choose to approach your victim and say hello, then you can get him to turn around by pointing to something out the window, asking him to look something up on his computer, or calling his attention to something across the room.

, There are so many fun and annoying ways to give a wedgie, so why stop at the most basic? See the list of different wedgie possibilities in the next section and choose whatever you think would be best for your victim (best = most annoying/most painful). And, you know, make sure your victim has some sort of sense of humor before you proceed.

, Just grab on to your victim's underwear from the back with both hands and pull it up as high as you can.

, Just grab the person's underwear from the front instead of the back and pull it up as high as you can. This is harder to do than the traditional from-the-back wedgie because the victim will be facing you. However, it will hurt more!

, Grab the underwear from the side or from both sides and pull it up to the victim's armpits.

, Grab the underwear with two hands and lift the person into the air. After this, the person can be tossed or hung on a hook if you're really feeling devious.

, Put the victim in a headlock, and make sure you have a hose nearby. Spray the victim's underwear with water and then give him or her a wedgie.

, Put the victim in a headlock, and make sure you have a water bomb on hand. Throw the water bomb into the victim's pants and then give him or her a wedgie.

, Lift up your victim by his underwear and hang it over a doorknob. Remember that your victim has to be pretty light/young for you to do this effectively.

, Lift your victim's underwear up from the back as high as you can, so high that you can actually lift it over the victim's head. This is considered the Grand Daddy of all wedgies. Just make sure your victim doesn't suffocate!

Get a roll of toilet paper.,
Break off a strip of five or six sheets.,
Wet the strips.,
Wrap the damp strips around your forearm or shin.,
Add more water to the toilet paper.,
Squeeze out any excess water.,
Apply another double sheet of toilet paper of the same length.,
Add a damp double strip of the same size around your wrist or ankle.,
Apply colored tissue paper around the whole “cast.” If you want to create the illusion of a colored cast, then you can choose the color of tissue paper you want and wrap one or two layers of the tissue paper around the “cast” once you’re happy with it.,
Wait for the “cast” to dry.,
Remember to keep the limb straight.",How to Make a Fake Cast2," This method for making a fake cast requires a lot of toilet paper, so you probably want to start with a full roll just to ensure that you have enough. If you try to make a leg “cast” this way, you will especially use a lot of it.

, Much like a paper mache project, you will have to form the “cast” in smaller strips and sections, so begin by tearing off a strip of toilet paper about five or six sheets long.








To help make the process take a bit less time, you can actually double up each strip of toilet paper. So break off a second strip the same length as the first and overlap them completely.This not only adds thickness to the “cast” more quickly, but it also helps strengthen the strips as you start getting them wet.

, You want to get the strips a little bit damp but definitely don’t soak them yet because they’ll become too brittle to wrap around your arm. If you have a spray bottle, simply mist the strips with water instead of drenching them.








, Whichever placement you have chosen for your “cast,” start by wrapping the damp toilet paper around the top of where the respective cast would end.For an ankle cast, this will be around your shin; for a wrist cast, this will be around your forearm.









You want to start at the top of the cast because it’s much easier to get around the curve of your ankle or around your thumb after you already have a base with which to work.
Don’t worry about wrapping the toilet paper toward the end of your extremity, just wrap it over itself to begin with.

, Once you have the strip wrapped around your shin or forearm, add more water to it. You want to use a spray bottle or even to flick water at the TP from your fingers because placing it under running water will just cause the TP to crumble.








, With more water on the toilet paper, it will be more malleable, and additional layers will stick to it more easily; however, the layers won’t stick if it’s too wet, so start by wrapping your hand around the appropriate forearm or shin and squeezing any excess water out of the toilet paper.








Apply direct pressure because if you pull at the toilet paper instead of just pushing against it, it’s likely to tear.

, With the first sheet applied, you want to apply a second double strip of the same size as the first. Stick one end of the double sheet to the current portion of the “cast.” The moisture in the first part will make the second double strip stick to it enough for you to wrap it. Then add more water and squeeze it out again.








You will repeat this step until the portion on your arm has the thickness you’re satisfied with, which will likely be with three or four applications.

, With the top portion of the cast ready, you can now move down to your wrist or ankle, depending on where you’ve placed the “cast.” Using the same length of double strip as before, dampen it and apply it over the bendable joint carefully.








For your ankle, you’ll need to keep your ankle at a 90-degree angle from here out, otherwise you risk tearing the toilet paper.
For your wrist and around your hand, you want to wrap the toilet paper from your wrist around the palm of your hand (so it passes across the L-shape between your thumb and index finger), across the back of your hand, and then finally back across your palm (but this time on the outside of your thumb).This will give your hand realistic looking coverage while still leaving your thumb and fingers free like an actual wrist cast.
You will repeat this step until you are satisfied with the bottom of the cast, which will probably require three or four total layers or however many you used on the top portion.
Remember to keep wetting the strips and squeezing them out between each application.,









Be extra careful apply the tissue paper to the damp toilet paper since the tissue paper is even more fragile.

, Once you’re happy with the toilet paper and tissue paper, you simply need to wait for the paper to dry. The toilet paper will harden as it dries, which will give the “cast” a more realistic look.If you’re in a hurry, you can also use a hairdryer to help the drying process along.

, The toilet paper can still rip or tear pretty easily, so you have to remember to keep your wrist or ankle in one position while you have the “cast” on since movement can break it.


Using a pair or crutches for an ankle “cast” is a great way both to sell the prank and to keep your from bending your ankle.

Buy a piece of fishing wire that will cover the length of your doorway.,
Buy a keychain siren at a home improvement store.,
Attach the body of the siren to the door.,
Knot the fishing wire around the alarm pin.,
Screw a small hook into the top of your doorframe.,
Put a small piece of tape on your door.",How to Make a Beginner Boobie Trap2," Measure your doorway ahead of time. You’ll want the wire to be able to reach all the way to the top of the door frame.

, This will be your noise-making device that will notify you when someone enters.

, Make sure that it is on the inside of the door or the intruder can easily take it off. You can use tape to securely attach the alarm – a keychain alarm is pretty light. , Make sure it’s around the part that you pull to make a sound, not the keychain part. , You’ll want to knot the other end of the fishing wire around this hook. That way, when the door opens, the fishing wire will pull on the alarm pin. Make sure that the fishing wire is relatively taught.


If you just want to know if someone entered your room, just place fishing wire in the front of your door without any sound making device. If the wire is disturbed you’ll know someone came in.

, This is another way to see if anyone entered your room. It isn't exactly a tripwire, but it will notify you if anyone has been snooping around. Try to stick the piece of tape up high so that the intruder won't notice that it was there.

Place marbles in front of your door.,
Place a bucket of cold water on top of the door.,
Make a flypaper trap.",How to Make a Beginner Boobie Trap3," This can be very dangerous, so think twice before using this step. The marbles will need to be on a hard wood floor, otherwise they are unlikely to make the intruder slip. Try to leave about two dozen marbles.


Remember to think about the way the door opens. If the door is pushed up and you leave the marbles too close to the door, the intruder will just push all the marbles out of the way.

, Fill a medium sized bucket with cold water. Now leave the door slightly ajar. Balance the bucket on top of the door using the door itself as the base for the bucket. It should be a delicate balance, but that’s what you want. When the intruder goes to push the door open, the water will fall right on their head.

, This is an incredibly annoying and effective booby trap. All you’ll need is string, nails, and flypaper from a home improvement store. Cut five feet of string and tie one end of the string to the doorknob. Now put two nails in the ceiling. Put the first one approximately a foot from the door and the other approximately five feet away. After you've done that, loop your string through the first nail and start attaching flypaper to the rest of the spring. Don’t wrap the flypaper around the string; just stick it on there so that there is plenty of sticky surface area still available. Loosely loop the end of the string around the final nail. When the door opens, the string will be pulled off of this last nail, the flypaper will swing down from the first nail, and stick to the person who opened the door. "

Put Saran Wrap over the toilet.,
Turn off the hot water.,
Cut a bottle of orange juice in half.",How to Make a Beginner Boobie Trap4," This is borderline prank, borderline booby trap. All you need to do is lift up the toilet seat and cover the inside of the toilet with saran wrap. Try to avoid leaving any creases in the saran wrap – you want it to look as see-through as possible.

, This is something you’ll probably want to do in the moment. If someone you want to prank is going to take a hot shower, you can run over and turn the hot water off. If they get out of the shower to check the hot water, quickly rush to turn it back on again. This will cause them a lot of confusion.

, Try doing this with a bottle of orange juice that is about half full. Take off the wrapper first, and then cut the bottle about an inch above wherever the juice line is. Make the cut all the way around so that you can sever the top and bottom sections. Now lightly tape the two sides back together with scotch tape. Put the wrapper back on to hide your trap. Leave the juice on the table and it will fall apart as they go to pour themselves some juice. "

Relish the memories.",How to Go Streaking," The timid might experiment with the backyard, an abandoned street or somewhere uncrowded at night. The bold (or those with authority problems) may aim for busy malls in the middle of the day. The extreme streaker may choose the football field during game time, right in front of all the cameras. How daring are you feeling?


Know that the more extreme your location, the more extreme the consequences. If you want to go streaking through a mall, you'll really just be running through a mall naked getting chased by security guards. And the football field? You're asking to be on tomorrow night's Tosh.O and you might be watching it from a 24-hour holding cell. It depends on your location, but you could either receive a fine, get arrested, or get put on the sex offender list (depending on the gravity of your circumstances). Research the laws in your region before you go about ruining the rest of your life for 30 seconds of harmless fun.;
, You'll look a lot skinnier in the dark. But if you want the world to experience you in your natural form, just like you were moments after you wrestled out of your mother's womb, do it in broad daylight. And if your stretch marks and fat rolls make it viral on YouTube, awesome. That's half the fun, right?


If you're planning a streak on private property, also be aware of trespassing laws. What is already illegal in the daytime is doubly illegal after hours if you're somewhere you're not supposed to be.

, Too many stories involve some poor schmuck getting his undies stolen. Then he has to grab the nearest garbage can lid (as if garbage cans had lids anymore) and parade his way through the nearest wedding in his starkers just to make a phone call to his mom. Don't let that kid be you. Get with a group of friends that you trust, that will not mind seeing you naked and that you don't mind seeing or being seen while naked.


If your friend is also streaking, make sure they're the type that you want to see naked too. And if all those guidelines rule out everyone you know, just go at it alone! That way the glory can be all yours. All eyes on you.

, This is one of those plans where you need all your exits clearly marked and located. If the cops do come after you, if things do go awry, what's your out? How are you going to handle it? Who's driving your getaway car? And what are you going to wear?


Where are your clothes going to be? On your head, in your hands, or somewhere else? Where's your transportation and how swiftly can you get to it when it all hits the fan? Are you going to wear a wig so no one recognizes you? How about shoes? Do your feet need protecting, wherever you are (especially if you need to run fast)?
If you're working on a rather tight time frame, plan what clothes you're going to be shedding. A robe can be thrown off in seconds, but those skinny jeans may take minutes to peel off, putting you in a rather vulnerable position.

, Literally - this is illegal. But you've done all this planning, so you might as well go through with it. Did you pound some caffeine beforehand? This type of thing takes some serious energy and adrenaline. Did you bring your guts and lack of shame? Hope so!

, The phrase ""watch your 6"" comes from streaking (questionable sources, though). If you're in a public place, scan the scene. Are there children present? Police? Obstacles that could trip you up (very literally)? The last thing you want to be is buck naked, spread-eagled (due to an unfortunate faceplant) in front of a six-year-old girl who's crying her eyes out and asking questions you're not prepared to answer. So check left, check right, and whip around.


If you're part of a crew, there's strength in numbers. Designate a person or two as a guard to keep watch. If something's amiss, establish a signal that can cue you to abort mission. You'll just have to try again tomorrow.

, Ah, sweet, sweet freedom. A healthy breeze around your privates. The way Mother Nature and Nelly intended. Just don't get too used to it. It's not streaking anymore if you just keep your clothes off. So run around, do your thing, and get your fill. How's it feel?


Put your clothes in a safe place or with friends that you trust before leaving them. If there is any chance you won't get your clothes back safely, put your underwear around your head so you will have some cover if needed. Or get another pair of clothes and hide them just in case. That underwear can also come in handy if the police arrive unexpectedly.

, Well, don't just stand there. Jump around. Do some lunges. Dive in. Adopt the Captain Morgan pose. Because how often does this moment happen? Not often enough is the correct answer, yes. So take these next 30 seconds and milk them for all they're worth. You may not get another chance ever.


If you want attention, scream and yell and you'll get it. It may be from the wrong people, but you'll get it. And those people will probably have some form of a recording device on them, so don't be surprised when they whip those out. There's no way this can get back to your employer, right?

, Just how far will you and your friends go? Who can last the longest and what crazy deeds can you do? Your locale will determine what kind of games you can play, but don't let your environment harsh your creativity. Here's a couple ideas:


Take a tennis ball (or some random small object) and place it far away. One person has to streak to it and move it further away. Then the next person has to do the same. Soon enough, someone will chicken out!
If you're in a public place, consider time, volume, and audacity to be your three variables. Who can do it the longest? Who is willing to be the loudest? Who is the most willing to make themselves seen and vulnerable?

, Well, it was short-lived, but it was sweet. If it were any longer-lived, it wouldn't be nearly as special. Brevity keeps the exceptional from turning into the mundane, so put your clothes back on (you're probably a little chilly anyway) and turn to your friends and talk about that one time when you all went streaking. How awesome was that? Did anyone get pictures?


If you can't find your clothes, for once wikiHow can't really help you. You could make your own, but it's probably easier to ask for the shirt off someone's back or to just parade around until you're escorted to somewhere that'll give you a bright orange jumpsuit.

, When you have grandchildren, you can regale them with the tale of that one time you laughed in the face of social norms and paraded around in your starkers as happy as a clam on Friday afternoon. Or you could not wait until you have grandkids and challenge your friends now to be as awesome as you are! Snowball's chance in hell, but they can try!

Prepare to make it up to the person you're pranking.",How to Do the Plastic Wrap on the Door Prank," The plastic wrap needs to stretch to each side of the door. You can use measuring tape to measure the width of your door-frame, then cut pieces of plastic wrap 5-6 inches longer than your door’s width. You should cut anywhere from 7-15 pieces for this prank.


Do not fold or get wrinkles in the wrap as you cut it.
To get a cleaner cut, use a pair of scissors.;
, You don’t want to tip them off to the prank early, so make sure that the prankee is used to going through the door you choose so nothing seems suspicious. Don’t use the front door, kitchen door or bathroom door because someone else may need to use it, and make sure that the other people in your house know you’re pulling off the prank.


Keep the door open when you do the prank.
Really wide door-frames are not the best for this prank because you’ll need to use more plastic wrap.
Don’t put the plastic wrap at foot height, or you’ll just cause the person to trip and fall.

, Tape the short end of the plastic wrap to one side of the door-frame while making sure that you’re not wrinkling it in the process. Line up the plastic wrap so that it is at chest height of the person you’re pranking.


Make sure that the tape is on the opposite side of the door, so that the prankee won’t be able to see it as he approaches the door frame.
Some people like to put the plastic wrap at face height, but this could be dangerous., Make sure the plastic wrap is taut as you do this. Once you make sure there are no visual wrinkles or folds, tape the other end of your plastic wrap to the opposite side of the door frame. It's very important that the plastic wrap appears to be transparent, so do it in a doorway that has low lighting and no reflective surfaces.


Wrinkles in the plastic wrap will tip off the prankee and they will most likely not walk through it.

, You need to keep applying layers of wrap one over the other, so that way the prankee doesn’t just walk through the prank but actually bounces off the plastic wrap.


Make sure that it’s sturdy enough by pressing on the plastic wrap barrier with your hand.
You can make the barrier larger than two feet, but don’t go under two feet tall or else it may not have the desired effect.

, Being strategic with the person you're pranking is crucial in having a good prank. The idea is that it should be fun for all parties involved, even for the person who’s being pranked. While they might be a bit embarrassed, it’s not meant to hurt their feelings or make them mad.


The best prank is when everyone laughs together at the end.
Make sure the person you’re pranking doesn’t have a bad temper.

, It will be easier to pull off the prank if the person is gullible or doesn’t typically notice things. It's also easy to pull this prank off on someone with bad eyesight because they are less likely to spot the plastic wrap. This prank is funniest when the person has no idea that it’s about to happen.


Don’t select someone who pays attention to detail, or is usually skeptical of you.
Try to select someone who you haven’t pranked before, because they're more likely to fall for the prank if they think it’s coming from a credible source., To get the person to fall for the prank, allure them through the doorway with their favorite candy, or a funny video on your computer. If you really want to be sneaky, you can tell them it’s urgent so they rush over, and run into the plastic wrap barrier. You don't want them to think about the potential for the prank, so figuring out a way to make them rush is the best way to do this prank.


Don’t laugh or you may give away your prank. An obvious tell is over excitement or laughter before you execute the prank.
If your friend is starting to catch on, change the conversation to misdirect their attention.

, Some people take jokes better than others. If the person is upset after you prank them, take them out to get ice cream, or do something nice for them. The nice thing about this prank is no one gets hurt, but the person you're pranking may be mad.


Make sure to calm the person down and tell them it was just a joke if they are visibly angry.
Prepare for retaliation pranks if you're pranking a friend or sibling.

Prepare for cooking.",How to Eat a Tangelo1," Tangelos have a thin and smooth skin that makes it easy to peel. You can start at the top of the tangelo by digging your fingernail or knife under the skin. Then, slowly begin to peel the layers back until all of the skin has been removed.You don’t have to peel neatly unless you are planning to use the rind for something.;
, Once the skin is off, you can begin to segment the tangelo. The fruit should be naturally sectioned, so all you need to do is peel it apart. The tangelo may have zero or many seeds.The amount of seeds varies depending on how much the tree was pollinated by bees as it was growing.

, You will need to do a couple of preparations if cooking with a tangelo. You will need to remove the seeds before cooking. Wash the rind under cold water if you will be using it."

Serve tangelo with dessert.",How to Eat a Tangelo2," Tangelo is a great addition to a light salad. You can use any ingredients and dressings you want, but some ingredients complement the taste of tangelo better than others. Simply throw the peeled segments of fruit into any salad.For example, spinach leaves, sliced endive, sliced red onions, toasted walnuts, and mint leaves taste great with tangelos.
Pair it with a dressing made from vinegar, oil, tangelo juice, grated zest, and black pepper.

, Tangelo gives salsa a sweet and citrus zest. You can make a salsa by mixing sautéed garlic, grated tangelo zest, and chopped red chili together. Then, add in the whole tangelo segment, cherry tomatoes, and basil leaves for a fresh and ready salsa., Add segments of tangelo to any type of taco. Some ingredients that work well with tangelo and tacos are diced avocados, black beans, corn, and the meat of your choice. You can use the tangelo juice to top the tacos along with sour cream, chili, and garlic., Tangelo also tastes good in a sorbet, topping a pie, or mixed into a fruit salad. You can also add tangelo to a smoothie for a healthier option. Dark chocolate, lemon, and coconut are a few flavors that go well with tangelo in a dessert dish. "

In the northern hemisphere, they are in season from mid-September to mid-December. They are in season from July to October in the southern hemisphere., The fruit should feel firm and heavy in your hands. Look for tangelos that are mostly unblemished. A few green spots close to the stem are okay, but there shouldn’t be any mold or soft spots., You can store tangelos out on your countertop for about one week. They will often stay fresh for ten days at room temperature. Move the tangelos to the refrigerator if you don’t think that you will eat them within a week., The tangelos will last slightly longer in the refrigerator. You can store the tangelos in the refrigerator for about two weeks. Throw them away once they start to show signs of decay—like bruising and softness."

Select and prepare your reclaimed wood plank.,
Prepare spoons.,
Attach spoons to wood.,
Mount on the wall and add candles.",How to Make Candle Wall Art with Reclaimed Wood," You should have an idea where you plan to hang your artwork before selecting the wood plank in order to give you an idea of size. A lumberyard may have an area of used pieces of wood or you could use a plank of wood from an old piece of furniture (that you were going to discard) or from a home remodel.


Sand the reclaimed wood to remove splinters, old paint or loose wood. Make several passes with the sander until the plank is clean and ready for staining.
Apply stain or paint. Allow ample dry time before proceeding to the next coat or step.;
, The spoons will be mounted on the wood and will act as the holder for your votive candles.

Lay the spoon on a flat surface, holding the spoon mouth firmly with one hand.






Grasp the spoon handle and bend it upward until the spoon becomes an “L” shape.






Lay spoon on a flat surface with the handle portion laying on the surface. You will want to make sure the handle rests evenly against the surface (and ultimately the piece of wood).







, Before you make it permanent, lay out the spoons on the wood so you can see how it will look once secured. Keep in mind that each spoon mouth will hold a candle, which may help with placement.


Hold spoon handle against the wood and nail against the plank using the nail gun. You may need to add a few nails in order to make sure the spoon is completely secured (consider one at the top and base of the handle).

, For best results, purchase a picture frame mounting kit at your local craft store. The kit should come with everything you need to hang the wood securely to the wall. Look for a kit that is designed for heavier wall art.


Place candles on spoons and light.

Cut the branch into thin slices.,
Drill holes into the branch slices.,
Sand and seal the buttons.,
Sew the buttons onto a jacket or sweater.,
Use them to decorate pillows and other accessories.,
Get crafty with them.",How to Make Buttons from Branches," The next time you’re out doing yard work or taking a stroll through your neighborhood, keep an eye out for branches that may be useful for making buttons. In most suburban and rural areas, gathering your materials should literally be as easy as picking it up off the ground, especially during the fall and winter seasons. If you don’t live in a wooded area, search for downed branches around the trees at a local park.


Pass up any branches that look especially brittle, or are too misshapen to be practical.
You’ll only need one or two good pieces of wood to make a set of buttons, so there’s no need to gather a big bundle.;
, When collecting sticks and branches, start visualizing how they would look as buttons. The size of the buttons you produce will depend on the thickness of the branches you use to make them. Imagine that you’re taking a cross-sectional view and consider how practical it would be to work with a branch of a particular width.If you need to, snap off one end of the branch to get a sense of how its inner area will look.

, Before you cart your branches home, look them over and determine what kind of shape they’re in. Old or diseased wood tends to be dry and will often crack and splinter when it’s handled. Young, green wood, however, may contain too much moisture, which can make it pulpy and resistant to shaping. Try to find branches that are firm, healthy and have a rich, tan wooden color inside.Oak, birch, pine and fir are just a few types of wood useful for crafting projects.Gray, lifeless wood should be discarded. It will likely break during the cutting or drilling process. The same goes for wood that is covered with moss or lichens. This may be a sign that the wood is rotten.

, Break off or pare away any rotted spots, protrusions or irregularities. This includes sap, twigs and anywhere that the bark may be especially thick. Plan on cutting the buttons from the straightest, roundest section of the branch.If you want, you can strip the branch of bark prior to cutting it into the slices you’ll use to make your buttons. Use a pocket knife to whittle away at tough park, or pry old bark off by hand. This will make for a more uniform color., Use a vice or table clamp to secure the branch while you cut it. In order to get the most precise cut possible and prevent injury, you’ll want to make sure it doesn’t move around, so holding it by hand won’t do. Be certain that the branch doesn’t have any wiggle room before you move on to the sawing phase.Position the branch so that the length you’ll be cutting extends off the edge of the table.
If you don’t have access to a clamp, a basic variety can be bought for around $10-$20.

, Achieving thin, even cuts will require the use of a saw. For this type of task, a jigsaw or manual coping saw will work best. Carefully cut the branch into slices between ⅛ and ¼ of an inch thick. Keep your free hand away from the saw blade as you work. Saw the branch into as many segments as you desire, depending on how many buttons you plan to make.The power of an electrical saw will save you time and result in an ultra-smooth cut, while being forced to go slower with a manual saw can help you fine-tune your cuts and correct potential mistakes.
You have a little freedom in how thick you want each button to be. Just remember that if you plan on sewing them onto your clothes, they’ll need to be able to fit through the buttonholes.

, Now that you’ve rendered the branch into small discs, it’s time to make actual buttons out of them. Attach a narrow 1/16th bit to a power drill and use it to bore two or four holes in each wooden disc. Make sure the holes are lined up and evenly spaced in the center of the buttons.Place a flat block of spare wood under the buttons to avoid accidentally drilling into your work surface.
Drill four (or more) holes into thick or large buttons to help attach them more securely.

, You’re almost done! Put the finishing touches on your homemade buttons by running them along a piece of fine-grit sandpaper. Then, brush a thin layer of oil or lacquer onto the face of each button. This will protect them from cracking splitting or drying out, and will also lend them a smooth, polished shine.If you’ve stripped the bark from the branches, focus on the buttons’ rough outer edges while sanding.
Linseed oil, mineral oil or beeswax all provide great natural finishes, while synthetic sealants like acrylic lacquer will ensure that your buttons enjoy a long lifespan., Let your homemade branch buttons take the place of the ordinary buttons on your favorite coat or cardigan. Simply snip off the old buttons, then position your new buttons in the same spot and use a couple passes with a needle and thread to hold them in place. You’ll now be able liven up old clothing items with unique accessories that will get people talking.The natural wooden color of branch buttons will look especially sharp with muted earth tones and outdoorsy patterns and materials such as plaid flannel.
For wide buttons, you may need to open up your buttonholes a little. Elongate the openings with scissors until they’re able to accommodate the buttons, then stitch the edges to keep them from tearing.

, You don’t have to use your branch buttons exclusively on clothing. Try attaching them to throw pillows, quilts, tote bags, stuffed animals and fabric decorations for an enchanting bohemian look. The rustic detailing will introduce an element of the great outdoors to almost any item, no matter how simple or contemporary.Paint or stain your buttons different colors to offer some visual contrast to the items you pair them with., In addition to their obvious fashion and furniture applications, natural wooden buttons have a range of surprising creative uses. Fill a mason jar full of branch buttons for a simple, eye-catching table topper. Attach magnet stripping to the backs of the buttons to make one-of-a-kind refrigerator magnets. Use large buttons to make the pull cords for light fixtures and ceiling fans more interesting. The number of places branch buttons could show up around your home is only limited by the scope of your imagination!Take a look at crafting websites like Pinterest, Country Living and Good Housekeeping for tips and ideas on alternative uses for buttons.
Keep a handful of pre-made branch buttons in your sewing kit. You never know what you might be able to do with them in the future.

Pick your battles.,
Pay attention.,
Stay tense.",How to Dip1," As the instigator of your prank, you have the power to choose a time and place for it. Some choices are better than others if you want to dip out successfully.


Go at night. People hate running at night, and are unlikely to follow you nearly as far. In addition, it is much easier to hide at night, regardless of your location.
Choose a safe target. It might be tempting to pull a prank on the crazy guy in the wheelchair who was threatening to shoot you at the supermarket yesterday, but it's not very wise. There's no way of knowing if he'll actually come out shooting, or unleash a big angry dog on you. Instead, pick people you think will be able to roll with the punches and get over what you do to them.
Preserve the element of surprise. Don't go into a situation where you or your plan will stick out like a sore thumb. Try to do things so that nobody knows what you're up to until the last possible moment.

Try a prank from a moving car. Your target won't know what hit them until you're long gone.
Don't tell anyone about your plan unless they're a part of it. You never know who your ideas will get back to.

;
, As you engage in whatever enjoyable foolishness you've decided to pursue, remember that you may need to dip at a moment's notice.


If you have an audience, gauge their reactions. If you're doing something without the target's knowledge, keep your eyes open for signs that he or she has noticed you're up to something.
Make a mental note of the landscape. Continue to scan it as you go about your “business.” Identify likely escape routes and alternates, as well as places to avoid.

If you're outside, remember to note the positions of any cars, bicycles, or other modes of transport that will beat you in a race. Plan to dip where they can't easily follow.
If the shenanigans are happening indoors, be sure to keep a clear line between you and the nearest exit. If you can't, at least have a route to the exit planned. Don't choose the wrong door or you might end up locked in a closet with half a dozen angry people pounding on the door.



, Put a few steps between yourself and the center of the action if anything seems to be happening. This will help you escape as quickly as possible.


If you're with a group of friends, they will benefit from your taking the time to find good escape routes as you lead the way.
If you bolt and it's a false alarm, don't feel embarrassed. It's better to be jumpy and get away clean than it is to laugh in the face of danger and get grounded or worse.

Add your grass.,
Add a stream.,
Apply an undercoat to the stream.,
Glue down figurines.,
Apply the water effect.,
Add your finishing touches.",How to Make Bookends1," Spread newspaper to cover the surface of your work area and use a paint brush or clean cloth to gently apply chestnut-coloured wood stain. Be sure to apply it in the direction of the wood on all vertical sides of your blocks. Allow the stain to dry for a couple of hours. You may add a second coat but one should be fine.Do not stain the top of the blocks. You may stain the bottom of the blocks if you choose.;
, Pour tacky glue into a bowl of water. Once the blocks are dry, use a paint brush to apply the mixture to the top of the blocks that do not have any stain on them., Sprinkle faux grass on the wet glue at the top of each block. Use your fingers and press on lightly on the grass to make sure it adheres to the blocks. Allow the glue to dry for a few hours., Use a blunt object, like the end of a foam brush, to scrape off some of the grass and create a stream. After you have created your desired stream shape, apply a thin layer of glue to either side in order to create a border to seal in any water you may with to add., Use a paintbrush to paint thick blue acrylic paint on your stream. You may also use the undercoat that comes in the Scene-A-Rama kit instead of the acrylic paint. You may also add small pebbles to the stream by placing them on top of the undercoat.Purchasing a Scene-A-Rama kit is optional.

, As the undercoat dries, glue down trees, figurines, structures, and rocks at your desired locations. Use tweezers to hold down the items as the glue dries., Use the water effect that comes with the Scene-A-Rama kit and apply it onto the dry undercoat of the stream. Allow the water effect to dry for a few hours and apply the special ripple effect from the same kit. You may also simply paint a contrasting blue or use white to create waves.The ripple effect is the last layer of the kit. Purchasing a Scene-A-Rama kit is optional.

, Add a few more pebbles or figurines to the stream. You may also paint flowers or details on any of the objects. Allow the diorama to dry for several hours before using as your bookends."
"
Let your friends know.,
Spring into action.,
Run numbers while you run.,
Rely on every tool at your disposal.,
Relax and have a good laugh.",How to Dip2," If you're part of a group, yell “dip!” as soon as you see that you're about to get into some trouble. This will signal them to scatter so that nobody gets caught flat-footed and has to endure the brunt of the punishment.

, Force all the nervous tension in your body into your legs and arms, and sprint like a bat out of hell. More often than not, your target will give up chasing you after only a few seconds, but keep up your sprint for 30 seconds or more and get some distance before you slow down and look behind you.

, How many people are after you? How many are focused on you specifically, rather than your friends? Being aware of such things will help you think on your feet and make smart decisions during the heat of the chase.


If you're being chased, glance back and try to gauge how fast the person chasing you is. Make adjustments based on what you see.

Outrun larger pursuers by clambering over rough terrain.
Outwit faster pursuers by getting out of their line of sight and hiding somewhere they aren't likely to look. Be sure to have an escape route ready in case they see you.



, Now is the time for lateral thinking and resource exploitation. Do whatever you can to get away clean.


Use the terrain to your advantage. In an outdoor situation, pursuers often discount just how effectively simple things like an elevation change or a large rock can hide a person.

On a forested hill, sprint horizontally out of sight and then turn sharply and run as high up the hill as you can. Take refuge behind a bush or tree and watch as the person chasing you continues slowly working his or her way down the hill.
On a creek, drop to the floor of the ravine and cross the creek on foot. Few people are willing to follow a mischief maker through cold, running water.
In a rocky area, hide behind a large boulder and listen. If your pursuer seems to be getting close to you, move slowly away from the side of the rock they are likely to pass by, and continue around as they move.
In town, few things beat the classic “run through other people's back yards” maneuver. Just be sure you know where the guard dogs live before you start jumping fences.


Have transportation waiting. If you're in a situation with no likely way to escape on foot, have a friend waiting nearby with a car. Keep its lights off and its engine running.

Don't forget to do your friend a favor later. You owe him or her big time.
Alternatively, hide your bicycle somewhere nearby and run to it instead. Remember, you'll have to leave it unlocked to use it as an escape vehicle, so hide it somewhere it won't get stolen.

Paint on final details.",How to Make a Windmill1," Draw a polygon shape on a large sheet of cardboard or paper. If you use paper, use a heavyweight paper such as butcher paper or posterboard. The shape should be 9 inches on top, 12 inches on bottom, and 20 inches tall. Cut out the template. This will be used to create the sides of your windmill.;
, Draw a hexagon with 9.5” sides on a sheet of cardboard or heavy paper. Cut out the hexagon template. This will be used to create the platform at the top of your windmill.

, Draw an “X” shape on a large sheet of cardboard or heavy paper. Each arm of the “X” should be 16” long and 2” wide.


Measure 2” from the exact center of the “X” shape on four sides to create a square shape around the center of the “X”.
Cut out the template as one piece, making sure not to cut into the square shape.

, Place the templates on your sheets of plywood. Use 1” plywood for the sides, top, and a 2”-diameter circle. Use ½” plywood for the “X”. Use a carpenter pencil to trace the shape of each template onto the wood. You will need six side pieces, one hexagonal top, one 2”-diameter circle, and one “X.”


Use a drafting compass to easily draw a 2”-diameter circle onto the plywood. If you have a jar or can whose diameter is 2”, you could also use it to trace the circle.
It is best to trace all the pieces you need onto the plywood before you start cutting. This way you make sure that you have laid out the pieces efficiently and have enough wood to complete your project.
Do not use “chipboard” or MDF as it is likely to fall apart when it becomes wet.

, Place the plywood onto two sawhorses for stability. Use a jigsaw to cut out all the pieces: six side pieces, one hexagonal top, one “X” (for the blades), and one 2” circle.


Circular saws are faster than jigsaws for long, straight cuts, but they cannot produce small shapes. If you have both, use a circular saw to cut out the sides and a jigsaw for the other pieces.

, Solid wood dowels such as oak or poplar will be the sturdiest. You can often find short dowels at craft supply stores, but you can also use dowels from hardware stores.

, If you do not have a 1/2”-diameter drill bit, use a drafting compass to draw a ½” circle on the wood first so that you can judge when the hole is large enough. The wooden dowel should be able to fit snugly inside these holes.

, Using a handheld sander or sandpaper, sand all the pieces except for the dowel. This step will give your wood a smooth, even finish. It will also prepare the wood for painting or staining.

, You can choose a vivid color for your Dutch windmills, or you can use a natural wood stain to show the beauty of your wood. Once you have painted or stained your pieces, let them dry completely. This may take 24-48 hours, depending on the humidity in your area.


If you use paint, choose an outdoor latex paint. If you use stain, follow it with at least one coat of clear polyurethane in order to provide weatherproofing.

, Place one of your six sides on a flat surface such as a worktable or level floor. The short end should be at the top, and the long end at the bottom. Place another side piece next to this one, also with the short end at the top and the long end at the bottom.


Place a pencil between these pieces and push the wood together to form a gap the width of the pencil.
Repeat this process with the remaining side pieces until you have laid all six side by side.

, Place strips of painter’s tape near the top, middle, and bottom of every joint created in the previous step. This will keep your side pieces together while you form the body shape.

, You may want to have a friend help you with this step. With the taped side facing outward, bring the edges of the body together to form a closed tower shape. Secure the final joint with painter’s tape. Test on a flat surface to make sure that the body is sitting level.


If the body is not level, mark which piece(s) are too long and sand them down to stabilize the body. Sand gradually and check your work often.

, Place the hexagonal top onto the body. Press firmly, taking care not to push so hard that you collapse the body pieces. Set this aside and allow glue to dry completely.

, Apply wood glue to all seams inside the body. Don’t worry if you have some excess glue on the joints; you can scrape it off once it’s dry. Set aside and allow the glue to dry completely.


Once the glue is dry, use a small chisel to scrape away the excess glue.

, Slide the 12” dowel about 2” into the hole. Apply wood glue around the seam. Allow to dry completely and then scrape off excess glue.

, Center the line in the middle of the hexagonal top. Pre-drill a hole at each end of this line. Screw in two screw eye hooks, adjusting so that the eyes are parallel.

, Slide the wooden dowel through both eyelets. The blades should have enough clearance from the body to spin freely. Apply wood glue to the inside of the center hole in the small wood circle and place it on the other end of the dowel.

, Dutch windmills sometimes have doors or windows, so if you’d like, you can use a small paintbrush to add these touches. You could also paint on flowers, animals, or other things you find appealing.

You can make them as large or small as you’d like depending on your bookcase. Use the slick side of white or dry erase poster board so that the plaster can be easily removed.

, Read the packaging of your plaster to know how much water to add to your mixture. Pour the plaster and water into a mixing bowl and use a spoon to stir the mixture. Be careful as the plaster heats up as you stir.Be sure to use a bowl and spoon that you will not be using for food. You may not be able to remove the plaster once you have used these items.

, Check the instructions on your plaster for drying times. You may have to wait 30 minutes or longer before removing your plaster from the mold and then waiting another 24 hours for the plaster to dry.If some of the poster board sticks to the mold, use an exacto knife to gently scrape or sand it off once fully dry, or paint over it later.

, Cut some scrap wood to the size of your quotation marks and glue or nail them together at a perpendicular angle to create the base and back. Nail or glue your quotation marks onto the scrap wood base and back.Use wood clamps when using glue as the glue dries. You may also paint the base and back. Paint them the same colour as your bookshelf to make your quotation marks seem as if they were floating.

, Paint your quotation marks a contrasting colour to the base and back to help them stand out. Be sure to sand both the plaster quotation marks and wooden base and back before painting them. Consult the paint packaging for proper drying times.Let your plaster dry for a few days. The paint may end up peeling off if you do not allow your plaster to dry. If this happens, sand off the paint and paint over it again.

Make sure they are cut in half because you need the symmetry to make your look work.Find vintage headphones at your local thrift store or online.

, Purchase some metal utilitarian bookends from your local dollar store and spray paint them. Choose a colour that suits the colour of your headphones or you may also spray paint your headphones the same colour for a monochromatic look.Allow your spraypaint several hours to dry. Make sure to apply your spray paint evenly. You may want to practice against some scrap pieces of board to get use to the paint distribution.

, Take each half of the headphone and set it on its own separate bookend. Take note of where the natural points of contact are and apply a few drops of glue to these areas. Press and hold the headphones in place as your wait for the glue to dry.Work on one side of the headphone at a time for convenience. You don’t want to apply too much glue and make a mess. Use a clean swab to wipe off any excess glue after you have pressed down on your headphones.

Thread a 1” metal washer onto a long wood screw.,
Pre-drill a ⅛” hole in the other end of the dowel boom.,
Find the center of your windmill.,
Drill a ⅛” hole through the boom at the place you marked.",How to Make a Windmill2," These sails should be rectangles about 2” wide by 12” long. Using medium-grain sandpaper, sand the edges until smooth.Do not use MDF or chipboard as it will not hold up in outside weather.

, The circle should be 1” thick, so use 1” plywood or glue two ½” plywood circles together. Use a jigsaw to cut out the circle.

, Use a pencil and a ruler or straightedge to draw a line that divides the circle into two halves. Draw another line that divides it into quarters. Then draw two more lines to divide those quarters in half. When you’re finished, the lines on the circle should resemble a sliced pizza.


Drill a ⅛” hole in the center of the circle. This should be the spot where all the lines you just drew intersect.

, Begin at each of the lines you drew in Step 3 and use a pencil to draw 45-degree angled lines across the edge. You may find it easiest to use a protractor or a “speed square” (a type of protractor used in construction).

, Repeat Step 3 on this side of the circle, placing your ruler at the other end of the 45-degree angled lines you just drew. When you’re finished, you should have two sets of lines that are offset from each other by about a half-inch., Each cut should be about 1” deep. Use a chisel or file to make sure these cuts are wide enough to fit the sails.


To give the circle stability as you cut, you will probably want to clamp it to a worktable or large piece of wood set on two sawhorses. Move the clamp as needed.

, Center each sail in a groove and fit in place. Set aside and allow the glue to dry completely. This may take between 24-48 hours, depending on the humidity in your area.


Once the glue has completely dried, you can use a chisel to remove any excess glue.

, The tail will be shaped like an elongated baseball “home plate.” Draw a 6” square on a piece of ½” plywood.


Place a ruler or straightedge at the top of the square 2” from the outer edge of the square. Tilt it to a 45-degree angle.
Use a pencil to draw a straight line from the top of the square to the outer edge of the square. This should create a triangle shape. Repeat on the other side.

, Follow the lines you just drew so that the top of your tail angles inward and the bottom of the tail is square.

, The dowel should be at least 16” long as it will form the “boom” for your windmill. Use small finishing nails and a hammer to attach the tail.

, Use outdoor latex paint or a waterproof stain and clear polyurethane to paint the boom and the windmill (the circle with the sails attached). Allow to dry completely.


You can wait to paint or stain the whole thing until it’s fully assembled, but that may be more difficult.

, The screw should be at least 2” long and 3mm in diameter (approximately a #10 screw). Screw through the hole in the center of the windmill. Thread another 1” washer onto the screw., Attach the windmill to the boom by screwing it into the hole you just drilled.


Don’t attach the windmill too tightly. It should be secure, but still loose enough to allow complete rotation of the circle.

, Balance the windmill by holding the boom on one finger. Adjust its position until you are able to balance the windmill on your finger. Mark that point in pencil., Attach windmill to a post by screwing through this hole into the post. Many hardware stores sell pre-cut fence posts.


You can also use the rest of your wooden dowel as the post. Most dowels sold at hardware stores come in 48” lengths, so you should have about 32” remaining after you cut off the boom.

Add water (optional).",How to Make a Wishing Well," The easiest way to create a base for the wishing well is to use an existing, wooden container. A barrel or wooden planter roughly 2–4 feet (0.6 – 1.2 meters) tall will make a small garden ornament, while larger containers can be used to make something closer in size to an actual well. If you do decide to use one of these options, skip ahead to the next section, on attaching a roof.


If you'd like to make your own circular well base, use the instructions below. If you prefer a square container, build a planter box, then skip ahead to attaching the roof.;
, If you have access to a table saw, you can make your own wooden ring out of lumber. Here are some guidelines for the raw materials:


Sixteen pieces of 1 x 4 (19 x 89 millimeter) lumber will make a wishing well that looks quite circular, and measures about 2 feet (0.6 meters) across.Use eight pieces of 2 x 4 instead to save time and money, making an octagonal well.
Cut all pieces to the same length, which will be the height of your wishing well. If you want the well to be portable, or usable by children, choose a height of 4 ft (1.2 m) or less.
If you plan to build a roof, cut two of the pieces at least 2.5 ft (0.75 m) longer than the others to serve as roof supports. Cut one end of these pieces to a fencepost-like point, using 45º angles.

, Bevel each long edge of each piece of lumber, to ensure that they fit together tightly when arranged in a circle. For a sixteen-sided barrel, cut each edge to an 11.25º angle. For an eight-sided barrel, use a 22.5º angle instead. Use a protractor, rafter square, or angle gauge to set the angle of your saw.


For a barrel with n sides, use an angle equal to 360 ÷ (n x 2).
See the tips section for an alternate method of finishing you barrel, that does not require beveling.

, Lay out the lumber flat on the ground, touching each other along the long edges. Push them against a straight edge to make sure the bases line up. If you are using extra-long roof supports, place exactly half of the short pieces in between them, to make sure the roof supports end up opposite each other.


For example, if you are using sixteen pieces, lay out a long roof support, seven short pieces, then a long roof support, then the other seven short pieces.
If you are using eight pieces, lay out a long roof support, three short pieces, a long roof support, then the other three short pieces.

, Once you have beveled the lumber and laid it out, rotate one slat of lumber onto the next, so the angled edges fit perfectly. Repeat until the barrel shape is formed, with the help of an assistant if possible. If you cannot roll the barrel together, use wood glue to fasten each slat to the next in turn.

, If you would like the barrel to have a bottom, trace out the dimensions of the bottom piece while the barrel is rolled together. Cut out the bottom from a single piece of lumber and wedge it into the barrel, then continue on to the next step.


If you leave your wishing well without a base, you can use it as a decoration around existing features, such as fountain pipes or flower planters.
Clamp the barrel together. Whether or not you used glue, clamp the final barrel shape together by tightening two hose clamps around it, one near each end.Use a third clamp near the middle if the barrel seems loose.

, If you made your own barrel as described above, there should already be two longer slats that can be used as roof supports. If you are using an existing barrel, select two long 2 x 4s (38 x 89 mm), and cut one end to a fencepost-like point, using 45º angles. The lumber should extend at least 2ft (0.6 m) above the lip of the well base, and may be significantly taller if you are using a heavy or tall barrel. Nail these roof supports at the base of the barrel and again near the lip, with the two supports at exactly opposite sides of the barrel.

, To make a small, peaked roof for your wishing well, begin by cutting four pieces of lumber to serve as the frame for the roof, using the same size lumber as formed the roof support. Cut one end of each piece to form a 45º slant, so two pieces can fit over each peaked roof support and slope downward. Drill holes and attach wood screws down through the frame and onto the support, from above.The length of the roof frame is up to you. Typically, a small roof is used, that does not extend past the edge of the well.

, Lay out 1 x 2 (19 x 38 mm) lumber rafters from one side of the frame to the other, using wood screws to attach them on each side. Choose between two styles of roof:Flat roof: Work from the top downward. Place each rafter flush with the one above it.
Overlapping roof: Work from the bottom upward, overlapping each rafter over the one beneath it. Plan the rafter placement in advance so the uppermost rafter meets the peak of the roof without having to be cut.

, Strengthen the roof and make it more attractive by adding a trim. Start by attaching a 1 x 4 (19 x 89 mm) across the open, triangular frame, at its lowest point. Use finishing nails and wood glue to make a strong bond, both to the roof support and to each end of the frame. Repeat on the opposite end, then connect them with another 1 x 4 (19 x 89 mm) just beneath the lowest rafter.

, If you are keeping your wishing well outdoors, giving it a coat of paint will protect the wood from the weather. Use a clear finish instead if you'd prefer to keep the natural wood color.


If you plan to use the wishing well for water, use a wood stain that protects the base from water damage.If you are painting the well in your garden, keep in mind that the products you use may harm nearby plants if they reach the soil.

, The spindle will run over the mouth of the well, and can support a small bucket to make your wishing well look more like a real one. You may use a strong, 1"" (25 mm) thick dowel, but since these are difficult to find, consider using a length of 1 x 1 (19 x 19 mm) lumber instead.Cut this to a length that can extend across the full outer diameter of the well, plus at least an additional 6 inches (15 cm).


The spindle will need to fit through holes in the roof supports. If you are building an extra-small wishing well, you may need to use a smaller spindle.
You'll need a similar piece about 6 inches (15 cm) long for the handle, so save the scraps from cutting.

, Drill holes large enough to fit the spindle. Choose a location high up on the roof support, but below the roof, and measure from the well edge to make sure the two holes are at the same height. Push the spindle through the holes.

, Using the scraps of lumber from this project, cut out two washers a bit larger than the spindle. For most wells, square or round washers 1.5"" (38 mm) across (and any thickness) will work. Drill a hole 1"" (25 mm) in diameter through each washer. Push a washer onto each end of the spindle, until it is flat against the frame. Use wood glue to attach the washers and frame.

, Cut a rectangle of lumber about 2"" x 3"" (5 x 7.5 cm), and drill two 1"" (25 mm) holes into it.Place one hole onto the spindle and attach it using wood glue. Cut a piece of dowel or lumber about 6 inches (15 cm) long, using the same size of lumber you used for the spindle. Stick this handle through the remaining hole on the rectangle, and attach with wood glue. You can now turn the spindle by rotating this handle.

, Select a mug, cup, or small bucket that you don't mind exposing to an outdoor environment. Tie a short length of rope onto the handle, and tie the other end onto the spindle. Use a strong glue to fasten the rope permanently to the spindle, allowing you to raise or lower the bucket.

, A tightly made barrel wit a bottom can hold water, but keep in mind that standing water can become a breeding ground for mosquito larvae. Place a small, dark-colored trash can or bucket at the base of the well instead so you can easily lift it out and empty it. Better yet, place an open-bottomed well over a small fountain pipe attached to your irrigation system for a burbling well.


Alternatively, fill the well with soil instead, and plant flowers.

Assemble the side pieces using a butt joint.,
Attach the sides to the base.,
Attach a hinged lid to the box.,
Fill any nail holes.",How to Make a Wooden Box1," You can use repurposed wood from previous projects, boards from broken down pallets, or you can purchase and cut new wood. Consider what your box will be used for.


For example, if you're making a jewelry box, consider thin pieces of cedar, ash or oak.It will be easier to make a smaller box with thinner wood. Save larger pieces or boards for bigger boxes. This will also prevent you from having to do too much trimming.;
, Keep all your basic tools in your workspace. If using power tools, make sure that you have access to power outlets. At the very least, you'll want a ruler, hammer, nails, wood glue or putty, and of course, your boards.


If using power tools, use caution and always wear eye protection.

, First, you'll need to decide on the size of your box. Specifically, you'll want to determine how long, wide, and tall to make your box. Then, mark the measurements on your boards using a ruler and pencil.









If you're building a box for a specific purpose or to hold a certain item, measure the item to ensure it will fit inside your finished box., Use a hand or circular saw to cut the boards according to your measurements. Remember you'll need four boards for the sides, one for the base, and one for your lid.









Power tools can make the job easier, but are not necessary. You can easily make your box using a screwdriver, carpenter's square, hand saw, and hammer.

, Join the sides together at a right angle using glue between the joints for durability. At this point, it should look like a square with no base or lid attached yet. Next, hammer or drill in finishing nails, wood screws or dowels.








You may want to use clamps to hold the glued sides together while you drill nails or screws into them.If you're using dowels, drill a hole through the side of one piece into the side of another. Use a wooden dowel to pin the pieces together in an ""L"" shape. After the sides are pinned, cut the dowel flush with the sides.

, Make sure the sides sit evenly on the base or are snug around the base, depending on your design. Use glue to attach the base and sides. Hammer or drill in finishing nails, wood screws, or dowels.









Allow your box to dry thoroughly before sealing or using it.

, Set the lid on the box so the lid and side are flush, then measure and mark where you'd like your hinges to be. Keep the hinge knuckle facing out from the back of your box and drill or hammer to attach it to the side and then the lid.









When laying out the hinges, it is important that you square them to the top and to the sides of the case. Otherwise, the door will not close or open correctly.
It's helpful to clamp the side and lid together when measuring and installing the hinges., Use a wood putty and putty knife to fill nail holes. Let the putty dry completely before sanding the areas smooth.


Filling and sanding nail holes will add a professional look to your project. Feel free to omit this step if you're not concerned with decorative aspects.

Power tools can make the job easier, but are not necessary. You can easily make your box using a screwdriver, carpenter's square, hand saw, and hammer.

, Use a table saw or router with a guide to cut a straight horizontal groove near what will be the top and inside of the box. The groove should run about 1/8"" deep along the top so your lid can slide into place. Make sure to cut equal grooves into three sides of your box.

, First, take one of the sides that you've already cut a groove into and measure from the top, where the lid will be, to the bottom of the groove you cut. Use the same distance to cut a straight horizontal line across the top of your box front.


After this point, you should be able to test sliding the lid into the grooves and over the front if you clamp the sides together.

, Make sure the grooves are facing inward. Join the sides together at a right angle using glue between the joints for durability. At this point, it should look like a square with no base or lid attached yet.

Tell the story of your totem pole.",How to Make a Totem Pole," Some people used to believe that totem poles were originally used in religious ceremonies, but the truth is, they're created as a way to preserve and illustrate history. Think of the totem pole you want to make as a sort of timeline, or an account of a certain family or one person's life. What story do you want to tell?


You could tell the story of one person's adventures, or depict your family history by adding a symbol for each member. You could tell the story of a town, a battle, or a relationship. Get creative!
Think of the most important elements of the story. Make a list of each event, personality trait, family member, or other factor you want to include on your totem pole. The more elements you include, the longer your totem pole will be. Aim to have at least 5 story elements on your totem pole.;
, Now that you have a list of the elements you want to include, how do you want to symbolize each one? Traditional totem poles usually have carvings of animals as a way to tell their tales. You could take this classic route or choose symbols that have personal meaning to you.If you want to include animals as part of your totem pole, you can choose animals that are important to you, like your spirit animal, or pick animals that have classically been used by totem pole artists that seem to fit with your story. Here are a few animals that are commonly seen on traditional totem poles:

The thunderbird. This mythical creature has the power to make thunder, lightning and large gusts of wind. You could use it to symbolize a time in your story when chaos reigned.
The bear. This beloved creature comes to others' aid in times of need. Use the bear to symbolize a person who is a good caretaker, or a time when help arrived.
The owl. The wise owl is a symbol of souls that have passed on. The owl could be the past itself, or a person in your life who has passed away.
The raven. This cunning, tricky bird is used to symbolize intelligence.
The wolf. Wolves are symbols of power and loyalty.
The frog. Frogs are said to bring great fortune, so use this symbol to represent a time of wealth and abundance.


You could also make up your own non-animal symbols. People's faces, buildings in a city, a sword or spear, and other symbols can be used to help tell your story.

, Your story needn't be told in chronological order. On totem poles, the most important symbol or figure is at the bottom of the pole, since it's the most visible to people standing on the ground. Take a look at the symbols you're including and arrange them in order of significance, with the most important symbol being at the bottom.

, Traditional totem poles are carved out of red or yellow cedar by hand. If you want to make a totem pole that's close to authentic, you could find a big, long piece of this type of wood and carve your symbols in a row on its face. However, you can make a nice totem pole for yourself or a school project with some simple craft supplies. Here's what you'll need:


One cylindrical container for each symbol on your totem pole. You can use recycled oatmeal canisters, coffee cans, or any other type of container.
Brown craft paper.
Scissors.
A ruler
A pencil.
Tempura or acrylic paints.
Hot glue or craft glue.

, Each canister will be covered with a sheet of craft paper. Measure the height and circumference of one of your canisters, then use your ruler to trace the measurements onto a sheet of craft paper. Cut out the measured piece of paper and wrap it around the canister to make sure it fits. Then cut more sheets of the same size, one for each canister you have.

, Draw one of your symbols on each sheet of craft paper. Use the pencil to create an outline of the animals, people, or other symbols you have chosen to use to represent your story. Keep in mind you'll be painting over the drawings.


Take a look at pictures of authentic totem poles online to get a sense for the style you might want to use. The symbols are usually simple but bold.
Many animals are traditionally pictured in profile. Sometimes only the head of an animal or person is shown, and sometimes the whole body is shown.

, Now take out your paints and determine what colors you want to use to accent your drawings. Rich, bright hues are traditionally used, although sometimes totem poles don't have paint at all. The colors that are most commonly used are black, white, red, yellow, and bright blue. Let the paint dry completely before going further.

, Adding some gold glitter to a drawing of a frog, for example, could help illustrate the wealth and good fortune the creature symbolizes. You could also choose to add touches that have personal meaning to you.


You could glue on beads, shells, small stones, feathers, leaves, and other materials that might help you tell your story.
Pictures, mementos, and other ephemera are also good to add if you're making a totem pole of your family or a historical event.

, One at a time, wrap the paintings around individual canisters, and seal the seam where the edges overlap with a line of hot glue or craft glue. Use your fingers to hold the edges in place for a few moments until the glue sets.


Consider covering the lid of the canister that will go at the top of the totem pole with a circle of craft paper, or decorating it in another way. That way it won't look bare against the rest of the totem pole.

, Use hot glue or craft glue to put a ring of glue on the lid of the bottom canister, then carefully stack the next one on top. Continue putting glue on the top canister's lid and adding a new canister until you run out.

, Leave it in a safe place for several hours or overnight before you handle it again.

, At this traditional ceremony celebrated by Native Americans, a totem pole was erected and blessed as attendants danced and sang. The host of the ceremony gave a gift to all in attendance, knowing that someday the favor would be returned. The pole-raising is followed by a big feast and party.If you want to celebrate the meaning of your totem pole, you can have a ceremony of your own.

, Using the symbols on your totem pole as illustrations, tell the story of the person, family or event for whom you made the totem pole. Describe the meaning behind each symbol, and how it relates to the story you're telling. Keep the totem pole as a reminder of the little piece of history it represents.

Enjoy your shadowbox.",How to Make a Shadow Box," You’ll first need a deep or wide edged wooden picture frame. You can get these from the dollar or thrift stores for next-to-nothing. Your other supplies will be Balsa wood, a ruler, double-sided tape, a pencil, paint or something to mark the wood with, a craft knife, craft glue, and backing paper. Backing paper can just be your standard drawing paper. , The contents will determine the size and shape of the shadow box you end up putting together. You can put whatever you want in there as long as it fits!

, Many people use seaside objects such as shells, coral, pebbles. Some people make entire doll house/storefront/miniature scenes within shadow boxes. Others prefer nature objects: gumnuts, leaves, herbs, flowers, seeds, pods, etc. Take a look at other potential options below.


Collectibles: Stamps, spoons, coins, stickers, etc.
Scrapbooking: The shadow box provides an great display case for scrapbook elements of all kinds.
Insects: Do you have a butterfly or beetle collection? A shadowbox is perfect for displaying them. Be kind to the wildlife though; a paper or photographic collection can be just as interesting
Militaria: Medals, insignia, buckles, awards, badges, etc.

, Play around with a design in advance. That way you'll know where to glue everything in place. Arrange the actual objects on a sheet of paper about the same size as the inside of the frame, or draw the outline of the object onto blank paper to guide your arrangement later.

, If it doesn't have deep sides already, it won't work well for the purposes of this box. You can buy a shadowbox frame on the Internet or an arts and crafts store. You can even make your own if you want. It’s really just a picture frame.

, This will usually be cardboard or press board that sits between the image and the backing. Remove the backing but don’t discard it – you’ll use it shortly. You can discard any clips or holders on it. , The backing will sit at the back of the frame, resting on four pieces of inserted balsa wood. Start by measuring the edges of your picture frame. Now use these measurements to mark and measure out four pieces of the balsa wood. They should fit inside the inner edge of the frame, about 3mm/ 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) shallower than the frame sides. , When cutting, make sure the balsa lengths are the same length as the frame. Make the width lengths slightly shorter, as they need to slip inside the two other longer lengths. Trust your measurements. , Use the double-sided tape to attach the balsa pieces to the frame so that it will fit snugly in place. The longer pieces should be attached first.Then slip in the width pieces.

, Measure so it fits inside the frame. Remember that the frame is now slightly smaller due to the addition of the balsa pieces. Use this measurement to correctly calculate the size of the backing paper, then cut the paper to the correct size.

, This is why it is important to plan ahead of time. Try lightly tracing the objects you plan to put on the paper in pencil so you can see how the layout works. Don’t go too close to the edges of the paper or you’ll bump into the frame. , Use a craft glue or a spray adhesive to attach the paper to the backing. Don’t use too much glue or you might make the paper wet and sticky.

, It’s probably helpful to make small markers so you remember where each item was supposed to go. You can either glue or pin items on.

, If you’re using glue make sure you allow the glue to dry before restoring the backing to the frame. If you are pinning your items to the backing you might need to add a thin sheet of foam to the backing before gluing the backing paper in place, so that the pins have something to stick into.

, This is optional but may fit with the theme of your shadow box. Try to have fun with it. You want the shadowbox to look nice, and now is your chance to add any additional decoration.

, Carefully shift the backing into place inside the frame. Rest it on the pre-affixed balsa wood pieces. Make any adjustments needed so that it sits flat. , Use a strong tape, such as framer's tape, brown packing tape, or duct tape. The tape must be able to hold the frame in place long-term. Put enough on to keep it sturdy without ruining the aesthetic of the shadowbox. , Remember, if you are hanging your shadowbox you may need to attach a hanging device at this point, unless one is already in place. Put a nail or a hanging pin into the wall. If there is a portion of the frame hanging open because you've removed clips or holders, tape this section shut too.

, Once you’ve placed your shadowbox in its display area you can sit back and appreciate your accomplishment. You can hang, lean or stand the frame up, depending on the type of frame used.

A fairly typical size matches the same size as printer paper or a regular picture frame.
The usual shape for a shadow box is square or rectangular.;
, When cutting the wood, keep the following in mind:


Use the measurements for the height and width as decided in the first step.
For the edges, make them deep. They should be at least 5cm/2 inches deep, and perhaps more, depending on what you're adding to the shadow box display.

, Nail in place where the pieces of wood join, in either a square or rectangle shape.

,, Use thin wood, such as plywood, for this part of the shadow box.


Measure the back of the shadow box by assembling the wood pieces together in the square or rectangle shape and placing the backing piece behind this.
Mark the size and then cut to fit. Use a hand or electric saw, whichever you're most comfortable with.

, This can be glued or nailed into place, whatever works best for the wood used (nailing might split thin wood while wood glue will hold it snugly).

, This background piece will be slightly smaller than the non-frame side or wood backing. Use this measurement to cut out a piece of thick cardboard. The type of cardboard found on fruit or grocery boxes is best, as it has cushioning.


You could also use foam sheeting for this backing.

, Glue it to the cardboard inner backing piece; it helps to overlap the cardboard to the other side just slightly but do this without adding bulk––avoid overlapping folds.


You might prefer covering with fabric, especially where you're making a miniature house or a themed craft item from the box.

, If may be easier to add some decorative elements to the background piece before gluing it into the box. However, you'll need to judge this according to what it is you're adding, as you don't want to press down on anything fragile and squash or break it while gluing the cardboard background into the box.


Allow the glue to dry before moving.

,, Done! The shadow box is now ready for display.

Using a mat will make your picture and frame look more professional and finished. It will also make it easier to see the picture. Before you begin measuring your material, you should determine how wide you want the mat to be.


A good estimate is roughly ¼ to ⅓ of the width (shortest dimension) of the image.;
, After deciding on the width of the mat, measure the picture itself. Double the mat width you have decided on and add this to the picture length and width. The resulting measurement will be the length and width of the outer edges of the mat.


The inner edges of the mat will be equal to or slightly smaller than the image to be framed.

, You will need to cut the mat once you have marked your measurements. Thinner mat materials like paper or cardstock can be cut with an exact-o knife or scissors. Thicker materials, such as the thin cardboard that matting is usually made from, can also be cut this way but will look more professional if you use a mat cutter.









Cut the outer edges. Cut the outer edges of the mat according to the measurements you took.
You should use a ruler to mark the places where you will cut.
You should also use an angle to be sure that your corners are even before cutting.

, The interior should be equal to or slightly smaller than the picture you will hang. On the back side of the mat, draw the measurements of the original image. Subtract a small amount from the original measurements if you wish the mat to overlap the image slightly. Cut the material with the appropriate tools.








, With the back side of the mat facing down, place the image down-facing as well and center it in the square. Tape the top two corners to the mat vertically and then place horizontal tape over the vertical tape, one piece on the mat and a second on the picture.









Now your picture will be secure in the mat but have enough flexibility to keep it from bowing or wrinkling.

, You will want to choose materials that not only appeal to your needs and sense of design, but which are also high quality and appropriate the the image you are framing. Many different woods, glues, metals, and nails are available and should be carefully chosen to create a superior final product. Here is some more information about each of these materials:


Wood shape. The wood you choose will depend largely on your own preferences and what the frame will be for. You can use either moulding or plain lumber. Moulding will give a more elaborate, finished look and is best suited to larger or more traditional images and interior designs. Plain lumber gives a cleaner, simpler look and is best suited for smaller or more modern images and interior designs.
Wood type. You will also have to decide what type of wood you want to use. Many woods are suitable for this purpose, especially hardwoods, so you should decide mainly by preference for the appearance. It may be easiest to use the same type of wood used in other objects in the room where the frame will sit or hang. This will help the frame look like it belongs in the room.
Metal. If you'd like to cut your frame out of metal instead of wood, you should follow a similar process, but use a circular saw with a diamond tip blade to cut the metal. Just connect the frame with metal L-corners and matching screws, using a power drill to make holes for the screws first.
Glue. Using wood glue will work best. Other glues can be used if wood glue is absolutely unavailable but it is best to used the glue designed for this purpose. Wood glue is cheap and generally readily available at hardware and craft stores.
Nails. The nails used in this project will depend partially upon how large the frame will be. Thicker, longer nails will needed for large and thick frames. Thinner, shorter nails will be needed for smaller frames. Use the correct nails to ensure that the wood is held firmly in place and will not split.

, Measure the length and width of the outer edge of the mat. This will be the necessary dimensions for the inside edges of the frame. In order to figure out the length and width of the outer edges, you will want to use this formula: L = E + (2 x C) + (2 x W). L represents the length or width measurement you will use to cut the wood. E represents the length or width measurement of the mat. C is the clearance around the mat (this will probably be a very small measurement, such as 1/16""). W is the width of the frame material itself.

, Cut the the frame according to the measurement provided by the formula. You will need two pieces cut to the length measurement and two pieces cut to the width measurement. You should remember the old adage: measure twice, cut once. Being accurate is very important, as any difference in the sizes of the wood pieces can result in the frame fitting together unevenly or not at all.









After the initial cut, you should angle the ends in order to fit the pieces together. Cut the angles so that they point towards each other, leaving one edge shorter than the other.
You can use a miter saw set at a 45 degree angle or you can mark the angle by hand and cut it with a handsaw. This second method is inaccurate and not recommended.

, This is the lip on the inside of the frame which will ensure that the glass does not fall through the opening. You can do this either by using a straight bit to carve the lip into the back, inside edge of the frame or by creating a thinner frame and attaching it to the back of the first.









This secondary frame should be larger in width and length, so as to accommodate a piece of glass which would be too large to fall through the opening of the frame.
Be sure that the rebate is deep enough to accommodate the glass, mat, and nails which will be used to hold the materials in the frame.

, You may wish to customize your frame to better match with the room in which it will be placed, or to accentuate an aspect of the photo or picture you'll place inside it. Before inserting the glass, image and mat, you can add paint or stain to the wood. The color of each is entirely up to you. Here's how you can paint or stain your picture frame to give it more flavor:









Paint. If you decide to paint the frame, be sure to use a type of paint appropriate for the wood. Latex-based paints will give a smoother, shinier appearance. You can paint the frame one color or you can paint on designs. Use long strokes and several coats to produce an even appearance.
Stain. Stain comes in a variety of colors. Try to choose one which closely matches the other wood stains in the room where the image will hang. You may wish to test the stain first on scraps of the wood, to see how many coats will be needed and how it will interact with the grain of the wood. With a stain it is best to add before putting the pieces of the frame together. This will give the stain a more even appearance. Use a stain brush to further ensure a professional finish. When the stain has dried, you can finish with a varnish to give the frame a nice shine.

, Fit the pieces together like a puzzle so that a square or rectangle is formed. Make any adjustments that are necessary but keep in mind that changing the angles too much will result in the frame fitting unevenly. Here's how to do it:









First, glue the frame together, using clamps and angles to keep it firmly in place. You will want to ensure that the angles dry correctly.
When the glue has dried, gently hammer in a nail at each of the four corners to secure the pieces together. The nails should be driven into one side of the frame, passing through one piece of wood and into the other, reaching as close to the midpoint of the wood as possible. They should also be placed perpendicular to the line of the joint.
Use wood filler to fill any gaps.

, Glass will need to be custom cut to fit the measurements of the rebate. You can do this yourself but it will likely be easier and cheaper to go to a glass shop or hardware store and have it done professionally, as special tools and skills are required for cutting glass safely.









You don't have to use real glass. Plexiglas or any clear plastic can work just as well. These materials may not look as nice but they will also be less prone to shattering or breaking if the frame ever falls.

, With the frame facing down, place the image and mat into the frame. Once it is centered, use either glazier’s points or nails placed parallel with the mat to keep the image, mat, and glass in the frame. This is the last step to making a picture frame. Now you can think about decorating the frame and the perfect place to hang it up.








, You can further embellish your frame with decorations. You may choose to add details with gold paint for a more traditional appearance. Another option would be to add small objects such as seashells or buttons by gluing them to the frame. This is a great way to make the frame match the theme of the picture it contains. Here are some other ways to decorate your picture frame:









Take parts of old broken jewelry and glue them to the frame with an adhesive craft glue. For example, if you have a cute flower that broke off a ring, a pendant from a broken necklace, or just one cute earring with an eye-catching design, you can glue them to different parts of the frame, or combine them to create an elaborate design.Frame the photo inside a page from a meaningful book or newspaper article. To do this, trace the mat on the reverse of the page and then cut it out. After that, trace the photo on the center, and cut about 1/8"" in from the outline of the photo to avoid having the edges show. Then just flip over the sheet, put the photo under the mat, and clip the frame in place. For more durability, you can laminate the article frame first.Stamp the frame. Find a cute frame that represents the person in the photo -- for example, if it's your little girl and stars are her new obsession, pick a starry stamp. This is perfect if you've painted the frame white or a lighter color, so the stamp is visible and contrasts with the frame., There are two main ways to easily hang the frame once you've finished decorating it. Just make sure that the frame has dried if you've glued anything to it before you proceed. Be sure that no matter what hanging method you use, it is carefully measured and centered. This will ensure that the picture hangs evenly.Here are your main options for hanging the frame:









You can place a string, made of either metal or some other strong material, across the back. This can be attached by adding pegs or nails to the back of the frame, one on each side, and attaching the string at each end.
Another option for hanging would be to add a hook, which can then be placed on a nail in the intended wall.

Having good ventilation is also important as some varnishes and thinners contain strong fumes, which might make you feel lightheaded or nauseous.


If the fumes are too strong for you, consider opening a window or turning a fan on.;
, The area you will be working in must be very clean and free of dust. You may have to mop or vacuum your work space to prevent dust from settling on your work and ruining it.


If you are working outside, avoid windy days, otherwise tiny dust particles may land in the wet varnish and ruin the finished look.

, The temperature in the area you will be varnishing should be between 70 °F and 80°F (about 21°C to 26°C). If it is too hot, the varnish will dry too quickly, resulting in tiny air bubbles forming. If it is too cold or humid, the varnish will dry too slowly, thus giving tiny dust particles more time to settle onto the wet varnish.

, When varnishing wood, you will be working with chemicals that may be harmful if they get on your skin; they may also ruin your clothes. Before starting to varnish your wooden piece, consider wearing some clothes that you would not mind getting dirty or stained, as well as some protective gloves and glasses. You may also consider getting a dust mask or a ventilated face mask.

, There are many different types of varnishes available, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Some varnishes are easier to use than others, while others are better for certain projects. Choose one that suits your project and preferences.


Oil-based varnishes, including some polyurethane varnishes, are very durable. They usually have to be mixed with a paint thinner, such as turpentine. They also have strong fumes and must be used in a well-ventilated area. The brushes you use must also be cleaned well in order to preserve them and make them last longer.
Acrylic and water-based vanishes have low-odor and can be mixed with just water. They tend to dry quicker than oil-based varnishes, but they are not as durable as oil-based varnishes. The brushes you use can be cleaned with just soap and water.
Spray on varnishes are easy to use. They do not require brushes and they do not need to be thinned. They must be used in a well-ventilated area, however, as they have strong fumes, which might make you feel lightheaded or nauseous.
Varnishes are also available in both clear and tinted forms. Clear varnishes will allow the wood's natural color to show through while colored varnishes can act as a stain and tint the piece a specific color.

, You can apply varnish over an already-painted surface to preserve it, or you can apply it to a raw, unpainted surface. There are various ways to remove old finishes including using paint stripper and sanding.


If your wooden furniture has never been painted or varnished, or if you wish to preserve the original paint, then you can proceed to Step 5.

, Remove old paints and finishes by applying a paint stripping solution to the wood with a paintbrush. Leave the solution on the wood according to the manufacturer's directions, then scrape it off using a putty knife with rounded corners.Do not allow the paint stripper to dry.


Be sure to remove any paint stripper residue. How you remove the residue will depend on the type of paint stripper you buy, but most strippers will need to be removed with turpentine or water.

, You can remove old finishes using sandpaper, a sanding block, or a handheld sander. Sandpaper and sanding blocks work best on uneven or curved surfaces, such as knobs and chair legs. Handheld sanders work best on flat surfaces, such as table tops. Start with a medium-grit sandpaper, such as 150-grit, and move up to a finer grit, such as 180., Much like paint stripper, paint thinner can be used to remove old finishes. Soak an old cloth or rag with some paint thinner, and rub it over the surface of your wooden piece. Once the old finish has been loosened, scrape it off using a putty knife., Sanding the wood not only gets rid of any residual gloss or finishes, but it also gives the varnish a rough surface to grip onto. Use 180 to 220-grit sandpaper and sand with the direction of the grain., Your work space will need to be free of any dust or dirt before you can start applying the varnish. Clean your wood piece by wiping it down with a damp cloth. Be sure to sweep and vacuum the tables and floors of your work space as well; you may have to use a damp cloth or mop.

, Some open-grained woods, such as oak, need to have the grain filled in with a grain filler for a smooth finish. You can use a color that matches the wood's natural color, or you can use the color of the stain you will be using.


You can use a contrasting color to make the grain appear more pronounced, or you can use a similar color to make the grain appear more subdued., Some varnishes, such as those that come in a spray can, do not need any preparation; other types of varnishes should be thinned for the first coat. This helps seal the wood and prepare it for the proceeding coats. The rest of the coats do not to be thinned.


If you are using an oil-based varnish, thin it with a paint thinner, such as turpentine. Use one part varnish to one part thinner.
If you are using a water-based or acrylic-based varnish, thin it with water instead. Use one part varnish to one part water.

, Use a flat paintbrush or foam applicator to apply the varnish to the wood. Use long, even strokes, and work along the wood grain. Let this first coat dry for 24 hours.


If you are using a spray on varnish, hold the can 6 to 8 inches away from the surface and spray on a light, even coat. Let it dry according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

, After you have applied the initial coat of thinned varnish, you will need to smooth it out. You can do this by buffing the surface of the varnished wood with 280-grit sandpaper,and then using a dry cloth to wipe away any dust of debris.


Make sure that you wipe down your work space with a damp cloth to get rid of any dust caused by the sanding.
Make sure that you clean your brush with paint thinner (if you are using an oil-based varnish) or water (if you are using a water-based varnish).

, Using a clean brush or a new foam applicator, apply the varnish to the wooden piece. Once again, make sure that you are brushing along the wood grain. You do not have to thin this layer. Wait 24 hours for this layer to dry.


If you are using a spray on varnish, you can spray on another coat. Make sure to keep the can 6 to 8 inches away from the surface, and spray on a single, light coat. If you spray the varnish on too thickly, you may end up with puddles, drips, and runs.

, Once the second coat of varnish has dried, sand it gently with a fine-grit sandpaper, such as 320-grit.Let the varnish dry 24 hours before applying the next coat, and remember to clean your work space of any dust or dirt caused by the sanding.

, Apply 2 to 3 more coats of varnish. Remember to let the varnish dry between coats, and to sand and wipe the varnish clean before applying more varnish. Always work along the grain when applying and sanding the varnish. When you get to the last coat, do not sand it.You can continue working with 320-grit sandpaper, or move up to 400-grit.For optimal results, consider waiting 48 hours before applying the final coat.

, Varnish will typically need some time to finish curing. To prevent ruining the varnish, leave your wooden piece some place where it will not be disturbed. Some varnishes finish curing with 24 or 48 hours, while others need as much as 5 or 7 days. Some varnishes require 30 days to finish curing. Refer to the instructions on the can for more specific drying and curing times.

Apply the first coat.,
Let the coat dry.,
Apply two more coats of oil.",How to Waterproof Wood1," The three common oils used for waterproofing wood are linseed, walnut, and tung. Tung oil is typically found as a mix in most commercial products. Raw tung oil is often more expensive than other oils, so it is usually used on smaller wood projects. Walnut oil is the same product you’ll find next to olive oil in the grocery store. Due to nut allergies, walnut oil cannot be used commercially.


Linseed oil can be purchased at most DIY repair shops, but many of these products are sold as raw or boiled. Boiled linseed oil contains metal drying agents that are poisonous. You can still use this product on outdoor patio equipment, but you should not use it for anything involving food.Linseed oil can also be bought without metal drying agents. Seek out raw linseed oil if you want a safe coat on certain woods like your kitchen counter top.;
, Scope out your project and decide which wooden surfaces you want to treat with oil. For larger projects like a patio deck, consider using an exterior stain and deck sealant. Oil is good for smaller based wooden objects like a cutting board, table, counter top, or baseball bat.


Make a list of surfaces you want to treat. This will help you know how much oil to purchase. A good thing about treating with oil is that the oil stays good for several years.
Purchase the oil that best suits your treating needs. Purchase a large container of oil. It is better to have too much than too little.

, You can create a stronger treatment and sealant by mixing the oil with turpentine and apple cider vinegar. Mix one part oil (tung, linseed, or walnut), one part turpentine oil, and ½ part apple cider vinegar. This mixture will preserve your oil supply and will create a more durable finish.Mix the ingredients in a metal container, like an empty coffee container. Mix the liquids until everything is blended.
It isn’t necessary to create a mixture, but many wood enthusiasts advise this type of concoction.

, Any surface imperfections will be more noticeable after the oil is applied. The oil or oil mixture will highlight all the colors in the wood. Use thick sandpaper or a metal file for any imperfections that are visible from the surface. Scrape with the sandpaper or file until the wood looks even.


Finish by sanding the whole surface with fine grit (220) sandpaper. This will prep the surface to absorb the oil.
Sweep the area or rub away any scraps with a dry cloth before applying the oil. The wood must be dry before treating with oil., Fold a lint-free rag and keep other scrap rags nearby. Folding the rag removes rough edges and stops potential snags when spreading the oil. Put on thick rubber gloves when handling turpentine and other products with mineral spirits.

, Pour a small amount of oil on the rag’s surface. Don’t apply the oil directly to the wood. Rub the oil with the grain by moving from the interior to the exterior. Be careful not to touch the oil while it’s absorbing. Concentrate on getting an even coat. Apply more oil instead of rubbing too hard to release the oil from the rag. Don’t leave any standing puddles of oil.

, Wait about 30 minutes for the oil to settle into the wood. Wipe the surface with a clean cloth to remove excess oil. Leave the wood to cure for 24 hours, or until it is dry. Waterproofing with oil takes longer than waterproofing with sealants.


Rub the surface with “0000” (very fine) steel wool.

Press the iron over the warped surface.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Unwarp Wood1," Moisten one or two large towels and wrap them around the wood, making sure that the entire warped area is covered.








The towels you use should ideally be large enough to cover the entire wood piece. Choose towels or rags that can withstand the heat of an iron.
When moistening the towels, drench them thoroughly and wring out the excess water. The towels should be damp but not dripping wet.;
, Place the wrapped wood on an ironing board or other flat, hard surface. The raised ""bubble"" should face up.









The concave or inward curving surface should face down.
The surface you place the wood on must be rigid. It should also be able to withstand the high heat of an iron.

, Turn on a steam iron and switch its temperature setting to the highest point.









Give the iron two to five minutes to heat up.
Note that the iron should be designed to work with steam. A dry iron is not recommended.

, Press the iron down on one end of the covered wood. Gradually slide it all the way over the entire surface, applying even pressure to the warped area.








Hold the iron on each spot for 5 to 10 seconds before sliding it to the next spot.
Each spot should overlap slightly to ensure that the entire wood piece is covered.
Do not leave the iron unattended at any point. An unattended iron can burn the press towel and the wood beneath it.

, Check the progress of the wood. If the problem has been corrected, stop here. If some warping remains, repeat the process until the warp is gone.









Once the wood has un-warped, turn off the iron and unwrap the wood. Allow the wood to dry thoroughly before use.
This process may not work on severely warped pieces. If you do not notice any progress after two or three tries, you may need to try another method.

Trim the edges.",How to Veneer Wood," Rotary veneers are what plywood is made out of and generally produce an appearance that many people don't like. However, they can also come in larger sheets and may be the only option for very large projects. Sliced veneer looks like normal lumber, and allows you to get really beautiful grain detail.;
, You can get random sets of veneers, or you can get book-matched sets. In book matched sets, you get the pieces that were cut one next to the other, so that the grain patterns match up. This can be used to create beautiful designs. However, unmatched sets may look more ""natural"".

, You can get veneer sheets that have adhesive already applied to one side. These are the easiest to place. If you get regular veneer, however, you'll need to use the application method discussed in the other section.


These are generally applied just like a sticker, but you should read the included instructions to see if that particular manufacturer requires special steps.

, Veneers are attached to a substrate (or base material). Usually this is either another wood (if you are veneering, for example, panels on doors or cabinets) or it is a cheaper material altogether, such as MDF. These man-made materials are probably the best option, since they usually allow you to save the most money.

, You can use yellow or carpenter's glue if you want to. If you live in a very dry environment with little humidity, these will work perfectly fine. If you live in a humid environment, however, these glues can cause your veneers to wander. It's better to use a proper veneering glue.


Many other methods of veneering use these glues. Be wary of those methods, especially if you live in a humid environment.

, Cut the veneer to the size you want, making sure to leave as little overhand as possible. Any more than 1/4"" overhang and you'll likely crack the veneer.

, Using a very short nap roller, roll the contact cement onto the area of the substrate that will be covered by a single panel of the veneer. Roll in one direction and then the other, just like you would a wall, in order to guarantee 100% coverage of the substrate surface.

, Go through the same motions to apply contact cement to the veneer, also making sure to get 100% coverage. There should not be any dry spots.

, Allow just enough time for the adhesive to dry slightly. It should feel perhaps somewhat tacky to the touch, but not be able to grab hold of a sheet of paper or the hairs of your arm. This is usually after 5-10 minutes.

, Place a sheet of wax or parchment paper on your substrate. This will go between the substrate and the veneer while you align the veneer, to help you get it as straight as possible without joining the pieces before they're ready.

, Line up the corners of the veneer and the substrate and get it into place. Then start to press it down so that the two glued sides touch, removing the paper as you go.

, Using your hand, smooth out the piece of veneer, starting from the center and moving out toward the edges. Apply firm pressure to ensure that full contact is made. Next, smooth it again using a flat tool like a putty knife or a carpet stair tool. Smooth it in one direction and then the other, just like you applies the adhesive.


Do not use a tool like a roller, as this applies weak and uneven pressure.

, Trim the edges using a utility knife and then sand the edges using high grit sandpaper (180 to 220).

Choose your vinegar.,
Gather your supplies.,
Dissolve your steel wool in the vinegar.,
Add coffee grounds to the solution for darker weathering.,
Prepare your wood.,
Apply your weathering solution to your wood.,
Allow the wood to dry completely.,
Stain your wood, if desired.",How to Weather Wood1," Using different kinds of vinegar when weathering will give the appearance of your wood a different look. White distilled vinegar will give you more of a brown color in your wood, apple cider vinegar will impart more of a bluish-gray, and balsamic vinegar will have more of a green tint.Depending on the wood you are using, the intensity of your vinegar weathering may vary. Differences in wood composition will influence the end result.
These kinds of vinegar are generally inexpensive and can be found at most grocery stores. You don't need a fancy brand for great results, even generic kinds of vinegar should work well for weathering.;
, To create your weathering solution, you're going to need to dissolve some steel wool into the vinegar. After that, you'll apply that solution with a paintbrush to begin aging your wood. When it dries, you can finish it all with a coat of staining. In all, you'll need:


A bowl (or other container)
A paintbrush
Coffee grounds (optional)
Steel wool (or soap pads)
Wood
Wood staining (recommended; optional)
Vinegar (distilled, apple cider, or balsamic), In your bowl or container, pour enough vinegar to coat the entire surface of the wood you are weathering. Since vinegar is a relatively thin liquid and spreads easily, 1 - 2 cups should be enough. Then place a piece of steel wool into the solution.









Generally, the longer you allow your vinegar and steel wool to sit, the more intense the weathering effect will be.
You may want to use a fine steel wool, like 0000 steel wool, as this will dissolve more easily in your vinegar solution and decrease the wait time.
At about the 15 minute mark, your steel wool will start dissolving into the solution. This will create a lighter weathering effect. Longer wait times will produce a darker result.
Adding a second piece of steel wool to the mix can speed the process along, as there will be more steel available for the vinegar to break down., Used or new coffee grounds will help to bring out rich, brown tones in your weathered wood. Instant coffee, however, reacts more easily to water, and will likely have the most pronounced effect. A tablespoon of grounds in your solution should be sufficient, if you wish to darken the effect of your weathering.


You can modify the amount of coffee used in your solution. Less coffee will result in more subtle brown tones, while more will give a more dramatic color., Dirt on your wood can create a patchy effect in your weathering. Additionally, irregular and uneven parts may not weather consistently. To ensure the best results, you should at minimum clean your wood with a damp rag.









For projects that you want to have a more finished look, you should consider sanding the wood so that it is even and smooth.

, For larger projects, you'll likely need to dip a paintbrush into the solution to apply it to your wood. When doing so, cover the wood completely and generously, but do not leave any solution puddled on it. For smaller projects, you may be able to dip the wood directly into the weathering solution.









When dipping, you should keep your fingers out of the solution. Use a pair of pliers, tongs, or a plastic glove to prevent skin contact.
The more coats of solution you apply, the more weathered the wood will appear. For most projects, dipping once or twice for a minute or two will be sufficient. When applying with a paintbrush, one or two coats should be enough.
Err on the side of caution when applying your weathering solution. If you find the wood isn't weathered enough after it is dry, you can always reapply your solution., As your wood dries, you may be discouraged that the appearance has not changed very much. This is common, and in most cases the character of your now weathered wood can be brought out with a coat of staining.









Depending on the climate where you live, your wood may dry in a few hours or it might take an entire day. When the wood is completely dry to the touch, it should be dry enough to move on.
If you're in a rush and can't wait for your wood to air dry, you can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.
As the wood dries, you should note a slight to significant change in color and a more pronounced grain.
If your dry wood is not as weathered as you like, you should reapply your weathering solution and allow it to dry again. Continue this process until you achieved your desired look., Staining your wood will add color, but it will also bring out the features of your weathering. Many kinds of lighter colored wood may not show much weathering until it is stained. Staining can be bought at most hardware stores, or in the home improvement section of most general retailers.Staining can dramatically change the appearance of wood, and some staining might react less favorable with your weathered wood than others. You should stain a test piece of weathered wood to prevent any unpleasant surprises.
There are many different brands of wood staining you might use. For the best results, you should follow the directions on the brand you purchased.

Prepare the surface.,
Purchase a water-based wood sealer.,
Apply an even coat.,
Allow the product to dry.,
Clean the first coat.,
Apply a second and third coat.,
Give the wood time to cure.",How to Waterproof Wood2," You’ll need to remove any remaining trace of past finish before using a sealant. Use sandpaper before you apply any sealants. This removes finish products that may keep the sealant from absorbing. The sealant method is best for any previously finished wood, since oil-based stain may not sink into the wood.


Use a rougher sandpaper for any areas that need more attention. Then finish sanding the surface with a finer sandpaper to ensure an even surface., You can find these products at a home improvement stores. Water Seal and Stain Sealer are common names for wood sealants. You can also purchase a tinted sealant and sand the surface of the wood before you apply it.


Sealants are often labeled by the type of product to which they should be applied to. For example, you may find deck sealant, fence sealant, outdoor sealant, floor sealant or furniture sealant.
Buy a marine wood sealant if your wood needs to stand up to humidity, UV rays and water.
Check the product to get specific application rules and dry times. Some products can be used with a paint sprayer.
Purchase a paint sprayer or paint brushes for application., Prepare your paintbrush or sprayer and focus on creating an even coat of the surface. Make sure the temperature and humidity of the air is in the right range of the product, or the product can evaporate too quickly. Consider working in an area with a controlled humidity like a garage.


Make sure the wood’s surface is cleaned before applying the sealant.

, Consult the product’s package directions for proper drying times. The drying times will be much shorter than oil’s drying times. Many sealants take between 4-10 hours.

, Use sandpaper with fine-grit to improve adhesion of the second coat, but only if it is recommended by the product instructions. Do this once the product has completely finished drying.


You can also use “0000” (very fine) steel wool to clean off the sealant.

, Softwoods may need two to three coats, while some hardwoods will only need one. Softwoods are cheaper woods that haven’t been treated in the past. Popular softwoods are cedar, pine, redwood spruce, balsa, and yew. Hardwood is denser wood that is used for higher quality furniture and decks. Popular hardwood is beech, hickory, mahogany, maple, oak, and walnut., Let the wood cure for several days before using it or placing furniture over it. When water is applied to the wood's surface, it darkens the wood instead of beading up and flowing off the surface.


Apply the sealant every few years for healthy wood care.

"
"
Choose an oil-based semi-transparent stain.,
Prepare the wood.,
Apply an initial coat.,
Remove any of the excesses.,
Apply the second coat of stain.,
Apply a third and final coat.",How to Waterproof Wood3," If you are planning on treating exterior wood, get an exterior grade stain. The lighter the stain, the more oil content the stain has. Light stains are good for interior projects or woods that won’t be exposed outdoors as much.


These products can be found in any hardware or repair stores.

, Any surface imperfections will be more noticeable after the stain is applied. The stain will highlight all the colors in the wood. Use thick sandpaper or a metal file for any imperfections that are visible from the surface. Scrape the surface with the sandpaper or file until the wood looks even.


Finish by sanding the whole surface with fine grit (220) sandpaper. This will allow the stain to be applied evenly.
Sweep the area or rub away any scraps with a dry cloth before applying the oil. The wood must be dry before stained., Apply the stain with a paintbrush in an even fashion. Cover the entire surface and then allow it to dry. Dry the wood for four hours to one day before you apply the next coat.

, Sand the dried surface with fine-grit sandpaper. Wipe with a tack cloth to ready the surface for a second coat. It is important that the surface of the wood is dry and clean before an additional coat can be applied.

, This coat will take slightly longer to dry. Make sure you give it plenty of time to dry so that all the waterproofing oil is absorbed. Check on the stain five hours after applying the second coat.


You will know a coat of stain is cured when the wood is no longer sticky to the touch.

, Follow the same procedures when applying the final coats of stain. Be patient and be sure to apply even coats throughout the process. Allow three days to a week for the wood to cure before using it.

Wrap the wood in moistened towels.,
Place the wood in bright, direct sunlight.,
Spray with additional water as needed.,
Dry until the warping vanishes.",How to Unwarp Wood2," Moisten several large towels and wrap them completely around the warped wood.









You can use towels, sheets, or rags. The material you use must retain moisture and be large enough to wrap around the warped wood piece.
Run the towels under water until they are soaked, then wring out as much excess moisture as possible. The material should be moist when you wrap it around the wood, but it should not be drenched.

, Set the wrapped wood out in a warm area that receives a lot of sunlight during the day. The concave (inwardly bent) side should face down and the convex (outwardly bent) side should face up.








You may want to place a plastic tarp beneath the wood to prevent the water from soaking the surrounding area.
This method works best during warm, dry weather. It may not work in cold, cloudy, or wet conditions.
For best results, place the wood on top of a rigid surface, like a driveway or deck. You can place it on top of your lawn, but the process may not be as effective if the wood sits on a soft surface.

, Depending on the extent of the warping, you will need to keep the wood in sunlight for two to four days. Spray the towels with additional water throughout this period to keep the wood moist.









As before, the material should only be moist and not dripping wet.
The sunlight should heat the covered wood and encourage it to absorb moisture from the towels. As moisture is absorbed into the surface, the wood should begin to warp back into its proper position.

, The entire process can take several days depending on the damage. Check it regularly. Once the wood is unwarped, remove the wrappings and let it dry.









When the sun disappears at night, you should bring the wood inside. Keep it in a warm place overnight with the inward curve facing down.
If you do not notice any progress after a few days, you may need to try a different method.

"
"
Cover the wood with damp paper towels.,
Wrap plastic over the paper towels.,
Place the wood in a clamp.,
Leave for one week.,
Remove the wrappings.,
Apply additional pressure.,
Check the progress frequently.",How to Unwarp Wood3," Moisten several sheets of paper towel and arrange them over the concave (inwardly curved) surface of the wood.









Paper towels are ideal for this method, but a thin steaming towel or standard paper can also be used. The material you use must be moistened, however, and it must be large enough to cover the entire warped area.
Rinse the paper towels under water, then carefully wring out the excess. The material should be moist when you drape it around the wood, but it should not be dripping wet.
Only apply the wet paper towels to the concave side of the wood for this method. By concentrating the moisture on the side, you can help direct the warping back to its original flat position. The concave side will absorb more moisture while the convex (outwardly bent) side will dry out.

, Wrap several layers of plastic wrap all the way around the wood and the moist paper towels. The plastic wrap must be tight and secure.








The plastic should slow down the process of evaporation, keeping the paper towels and wood moist for a longer period of time as a result.
Make sure that the plastic wrap covers all sides of the wood, not just the side covered by paper towels.

, Place the wood in a clamp, over-tightening the clamp slightly until the warped area begins to straighten out.








Work carefully while tightening the clamp. If you tighten it too much, the wood might split apart instead of straightening out.

, Keep the wood clamped and wrapped in a warm location for one week.









Check regularly and remove the wood from the clamp if you see signs of possible damage.
The storage area should be as warm as possible during this first week. Ideal temperatures would be as high as 149 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), but if heat that warm is impossible to maintain, the hottest room you have should suffice for most purposes.
You can keep the wood warmer if you let it sit in direct sunlight, beneath a heat lamp, beneath an electric blanket, or over a warming mat. Keep the heat on the wood for at least six to eight hours per day.

, After the first week, remove the wood from the clamp and take off the plastic wrap and paper towels.









At this point, the wood must be allowed to thoroughly dry.
Check the progress of the warp. If it has vanished, the wood piece is ready to use as soon as it dries and not additional pressure is needed.

, If some warping still remains, return the wood to its clamped position and let it dry that way for two to three weeks.









The temperature can be somewhat cooler for this stage, but the ideal temperature is still 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius).
The air of the room should also be dry during this stage. Do not store the wood in a humid room.

, As soon as the wood has completely dried throughout the entire piece, it should be ready to unclamp and use.









If the wood has not unwarped after you complete this process, the damage might be too severe to reverse.

Collect your weathering supplies.,
Prepare your wood.,
Mix your solution.,
Apply your solution to the wood.,
Allow the wood to dry.,
Add a coat of wood staining to highlight weathering.",How to Weather Wood2," You're going to be changing the appearance of your wood with a solution of warm water and baking soda. After the solution is mixed, you'll apply it to your wood with a paintbrush, allow it to dry, and then you can stain the wood if you desire. All things considered, for this project you'll need:


A container (for your weathering solution)
A paintbrush
Baking soda
Wood
Wood staining (recommended; optional), Dirt, dust, or irregular bits of wood can make the application of your weathering solution inconsistent. Wiping down your wood with a damp, clean rag first will help prevent this from happening. You might also want to sand the wood to give it a professional, well-finished look.

, There is no perfect proportion for this weathering solution. A high concentration of baking soda in warm water will produce a more intense weathering effect. A good starting point, however, is 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda.Mix your baking soda and water thoroughly before applying the solution. If the baking soda isn't equally distributed, parts of your wood could look more weathered than others.
Baking soda has a chemical reaction with a substance in the wood known as ""tannins."" Wood high in tannins, like mahogany, oak, and walnut, will react more intensely with this solution.
Generally, hardwoods have a higher tannin content than softwoods. If you notice natural yellow, red, or brown tinting in the wood, this could be a strong indication of tannins.
Since wood with a higher tannin content reacts stronger than lower tannin wood, you may want to decrease the amount of baking soda when weathering high tannin wood., Take your paintbrush and dip it into your weathering solution. Use a generous coating to completely cover your wood with the solution, but do not leave excess puddling on it. Pay special attention to cracks and knots, as these can be difficult to completely coat.


It's better to use less than more at this point in the weathering. If after the wood dries it is not weathered to the point you desire, you can add another layer of solution.
A single coat of this solution should be enough to have a noticeable effect on your wood, though the change in woods containing few tannins may be slight., Since you've only applied a single coat to your wood, it shouldn't take too long for it to dry. In most climates, 10 minutes should be enough for your wood to be ready for staining, though in humid regions this may take longer.


If your wood is taking longer to dry than you'd like, you can use a hair dryer to dry it more quickly.
Observe your wood closely at this point. If it is not as weathered as you wanted, you should apply another coat of your weathering solution and allow it to dry again., This step is optional, though adding staining to your wood will make the weathering more distinct. Use a clean brush to apply your stain in the fashion indicated by its label until the surface of the wood is completely stained.


Use a test piece of wood that you've already weathered to prevent unpleasant surprises. Some stains may have a unexpected effect on your weathered wood."
"
Scour the wood with a stiff wire brush.,
Erode the wood with rocks.,
Use a tool to etch the wood.",How to Weather Wood3," The weathered look is caused by wood breaking down over time, and you can simulate this wear by using a wire bristle brush on your wood. However, this process can take a great deal of time and effort before you achieve the right effect.


The stiffer the bristles of your brush, the more it will break down the wood as you scrub. Use strong, firm pressure for the best results.
Depending on the kind of wood you are using, this process might take a day or more of hard scrubbing before the effects are apparent.

, Rocks, stones, and other airborne particles naturally wear wood down over time. You can do the same by adding small, irregularly shaped rocks and pebbles to the surface of your wood and scrubbing it with your wire brush or stepping on the stones to scrape the stones against wood.


The key to this technique is trapping the stones between your brush or foot before applying pressure. As the rocks rub against or are ground into the wood, it will break down and look more weathered.
Exercise care when trying to grind stones into your wood with your feet. You can very easily lose balance and injure yourself.
You may be able to erode a larger area of your wood at a time by sandwiching rocks between two boards and standing on the top board., This technique allows for the most intentional weathering. With a tool, like a woodworking knife, a screwdriver, or a chisel, you can add notches and small cuts to give more character to the wood. However, the cuts you make may appear unnatural. In this case:


Use sandpaper to soften the sharp edges of your cuts to make them look more natural. Hardwoods may require a coarser grain of sandpaper for you to sand effectively.
Use your wire bristle brush to make your tool weathering appear less intentional. Even a few passes with your brush can have a significant effect.

",How to Stain Bamboo," Allow the bamboo to dry completely.

, All bamboo has this layer, and it will prevent the bamboo fibers from accepting the stain. Pay particular attention to the rough areas of the bamboo that may be difficult to get to. If you leave any of the waxy layer, the bamboo will accept stain in some areas, but not in others. This will give the bamboo a mottled look.


Be aware that sanding the bamboo will change the character of the bamboo since it removes the bamboo's natural sheen and reduces the nodes.
If the bamboo you desire to stain has been left out in the weather for several months, it may have turned a light gray color. Bamboo that has been weathered has lost its tough, waxy outer layer and will readily take a stain, varnish, or paint.

,, Pay attention to the node areas.


If you find that the bamboo is not taking the stain, wipe off the extra stain with a rag and allow the area to dry. Try re-sanding the area and then re-stain.

, Add several coats as needed to get the desired color.

Position the resulting apparatus.,
Balance the apparatus.,
Consider burning the ends of the matchstick off after you have balanced everything (optional).",How to Make a Fork and Spoon Appear to Defy Gravity," It is especially good if the glass has a wide mouth with a tapered bottom.;
, Remember that the entire weight of the silverware will be supported on one single point on the outside edge of the glass. Keep this in mind and make sure the base of the glass is stable enough to sustain the weight.

, Put the two outside tines of the fork over the back of the spoon When they're connected, the utensils should make sort of a boomerang shape.

, Ensure that it is still touching the spoon. Leave as much of the matchstick sticking towards the center of the ""boomerang"" shape as possible.

, Take the whole kit and (here comes the tricky part) balance the matchstick on the edge of the glass with the two handle ends pointing back towards the glass. Note that the matchstick will be horizontal.

, It might take you a moment to figure out where to place the matchstick. Try moving it from side to side, as well as closer to and farther away from the glass, to locate the best spot.

, Then sit back and collect your bets. The reason that people believe it is defying gravity is the fact that they believe it is balancing relative to the entire cup, rather than just one edge of it. They are, technically, fooling themselves.

Choose a suitable wood if you are building a project.,
Work the wood so that the grain runs its longest direction along the length of your project, rather than cutting the wood diagonally or across the grain.

,
Seal the wood with boiled linseed oil or sanding sealer as soon as possible after you are finished shaping the work.

,
Use an exterior sealer for lumber used in building handrails, decks, or other outdoor building products to reduce expansion and contraction during rain/sunny weather changes.

,
Reduce exposure to direct sunlight where rapid drying can cause the wood to split if possible.

,
During a curing period for green woods, stack the wood so that even drying will occur.,
Consider using knotty or burl woods since the uneven, gnarly, or crooked grains are not as prone to cracking as are straight grains.

The finish is shellac if it turns to liquid after applying the alcohol. If the finish becomes malleable but does not liquefy, it is composed of lacquer and shellac.;
, Apply lacquer thinner to the surface of the wood if nothing happens after applying denatured alcohol. The finish is lacquer if it turns to liquid.

, If nothing happens with either of these thinning substances, your wood is probably covered in varnish or paint.

Form the first triangle.,
Build the foundation.,
Brace the triangles.,
Build the next layer of cards.,
Add the point.",How to Build a House of Cards1," This ""truss"" is the basic structure of the pyramidal design.Prop two cards together into an inverted ""V"" shape. The top edges of the cards should meet, and the bottom edges should be evenly spaced apart from a central axis. Spend some time practicing this process. You'll need to repeat it over and over again in the construction of your house., Create a steady line of triangular trusses, two cards each. The point of each triangle should be no more than one card's length from the point of the next triangle. The number of triangles in the foundation determines the possible height of your house of cards: each ""floor"" will be built upon one less triangle than the floor below. For instance, if you build a three-triangle foundation, you'll be able to go up three ""floors"" before the house reaches a point; if you build a six-triangle foundation, you'll have more space to build, and you'll be able to go up six floors. Start with a three-floor house.


Brace each new triangle against the base of the adjacent triangle. Eventually, you should have three triangles (using six cards, total) that are all touching.

, Gently lay a flat card on top of the first two triangles (say, 1 and 2). Make sure that the card is perfectly balanced between the points. Now, lay another card between Triangles 2 and 3. You should have a ""foundation"" of three triangles with two flat cards on top. This takes eight cards, total., If your foundation comprises three triangles, the next ""floor"" up should use two triangles. Try to stack each new triangle at the same angle as the two triangles below, for the sake of structural integrity. Place the base of each card above the point of a lower triangle. When you have formed these two triangles, lay one flat card on top between their points.Be extremely careful. If you built the foundation well, it should be strong enough to hold up these new cards – but you will need to keep from knocking the whole thing over with a tremble or sudden movement. Stack the new cards lightly and cautiously.
When you've finished laying the second ""floor"", your tower should comprise thirteen cards: five triangles and three flat cards.

, To complete your house of cards, you just need to stack one more triangle atop the structure. Slowly and carefully prop two cards together at the same angle as all of the prior triangles. Hold them in place until they are completely even, and pull your hands away when you feel confident that the point will stand on its own. If the structure stands, you have built a house of cards!

"
"
Form the cell.,
Build a ""roof"" or ""ceiling"".,
Add a second story.",How to Build a House of Cards2," First, arrange two cards into a slightly-off-center ""T"". Hold the cards, one in each hand, so that their flat faces are perpendicular to the table. Lean them against each other to form another almost-T. Next, place a third card against the middle of one card to form another ""T"". Close the box with a fourth card and ""T"", so you have four cards pressed against each other with a square space in the center.


This is the basic four-card cell or ""lock box"". It is one of the most structurally stable foundations that you can lay for your house of cards. Think of this cell as a pattern that you can repeat throughout your design.

, Overlap two cards flat on top of your four-card cell. Then, lay two more flat cards (rotated at a 90-degree angle) to complete the roof. A ""double-ply"" flat layer will make your eventual structure much more stable.

, Carefully construct a second four-card cell on top off the flat layer. You now have a stable two-story card structure. Feel free to keep adding stories until you run out of cards, or until you think the structure is tall enough. The four-card cell is a very strong root, so you should be able to stack many levels atop the foundation.


Try adding ""wings"" to the house by attaching more T-shapes to the ground floor. Whenever you put down a card shape that is perpendicular to the table surface, make sure to lay a flat card layer on top as a ""ceiling"". This will make the cards more structurally sound, and it will make the whole building look more like a house.
Get creative. The sky's the limit with this method – so see how big of a house you can build!

"
Use cheap cards.,
Choose your surface carefully.,
Stay calm.",How to Build a House of Cards3," Expensive pro-quality cards are usually smooth and glossy, and they are prone to slipping apart. Cheaper cards tend to be grainier and less slippery, and thus better for sticking together., Pick a safe, sturdy space that will not shift while you're stacking cards. Try building upon a slightly textured surface, like a billiards table or an unfinished wood table. A smooth surface like a glass table could cause your cards to slip. Consider using a tablecloth or a place-mat to add texture to a smooth surface – but be aware that these unfixed foundations are prone to shift unexpectedly.


Make sure that there isn't a draft! Build your house of cards indoors, away from open windows, doors, fans, and vents. You don't want to lose all of your hard work to a ill-timed gust of wind.

, A shaky hand or a sudden twitch can make your house crumble. Hold each card gently but firmly between two fingers of your dominant hand. Try to ""float"" it smoothly into place.


Try placing cards when you are between breaths, or at the ""bottom of your breath"" – in the moment just after you exhale. Take deep breaths, and pay attention to the brief space that occurs between exhalation and inhalation. Your body is at its stillest during this moment, and you may find it easier to keep your hand steady."

Place your thumbs on top of the deck.,
Make an arch with the cards.,
Release the arch to cascade.,
Push the stacks back together.",How to Cascade Cards1," Take the deck in your dominate hand. Place your other hand below the deck. With your dominant hand, use your thumb to rifle through the deck. Stop about halfway through. Take one half of the deck in either hand., Set your cards on a flat surface. The two decks should be set side by side so the shorter ends of each deck face each other. The decks should be close enough that they're almost touching., Set your thumbs on the edges of the decks that are facing each other. Curl your remaining fingers around the edges of the deck that are facing outward.There is no precise way to secure the stacks with your fingers other than your thumb. Hold them in whatever way allows you to feel comfortable and in control.

, Pull your thumbs upward to create a slight arch in each deck. Then, gently tip each thumb backwards. This will cause the cards to fall inward, overlapping with one another. The cards are now shuffled.When you're done, the decks should be lying on your flat surface. The tips of the cards on each deck should overlap with one another.

, Place both your thumbs at the point where the cards overlap. Place your thumbs down firmly, as this helps secure the deck and then complete the cascade., Secure the edges of each deck by curling your middle, ring, and index finger around the edges. Lift the cards off the flat surface. Bend your hands downward slightly to create a mild arch with the cards.When you're done, your cards should form an arch. They should be connected at the center of the arch by the overlapping tips of each deck.

, All you need to do now is uncurl your thumbs. The cards should naturally cascade together.The cascade may not go smoothly the first time as it takes awhile to get a hang of the movements required. If your cards don't cascade, start over and try again.

, After cascading your cards, push the deck back together. Straighten your cards into a neat pile. If you want, you can repeat the process a few times to fully shuffle the deck."

Put the queen on top of the other queen in spectators hand and that is it.",How to Do a 2 Card Monte Card Trick," Make sure that you have the spade between the two and place this on top. Place a club on the bottom of the deck. For example, on top of the deck you have an ace of hearts first, queen of spades second and ace of diamonds third. The bottom card of the deck is the queen of clubs. Now you are ready!






;
,








,, (To give you some time to get a double lift ready, ask the spectator what card he has and to look at it to make sure it is ok.)








, Place this on top of the ace of hearts. Say, ""I will teach you the move in slow motion.""








,








, What you are trying to do here is make the spectator believe that you are switching the heart and the diamond. After you shove it in and out your hand goes to the top of the deck, releases the heart, and grabs the other queen from the bottom of the deck.








, The most difficult part of this trick is the last switch. To make it easier, you have to keep on talking. While you are switching from the deck say, ""Now, do you bet the heart is on the top or bottom?"" You have to be quick and keep the spectator's eyes off of the deck. The spectator will then make a prediction but they are totally wrong!

Create two stacks with your thumb.,
Overlap the cards together at the corners.,
Position the stacks in an upside down v-shape.,
Hold the stacks with your thumb, index finger, and pinky finger.,
Release the cards to cascade.",How to Cascade Cards2," Hold the deck in your dominant hand and place your other hand below the deck. Use your thumb to rifle through cards until you reach the rough halfway point. Then, take one half of the cards in either hand. This creates two small decks., Press the tips of corners of either deck together. Then, slide the cards in both decks together gently so the cards in either deck overlap slightly. This begins your shuffle.Some slight wiggling motion may be required to get the decks to overlap.

, Now that the decks are connected at either corner, bend the top deck downward. Bend slowly enough that the overlapping cards don't come undone. Keeping bending the top deck until you make the rough shape of an upside down ""v"" with your decks.From your perspective, however, the shape will simply look like a ""v."" Those watching you will see an upside down ""v.""

, Transfer the cards to your dominate hand. Place your thumb at the point where the cards meet at the corners. Curl your index finger around the bottom of one deck. Curl your pinky finger around the bottom of the other.It may take some maneuvering to hold the decks properly. A lot depends on hand size, so you may find you need to make your v bigger or smaller to hold your deck securely.

, Hold your non-dominant hand below the deck of cards. Let go of the deck with your thumb. The cards will then cascade into your non-dominant hand."
"
Be gentle with your cards.,
Go slowly at first.,
Have patience.",How to Cascade Cards3," It's easy to damage cards by not handling them with care. When arching the deck especially, you risk permanently bending the cards if you handle them too roughly. Make sure to be very gentle with the cards. Always stop bending when you feel resistance., Pro card dealers are able to quickly and impressively shuffle and cascade a deck. However, getting these motions down takes time. If you jump into fast motions, it's easy to make mistakes when shuffling. At first, do all the motions slowly and precisely. With time, you'll get the hang of shuffling your deck and you should be able to complete the cascade faster., It takes awhile to figure out what's comfortable for you in terms of shuffling your deck. Don't get discouraged if you fumble a bit at first. Give it time and practice each day. Eventually, you'll be cascading cards with ease."

Begin by asking a member of your audience for a coin.,
Hold the coin out to your audience between your thumb and first two fingers of your left hand.

,
Pretend to pass the coin from your left to your right hand by doing the following:

Turn your left hand so that your thumb is on top with your fingers below.,
Direct your gaze to your right hand (the one you wish the audience to believe holds the coin), and raise it up to your audience.,
Wiggle the fingers of your right hand and open it up, to reveal it the hand to be empty.

",How to Do the 'French Drop'," If no one has one, produce one of your own.


Any small object can be used in place of the coin but it must be no larger than the size of the coin and something that is easily concealed and held onto.;
,,






Reach toward the coin with your right hand so that your thumb is going behind the coin and your fingers are going in front of it. The fingers of your right hand will obscure the coin from the audience's view.







Relax the thumb of your left hand, allowing the coin to drop to your fingers.






Continue the grasping motion with your right hand, but do not actually grab the coin. If you have done this correctly, the audience will now believe the coin to be in your right hand.







, At the same time, swing your left hand in a relaxed motion to a normal position by your side. At this point, it's best to drop the object into your pocket so that your left hand can remain free to move around or reveal that it, too, is empty.


To help encourage the audience to watch your right hand, patter a little about the need to watch that hand closely.

Grab a deck of 52 cards.,
Begin by shuffling the deck.,
Gather up the remaining eight cards into a pile and have the spectator place the ninth on top.,
Explain to your audience that you have enchanted the cards in this deck to speak to you.,
Begin counting down from ten as you place the cards into a stack face up.,
Count down from 10 as you place each card face up on the table.,
Repeat this process until you have four stacks.,
Add up the value of face-up cards.,
Flip through the remaining cards in your deck.,
Keep counting out the proper number of cards until you reach the last one.",How to Do a Card Trick1," For this trick, you need a standard deck of 52 playing cards. This trick is simple and involves basic math. You don’t need any sleight of hand to perform this trick.
You will perform this trick by counting out cards into four stacks.
Each card is assigned a number value that will determine how many cards you count to after you make four stacks and until you reach your spectator’s card.;
, You can shuffle the deck a couple of times and then ask your spectator to cut it if you want. Then count out nine cards.


Count off nine cards and separate this pile from your deck. Fan out your nine cards for the spectator.
Ask the spectator to take one of the nine cards and memorize it. Don’t have your spectator show you the card.

, Then place your pile of nine cards on the bottom of your deck.


You want to re-stack your eight cards while the spectator is memorizing or showing the ninth card to the rest of the audience. You do this so that you can ensure your spectator’s card goes on top of this pile.

, You will now explain that you will create four stacks of ten cards each. The number of cards in each stack and the card that ends up on top will magically reveal to you the location of your spectator’s card.

You can make up a story of how the cards have magically reshuffled in the deck, and will reveal the spectator’s card location to you.

, As you do this, explain that you will count down from ten and if the number you say matches the card you turn over, you will stop adding cards to that stack.


Explain that each card is of an equal value to the number on it. Then say that if you count all the way to one without a match, you will lay a card face down on top of the pile to cap it.
Also explain that all face cards are worth 10 and any Aces are worth 1.
A=1, J=10, Q=10, K=10

, If you are counting down and the number you’re on matches the number on the card, stop counting and move onto the next stack, starting at ten.


If you begin counting down and you get to the number seven and the card you lay down is also a 7, then that stack is done. Don’t place a face-down card on top of the pile when you get a match. You will use the 7 to help you tally up the number of cards you have to count before finding your spectator’s at the end.
If you begin a stack with a face card or a 10, then move onto the next stack. Don’t place a face-down card on top.
Likewise, if you get all the way down to one and the last card is an Ace, then that also counts as a match. Don’t place a face-down card on top.

, Not all stacks will have a face-down card on top.


You will use the stacks without face down cards to tally up the number of cards you count from your remaining deck until you find your spectator’s card.

, You will now look at the stacks of cards which do not have a face-down card on top and add up the total value.


If you have three stacks which found a match, you would add up the total value from the top card on each stack.
For example, If your three matches were an Ace (1), 4, and Queen (10) you would add up the value to get a total of 15.

, Count out the number of cards equal to your total, 15, from your three face-up cards.


As you do this, you can explain that the cards have magically spoken to you, and told you where to find your spectator’s card.

, This will be your spectator’s card. Flip the card over.

Ask your spectator if this is the correct card.

Display the second set of cards.,
Ask the person if they see their card.",How to Perform the Missing Card Illusion," You do not need to purchase a special deck of cards for this particular illusion. Do not worry if your deck isn’t complete, but do make sure it contains all four suits (spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs) of at least three card types (i.e. 5, 6, 7 or Jack, Queen, King, etc,).;
, To make the illusion convincing, you should use three sequential cards (for example, Jack, Queen, King). Pull out all four suits for each of the chosen cards. If you are using the above example, you will have the following:


Jack ♥ Jack ♦ Jack ♠ Jack ♣
Queen ♥ Queen ♦ Queen ♠ Queen ♣
King ♥ King ♦ King ♠ King ♣

, Both sets should follow the sequence (i.e. Jack, Queen, King) and should contain both a red and black suit. Using the above example, your sets could look like this, but do not have to follow this exact order:


Set 1: Jack ♦ (red), Jack ♠ (black); Queen ♥(red); Queen ♠ (black); King ♣ (black); King ♦ (red)
Set 2: Jack ♥ (red); Jack ♣ (black); Queen ♦ (red); Queen ♣ (black); King ♠ (black); King ♥ (red)

, It does not matter which card you choose. Hide that card out of sight. You will not need to use it again during the illusion.

, Shuffle Set 1 and place the six cards in front of you. You can either leave the cards stacked facedown or can spread them out. These will be the six cards that your audience initially sees.

, Be sure to shuffle the five remaining cards first. You will need to place this set in a location that will be easily reachable during the illusion, but hidden out of sight. You may want to wear long sleeves or wear pants with pockets.

,, Encourage the person to touch the cards and to flip them over to ensure they are real.


You are trying to create a sense of security, so reassure them by smiling and saying, ""Go ahead and inspect the cards. Take as long as you need!""

, Be sure to preface it by saying, ""Choose any card, but don't point to it, touch it or indicate to me in any way, which card you have chosen.""


To make them feel more secure, you may even volunteer to close your eyes while they look over and choose a card.
Encourage them to whisper their choice to a friend.

, Once they have indicated that a choice has been made, pick up the cards and neatly stack them in a facedown pile.

, You may want to say, ""Ok, focus on the card you chose. Are you concentrating really hard?"" Have them nod in response. Then say, ""I'm going to read your mind to learn which card you chose, so keep concentrating.""


While they are concentrating, you should also act as if you are thinking really hard, trying to read their mind.

, The most difficult part of this illusion, is to create a distraction. You may not realize it, but brains have two kinds of attention. One type pertains to your focus, while the other reacts to surprises. Magicians trick you by occupying both forms of your attention. Left with no others, you're completely and hopelessly distracted from their sleights-of-hand.One suggestion for creating a distraction is to be seated behind a table, wearing a long sleeved shirt. Dramatically throw both of your hands on to the table, covering the visible set of cards. In the process of putting your hands on the table, you should shimmy the hidden set of cards out of your sleeve, on to the table and beneath your hand.
You can then quickly sweep the initially visible set of cards, onto your lap, leaving the second set of cards (originally hidden in your sleeve) on the table.

, Create a bit of fanfare by slowly turning over each card, one at a time, leaving each face up. You may want to say, ""Ok, let's take a look at the cards and see if your card is still there.""

, You'll want to confirm, ""So, do you see your card or has it disappeared?"" Like magic, they'll be able to agree that the card they have chosen, has in fact disappeared!

Start with the bottom card of the deck upside down.,
Fan out the cards.,
Ask for a volunteer.,
Flip your deck over as your spectator looks at the card.,
Ask your spectator to place the card back in the deck.,
Tap your deck three times.,
Fan out the cards to reveal your spectator’s card facing up.",How to Do a Card Trick2," This trick involves a bit of preparation. It’s easiest to start the trick with your bottom card facing the opposite direction as the rest of the deck. If you flipped your deck over, it would look the same.


If you are skilled enough at sleight of hand, you can quickly flip the bottom card over after you shuffle the deck. One way to attempt to flip the bottom card after a shuffle is to finish shuffling with an overhand shuffle. Take the last card from your overhand shuffle and flip it back onto the bottom of the deck facing the opposite direction. You have to do this quickly so no one sees. Angle your hands so your audience won’t see the bottom of the deck.

, With your bottom card facing the other direction, fan out the deck without showing the bottom card.


Make sure to fan the cards out more in the middle of the deck.
Angle the cards down slightly so your audience mostly sees the tops of the cards.

, Have your volunteer pick a card from somewhere in the deck.


If you want, you can run your thumb along the outer edges of the fanned out cards and ask your volunteer to say “stop” at a certain point. When your spectator says “stop”, you ask your spectator to take the card your thumb is on.
This gives you a little bit more control so you ensure your spectator doesn’t pick your upside down card.

, Ask your spectator to memorize the card and show it to the rest of audience.


As soon as your spectator takes a card, you want to re-stack the deck.
While your audience is distracted by the card, flip your deck over so the bottom is now the top.
During this moment, discretely flip your deck. To help you do this unseen, you can lower the deck a bit. Also, cover the front of it with one hand while you turn it over so your audience doesn’t see what you’re doing.

, Your deck will now be upside but look normal to your audience.


Be careful to keep the deck stacked here so that your audience doesn’t notice that your deck is flipped.

, Explain that you are tapping the deck to trigger its magical properties. This will help with the illusion as you prepare to flip the deck. Then explain that you will cause the spectator’s card to magically flip over in the deck. Begin shaking the deck, and while you do, flip the deck back over.


This part can be a little tricky as your audience will be focused on the deck. The purpose of shaking the deck as you explain what you are doing is to distract your audience while you quickly flip the deck back over.
All of the cards will now be facing the right way except for the bottom card, and the spectator’s.

, Be careful not to show your audience the bottom card.


Remove your spectator’s card from the deck and ask the audience to inspect it. You can even have your spectator hold it. While this is happening, if you want, quickly flip the bottom card back over.

Count out sixteen random cards from a standard 52 card deck.,
Deal out the cards face up.,
Ask your spectator to tell you which row the card is in.,
Deal the cards out again into four columns of four cards each.,
Ask your spectator which row the card is in again.,
Gather the cards up just like you did before, starting with the row your spectator’s card is in.,
Deal the cards out, face down into four groups of four cards each.,
Ask your spectator to choose another group of cards.,
Ask your spectator to pick an individual card.",How to Do a Card Trick3," This trick involves a bit of memorization and is done by how you lay out the cards out in each round of the trick. The first round of the trick has you laying the cards in four rows of four cards each, face up. The second round has you laying the cards in four columns of four cards each, face up.
The third round has you laying the cards in four squares of four cards each, face up.

, Create four rows of four cards each. Ask your spectator to pick a card and memorize it.
Tell your spectator not to tell you which one it is, but to think about it very hard and visualize the card.

, Once your spectator tells you which row the card the is in, quickly memorize the cards in that row.


While you do this, keep talking to your spectator. If you want to make it a bit more interesting, you can wager a bet that you will be able to read your spectator’s mind and eventually find the correct card.
Gather up the cards. Pick up the row that your spectator’s card is in first. Be careful to keep the cards in the same order for each row.
Stack the cards face up on top of one another. You will have your spectator’s card in the bottom four cards with the cards face up. Then turn the deck of sixteen over so your spectator’s card is now in the top four.

, By separating the cards into columns for this round, you can quickly find your spectator’s card.


Because you previously memorized the row that your spectator’s card was in, and have now separated that row into different columns, each of the cards from the spectator’s row is now in a new grouping of four.
Furthermore, since your spectator’s card is one of the first four cards you laid out, you will be able to identify it easily.

, Though you laid the cards out in columns, you still want your spectator to identify the card by the row. You will now be able to find the card by the column. However, don’t reveal that you know which card it is just yet.


You can identify your spectator’s card because it will be the top card in whichever row your spectator points to.
Since you laid the cards out by columns in this round, the four cards from the first row will now be at the top of each new row.

,


Gather the cards face up again, starting with the top card of each row.
This way, your spectator’s card will be on the bottom of your deck.
As you gather up all of the cards, flip the deck over in your hand again. The cards should now be facing down.
Now explain that you will separate the cards into groups of four face down. Say that you bet you can use your magical powers to read your spectator’s mind to find the card.

, Ask your spectator to pick a group of cards.


You now know, that because your spectator’s card is the first card you put down, where it is.
If your spectator chooses the group of cards that the card is in, take the other three groups away.
If your spectator chooses a different group, remove only that group.

, Assuming your spectator hasn’t picked the group with the card in it.


Repeat this process until the group with the card is the only one left, or until that group is picked.
As soon as the group with your spectator’s card is chosen, remove all other groups.

, Just like with the groups, if your spectator picks the chosen card, remove the others. Otherwise, eliminate one more card until there are two left.

If the first card your spectator picks is the chosen card, bet that you can identify it before you flip it over. Say that through your magical abilities you are able to direct your spectator into picking the card. Then flip the card over to reveal that you guessed it correctly.
If you get down to two cards, you can bet your spectator that you not only know which card is the chosen card, but you can also identify what it is. Announce the card and flip it over to reveal you are correct.

Tell the participant you are going to use mind control to make a card magically rise to the top of a deck.,
Perform a double lift.,
Turn the cards over and ask the participant to memorize the card you are showing them — which they think is the top card.,
Put the cards back.,
Say the magic words, snap or ask the participant to tap on the deck and visualize the card rising toward them.

,
Now flip over the top card, and enjoy their amazement that the card you supposedly shoved in the middle is suddenly back on top!

",How to Make a Card Come Back to the Top of the Deck,";
, As you’re talking, perform a double lift — that is, pretend you are taking just the top card from the top of the deck, but actually pick up the first two cards. Do this without showing that you have two cards.


The critical part here is to remove the two cards so smoothly that the participant believes you are showing them only the top card.

, In actual fact, it will be the second card that they're seeing but they will think it's the first card.

, When they have assured you they have the card memorized, put the cards back on the top of the deck, and make a big show of removing the top card putting it into the middle of the deck. Now the once second card is on top.


Obviously, don’t let the person see the face of the card!

Separate all the kings (or jacks, if you prefer) and three extra cards of any other type.








,
Fan out the cards so that the four kings show, with the three extra cards hidden behind the fourth king.








,
Explain that the kings are going to rob a bank.,
At this point, stack the cards all together and place them face down on the top (roof) of the deck.,
Take the first spare card off the top.,
Send the second ""king"" to the second floor, putting the next card somewhere in the middle of the deck.








,
Send the third ""king"" to the vault at the bottom.,
The fourth stays on top to be the lookout.,
Have the top king say that the police are coming, so everybody needs to go to the top.,
Make a show of taking the four cards off the top of the deck and showing them to the audience.,
Display the four ""rescued"" kings alongside the deck and invite someone from the audience to search the remaining deck for the spare kings that they will assume you inserted.








,
Hide two random cards behind the second king when you fan them out.,
Show the audience the top card (the first king), then send it to the bottom of the deck.








,
Send the next two cards, which aren't kings, to the middle of the deck without showing the audience (since you showed them the first one, they're more likely to take your word for it that the next two are kings as well).








,
Show them the fourth card (the second king), which the audience will believe is the fourth and last king.,
Cut the deck, putting the bottom half on top and thus putting the first king back with the other three kings.








,
Fan out the deck and show the audience that the kings have stuck together through it all.








",How to Do the 4 Kings Card Trick,",, They will enter through the roof. (Another variation holds that the kings are such good friends that they won't let anything get between them. This variation may work better with the alternate method described below.)








, The three top cards are your spares, but your audience will believe they are the kings that they were shown previously.








, Without showing anyone the face of the card, say he's going to be on the first floor. Put it in the deck, somewhere near the bottom.








,, Don't put any of the cards too close to the top of the deck, because the real kings are on top.








, Stand him up and show him to the audience.








, He knocks on the roof. Tap or knock on the deck four times.








, They should all be kings.








,, Put them on the top of the deck. They should be in this order, from top to bottom: first king, random, random, second king, third king, fourth king.






;
,,, In reality, you still have three kings at the top of the deck, and one at the bottom.

,, This is the tricky part. As you do this, bring your outer fingers together towards your middle fingers, bending the card into an arc.








, If you do it right, the corners of the card will be trapped in between your fingers, but not enough to be easily seen. This takes practice and precision, so don't be frustrated if it takes some time to master.









As you can see in the image, the card is flipped onto the back of your hand. Not letting your audience see the back of your hand is key; try doing the move in front of a mirror so you can see at what angles you can move your hand without revealing the card.














, Relax your hand, bending your fingers forward slightly. Start pulling your middle fingers back behind the card, pivoting it forward and pushing it into the starting position.








, When the card is once again between your fingers and thumb, be sure to release the grip your outer fingers have on the card's edges so the hold looks natural.

Add fine detail.,
Apply a Citadel Wash, if wanted.,
Finish the base.,
Protect the miniature (once it's completely dry and finished) with matte varnish.

,
Strip your model down and start over.",How to Paint Warhammer Figures," You should already have Warhammer figurines, as well as Citadel paints and brushes. If not, you can purchase them from Warhammer retailers or any good craft store. It's usually a good idea to leave parts like shields separate until you finish the model.;
, Decide on two or three bright colours and one balancing dark colour. (For example, red, moss green and black; or rich yellow, bronze and dark brown.) Remember, you want your colours to reflect the identity of the character. Red and black are appropriate for any Chaos champion. Darker greens and blues work for just about any figure. You want to reflect on your army choice, for example, if your going for a mad Ork clan, then don't choose two bland colours, spice it up a little!

, An undercoat provides a smooth base for subsequent layers of paint. Use Black (if you're planning on using lots of metallics), White (if you want to make your miniature colorful) or Grey if you want to be able to go both ways. You can apply an undercoat in a few different ways:


Spray painting. This will give you the best results in the least amount of time, and it's faster than setting up an airbrush. Make sure you do your spray painting over a piece of cardboard or a sheet of scratch paper.
Air brushing. Using the Citadel spray gun is similar to spray painting, but more exact. However, set-up takes longer.
Hand painting. Painting the undercoat by hand takes the longest. You can also use hand-painted touch-ups to improve undercoats applied via spray paint or airbrushing. When you paint by hand, make sure you thin the paint with a bit of water first on your palette. Keep the coat light so you don't obscure any detail.

, Use a palette to separate different colors that you'll be using. Then, thin them by dipping the brush in a bit of clean water and mixing it with the paint. Do this little by little - remember, you can always add more water to your paint, but you can't take it back out. Daub a bit of the thinned paint onto your brush and hold the brush pointing straight down; if the colour drips off, you've gone too far. Thinning your paints makes them easier to work with, in addition to stretching out the product.

, Base coating is the process of applying the first coats of the dominant colors to your miniature. Try to paint in steady, light sweeps and avoid putting on too much. If it's not as neat as you'd like, don't worry too much - you can always touch it up later. Don't worry too much about the details yet, and do as many light coats as needed.

, Certain parts of your model - such as crevices, fur, chainmail and so on - would naturally look shaded and darker. Use ink or extra-thinned black paint on these areas for realistic shading.

, For dry-brushing, load your brush directly from the paint pot - no thinning necessary. Blot it on a piece of tissue or a paper towel until most of the paint is gone. Lightly brush upwards over the area you want to highlight - the paint will adhere to the raised areas of the figure. For example, for painting a Caucasian face, you’d start with flesh colour, then put darker shades under the eyebrows and jaw, and finally mix some white with the flesh paint and dry brush the forehead, nose, upper lip and cheekbones. On metals, mix metal with a little black/brown first, then use ink for the grooves and dips, and dry-brush highlights in unmixed metal colour.

, Dilute paint to prevent clumping before painting the smaller parts of the model.

, Citadel Washes will settle into the recesses of the model and highlight detail. You can apply the wash directly from the paint pot, or water it down on the palette first.

, Paint the base carefully and neatly in the desired color. Wait for the whole figure to dry, then brush glue onto the top of the base and dip it in sand. Shake off the excess and let the glue dry. Then paint watered-down PVA glue over the sand to make it stay, and wait for that layer to dry before adding Bestial Brown or whatever colour you want over the sand. After that's dried, brush the base with a lighter colour, such as Bleach Bone. You can also put little spots of glue on the base, pick up static flock and stick it on.


Alternatively, you could glue the sand to the base before painting the model. After spray painting, the sand will be easy to dry-brush any color you like. The paint will help hold the sand in place as well.

,, If you're unhappy with how the model turned out or you simply want to enjoy the process of painting it again, you can strip with some gentle solvents such as Simple Green cleaner, Dettol solution, Dawn Power Dissolve, acetone-free nail polish and similar products. Soak the model overnight, then use a toothbrush to remove remaining stains.

Strike fear into your enemies' hearts.",How to Use Heavy Units Effectively in Warhammer," The easiest and most exhilarating way to learn the game is by playing it. Go to the nearest Games Workshop, a hobby store specifically dedicated for Warhammer, and meet some of the store associates. They will be happy to show you how the game works and maybe even introduce you to someone who would challenge you to a match.;
, Once you have a starter set and a basic understanding of how the game works, buy a heavy unit that goes with your army. Make sure it looks cool. Half of the fun in getting a new set is building and customizing it!

, Players usually choose a color scheme for their army. This gives an army a unique and distinctive look. Make heavy units look battle-tested by adding bullet holes in the armor, or by painting rust or mud stains on the model.

, The most important units in Warhammer are the expensive ones. This is because they are so effective in battle. Templates are plastic cut-outs that cover a small surface area on the gaming table. They represent shell explosions and flame thrower attacks. Any model underneath the template is hit, and likely destroyed.

, Find out which infantry units with which it works best. Tanks and other vehicles are great at protecting smaller units. Once the enemy gets up close and personal, the standard units will most likely be protecting the tank. To make battles even, each model has been assigned a point value. The entire Imperial Guard Grunt Squad on the left is worth far less then the Earth Shaker Battle Tank on the right, yet both are needed for an effective attack.

, Yes, this happens before any actual fighting, but this is the most crucial step.

, The map may include some rough terrain or even tank traps. You must plan ahead and avoid such areas, or send smaller units into those areas for cover.

, If the enemies do not have time to take cover, they are sitting ducks.

, Some tanks can double as unit transports. Since they can travel faster than ordinary ground units, they can venture ahead and send a strike team to break up the enemy lines before your main force catches up.

, Light armored vehicles are faster at this, but lack the firepower that heavy units possess. If the flank is successful, then slip past the main body of the army, and take out the enemy support squads, snipers, artillery and HQ units.

, This will cause an effective diversion because it draws enemy fire away from the weaker, yet necessary, units. This tactic protects them. Even if an enemy unit has a line of sight and wants to target your weak squad, it will have to take a leadership test. Think about it: If a unit is not trained enough to listen to its leader, it will instinctively shoot the deadly, skull-crushing creature that steadily approaches.

, Get monstrous creatures, a type of heavy unit, into close combat ASAP. They cannot move quite as fast as an agile vehicle, but they can do something even better. When engaged in a close quarters battle, the heavily armored beast towers over its enemy. If a blood thirsty, ground-shaking beast suffers less damage than the infantry unit it is fighting, then the unit must take a moral check. If it fails, then the torn unit is required to flee in the opposite direction however many inches the die value indicates.

One player controls the elite human space marines Dark Angels, fighting corrupted Chaos Space Marines. If you purchase this set, skip down to the next section. If you would rather play a different faction (and have a larger budget to spend), continue to the next step.

Don't buy the 6th edition Dark Vengeance set by mistake. Older editions may be cheaper, but you won't be able to play with most other Warhammer 40K players.;
, Each Codex describes the unique units, special abilities, and long history of a playable faction. There are many 7th edition Codices and more are released regularly. As a new player, don't worry about how powerful each army is. Pick an army that grabs your attention with cool models, or a story you enjoy. You'll spend a lot of time with this army, and choosing something that appeals to you is more important than which army is ""powerful.""


Necrons, Grey Knights, Space Marines, Chaos Marines, and Eldar are all good options for new players.Other factions can be difficult to play, or rely on complex rules.

, The cheapest option is to find a used copy of the Dark Vengeance paperback mini Rulebook, which you can buy from auction sites.The more expensive hardback comes in a three-volume set along with a guide to miniatures and a history of the setting. You can also buy this as an ebook., An Unbounded army can have any combination of units (miniatures). This is a great choice if you happen to have a few miniatures already, but the choices can overwhelm a novice.

Optionally, you can group units into Formations to get special benefits. See the Rulebook and Codex for more information. An Unbound army cannot form other types of Detachments.
You can combine units from different factions, if you have more than one Codex. Look up Allies in the Rulebook to see how this affects your units.

, This method gives you some guidance in which units to choose, and is favored by competitive players. A Battle Forged army is divided into Detachments, and each detachment must fulfill certain requirements.Your units get various bonuses for fulfilling these requirements, as described in your Rulebook and Codex.

The main requirements are minimum or maximum numbers of each Battle Role, such as HQ or Troops. Each unit's Battle Role is shown as a symbol in its description.
Each detachment must be a single faction, and there are additional restrictions when choosing them.

, Your Codex lists every unit available to your faction, with a point cost for each unit. Each player should make an army with the same total point cost. A 500 or 750 point army is a good place for a new player to start. There are endless combinations of units you could buy, but don't overthink it for your first time.

Ask for help from experienced players, or search for beginner guides to your faction online.
Check with the people you'll be playing against. Some groups of Warhammer players agree on extra requirements for their armies, which you'll have to follow to play with them.
If you can't find any advice, follow the suggested division of Battle Roles on any Force Organization Chart in your Codex or Rulebook.

, Buy the Warhammer miniatures for the units you chose from a game store or the Games Workshop website. Just pick a couple to start with, so you can get a feel for the assembly and painting process. You'll need the following equipment.Nail clippers or sprue clippers to remove model parts from frame
Plastic glue for plastic models, or super glue for metal and finecast models
Emery board, nail file, and/or utility knife to clean rough edges

, Follow the link to a full article if you enjoy painting, but feel free to use a simple two or three color paint job otherwise. Besides aesthetic appeal, this will help you and your opponent identify units during battle.

, Finally, you will need the following items. If another player already has these, you don't need to get them as well.

Measuring tape in inches
Warhammer 40K Template set (three clear plastic objects showing blast radius; a few extra-powerful weapons require larger templates)
A special ""scatter die,"" sold wherever Warhammer is sold
Plenty of ordinary six-sided dice

, The Dark Vengeance box set comes with small missions ideal for learning the game. If you do not have the box set, choose one of the Eternal War missions in your Rulebook. These will set the story for your battle, and explain how to win the mission. Read the mission carefully, since it can add extra rules for how you place terrain and deploy units.

Avoid the Maelstrom of War missions for now, which add extra Objectives in the middle of the game., Each player picks one character model in his army to be a Warlord. That unit has the Warlord Trait listed in its entry. If it does not have any Warlord Traits listed, roll on the Warlord Trait table in the Rulebook. It has that Warlord Trait for this battle.


You lose the Warlord Trait bonus if that unit dies.
If you have any Psyker units, each one generates psychic powers. Check the unit's Codex entry to see which psychic disciplines it knows. For each Mastery Level, choose a discipline and roll on that discipline's chart to see what power the unit has this battle. If you don't like, it, switch to the discipline's Primary power instead., You can play on any flat surface. A 6 x 4 foot board is the most common size, but if you have small armies (500 points) you can use an area as small as 4 x 4. Terrain is optional, but highly recommended, and can be placed anywhere that all players agree on. This can be purchased warhammer terrain or homemade terrain.

Warhammer rules always use inches. 12 inches = 1 foot.
You don't even have to play on a rectangular board, but most people prefer to.

, Check the mission for deployment rules. If there aren't any, use any of the deployment zones in the Rulebook. (For example, the two players pick opposite sides of the board and must place their units within 12 inches of that side.) Roll dice to see who deploys first. That player puts down all his units, then the second player puts down all her units.

If you can't fit all your units in your deployment zone, read the ""Reserves"" section of the Rulebook.

, Whoever deployed first gets to choose whether he goes first or second. (First is usually better.) If he chose to go first, the second play can roll a die. If it comes up 6, she ""Seizes the Initiative"" and goes first instead., Most missions will tell you how long the game will last, and how to decide who wins at the end of it. If your mission doesn't, try these suggested rules:

The game ends in five turns.
Earn 1 victory point for each completely destroyed enemy unit.
Slay the Warlord: Earn 1 point for removing the enemy warlord
First Blood: Earn 1 point if you were the first to destroy a unit.
Linebreaker: Earn 1 point if you have a unit within 12 inches of the enemy table edge at end of game.

, If the mission has objective markers, players take turns placing them. The markers must be at least 6 inches from the table edge, and 12 inches from each other. To control an objective (and earn victory points), you must control all units within 3 inches of the objective.

If you have a Battle Forged Army, some detachments will have the Objective Secured ability. Units in these detachments can control an objective even if an enemy unit is nearby, unless the enemy has the same ability.

, First, move every one of your models. Most infantry models can move 6 inches, but check the codex entry for vehicles and monsters. Measure the distance with your tape measure from the center of the model, and place the center of the model at the far edge of the tape measure.

Models in the same unit stick together. A model can't move farther than 2 inches horizontally from the nearest model in the same unit. If you start your turn with them farther apart than this, they must move back together (or as close as they can).
Most terrain slows down most unit types. Check the Rulebook for more info.

, If you have any Psykers in your army, roll a die. Add the result to the total Mastery Level of all Psyker units you have. This is the number of your Warp Charge dice for this turn. Spend these on psychic powers as described in the Rulebook., Now each of your units with ranged weapons can make an attack against any enemy the unit can ""see"" within its weapon's range. All models in that unit fire at the same time. Roll a die and use the unit's Ballistic Skill (BS) to see whether it was a hit. The Follow the Wound Chart and instructions in the Rulebook to check for injured or killed enemies.

Only one model in the unit needs to ""see"" the enemy. If you're not sure, put your eye down to the board and look. Banners, wings, weapons, and other ""poky bits"" don't count; you need to be able to see the core of the model.
There are many shooting rules not covered here. It's worth reading this Rulebook section in detail.

, You can now charge the enemy and attack with each of your units. This has drawbacks, since units in close combat cannot move or shoot in future turns.

Pick an enemy within maximum charging distance (usually 12 inches).
That enemy gets to make an Overwatch attack, described in the Rulebook.
Roll two dice. Move the unit up to the total result, in inches.
If the base of one of your models is touching the base of an enemy, the whole units are in close combat.

, The final portion of your turn only applies to units in close combat. Make attacks using the Fight rules. Reading this Rulebook section carefully is recommended. Here are the most important points to remember:

Models attack in order of highest Initiative to lowest. This includes enemy models.
Each model's Attack (A) value tells you how many attacks it can make.
Use the To Hit and To Wound charts to find the results of attacks.

, After all models have attacked, the side with more Wounds makes a Morale Check by rolling two dice. If the result is higher than the units' Leadership, the unit must Fall Back. Roll two dice again and move that many inches, straight back to the unit's starting table edge. These units get one chance each turn to Regroup, as described in the rules. If they fail, they keep moving back the same way. When they reach the table edge, they become casualties and leave the game., You've completed one turn. The enemy player now repeats these steps. Continue playing until you reach the end point you agreed on. This is usually a number of turns (try 5 for your first game), a time limit, or when a certain mission objective is complete."

Assemble your models for the undercoat.,
Once the undercoat is done, paint over your model, as completely as possible, with your chosen foundation colour.

,
Over top of your foundation(s) use your colour(s) to paint the main face of your model.

,
Use a Citadel wash/ink to get in the cracks of your models.

,Go over any places you un-intentionally got the wash on

,Start your detailing work

,
Clean up any part of the models that either weren't covered completely, or that got a bit of the wrong paint on them.

,
Make sure your model has no fault or anything.

You have finished your model and are ready to wage war across the galaxy!","How to Paint Warhammer 40,000"," You can do this easily by spray painting them. Undercoating must be done in black or white paint. This depends on whether or not the colours you are using are light colours or not. For colours such as oranges and yellows use white undercoating and for colours such as blues and purples use black.;

Keep in mind the current Tau strategies are developed according to the Games Workshop's Tau Empire 4th edition Codex and the Games Workshop's 6th edition Rulebook - which will influence your purchases.
,
Look around for places to buy them.,
Consider buying a Battleforce.,
Get Battle suits.,According to the Force Organisation Chart (FOC), you may have up to two HQs, three Elites, three Fast Attack, three Heavy Support and six Troop choices (but a minimum of one HQ and two Troop choices).,
Start playing.,
See each of the other Tau units in detail:

The Ethereal (HQ) - they're good in combat and have some interesting abilities but learn on thing: Tau are not melee warriors.",How to Start Buying a Warhammer 40.000 Tau Empire Army,", There are many good places to buy your items from: Games Workshop's store, independent retailers, eBay, even Craigslist! Sometimes people get rid of their armies too (which is a great way to start playing if you do not want to spend time and money painting., A very good way to start shopping and playing is to buy a Battleforce - you'll get one Battle suit, one Kroot Carnivore unit, one Fire Warrior unit, one Stealth Suit unit, and a precious Devilfish., They'll fulfill the roles of HQs (and their Bodyguards), Elite teams and Broadside Heavy Support units. The Battlesuit is the most versatile unit of the Tau Codex. Stealth Suits and Ethereals do not compare. And you need Sky Ray boxes (you want these for the extra sprues and the money value: you'll be actually assembling Hammerheads/Devilfishes; see below).,, Starting to play Tau with an HQ and two Troops (from the Battleforces) would be a good idea if the bulk of their gameplay was created to use Troops - it was not. The bread-and-butter of the Tau Empire are the Battlesuits. So you'll be looking at about two HQs (both Battlesuits), XV8 Battlesuits as Elites choices (individually or in teams, you'll find your sweet spot) - and troops that suit your strategy and point availability. Later you'll be definitely using TEAMS of Elite Battlesuits, and Bodyguards for the HQs. By then you'll have bought 15 Battlesuit boxes - yeah, start saving for them now., So buy them only if you have spare change - to use them as decoration or objective markers, at best.
A quick note on the Battlesuit Commander (HQ): their boxes are more expensive than the average Battlesuit, but you only get two new heads and the Airbursting Fragmentation Projector and the Cyclic Ion Blaster (and no Gun Drone!) - but you can convert them, can't you? Yeah, 'thought so, so avoid theses purchases unless you've got the money to spare.
The Stealth Suits (Elite) - their sprues are awesome for conversions, with some great designs, so don't bother assembling them: they cannot compete with the Battlesuits - who needs more Strength 5 shots/Armor Penetration 5 shots? Still, they are interesting in Kill Team games.
The Fire Warriors - a weak Troop choice, they might be good for securing objectives, or being properly equipped for tank busting, but they're better inside their Devilfishes, held in Reserve for increased protection. Only buy the Shas'ui model if you have the money to spare.
The Kroot Carnivores (Troop) - the best the Tau can recruit for close combat, but definitely not the best there is in the 40K universe. They can secure objectives, infiltrate (and thus also outflank) and shoot. And if you add Hounds, the unit becomes even more powerful - but Hounds are ridiculously expensive; take a look at the Chaos Warhounds and how they look outwardly ferocious... and a bargain! And the Krootox, though powerful, is expensive and limits the Carnivores a little. Again, the Kroot Shaper can be easily modeled.

Soon you'll see how limited the Tau Troop choices are. There's a Chapter Approved article from the White Dwarf magazine describing the Tau Human Auxiliaries, the Tau Gue'Vesa (great for Tank Busting). These are interesting options, and could be modeled from Imperial Guard units, like the Cadians or Catachans, which could be cheap if bought as push-fit models.


Gun Drone Squadron (Fast Attack) - An interesting choice, the whole unit can be assembled from individual Gun Drones that come with each Battlesuit you buy. Still, the Gun Drone can be turned into a Shield Drone by removing the lower Pulse Carbine section or through the GW Shield Drone kit (expensive...) or through a creative conversion. If you buy the Sky Ray vehicle (see below), you can even create your own Markerlight drones.
The Pathfinder Team (Fast Attack) - a very important unit for higher point games, they could be modeled from Pulse Carbine Fire Warrior models. The Rail Gun variant is a nice model though, specially the ones lying down.
The Piranha (Fast Attack) - an important vehicle for screening, these have no alternatives whatsoever (except for Papercraft). Buy one model when you feel the need, probably after you've reached the 1000 point range. To reach their full potential, use full units of three models.
Stingwings (Fast Attack) - a broken, expensive unit (point and money wise), their use is tricky, even in the 6th edition. Besides, they'd be taking one Fast Attack slot from the Pathfinders or the Piranhas.
The Broadside (Heavy Support) - an important Battlesuit, especially now in the 6th edition when the Hammerhead is more vulnerable, and for carrying high-accuracy Railguns. The box comes with the same XV8 Battlesuit plastic sprues, plus feet, additional torso parts, modified arms and the Railguns, all in metal. If only you could make copies of these parts, you could get free Broadsides for the same price as XV8 Battlesuits...
Sniper Drone Team (Heavy Support) - small, powerful and camouflaged, these units are a powerful addition to any army. If you have spare gun drones and rail rifle Pathfinder models, you could convert them into Sniper Drones (a Fire Warrior and the Stealth Suit sprues could be converted into the Spotter).
The Hammerhead (Heavy Support) - after the Devilfish, it's the most important vehicle for the Tau: its Railgun is the most powerful weapon in our codex. Now, they cost the same as the Sky Ray box, and here's the trick: the Sky Ray box comes with ALL the sprues to create a Hammerhead - so why not buy the Sky Ray and have the option to use the tank as a Sky Ray in the future?
The Sky Ray (Heavy Support) - it's a good vehicle, but hardly employed in armies under 2000 point games, especially when you only have three Heavy Support slots and Broadsides, Hammerheads and Sniper Drone teams to fill them...
Special Characters: available only in 1500 point games and up, these are interesting additions to an army - except for Aun'Va: although a cool model (decorative item, perhaps?), you don't want to spend all those points (and HQ slot) with a melee, non-scoring unit, right? Commander Farsight makes for an even more Battlesuit crowded army (yay!) and Commander Shadowsun could not only efficiently Tank Hunt but also boost the morale saves of your entire army!

Undercoat them.,
Use Games Workshops 'Mithril Silver' for the first layer of the armour.,
Paint all of the gold bits.,
Paint all of the scrolls, pages and books.,
Start on the weapons.,
Use a smaller brush for the eyes, such as the (European 5/0).,
The next stage is to paint all of the wires.,
Work on the scrolls by adding some markings using a marker pen.,
Paint black ink (or black paint thinned down to the consistency of water) into all of the cracks, holes and areas that should be darker.,
Paint the belt that goes from the storm bolter, around to the armour.,
Do the base.",How to Paint Warhammer 40K Gray Knights," For this use black spray paint from Games Workshop. However you can paint it on by hand, just be careful to keep it to a thin layer to ensure no detail is lost. It's important to use black for these as we will need it for the shadows.;
, It is important in this stage to not get any paint in the cracks, as doing so will take away the intended shadow effect that we are looking for. Do this by using a method of dry brushing over the cracks and filling in the rest to give an even coat. If you do get some paint in the cracks don't worry to much as we will go over it with black ink later on.

, Do this in three layers. First a base coat of Games Workshops 'Dwarf Bronze' (again try not to get paint into the cracks). Then a layer of 'Shining Gold' on top, and finally a dry brush of 'Burnished Gold'. This will build up shade.

, Start off with a layer of 'Bronzed Flesh', then a dry brush of 'Breached Bone'.

, Paint the storm bolter and the handle of his nemesis weapon first a base coat of 'Regal Blue', then a dry brush with 'Enchanted Blue'. Next, paint the blade of his nemesis weapon 'Boltgun Metal', then dry brush over it with 'Mithril Silver'. Paint all the bolts that are holding the storm bolter together 'Mithril silver'.

, Carefully paint a base layer of 'Red Gore', then paint a tiny dot of 'Blood Red' at the front of the eye to give an impression of where he might be looking.

, There are some going to the storm bolter and some in the backpack as shown below. Paint them a variety of bright colours such as blue, orange and green. Try to ensure that you don't have too much paint on the brush as you want to leave the little gaps on the wires black. If you do get paint in them paint into the gap with some black ink or black paint thinned down to the consistency of water.

, These are not too expensive, and you can get them from art and drawing shops. Ideally I would like one a bit smaller than the one shown below, it's a European size three and can be a bit big for this purpose.

, For example parts that are shaded by his arms. This will really make the armour stand out, and really improves the model.

, First paint it 'Codex Gray'. Be careful not to go into the cracks as it will remove the shadow effect. Then apply a layer of black ink (or black paint thinned down to the consistency of water, see, then finally a dry brush of 'Fortress Gray'.

, To do this first paint over the whole base with 'Scorched Brown'. Then paint over the top of the base with PVA glue, and sprinkle sand and gravel onto it. This can be bought from model or craft shops, although sometimes you can find materials perfect for this job outside. After that has dried paint brown ink over it (or brown paint thinned down to the consistency of water). After that has dried dry brush a layer of 'Bestial Brown' over it. Finally apply a few spots of PVA glue and sprinkled some modelling grass over it. Then varnished it with matte varnish.

Undercoat the model black, preferably with black spray paint so you don't cover any detail if you use too much Chaos Black.,
Now comes all the dry-brushing.",How to Paint Orks1," Plus, it's way faster.;
, Dry-brushing is exceedingly messy, so it's best to do it at the beginning of your work on the model. Dry-brush all the metal on the model bolt-gun metal, such as any knives, swords, guns (etc.).

"
Find some space to work.,
Find a cardboard box, foam core, styro or plywood to create your base.,
Outline the desired shape for your terrain base.,
Cut the shape out from the board.,
Cover the edges with tape.,
Paint the base using an enamel paint.,
Allow paint to dry and set aside.

",How to Make Warhammer Terrain1," You will need dedicated bins for supplies, and a surface that you can cut, glue and paint on. You are very likely to create a mess, and will be working with a number of materials that can be hazardous or dangerous to leave around children or pets.;
, The board should be rigid, light and thin.It should be thin enough to cut with a knife. The base must be big enough to support your entire object.

, Use a pencil to make the desired shape. It is best to have an idea of the best shape and size for your terrain. If you are just building a base for a tree, a round shape will be most efficient. If you are doing a cubic building, you will probably want something that is more square. You may need to take some measurements of your terrain object before creating the base.

, You can use scissors to cut out the shape on a cardboard base. If you have a thicker material like plywood, you might need to use a sharp knife to cut.

, A painter’s tape works well to hide the rough edges, especially if you use cardboard as your material. Do not use a tape with a glossy, non-stick surface. You want the paint to be able to stick.

, You can choose a green color for natural grass look or gray for a rock or concrete type of texture. Choose something appropriate to your piece and then apply it over the entire surface.


Do not use a water-based paint or glue on terrain bases. These paints shrink when drying and can warp the surface of the base.

Gather your supplies.,
Clean your miniature.,
Remove mold lines.,
Assemble.",How to Paint Miniatures1," First you need a comfortable and well lit work area. You also should have hobby knives, a small file set, fingernail filing boards, super glue, a clean pot of water, and a paint set.;
, When miniatures are cast a release agent is applied to them. This is an oily or powdery substance that needs to be removed before you start painting. Wash with warm soapy water to clean off any mold release on the model. Let the miniature dry.

, Now using the hobby knife, trim away any mold flash. That's the extra material around the model that will make a thin line sticking to the miniature horizontally. When the two halves of the miniature are connected in the casting process, this line is often left behind. You should use your knife to remove any other irregularities on the miniature at this point. Oftentimes the extremities have points or bubbles that shouldn’t be there. Use short strokes of the knife to remove the mold lines. Try not to damage the miniature, just swipe off any excess material or bubbles. The irregularities should be pretty obvious. , Some miniatures have extra parts that need to be assembled, such as a sword or shield. This can be the hardest part. Small parts like hands, small weapons, antennas and other pieces can be glued with a simple tube of superglue. Larger metal pieces may need to be pinned. Pinning requires drilling a hole in each end of the hand or wherever you are attaching the metal piece. Then you need to string a small piece of hard wire through the hole and connect the wire to the metal piece. Then glue together everything with a superglue or a two part epoxy for stronger hold.

Decide how large your table will be.,
Get the tabletop.,
Buy your baseboards.,
Decide on a tabletop surface.,
Gather miscellaneous supplies.,
Make the frame.,
Screw in your tabletop.,
Apply your sand or felt.,
Let the glue dry.,
Sand the edges.,
Paint the tabletop.,
Decorate the base.,
Start researching terrain ideas for your board.",How to Make a Wargaming Table," Different wargames call for different sized tables. Warhammer 40K’s standard table size is 6’x4’, but your game of choice may call for a different sized table. Do research, read the game’s manual, and ask others who play your game about the standard table size., At your local hardware store, look for plywood or MDF sheets of 1” thickness. MDF, or medium-density fiberboard, is a durable alternative to plywood made by compressing and sealing small wood particles together with an adhesive. You may have to ask an attendant to cut your sheet down to size. Most stores provide this as a free service, and it will save you the hassle of having to do it yourself. Always make sure an attendant cuts any MDF, as the glue that holds the board together can be toxic.Plywood is lighter than MDF, but may be more expensive. Choosing between the two materials will come down to the amount of money you want to spend and whether or not you want the board to be portable., The baseboards are the four pieces of wood that will form the legs, or frame of your table. Buying baseboards will require a little calculation, so make sure to sketch out your table. Choose boards or MDF pieces with a thickness of 1”, and a width of 8”, 10” or 12”, which are all standard sizes and easy to find.The length of the boards will be a bit trickier to calculate. You want the tabletop to be the exact same size as the frame, so you’ll need to subtract the 2 inch of length from the shorter sides.


For example, if you wanted to make a 6’x4’ game board (72”x48”), you’d buy two 1”x12s” of 72” length, and two 1”x12”s of 46” length.
For a smaller example, let’s try a 4’x4’ board (48”x48”). For a 4’x4’ frame, you’d buy two 1”x12”s of 48” in length and two 1”x12”s of 46” in length.
As with the tabletop, ask an attendant to cut the wood or MDF down to size for you.

, Felt and sand are used to make surfaces for the majority of gaming tabletops. Choosing a covering depends on type of game you want to play. Felt makes a good surface because it is cheap and easy to apply. Sand is another choice: while it’s harder to apply, it helps keep your figures from sliding around on the tabletop. There may be other options available, but felt and sand are the most common.Look for sand at your local hardware store. There are many types of bagged sand available: road sand, play sand or colored sand from craft stores. Choose the type that best fits into your budget and one that fits the aesthetic of your game.
Buy felt at a fabric store. Most stores have attendants to cut the fabric for you: all you have to do is bring them the bolt that you’ve chosen and tell them the size. Buy a piece slightly larger than your tabletop so you have extra length to stretch it around the edges. Felt comes in a wide variety of colors, so choose the one that fits your game the best.

, After you have your wood and your table surface, there are a few more things you’ll need. You may already have them at home, or you may have to buy extra. Find some white glue, a bucket, a wide paintbrush, a power drill, a pack of 2” wood screws, and some coarse sandpaper.

, The frame is the base for your table, so you want to make sure it’s extra sturdy. For this step, you’ll need your wood screws, the drill, and your long baseboards. Ask a friend to help with this step if you can’t hold the boards and drill at the same time.Hold one longer board and a shorter board together to make an “L” shape. Make sure that the angle is as close to 90 degrees as you can make it, with the longer board on the outside of the “L.” Drive three screws through the long board and into the short board so that they fasten together: one screw in the middle and one screw at each end.
Hold the remaining long board against the “L” you’ve made to make another “L”. This will form another L shape, with the shorter board sandwiched between the two longer ones. Drill in three screws in exactly the same way as the first “L”: one in the middle and one at each end, through the long board and into the short.
Screw in the remaining short board. At this point, you’ll have a “U” shape, with two long boards screwed directly into the short board. The remaining short board will close the shape into a rectangle. Place it in the gap between the long boards to form 90 degree angles with each, then screw through the long boards and into the short board just as before.
Make sure the frame is sturdy. There should be no gaps between the boards, and all should be flush with one another. If you find that there are gaps or spots in which the boards aren’t secure, tightening the screw in that area.

, Place the flat tabletop onto the frame. It should be the exact same size as your frame, give or take a few millimeters. Mark three points on each side of the table where you’ll screw into the frame, making sure that all the screws will go in at even intervals. Then, drill in a screw for each spot you marked., Depending on which tabletop covering you chose, you’ll have a slightly different step at this point. Both surfaces need to be glued to the table, and both require some attention to make sure that the application is even. Ask a friend for help, especially if your table is large.To apply sand, use your large paintbrush to apply the white glue first. Make sure that the application is even, with no areas over-glued or under-glued. Apply sand with even consistency over the board, then begin to spread it around with your hands or the brush. Apply more or take some off as necessary until you’ve achieved the right look.
To apply felt, first apply the glue to the top of the tabletop and the edges with the wide paintbrush. Lay the felt carefully over the tabletop, then use a flat object, like the edge of a book, to smooth out any raised areas or bubbles in the felt. Press the felt down over the edges, folding the corners for a neater appearance. A stapler or small nails may help affix the felt to the edges of the table.

, Now that you’ve added your sand or felt, the glue will need time to dry. Leave the board for 24 hours, then check to make sure it’s dry enough. If the glue still feels tacky or wet, leave it for a few more hours before using it., Plywood and lumber tend to have uneven and coarse edges that can cause splinters or cuts. Use medium grit sandpaper to shape the edges and joints of your table, softening up any abrasive surfaces. Make sure to run your hands around any edges to double check for splinters or spots you missed., If you used sand to cover your table, you may want to paint it. Depending on the game you play, a layer of brown or red paint may give your board a more realistic feel. Wait until the glue has dried fully, then apply paint to the dry tabletop surface.

, The board is your own creation, and you’ll be using it for a long time. Get creative and decorate your board, personalizing it further. Paint the base your favorite color, then design symbols or add stickers. Take your imagination as far as you want to go to create a board that’s truly your own, or look online for ideas, Now that you’ve built it, it will need to be decked out for your game. Different games require different kinds of terrain, and players spend a great deal of time building and rebuilding battle arenas. Look online, in your game manual, or at wargaming shops for different ideas on how to proceed further.

, The paint should be the consistency of melted butter.

, Apply to the arms and face liberally, but don't paint in the reassesses of the orks arm, or face. The darkness in reassesses adds depth to the model.

, Make sure to leave an outline of the last coat so the green blends and transitions well.

, Apply to the very tops of muscle and curves in the orks skin. Tip: Paint the current mixture in a sinewy pattern to add a ""rippling"" effect to the orks skin. It requires a steady hand, but it's worth it.

, Apply to the very highest highlights, ie. on the edges of lips, eyebrows, and on the highlights of the muscles.

Use foam board to design the walls of buildings.,
Cut it to your desired size.

,
Draw your design on the foam board before cutting.,
Use a pliers to trace the outline of your design.

,
Fit the walls together at the corner.,
Create details with recycled objects.,
Save all your small pieces of foam.,
Set aside and prepare for painting.",How to Make Warhammer Terrain2," A 3/16"" or 1/4"" thick foam board will make great walls, floors, and even the bases on which to craft the rest of your terrain. Foam board will make it easier to cut out windows and doorway shapes with precision. It is easier to make any modifications to your design before assembling the building. Be sure you are satisfied with your design before proceeding.

,, Use a pencil to outline the doorways and windows.


Design the walls. You can just make the foam board wall pieces the same size if you want an intact structure, or you can design walls that are partially destroyed from being in a war zone. If you are new to crafting Warhammer terrain, designing ruins is a good way to start. Even if you mess it up you can work around it since the building is supposed to be destroyed anyway.

,, You can trim away the foam at the edge of one wall, then fit the other wall into the corner. This will conceal the gap between the foam board pieces and make it look more realistic. Be sure to get the pieces lined up exactly how you want them. Then, add some glue then fit the two walls together.


Hot glue will dry the fastest and allow you to keep working. Be sure to let the glue dry completely before painting so you don't ruin your brushes by getting glue in them., Use straws to create realistic looking pipes coming out of the rubble of your building. Break down some styrofoam packaging to create debris, bricks, rubble, impact craters, or rocks. Start with a simple object or design, and use these creative details to build a more elaborate scenery.

, You can use small pieces to shape in random bricks and rubble to add more detail to your terrain. Using the same materials you can shape foam board in a raised circle and attach it to a base to create a blast crater.

,


Visit model train shops. Many terrain objects, such as trees, can be found ready-made at a hobby shop. While many train modeling pieces will add a great touch to your Warhammer terrain, just be sure to select pieces that are durable enough for gaming purposes.
Check out garage sales. They offer a cheap way to find lots of materials that can be incorporated into your Warhammer terrain. Take an old action figure, mount it on a tin cup, give it a little gray paint, and you have the beginning of a statue. The possibilities of what you can create are limited only by your imagination.

",How to Make Warhammer Terrain3,",,,, If you desire a more realistic appearance to concrete or rock structures, coat the entire surface with this paint mixture. Use a large brush to apply the paint with vertical strokes for best results.


You will do this step before priming because you are just trying to create a layer of texture over the surface of your buildings. The color will not matter.
You can buy paint that is already mixed with sand at craft and hobby stores. You can also make some on your own. Just add a small pinch of sand to start with. More sand can be added depending on your desired appearance.

, Cover the entire surface with a liberal coat. This will provide a good surface for your paint to be applied. Use a black primer to provide a base for darker surfaces like rocks and buildings. Use a white primer for light-colored surfaces.

, Dry-brush is applying paint to a piece with a brush that has dried but still holds paint.Dry-brush various shades of gray and white to add an impression of weathering to objects buildings. Shades of brown can be useful to create mud or dirt. It might take many layers to look exactly like you want. A skilled piece can take up to 30 hours to paint.The key is to take your time and enjoy the experience.

Use an appropriate amount of white primer.,
Begin priming.,
Buy or find your base.,
Attach your base using high quality super glue.",How to Paint Miniatures2," Depending on how many details your miniature has you might want to use less or more primer. The more primer you use, the more your colors will pop once you start painting. However, if you use too much primer you’ll also fill in some smaller details of the miniature accidentally.. , For colorful models prime with a white primer. If you’re painting a darker model you can try to prime with black or gray. Remember two or three thin coats are better than a thick coat that might fill in details. Let the model dry between coats.


In general, use a white primer. This will allow your colors to pop once you start painting your miniature.

, Most miniatures come with a separate base. If the base is part of the entire miniature that normally means the miniature will be unstable and tip over. You want a stable base, especially if you plan to use your miniature for board games. You can buy a separate base online or at a craft shop. You don't need to remove the base of your miniature if it came with one, just attach it to a larger base. Bases that are already connected to a miniature are usually quite small.

, Thick consistency crazy glue is recommended because it can fill in the small gaps between the miniature and the base. Avoid putting it in area where it will obscure details. Consider buying a super glue accelerant at a hobby shop to make this process faster. Not having to wait is a huge help. "

Choose your color scheme.,
Add your base coat.,
Dark wash the miniature.,
Apply details.,
Dry brush the miniature.,
Protect the model using a spray varnish, dull cote or sealer.",How to Paint Miniatures3," This is where a color wheel will come in handy. Choose primary colors that you think match your miniature, and then mix the primary colors in equal proportion to get secondary colors. Choose complementary color pairings - these are colors that lie directly across from each other on the color wheel. Avoid using too many colors. If you're painting historical miniatures it could be a good idea to look at pictures or history books to get an idea of what that character would look like. If you're painting miniatures from a game, try searching on the internet for your character. This only applies if you want to paint the character as accurately as possible. Feel free to use your imagination.
As a general rule of thumb, don't use more than three major colors in your miniature or it will end up looking messy.

, Once you’ve chosen your color scheme you can add your first coat of paint over your primer. Remember that you won’t be adding details yet. Start with the hardest to reach part of the model part and paint a thin coat with the base color of that part. Continue painting the parts with the correct color from most difficult to to the largest least difficulty part of the miniature. Apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat.

, This is a technique done to bring out the shadows. Mix your base coat with brown or black and then dilute it. Now apply a layer of paint to an area filled with detail. This will bring out shadows and make the miniature look much more detailed and interesting. Let dry.

, Try using oil paint when you go to paint the face and skin areas of your miniature. Oil paint dries slower and blends more smoothly, so you can add more detail. Use a smaller brush to add smaller details like the eyes or fingernails. Try to keep a steady hand and make sure your miniature has had time to dry off after the dark washing. You don't want your details to drip.

, After your miniature is dried, and if you’re happy with it, you’re ready to dry brush the miniature. Mix the base color with a bit of white and then apply a small amount of this mixture to your paint brush. Wipe a little off on a rag or paper towel. Now use the dry brush on the model. The idea is to imagine a hypothetical light source and use this mixture to simulate how the light would hit the miniature. Build the area up with lighter colors.

, These can be found in arts and crafts stores. Spray in a well ventilated area with a clear coat. Again, several thin coats are best. Let varnish dry between coats.

Start playing.",How to Have a Good Warhammer 40K Army," (listings available from the Games Workshop website) Other experienced players are vital to enjoying and learning the game. Watch a few games. Just note what armies are being used and how they are being used. Do not be afraid to ask questions, most players love to talk about their forces––at length.;
, It provides a rulebook, two sets of opposing forces and some scenarios to get you started. This set can keep you playing skirmish size battles for months and is a good way to get used to the game and to work out your own preferred method of playing.

, Each of the forces in Warhammer 40K have their own style. Styles refer to how they play. Every race has its strengths and weaknesses, so ask yourself what kind of basic strategy you'd like to play. The speed of the Dark Eldar will allow you to outmaneuver the enemy and seize Objectives, while the Necrons and Space Marines tend to be more durable in extended fights. Space marines are ""shooty"" and the Orcs are ""horde-ish"". This means the space marines rely on their shooting abilities and the Orcs just form great whopping forces that try to overrun your forces.


There are several websites that offer in depth lore about the different armies in the 40K universe. While they will not carry the specific stats on individual units, characteristics of the armies will be available. For example, the Tau's long range weaponry and technology, the Elders specialist infantry, the Tyranids' numberless swarms, the Space Marines' tactical flexibility, and the Necrons' ability to regenerate, among many others.

, Is it unsubtle, brute force? Do you prefer to hang back and not directly engage? Do you like long range, brutal area of effect shelling? Perhaps you are looking for a more subtle, controlling type of force? Do you prefer overwhelming the enemy in close combat, a long range bombardment to destroy them, or lightning fast attacks? These preferences will guide you toward selecting your army.

, A Warhammer army is a long term investment of money and, more importantly, time. Assembling and painting a single squad takes a lot of time. Make sure you like the basic look of the army you will purchase before you invest these hours. It does no good to buy and play an army you personally find looks dumb just for their stats. If you want the staying power of Marines but hate their look, there are other armies to consider- Necrons, for instance. If you don't like the insectoid Tyranids but love the idea of an overwhelming swarm, consider using an Orc horde instead. Chances are if you like the stats and tactics of one army and not their looks, there's a way to build another army you think looks cooler around the same tactics.

, Throughout the whole process, ask what their opinions are on various races. Advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of assembling and playing their personal armies are great conversation starters. Finally, ask to take a look at their army's codex if they own one. Have them explain rules and warlords, and especially win conditions. Not every game is won by having the most soldiers left on the table!

, Anything else is doomed to failure. For example, if you play Space Marines but love to rush your opponent, you'll discover usually that Space Marines do not fair well in hand to hand combat, so you will lose often and will need to investigate other forces.

, The final step before taking the big plunge is purchasing the Codex of an army. While expensive compared to other books of its size, the Codex will give you a force organization chart to help guide you build your army. If the details in the Codex still don't fit your style, you still have time to return it and find a different army before taking the plunge and buying the actual soldiers.


The Codex for each force contains some background information on the army, a few stories and the complete force listing for the army. Read it cover to cover. It provides a true flavor for the army.

, You will be proxying the new army before buying models. Just be aware that a Games Workshop store will most likely not like you doing this, so maybe skirmish at your local store or home. Some hobby shops frown on it too. Explaining that once you find your force, you'll be more than happy to purchase locally, may help your cause in-store.

, Cut small pieces of cardstock that correspond to the base size of your models (guesstimate if you have too) and use these instead of models. Mark the name of the unit and the most important stats of the unit to help you keep them separate. Using your proxies, play a bunch of skirmish sized games (500 - 750 points). Use as many types of units as you like––they are currently free (by proxy of course). You can also ask one of your local gaming friends to try their army out. Play them using their army and they can use yours.

, Are you happy with your new army? Do you like the way it plays? Have you tried all the forces? Have you compared how you're doing with someone who plays the same force? The key to a good army is that you like the models, enjoy their style of play and it matches your own style of play.

, Start small. Build a 1000 point force, and consider buying the introductory army packages from Games Workshop. These are around the $200 mark and include the basic staples of any army––infantry, a few vehicles and one or two specialists. They can be a good first investment in infantry and vehicles before you buy more expensive soldiers and vehicles


The larger box sets are definitely worth the money but will take tons of time to paint and outfit. Most local game clubs/shops allow you to play your ""greys"".

, Above all enjoy the game, learn from your mistakes and any army can become a great army.

Before making any major purchases, read the rules and develop a basic understanding of how the different armies work!,
You may want to own a giant Goblin horde because it would not only be an interesting force on the battlefield, but would also look great!,
Once you have about 500 points you should be ready for your first decent game (40k combat patrol requires 400 points, but it is still an excellent way to play a good game of Warhammer in a short space of time).,
If you are mathematically minded, think about the probability of how many wounds you are likely to inflict with a certain weapon compared to another.,
Don't expand your army too quickly.,
Specializing your army isn't as simple as big and weak or small and strong-there are countless other things to consider, such as whether you want a shooty army-such as Tau-or a close combat army-such as Orks.,
Eventually you may find that your army is big enough and that you want to go on to something else.,
This will help you to think like your enemy next time you play someone with an army like the above.",How to Be Good at Warhammer," Unless you are fairly experienced with wargames already you probably won't be sure how you will want to play, but consider the options available and what is most beneficial to you not only in terms of how you play, but also in time and money spent collecting, assembling and painting the models.;
, However, if you are impatient and not willing to paint rank upon rank of Goblins to a gaming standard, you should probably collect a more elite army, like Ogres, or if you really really want Goblins you could always go for an average-sized army of mixed Orcs and Goblins. The same applies to 40k-it may not be the best idea to go for an infantry-heavy Imperial Guard or a horde of Tyranid gaunts if you can't stand painting, but that is not to say you can't have those units-just have a mix of ""horde"" and ""elite"" units.

, Find out who you will be battling and plan your army. Think about what army you are about to fight, about terrain if it is already decided, and anything else which your army will face in the coming battle.

, Is there any point in arming your special weapons squad with plasma guns over grenade launchers when fighting Orcs? What is more likely to win a fight against standard infantry, a 40-man regiment of Skaven Clanrats or a couple of Rat Ogres?

, Make sure you have a few games using different units and different strategies. Think about what works best for you. If you collect Imperial Guard and find the big stuff (Stormtroopers, ogryns, tanks, etc) work best for you, seriously consider a more elite army. This doesn't necessarily mean abandoning your Imperial Guard army! Many players will be happy for you to use Space Marines with your Imperial Guard, and it is perfectly acceptable to add Grey Knights-arguably the ultimate choice to be found in the Troops section of any codex in 40k-to your army. Alternatively, you may find your Genestealer-heavy Tyranid army has too few men in it-add Gaunts, lots and lots of Gaunts!!!

, You can also specialize your army to your style of play without changing the actual army-for example, Chaos are commonly seen as being a close combat army. This needn't be the case, just dedicate it to Tzeentch and you're one giant step on the way to dominating the shooting phase against any foe!

, This is, oddly enough, very important to mastering the art of warhammer. In the last step I focused mainly of 40k, so this time I shall focus mainly on warhammer-commoly known as warhammer fantasy battles, or warhammer fantasy. If you have been collecting Bretonnians for the past year or so and now have well over 2000 points, starting afresh with a completely different army can work wonders. During the time you have collected a balanced army of Brettonians, chances are you are used to a fast, heavy and very hard hitting army, backed by a fairly large number of peasants. You rarely outnumber your foe, but if you have a good balance of Knights and peasants you should find you are rarely outnumbered by more than 2-to-1, even by goblin or skaven hordes! Now let's say you have changed to collecting Dwarfs. Not any old dwarves though, these are shooty dwarves, with as many guns as you can fit into the army with an almost total disregard for dedicated combat troops. You are now faced with a completely different situation. You are likely to be even more outnumber than before with no extra-cheap peasants to back you up, you have no dedicated combat troops (though that's not to say your average Thunderer is useless in combat), and worst of all you are SLOW!!! On a more positive note, however, you find that the more guns you put into your army, the less enemies seem to reach you, as they are all gunned down before they can reach your lines.

, Not only that, but when using your shooty Dwarves against a balanced army of Brettonians, there's every chance you know what your opponent is thinking, and what tricks they have up their sleeves (which should be none, being the most honourable people in the warhammer world).

also remember to think before you move."

Decide where you are going to play the game.,
Resolve not to be worried by the phrase ""Toy Soldiers"".,
Go to a toy store and look at what they have.,
A simple example is the American Civil War, for which is is fairly easy to find a useful range of figures for both sides.,
For each side you need to organise the figures into units, and it helps to glue groups of models to card bases.,
For the battleground, you have a table with a hill in the middle; this could be made from a few magazines, and looks best when covered by a green cloth.,
Movement: The bases of a unit must start and end each move in contact with each other.,
Firing: All the bases of a unit must fire at the same enemy unit, which must be within range and visible.,
Fighting: If 2 bases end the turn In Contact (within 1 inch of each other) they Fight.,
Morale: Most battles are decided by soldiers running away, rather than by being killed.",How to Find and Use Inexpensive Scale Models for Wargames," This style of gaming needs a large level space which will be undisturbed for the duration of the game.;
, The models which are sold as toys can be quite accurate in scale, and protesting isn't going to do much good anyway. Besides, they're cheap.

, You're looking for sets of plastic figures, about an inch high, rather than much more expensive products such as Warhammer (which is otherwise a good start}. Each set will have a mix of models of a particular sort, and you need two different packs, based on the same history and from opposing sides. Yes, it helps to know a little history.

, For each side, start with two packs on Infantry (troops on foot), one of Cavalry (troops on horses), and one artillery piece (a cannon with crew). If you're lucky, the figures for the Union Army will be moulded in blue plastic and the figures for the Confederate Army will be moulded in grey. Otherwise, you can paint the figurines yourself to suit your battle., Make all the bases 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) wide. The base for the artillery should be square. Those for infantry and cavalry should be deep enough, front to back, for one figure. The bases are wide enough for 5 infantry, side by side, or 2 cavalry. An infantry unit has 30 figures and the cavalry 12, 6 bases each. It looks better if the figure on an infantry base have the same pose. You can have special figures, such as an officer and a standard bearer (the soldier carrying the flag) on a base.

, The two sides will start from opposite corners of the table. The rules for the game follow. You need a ruler and some ordinary 6-sided dice.

, All units may move OR fire every turn. If bases are in contact with enemy bases after movement, they must fight. Infantry may move up to 6 inches (15.2 cm), Cavalry up to 12 inches (30.5 cm), and Artillery up to 3 inches (7.6 cm). Infantry or Cavalry with all the bases of the unit lined up one behind the other are In Column and may move an extra 3 inches (7.6 cm) but cannot fire. Artillery may be Limbered and also move an extra 3 inches (7.6 cm), but must unlimber, taking one turn, before they can fire.

, Artillery and Infantry can fire at enemy within 24 inches (61.0 cm), while Cavalry can fire 12 inches (30.5 cm). If a base is within 6 inches (15.2 cm) of the enemy, but not In Contact, it may fire as if it were two bases. No base may fire through another base or through the hill, nor can it fire sideways or backwards. Each base which fires rolls a 6-sided dice, and a score of 6 is a kill, which removes one enemy base, if it was within range and visible.

, Each base involved rolls 1 dice. A 6 Kills an enemy base. A base attacked from the side subtracts 2 from its score, one attacked from the rear subtracts 4. A base which has a lower score than any of its opponents must Fall Back, moving 3 inches (7.6 cm) back in its next turn (which means it cannot fire). This is the only exception to the need for bases of the same unit to remain In Contact with each other.

, If a base Falls Back, or a Unit has a base Killed or Runs Away, roll one dice, and subtract the number of bases the unit has already lost. A score of 1 or less means that the base Runs Away, or if rolling for the whole unit, the unit Runs Away. Any base or unit which Runs Away is removed from the table.

Determine the dimensions of the Workbench.,
Find a bench top.,
Cut four legs from 4x4s.,
Cut four leg braces from 2x4s.,
Position each top leg brace on a pair of legs.,
Bolt each top leg brace to a pair of legs.,
Bolt the bottom two leg braces to the legs.,
Cut two top supports from 2x4s.,
Bolt the top supports into place.,
Attach the Workbench top.,
Attach a low shelf if desired.,
Finish the bench if desired.",How to Build a Garage Work Bench1," Measure the desired length, width, and height relative to your work space and write these dimensions down.






;
, You can use thick, wooden, butcher-block-style Workbench tops (which are quite pricey), thin, hard, wooden sheets for industrial bench tops (which are more affordable), or a few pieces of plywood stacked on top of each other. For a thick, sturdy, affordable alternative, salvage a solid-core door; check your local listings, find a rebuilding center, or even ask around at a building undergoing renovation. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the Workbench should be flat and sturdy.









Cut the bench top to size if necessary.

, The length of each leg should be the desired height of the bench minus the thickness of the bench top.








, If you want the top of the Workbench to be flush with the frame underneath it (which you will be building in Steps 8 and 9), each brace should be equal to the width of the bench top minus the width of two 2x4s; however, if you’d like the frame to jut slightly out from underneath the bench top, which can be useful for storing clamps, for example, cut the braces to same length as the width of the bench top.









Since 2x4s aren’t actually 2 x 4 inches and can sometimes even vary in thickness, measure the (skinny) width of your 2x4s for a precise cut.

, Lay down two of the 4x4s perfectly parallel to one other so that the distance from the outside left edge to the outside right edge equals the length of the brace. Lay one leg brace across them so that it is flush with both the sides and (what will eventually be) the tops of the legs. Repeat on the other leg pair.








, Using a 3/8-inch (10-mm) drill bit, drill two holes clear through both the 2x4 and the 4x4. Make sure to drill the holes at a diagonal from each other (i.e. one at the top left, one at the bottom right) so that you will later be able to fit a third bolt into the space between. Moving from the 2x4 to the 4x4, slide bolts through the pre-drilled holes. Close them by sliding washers over the ends and holding them in place with nuts, which you can tighten with a wrench. When you’re done, the bolt ends should stick out of the 4x4s. Repeat on the remaining leg pair.








, Flip one of the leg pairs over and repeat the process you followed in Steps 7 and 8 with another brace; however, instead of lining the brace up with (what will eventually be) the bottoms of the legs, raise them a few inches so that they won’t sit flush with the floor. When you’re done, you will have a top brace at the top of one side of each leg pair and a bottom brace near the bottom of the other side of each leg pair.









If you would like to build a low shelf across the bottom braces, position them accordingly provided that they do not rise above 1/3 of the height of the legs; the lower the braces, the more stable the bench will be.

, Each support should equal the length of the bench top.








, Lay the leg pairs down with the top braces facing outwards (i.e. away from one another) so that the distance from the outside left edge to the outside right edge equals the length of the top support. Place one of the top supports across the leg pairs so that it lines up with the top braces. Pre-drill a hole through the top support and into the 4x4 on either side (making sure to drill between the existing bolts) and then bolt the support into place with coach bolts. Flip the structure over and repeat on the other side. When you’re done, your four legs should be surrounded by a frame at the top.








, Lay the piece(s) in place and pre-drill bolt holes downward through the underlying supports where necessary. Screw coach bolts into place to secure.









If you have a thick bench top, consider bolting from the bottom up; this will keep the bench top smooth and bolt-free. However, only do this if the bench top is thick enough that it won’t risk popping off of the bolt ends.

, Simply measure the dimensions between all four legs, cut a shelf to this size from your desired material (ex. plywood), and screw into place.








, Sand the wood smooth and apply stain, varnish, polyurethane, etc.

Select two pieces of lumber you intend to fit.,
Mark the tenon cut.,
Set your saw to the depth you need so the blade will not over-cut and weaken the tenon before cutting the first square crosscut.

,
Cut each side or face of your board, being careful to make sure the cut follows the line.,
Chisel or rip cut the two side of the board, so only the tenon is left on the end.

,
Mark your mortise on the second board.,
Test fit the tenon into the mortise to make sure the mortise is wide and deep enough for the joint to fit correctly.,
Clamp the two pieces together after gluing and fitting to hold them in place until the glue is completely dried and cured.

",How to Cut a Mortise and Tenon," For the examples in this article, standard 2X4 dimension lumber is used.;
, For the greatest strength, you will want the tenon to be one third of the overall thickness of the smaller of the two members being joined.

,, Any errors here will be visible when the two pieces are joined later.

,, It should be wide enough for the tenon to fit into it, but not loosely. For a blind mortise, you will need to drill a hole on each end of the mortise then chisel the wood out between these two holes with a wood chisel, but if the edge of the board you are tenoning into is not exposed, you can simply saw out the mortise with a circular saw.

, Apply glue to the tenon, then join the two pieces together for the permanent assembly.

Attach a long 2x4 (38×89 mm) horizontally to the wall studs.,
Attach another piece of timber of the same dimensions below the first one.,
Attach the shelf brackets to the two strips.,
Cut 3/4-in (2-cm) thick plywood into 2-ft (.6-m) wide planks.,
Place another strip across the top of the shelf and screw into the wall studs.








,
Apply a front strip along the bottom edge of the shelf.,
Attach drawers to the underside of the shelf.",How to Build a Garage Work Bench2," (If your wall is solid brick, stone, etc., this method will not help you). The length of the 2x4 will be the length of the workbench and should be sized accordingly. (In this example, we are using a 16-foot / 4.8-meter piece.) Use a spirit level to make sure that this is attached horizontally.









Depending on the steel shelf brackets you have (and how far the hole is from the bend in the bracket), you may need a 2x6 (38×140 mm) instead.
The top of the 2x4 strip in this example is 3 to 3.5 feet (approximately 1 meter) off the ground. If you need park a vehicle in your garage and it needs to fit underneath the shelf, account for any additional clearance required (i.e. your vehicle's hood).
Use 2.5-in / 6.5 cm screws (or 3-in / 7.5-cm screws if going through drywall) to attach the 4-in (89-mm) flat face against the garage wall studs.

, The gap between the two parallel strips should be determined by the length of the steel shelf bracket.








, The heavier duty the shelf bracket, the better. The top of the bracket is flush with the top surface of the upper strip. Use a plywood piece on top (a temporary shelf) and then butt the shelf bracket against it. Use 1.5-in (3.8-cm) screws to then attach the brackets. You will end up with two strips against the wall with a row of shelf brackets attached to them. The shelf brackets should be spaced approximately 2 feet (.6 meters) apart.









If desired, shelf brackets can be alternated; heavy duty, lighter duty, heavy duty, etc. in order to accommodate toolbox placement and to be able to comfortably pull up a chair underneath the workbench.

, A 4x8 ft (1.2 x 2.4 m) sheet will work well for this purpose. Place one of the planks on the shelf brackets and screw the plank to the upper strip at the top/rear. Place the second plank next to (left or right of) the first one and join the two end-to-end with a 6 in (15.25cm) x 18 in (45.7 cm) piece of plywood underneath the two plank ends.








,, Glue and screw a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) by 3/4 in (1.9 cm) maple strip that's as long as your shelf. This strengthens the Workbench top while absorbing wear and tear.








, These thin drawers will accommodate any small tools you may have. The drawers should be 2 feet (.6 meter) wide, have a depth of 1.5 in (3.8 cm), and stretch 18 in (45.7 cm) to the back. To make and attach the shelves:









1x4 ((19×89 mm) pine strips can be attached to the bottom of the shelf. The short part of the strip can be attached with glue and screws to the plywood sheet.
Attach metal drawer slides to the strips.
Construct drawers with a hardboard base and pine sides (1x2in or 2.5 by 5 cm). Edges hold the matching drawer slides. These drawer boxes are then slid into the pine strips that are attached to your plywood plank.

Use 3-inch wood screws to attach the rack to the studs in the wall.",How to Build Wine Racks," While you can always adjust the dimensions to fit your rack, the following tutorial will hold six bottles and six wine glasses. You can use any solid, easily worked wood you like, depending on your style preferences. You will need:


You need one – 2×4 by 8-foot-long board
You need two 1×4 by 8-foot-long boards;
, If you have a woodworking shop, you likely have almost everything already. Still, check the following list before starting:









Saw – (miter saw, circular saw, or hand saw)
Drill
Orbital sander (220 grit paper)
Jigsaw
Air nailer or hammer and nails
Wood clamp
3/8-inch bit and 5/64-inch drill bit
Carpenters square
Tape measure

, You can use a circular saw, hand saw, or miter saw. You want to end up with seven total boards, cutting as follows:









Cut five (5) boards to 30"" long a piece.
One (1) board to 27"" long
Two (2) boards at just 2"" long.

, You'll have three separate pieces of 2x4, giving you a total of eleven cut pieces of wood when you're done. After making all of your cuts, briefly use the orbital sander to remove any rough edges. The 2x4 should be cut to:









Two (2) boards at 11"" long.
One (1) board at 10¼"" long.

, You want a simple curve on one end of each board, on the long flat side. You'll be cutting a rounded triangle off of the top corner of each 2x4.








, Move slowly to cut the curve as purposely as possible. When done, sand down the edges.









Each 2x4 will have one rounded edge and one squared edge. It looks a little like the front car of a train.

, This is to hold your wine glasses. Just to be safe, center the glasses on the following marks to ensure that your specific glasses fit next to each other. You should make the following 12 marks.










Measuring from the left edge:

Mark the wood at 4 inch, 8 ¼ inch, and 12 ¾ inches.



Measuring from the right edge:

Mark the wood at 4 inch, 8 ¼ inch, and 12 ¾ inches



, Go to each 4"" mark, then measure in from the edge 2"". If it helps, use your straightedge to first draw a horizontal line at each measurement, then place the 2"" mark on each measurement.








, Clamp the board to your workbench before drilling. These holes will be the tops of each notch for holding the wine glasses. Drill down as straight as possible.








, You'll basically be making six ""H"" shapes on the board, but the drilled hole will form the horizontal bridge in the middle. Line up your straight edge along each side of the hole and draw two lines across the width of the board. You'll make 12 lines in total.









The 2"" measurement should be above the drill hole, with extra room below.

, Do not come from the 2"" line, come up from the bottom. If you cut a little wider than your lines, that is fine -- it is better to err on the side of wider than narrower. Your wine glasses will slide into this upside-down, as the bottom will hold up the glass. The stems need to fit into these notches.









Just cut straight up to the hole you drilled -- the notches of wood should fall right out.
When done, use the orbital sander again to smooth out the new cuts.

, Stand the 2x4s up so that rounded edge points to the ceiling, then fit the 27"" between them so that it lays flush between the boards. Then center the 10¼"" on the plank in the middle.









The center is at 15"" from either side of the long board.

, You can use a variety of methods, all of which require wood glue. Use your square to ensure each joint is 90-degrees. Place a generous amount of glue on each joint, clamp them together, and then adhere the wood using whatever method you prefer:









Nail gun, or hammer and nails. Use at least 2 nails per joint.
Screws and power drill. Be sure to pre-drill the holes to prevent the wood from splitting.
Pocket holes and a Kreg jig (1-1/2"")

, The three curved sections should curve away from the back so that the highest section of the 2x4's is the top and back of the finished rack. Turn the rack over, then liberally apply wood glue to the back of each 2x4 and the bottom panel. Place your three boards evenly on the back, then use a nail gun or hammer and nails to tack all three boards in place.








, Turn the rack over, then lay the 1x4 over the front of the rack so that it is flush to the bottom. This board keeps the wine from falling out of the rack.









Again, use wood glue, line up the board, then tack it in place with the nail gun.

, These will for them ""feet"" of the wineglass. Turn the rack so that you can see the bottom of it. Glue up one side of the small square boards and then place them on the bottom two corners, so that the rack has two ""feet"" on the bottom right and bottom left. After gluing, use a nail in each corner to bind the feet to the rack.









The ""bottom"" corners are the two closest to the back of the rack, where you have the three 30"" boards.

, It will be flush with bottom of the wine rack. Simply line up the wine glass holder with the bottom of the rack, then glue and nail it to the feet, There should be 1"" of space between the bottom of the rack and the top of the notched glass holder.









Test a couple of glasses in the holder before attaching anything to make sure they fit.

, Give the rack 2-3 hours to dry, just to be safe. Then run your orbital sander over everything to smooth it out and get rid of any excess wood glue. When done, you can finish it any way you like -- painting, finishing, staining, etc.








, You'll need to drill some pilot holes into your rack, but you can't if you' don't know how far apart the studs are. Most are 16"" apart -- but check your wall with a stud finder as well.








, To find the center, simply measure the middle of the middle board in the back -- it will be 1-¾"" from either edge. For a normal wall, drill two holes 16"" apart from each other along this middle board.








, Follow your pilot holes, and make sure you hit the studs. Your wine rack is done!

Get a couple of suitable boards for your project.,
Set up a work table or other surface to measure and cut the lumber on.,
Rip the lumber in half if you are using 2X6 boards and they do not have big knots or have to support a great deal of weight.,
Measure the length of the legs to a comfortable working height.,
Cut a bevel on the first leg when you cut it to length.,
Cut the back or top board of your horse, which will be sawed square on both ends, about 42-48 inches (107-122cm) long.,
Lay the back board on a flat surface, whether a work table, on a smooth floor, or even on the tailgate of a pickup truck.,
Nail both legs on one side of the top board, then flip the assembly over.,
Stand your partially assembled horses upright, and measure down from the bottom of your top board about 8 inches (20cm), and using a short board, scribe it to be a horizontal spreader brace to fit between the legs.,
Nail your braces in place, using two 12d nails in each end, going first through the leg, and into the end-grain of the brace.,
Flip the horse back over on its top board, and prop it in place or have someone hold it.,
Nail these braces in place, with the end cut on a 45 degree angle butted into the spreader brace and nailed through from the brace into the end grain, and the scribed end to the underside of the top board.,
Check your horses to make sure the legs are equal in length and fit the ground evenly, if not, you can trim the legs that are long, making sure the top board is parallel to the ground.








,
Finished.








",How to Build a Saw Horse," 2X6 nominal southern yellow pine was used for the horses in the illustrations, and was ripped down, or split to make the finished product lighter in weight, but 2X4 (no ripping) using lodgepole or white pine, or spruce will also work. For horses that are to be left outdoors in the weather, it may be worthwhile to buy lumber that is treated to resist rot and insects.






;
, Since you are building the saw horses, it can be assumed you don't already have a set available, but if you do, of course use them.








, This will reduce the total weight and amount of lumber required by half (compared to 2x6). For using full sized 2X4s, skip this step.








, For a typical 6 foot (1.8m) tall worker, 34-36 inches (.86-.91m) is about right, for shorter individuals, you may need to adjust the height. It is suggested you build your horses a bit tall, since the legs can be trimmed when they are complete to fit the user.








, For a good spread on the horse's legs, an angle of about 65 degrees from the square line, or 25 degrees from the board's edge should work nicely; those angles do and should total 90 degrees. You will want to note, you are cutting this bevel square to the narrow edge of your board, so you may find you need to mark both top and bottom, and recut through from the bottom to get all the way through the board. These cuts need to be flat (and straight), so they will fit against the top board flush and tightly.








, Make a mark an inch or so from each end, and draw a square line to determine where to attach the legs, on both sides.








, Position your first leg on the square mark made previously, and nail it so the bevel is set tightly against the edge of the top board. Blunting the point of your nails will decrease the likelihood the wood will split when it is nailed, and using an 8d (8 penny) nail for this will give sufficient holding power without passing through both pieces.








, Nail the other two legs opposite to the first pair. You can use larger nails now, since if the points project through, they will go into the back of the first pair of legs and increase the strength of this joint.








, The angles on these braces should be roughly degrees 115 top and 65 bottom for total of 180 degrees, but scribing all of the braces in position will provide a better (more exact) fit. Use your scribed brace as a pattern to mark three additional pieces, making sure you have two for each Sawhorse.









The 65 degree angle is called ""25 from square"" because you can find a 65 angle by marking ""25 off from 90"" using a tool called a 90 degree ""rafter angle square,"" or ""speed square"" or similar instrument.

,
~ Nail the braces on each pair of legs carefully, making sure they position the legs so the horse stands flat and straight on level ground.
~ Nailing these braces out of position will mean the horse will wobble and be unsteady.
~ Holding the horse upright and straight while nailing is worth the effort.








, Cut another board about 18 inches (46cm) long, with a 45 degree angle on one end as the diagonal brace. Hold the angled end against the spreader brace and scribe the other end where it intersects the top board, then cut this mark. Use this piece for your pattern and for a pair of horses, cut 3 more.








, This will be nailed across the grain into the bottom of the top board, so use nails that are large enough to get a good bite, at least 12d, and blunt the ends to prevent the wood from splitting.

Choose your pattern.,
Choose your wood.,
Trace your pattern.,
Make a stop cut.,
Cut the background.,
Cut the next level of outlines.,
Add detail.,
Sand your piece.,
Add stain and finish.",How to Begin Woodcarving with a Utility Knife," The first part of any woodcarving project is deciding what to carve. There are many places you can find good pattern books, such as hobby shops and the internet, or you can draw your own.;
, There are a lot of different types of wood providing a wide variety of color and grain textures. Some basic woods can be found at your local hardware store, while more exotic woods can be found at hobby shops, specialty wood stores and on the internet. Some woods are better suited for some projects than others. For your first carving, it is best to use a soft wood like pine, bass or soft maple (available at most hardware stores). If you can easily mark the wood with your fingernail, it is probably soft.

, Using a stylus and a piece of carbon paper, which can be found at an office/stationery supply store, trace the pattern you have selected. Try not to move the pattern until it is completely traced, or it may get a little disjointed. It is often helpful to tape the pattern to the wood with small pieces of masking tape.

, Take your utility blade and cut around the outline of the pattern. This prevents unwanted chipping and helps your outlines to look clean.

, With your blade at a shallow angle, cut the wood around the outline of the pattern. In this case, it would be the petals, stem and leaves.

, Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each level of detail. In this case, it would be the flower petals. Continue doing this until all of the lines are cut. Be careful to pay attention to which side of each line you want to cut; you want to cut the side that will appear farther away.

, Now that the basic outlines are cut, add detail that creates the illusion of depth and texture. For our pattern, this detail includes:



Rounding edges: Lightly cut the corners off the sharp outlines to provide a smooth transition.

Thumbprint type cut in the petals: To add dimension to the otherwise flat petals, cut circular gouges in each one, holding the utility blade at a very shallow angle and pivoting it about the tip. Don’t worry if it looks a little sloppy, as this will be smoothed out later.
Adding levels to the leaves: Cut the portion that is farther back - this gives the illusion of a portion of the leaf folding over itself.

Adding veins to the leaves: This requires two cuts per vein, a stop cut and then another cut at a steep angle to create a long thin gouge in the wood.

, Once details are cut, they can be smoothed and cleaned up by using bits of fine grit sandpaper to smooth the cut marks so the carving has a uniform surface.

, Adding stain to your piece can add depth and texture, bringing out nuances in the carving that would not be as visible without the stain. Protect the wood from the elements with a varnish or sealer. The extra gloss can also give it a more professional look.

Consider the requirements of a bat box:
Bats need enough space for a small colony.,
Review several plans.,Gather materials and tools and clear a suitable workspace.,Think about the work plan; you will measure, cut and fit materials, and then assemble.",How to Build a Bat Box1,"
They need a place to land to enter the box.
They need rough surfaces to cling to.
They need an airtight enclosure as they will regulate the interior heat by moving up or down in the chamber.
The box should be installed in the right location (somewhere where they will get 4-5 hours of morning sun, 15-20 feet above the ground).;

Get real juggling scarfs.,
Throw scarfs at eye height.",How to Juggle Scarves1," It is hard to juggle normal scarfs as they are large and not made for that purpose. Instead see if you can get your hands on proper juggling scarfs. You might live close to a physical shop that sells circus equipment, but if not use internet sites like eBay or Amazon. Alternatively, you could try making your own out of an old scarf.
, Every time you throw a scarf make sure that its peak is always at your eye level."

Know how to throw the balls.,
Practice with each hand.,
Put the moves together.,
Try an asynchronous Fountain.",How to Juggle Four Balls1," The most basic four ball jugging move is the Fountain. To start, you need four balls. When you throw them in the air, you need to throw them slightly to the outside. The side you throw the ball to will vary depending on the hand that the ball is in. If the ball is in the left hand, you will throw the ball toward the left side. If you have the ball in your right hand, you will throw it to the right.


This move give momentum to the balls and also creates space for the other balls to fly in the air.;
, Now that you know the way to throw the balls, you need to start practicing with each hand. Hold two balls with your right hand. Moving your hand in a clockwise circle, throw one ball in the air. After you let one ball go, move your hand in the clockwise circle with the other ball still in your hand. As you round the bottom curve of the circle, let go of the second ball. Then, as you crest the top of the circle, catch the first ball. Continue to make the circle with the first ball now in your hand and the second in the air. Continue the pattern, alternating balls and keeping the momentum going.


Once you've grown comfortable with your right hand, try your left. For your left hand, you complete the same steps, but move your hand in a counterclockwise direction.If you are left handed, you might want to start with the left instead. Your dominant hand will likely be more coordinated than your non-dominant hand.

, Once you have mastered each hand, it is time to put the two motions together in a synchronous Fountain. Start with two balls in each hand. Start moving your hand in the circular motions you practiced. When your hands reach the center, let go of one of each of the balls and continue to move your hands around the circle. When you are cresting the bottom of the circle, let go of each of the second balls and then catch the first balls as you round the circles. Keep going as long as you can.


To stop, just catch two balls in each hand.
If you have a hard time doing this for long periods of time, try doing two or four circles before stopping. Then work up to six, eight, and ten. Before long, you'll be able to juggle without interruption.
The basic four-ball pattern is really each hand handling two balls. A ball never goes from one hand to the other., In addition to the synchronous Fountain, you can also try an asynchronous Fountain. Instead of releasing the balls at the same time, move them in opposite positions at the same time. When one of your hands is releasing the ball, the other should be catching a ball. In other words, when the left hand moves up to throw a ball, the right hand is going down after just catching a ball.


Interleaving the hand timing makes the pattern look more like a real fountain. This also allows you to throw the balls closer together in the center. This sells the cascade illusion more effectively."

Juggle Columns.,
Try the Shower.,
Do the Wimpy.,
Learn the Windmill.",How to Juggle Four Balls2," In additional to the basic Fountain, there are other four ball juggle moves that are fun to do. Start with two balls in each hand. Throw the ball on the right side of each hand straight up in the air. Move your hand slightly to the left. Right before the first balls come back to your hands, throw the second ball in each hand straight up in the air. Then, move your hand back toward the right and catch the first ball.


To keep the columns going, throw the balls back straight in the air before the second balls fall back in your hands.
Unlike the Fountain, your hands move back and forth from side to side instead of in a circle.
You can also do an asynchronous column as well. Instead of throwing your balls at the same time, stagger the timing where one of your hands is releasing and throwing the balls in the air while the other is catching., Start with two balls in each hand. With your left hand, throw a ball in a large arch from the outside to your right hand. At the same time, with your right hand, throw a ball directly to your left hand across the inside before catching the ball coming down from the arch. There will always be at least two balls in the air, though there will be three as you thrown the ball from right to left.You can also do a Half-Shower. To do this, instead of throwing the ball directly from the right hand to the left, throw it in a small arch across the inside between your hands., Start with two balls in each hand. Instead of keeping two balls on each side, you are going to switch balls between your hands. To do this, one of your balls needs to be thrown a bit higher than the other. Your hands should circle in mirror images of each other, where they each go to the outside and inside at the same time. Pick one of the balls in each hand and circle your hands. As you hit the center area, throw one of the balls in each hand towards your other hand, throwing one higher than the other.


Continue the circle with your hand and, as you make your way back towards the center, throw the second ball in each hand into the air towards the other side, again throwing one higher than the other. As you make your way across the top of the circle with your hands, you should catch the first ball thrown from the opposite hand.
As you move your hands in circles, the balls will keep changing hands as you throw them towards the other hand.
You can choose which ever hand you want to throw higher. Some prefer their non-dominant hand instead of their dominant. You can figure out which feels the best for you., The Windmill is a distorted version of the basic Fountain, but is more complicated. Instead of keeping your hands in a circular pattern, you cross your arms under one another. Start with two balls in each hand. With your right hand, throw one of the ball into the air toward the left side. Cross your arms in front of you, moving your left hand under your right arm and throwing one of those balls in the air in the same direction as the first.


With two balls in the air, uncross your arms and move your right hand back to where it first threw the first ball. Throw the second ball from your right hand. Crossing your arms again, grab the first ball with your right hand and throw the second ball with your left. Uncross your arms again, catching the first ball in your left hand and throwing the first ball from your right hand again.
Like the fountain, your balls will not change hands. You keep throwing the same two balls with each hand, you just interlace the actions with each other by crossing your arms.
If you are left handed, you may want to switch the actions where you cross your right arm under your left and throw the large arch with your left hand. Just do what feels right for you.
If you find this move difficult, try the three ball Windmill first."

Loosely cradle a ball in one hand, keeping it low and at your side. Using your elbow and not your wrist, toss the ball up into a high arc, aiming to brush your forehead., Watch the ball as it moves through the air, and slightly adjust your other hand so that the ball will land in it. Repeat this until you can comfortably throw and catch the ball without struggling., Hold one ball in each hand, and then throw one of them up into the air as you do when you only have one ball. When the ball you threw begins to descend, toss the second ball up and across in the opposite direction., Catch the first ball you threw in the opposite hand you threw it from. Catch the second ball you threw in the opposite hand you threw it from. Practice throwing and catching the two balls like this until it feels easy., Hold two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Start the same way you do when throwing two balls, but this time when the second ball is falling into your dominant hand, throw the third ball up. Catch the balls. You should have one in your dominant hand and two in your non-dominant hand., Repeat this process until you’re comfortable with continuing the sequence over and over again without pausing in between to catch all three. This is called the three ball cascade., Continue practicing the three ball cascade, but increase the height that you’re throwing at to better resemble the height of the five ball cascade.While having the balls peak at the top of your head is a good height for juggling with three balls, juggling with five balls requires that the balls peak about a foot above your head., When doing the three ball cascade, empty your hands quicker than usual by making three quick tosses. Clap your hands once before catching the balls and returning to the three ball cascade.This will help you develop the quickness needed when juggling a higher quantity., Start with two balls in each hand. Throw one ball from your non-dominant hand, followed by two consecutive throws from your dominant hand. As the second ball thrown (first from your dominant hand) begins to approach your non-dominant hand, make room to catch it by tossing the last ball up. Catch the balls. There should be three in one hand and one in the other., Start with two balls in each hand. Throw one ball from your dominant hand, one ball from your non-dominant, and then the second ball from your dominant. At this point, you’ll have three balls in the air and one still held in your hand. As the first ball you threw approaches your non-dominant hand, throw your last ball horizontally to your dominant hand. Catch the first ball in your non-dominant followed by the others., Starting with two balls in each hand, throw one ball from your dominant hand and then throw one ball from your non-dominant hand. Throw the other ball from your dominant hand and then the last ball from your non-dominant hand. Catch two balls in one hand and two balls in the other., Start with three balls in your dominant hand and two balls in your other hand. Throw one ball in a high arc from your dominant hand, one ball from your non-dominant hand, and one more from your dominant hand. You should have one ball in each hand and three in the air at this point., As the first ball you threw approaches your non-dominant hand, make a throw from your non-dominant hand to make room for the ball to be caught. Then, throw one ball from your dominant hand to make room for the next ball to be caught., Catch all five balls in your hands so that the balls are similar to how they started at the beginning of the sequence. Start the sequence over again, take the same steps, and pause again when all five balls fall back into your hands. Continue practicing this until you feel confident., Once you’re able to throw and catch all five balls in the five ball cascade sequence without dropping them or losing control, omit the pause. Instead of pausing to catch all five balls at the sequence’s end, keep adding throws in the pattern one by one for as long as you can."

Shake off your torches.,
Light the torches.,
Juggle!,
When you fumble a torch, let it fall.",How to Juggle Fire," If you want to juggle fire at night when it's more impressive (you do), then you should practice juggling ordinary clubs at night. If you're busy at night or it's daytime and you're impatient, close your eyes. When you juggle fire, it's a lot harder to see the handle because it's just not nearly as bright as the fire. Imagine juggling with clubs whose handles are basically invisible.;
, No matter how safe you assure people this is, some people just naturally worry about their building or wildlife catching on fire. In general, do not do this inside, near dry grass, on school grounds, or in a crowded area.

, And put your bucket in a larger bucket. Dipping your torches into a bucket of fuel is a lot easier than trying to squirt it on. Any fuel that drips off your torches should run into the bottom of the larger bucket. Put a lid on your fuel to prevent it from drying up., A fire extinguisher and a bucket of water are good, but it's also a good idea to have spotters on hand with fire blankets just in case. They are commonly called duvetyne blankets. You probably won't need them but just in case.

, After dipping in the fuel, give them a good shake. Aim this shake toward the ground! If you don't do this, you run the risk of splattering everyone with fire. Do this away from where you plan to be lighting the torches. You don't want to accidentally drop and end up setting the ground around you alight.

, Light one torch first, either with a lighter or from someone else' torch. Hold it in front of you, pointed up, and light the other two.

, If you do this right, you will now be confronted with spinning fire right in front of your face. Don't be afraid of this. Juggle normally, and concentrate on your catches.

, Picking up a fallen torch is a lot more fun than catching the fire in your hand. Get out of the way.

Using a solid ball will frustrate the student because it will roll away when they drop. Similarly, a ball that bounces can be mayhem for the beginner. For this reason, choose a beanbag or beanball that will stay put when it is dropped.


Choose the weight carefully. Anything over 8 ounces (226 g) will become really heavy after prolonged juggling. Something that is too light will also be difficult to juggle.
It will help if the objects are brightly colored and contrast with themselves and the surroundings.
If you need lots of props for a larger class, see how to make balloon juggling bags, how to make juggling balls from tennis balls, and how to make your own juggling clubs.;
, Your student might be disappointed by this since there's no fun in simply throwing an object from one hand to the other, but it will help to remind him or her that when juggling three balls, you are actually only throwing one ball at a time, while holding the other two.

,


The ball should pop off your student's hand rather than rolling off their fingertips. Watch the ball as it flies from one hand to the other. If it is spinning, your student is throwing incorrectly.
When juggling balls, they don't simply travel back and forth in the same arc. They travel in a figure-8 pattern, with the hand carrying them from outside to inside. If they traveled in the same arc, they would hit each other.

, Still only using one ball, encourage your student to toss back and forth and to keep the ball on a plane in front of him or her. Your student should not have to reach out or in to make a catch.

, The hands should remain level, slightly above the beltline. The elbows should be bent 90 degrees. The throw should come from the forearm and not the wrist, so encourage your student to keep their wrists locked.

, This is the most important step, as you will now be teaching the exchange. This is the nearly simultaneous catch and throw that is at the foundation of juggling. Have your student start with one ball in each hand. Throw from the weak hand (left if right handed, right if left handed) and as the throw begins to come down toward the opposing hand, toss the second ball.


If done correctly, the hand motion for the throw should leave the palm in perfect position to catch the first ball. The second throw should sweep under the first.
Most people already know how to catch. Now is the time to work on getting the throw under control. If someone is particularly timid about their ability to catch, especially as they begin to learn the exchange, encourage them to practice the throws while letting the balls drop to the ground.
Both balls should remain in the same plane. The second ball should pass underneath the first.

, At this point your student will be eager to move on and get to the three ball juggle, but you should encourage them to work on the two ball exchange until every throw is going to about the same height.

, Juggling is an ambidextrous skill, so as soon as your student gets the exchange down with their strong hand, have them switch to the other hand. Your student will still be using only two balls, but will make the first throw with their strong hand and the exchange with the weak hand.

, Once the student is exchanging the ball well with both hands, they are ready to take the next step. Pat your student on the back and tell them that they've already learned to juggle. They might doubt that since they still haven't added the third ball yet, but the hardest part is over.


Have your student start with one ball in their weak hand and two in their strong hand.
Begin with a single throw from the strong hand and then make one exchange after the other.

, There is no substitute for repetition. This is where the skill of the teacher is really tested. Most students will give up before they master this basic pattern, but with plenty of encouragement and corrective advice, you can make all the difference.

One ball changing hands Pick one ball and just toss it from one hand to another.,
Two Ball Exchange Hold one ball in each hand.,
Know that once you can ""Do the Jug"" four times in a row or so, you've mastered the basics!,
A natural instinct is to always throw first with the dominant hand.",How to Juggle Two Balls," Don't toss too high or too far -- keep it right in front of you. Then toss it back to the other hand. Do this until it becomes comfortable or until you feel silly doing it. Return the ball to the other hand in the same fashion, toss it up into the air. Resist the urge to simply pass it across to your ""good"" hand. Tossing it back up into the air gives you that split-second you will soon need for the third ball.;
, Begin by tossing as before (you want to toss first from your dominant hand). Just after the first ball has peaked, reach up slightly to get it while tossing the other. The second toss (up-going) travels just the the inside of the down-coming balls path. Right after tossing the second ball you should catch the first. Do not toss too hard; keep them about eye-high. You will find that you are simply exchanging the one in the air for the one in your hand.


This is the basic trick to juggling, it is called ""The Jug"". The good news is - if you can do two, you can do three (you just don't know it yet). Keep practicing exchanging the one in the air for the one in your hand. One, two, catch, catch, stop. One, two, catch, catch, stop.

, At this point, you have the skills needed to to pick up that third ball and change that ""Jug"" into a ""Juggle"".

, Instead, try to alternate starting hand. This means always starting with the same ball.

,
Put the string under the diabolo.,
If the diabolo starts to tilt forward, bring your dominant hand back while continuing the up and down motion.

,
If the diabolo starts to tilt back, move dominant hand forward and your other hand back keeping both sticks level.,
Stay behind the diabolo's cup.,
Once you've gotten the basics down on handling a diabolo, it's time to learn how to throw and catch it:


To throw the diabolo, quickly open up both your left and right hands and toss the diabolo in the air.,
Start spinning your diabolo.

,
Make it go as fast as you can.

,
Throw it into the air about 2 feet (0.6 m) high.

,
Try to move your stick so that the axle will drop onto it.

,
Just let it spin.

,
Throw it back into the air and catch it on the string.

",How to Juggle a Diabolo," Hover your string horizontally.;
,, Roll it to the left for right handers or to the right for left handers. To keep it spinning:


Right-handers: Keep your left hand still and level and slightly tap your right hand up to keep the diabolo spinning.
Left-handers: Keep your right hand still and level and slightly tap your left hand up to keep the diabolo spinning.

,, Continue tapping.

, This ensures that the strings don't tangle and you remain in control of it. This may involve adjusting the direction you're facing or tapping the cups. By tapping the front/back with your stick, you can turn the diabolo.

,
To catch the diabolo, put the right/left stick in the air depending on whether you're right or left handed, and keep your opposite hand on a slight curve. Point the right/left stick up at the diabolo and it will catch onto the string. Try to make the string as taut as possible to make it easier to catch.

'The Cradle.,
Palm to Cradle Over the Edge (transfer)– Hold the ball in your open palm, set on the upper, meaty part between the third and second knuckles.,
Palm to Cradle Over the Tips (transfer)– Again, set the ball in the open palm as in step 2 but this time the ball will roll over the fingertips rather than the edge of the index finger.,
The Butterfly – This is the previous palm-to-cradle-fingertips transfer done back and forth rhythmically so that the ball travels in a fluid figure-eight or windshield wiper motion as it glides to-and-fro.,
Beyond - Many more transfers and passes exist and there are also isolation's: keeping the ball in one fixed spot in space while the hands grab, hold and flourish around it as the ball appears to hover.",How to Start Contact Juggling," Hold your favored hand out, palm down with fingers extended and touching. Dip the straightened middle finger down slightly to make a cradle for the ball. Place and leave the ball on top of the fingers near the second knuckles of the first, middle and ring fingers. Keep it there for several minutes at a time to get used to it. Move your hand around, up and down as the ball is cradled on top of it, adjusting for inertia. Find the cradle on the tops of both your hands and become very accustomed to the ball being there. This is intrinsic to contact juggling.;
, Now, keeping the fingers together and straight (but not tense), give the ball a very slight lift up and pivot your open hand inwards, still underneath the ball so that it rolls over the outer edge of your index finger and lands in the cradle position on the top of your hand. Hold it a few moments. Now rotate it back to your palm with the opposite pivoting motion, dropping the plane of your hand back down if you need to. Practice until the ball moves as little as possible while your hand moves under it. Eventually there will be ""sweet spots"" where you instinctively feel it and perform the move effortlessly.

, Hold the ball in your open palm with the fingers together and gesturing towards ten o'clock (left) or two o'clock (right), depending on which hand you're starting with (it should look like you’re about to shrug with one arm). Then, using your elbow for a counterbalance (get your upper arm working, too), steadily swing your open palm in towards you with a windshield-wiper, arching kind of motion and let the ball roll over the tips of the fingers (just between the first and middle fingers) and on to the cradle position (top of the hand). Once the ball comes to rest on the cradle, pivot/swing your arm in the same arc back to the starting position and allow the ball to pass back over the fingertips to the palm. The ball should ultimately go over without the fingers being spread too far apart, but get them further apart and make an actual track for awhile if you need to. You can also try learning this transfer with the ball first cradled in front of you and arc it out to the palm.

, The only difference is that your elbow should be free to move around a lot more to support a fluid motion. To get a well-rounded figure-eight, lift the ball in a small, inward curve from your palm as the ball passes over it back to the cradle. Start off slowly and deliberately so you can get used to the move and watch it. The butterfly looks its best, though, when done snug and sleek. Once you've really got it, try reversing the direction of the figure-eight.


On the outward motion of the butterfly (when the ball rolls on to the palm) be sure not to cup or grasp the ball before you roll it back over to the cradle. Even when in the palm, the ball should be visible.
Mastery of the butterfly leads to more flashy, intermediate moves such as the top to top butterfly pass.

, There are also arm rolls, elbow stalls, chest rolls and (for some very talented folks indeed) head, neck, back and shoulder rolls. Practiced contact jugglers also do many types of palm spinning, rotating multiple balls in the hands. The list goes on; if you can picture it, it can probably be done.

Make excuses.,

Show confidence and get back into your routine.,
Offer to teach hecklers to juggle.",How to Recover from a Drop in a Juggling Act," Practicing will make them second nature, so that you don't panic just because you've dropped something. A drop during practice is not the time to take a break. It's the time to practice your recoveries.
, If you haven't quite worked out all the kinks yet, or if a trick is really going to be difficult, you can flat out tell your audience that you may drop a couple of times during your act. Let them know you're relaxed about it, and they'll relax, too.

Tell your audience when a particularly difficult trick is coming. Say you're going to give yourself three tries. There is suspense (and therefore interest) in watching somebody do something that is difficult.

, Practice picking up a drop and getting back into your pattern or your group's pattern. If you are juggling with a group, it will help if everyone knows the basics of recovery, anyway., You can even turn a drop into an applause point this way. If you're comfortable having an audience member or another performer throw a prop back into your pattern, ask someone to do that for you. Or see if you can keep the remaining objects going while you kneel down to pick up a drop. Otherwise, learn some kick-ups.





 Scoop the ball onto one toe. You can get it there with your other foot.











To kick up a dropped ball with your feet, use one foot to scoop it onto the other toe. Then kick straight up and catch it. You can kick straight into your pattern if you practice.




 Hook your foot under the center of the club.











To kick up a dropped club, roll the middle of it onto your foot, with the bulb facing out away from you. Flex your foot up in a hook so the handle of the club touches your ankle, as shown. Then kick straight up quickly. The club will rotate on its own and land in your hand. This maneuver will take some practice, but it's worth it.

, If your juggling act includes speaking, and especially if it includes clowning, a drop is a great opportunity to poke fun at yourself and elicit a laugh. An excuse can entertain your audience until you get back into your routine. The more far-fetched or outrageous the ""excuse"", the better.

Stare at the dropped object as though it had suddenly appeared there and you don't know why, or as though you are angry with it for falling.
Blame ""a sudden gust of gravity!"" or simply observe, ""Ah, gravity works!""
""Oops, I almost dropped something there! Good thing I didn't!"" An obvious flat-out lie often gets a laugh.
""I dropped that to make the next trick look harder, you see.""




 ""I think floor-juggling is about to catch on.""

Crouch down and start ""juggling"" the other props along with the dropped object by shuffling them around on the floor, as though you meant to do that. Be sure to include a guilty smile.




 ""You can do a better job? Go ahead!""

Involve (or blame) the audience. ""Stop looking at me!"" ""It works when nobody's watching!"" ""What are you laughing at?"" ""Oh, yeah, let's see you do it!""
If the audience seemed to like that you dropped, say, ""So you like that? I could drop this one, too.""

,

Your audience will see what you're feeling.




 No.

Recover quickly without dwelling on it. Don't project or emphasize your error unless it's part of your act to do so.
Don't lose intensity or focus.
Keep in character, whatever your character may be.
Get back into your routine, strongly, quickly, and confidently.

Find ideal balls.,
Find a suitable place to stand.,
Start with one ball.,
Move on to two balls.,
Throw the second ball is when the first reaches its maximum height.",How to Juggle Three Balls1," A good choice is to find balls that are not too light and not too big (or too small like marbles). If you are just starting to juggle, it is best to use small balls filled with sand. They should fit snugly in the palm of your hand.


Try using beanbags or purpose-made juggling balls while first learning to juggle. They don't bounce or roll away when dropped, so you spend your time and energy juggling, not chasing dropped balls.
You can make your own practice juggling balls from tennis balls or balloons.;
, When learning to juggle, you will drop the balls and it's best that you're not anywhere near fragile objects and that you have plenty of space around you. Outdoors is ideal.


Stand comfortably with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you can, stand next to a surface (like a table or bed), so you don't have to constantly bend down.

, Throw one ball from one hand to the other hand at head height, in an arc. Get used to the feel and weight of the ball. Notice that the pattern is an arc, and not a circle as you may have thought.









A common mistake made by beginners is to throw the ball high into the air. It's important to ensure that the ball doesn't go any higher than head or eye height. Do not throw too low either, since that will force you to juggle fast, and fast isn't necessary for three balls.
As you get better at throwing the single ball, start trying to move your arms in a gentle circular movement, scooping inward. This is much closer to the final movement that you will use when juggling all three balls. You are not trying to throw in a circle though, just moving your hands this way.

, Put a ball in each hand. Throw the first ball to your left hand at head height.









Before ball 1 reaches the left hand, release ball 2 towards your right hand and catch. Keep your hand movements open (meaning, don't close your hands over the ball after catching).

, The only difference between this movement and juggling three balls is doing it once more -- so you're almost there.









Keep practicing this movement. Once you get this right, the remaining steps will be much easier. Review wikiHow's article on juggling two balls for added help.

Choose suitable balls.,
Toss one ball for a while to get the feel of juggling.,
Practice scooping.,
Take one ball in each hand.",How to Juggle1," Beanbags are good for beginners. Basically, find balls that will not bounce a lot, or roll away when they're dropped––this will save a fair bit of running initially! A set of beanbags can be bought for a very low price or made by hand. Tennis balls filled with sand or a few pennies and covered with a round balloon also work well. They don't bounce and they provide a slip-free grip.


While you're at it, choose a suitable place to work in. At the very beginning, balls will end up flying everywhere, so it's best not to stand near granny's precious oil lamp or dad's collection of ceramic cows.;
, Start passing one ball from one hand to the other. Also practice ""selfies"" –– these are throws you catch with the throwing hand. The ball should come to eye-height or higher. Your hands should not move very much, so aim to keep your elbows at your hips.








, This is a technique to make juggling smooth. Simply scoop, or dip, your hand before tossing the ball. Keep the dip shallow though; it isn't going to work if you scoop too deeply. Practice scooping and tossing from one hand to another, so that arc does not rise above eye level.









Simply mimic the movements of jugglers. If you were to ""air juggle,"" do you find yourself moving your hands in small circles? You're already scooping!

, Toss ball A, and when it reaches the top of its arc, toss ball B. Practice until this simple exchange becomes comfortable.










At the top is key here. This will give you the most time for your next catch. When you start working with 3, 4, and 5, this becomes especially important.

Move on to three balls.,
Start with the right hand and throw ball 1 (blue) towards your left hand.,
Release ball 2 (red) toward your right hand when ball 1 (blue) is about to land in your left.,
When ball 2 (red) is about to arrive in your right hand, release ball 3 (green) on its arc back to your left hand.,
Repeat the three ball juggling steps as necessary.",How to Juggle Three Balls2," Place two balls in your right hand and the other ball in your left. If you are left-handed, reverse the instructions to fit. Only proceed with this step when you feel confident with juggling two balls.


Remember how you threw the second one when the first one was high up in the air? Now you're just throwing the third when the second one is high up in the air. Same thing. Ready? Set....

, Remember that the ball in the air should be at head height.








, At maximum height, you'll have about a second. That's plenty of time!








, Catch both balls. This is where it gets difficult -- catching and throwing -- so keep trying!









It is often helpful to roll the ball in your right hand to the front of your hand with a slight downward motion of the hand before you throw it. The outgoing ball travels just to the inside of the arc of incoming ball. You are exchanging the one in your hand for the one in the air.

, Keep practicing until you get used to the movement, then stop catching and holding the balls at the end. Don't worry about walking forward; this is normal for beginners. With practice, you will be able to perform the 3 ball juggle with your feet planted firmly in the same spot.









Continue juggling as long as you can. Increase the speed with practice. Try to make the balls look as though they are in continual motion.
Keep practicing! Juggling only improves with practice and the more you try, the less and less you will drop the balls, and the faster you will become.

Learn to juggle over the top.,
Experiment with different hand positions.,
Try the ""shower"" trick.,
Do the ""box"" throw.",How to Juggle Three Balls3," For the normal cascade, you've been moving your right hand in a clockwise motion and your left in a counter-clockwise motion; in other words, you've been scooping them toward the inside. To do an over the top throw, you simply reverse the motion. When a ball lands in your hand, instead of scooping it in, reverse and throw it out and over.









Start by doing this with just one ball. Then, when you get good at one specific ball being thrown over the top, do it with them all. Some will refer to this as ""outside throws.""

, Now that you've got the cascade and over the top methods down, start catching your balls different ways. If done right, it can almost look like magic.









Use the claw catch. This is when you catch them higher from above, working overhand instead of underhand. Be sure to flick your wrist up when throwing to give the ball its vertical trajectory, working at shoulder height. Start with one ball, catching and throwing with the same hand.

Imagine a cat juggling. You'll look half Tom Cruise in that wicked scene from Minority Report and half juggling cat.


Try catching the balls on the back of your hand. This can be done mid-trick or at the end. Once you do that, can you catch a ball on your head?!

, When you started with two balls, you know how you threw one horizontally? Same concept with three. You have one hand doing all the catching and one hand doing all the throwing.


With this trick, you need to employ more height. You'll have two balls in the air following each other, so more height is necessary to give them adequate time on their own paths.

, With this one, one ball is always being thrown between your two hands horizontally. The second ball always stays in your right and the third ball is always staying in your left. This three-sided throw gives it the ""box"" look.









Start with two balls in your right. Throw a ball from your left up in the air -- as soon as you do this, throw the second ball from your right to your left. And as soon as your left catches it, throw up the second in your right and the ball in your left, catching the horizontal ball when your right is free.

Move the table to a well-ventilated area.,
Apply the stripper.,
Remove the finish.,
Sand the grain.",How to Refinish a Wood Table1," This work can be done in a workshop, garage or outside if weather and conditions permit. If the table is too big to move, open all the windows around the table and make the area as ventilated as possible.









Protect the area. Lay plastic sheeting and newspapers on the floor around your work area to protect it from any stains or damage.












;
, Apply a coat as evenly as possible to the surface with a paint brush. Give it 15 to 20 minutes to do its job -- loosening the finish, that is. Don't set it and forget it, though; if it gets too dry, it will be difficult to remove.Strippers come as liquids, or in thicker formulations referred to as gels, semi-pastes or pastes. Liquid strippers are only good for horizontal surfaces. For vertical surfaces, the thicker strippers are able to hang on better.









As useful as they are, chemical strippers can be bad news if used improperly. Treat them with care -- use adequate ventilation, rubber gloves and eye protection when using these substances. After all, they are designed to soften, peel and blister paint and varnish -- you do not want them to do the same to your skin, lungs or eyes. Always follow the safety recommendations on the container.












If your interest is in restoring antique or valuable old furniture, look first at products designed to clean and restore antique furniture without refinishing, and always test such products in an inconspicuous area before use. It may be that the old finish itself contributes to the value of the furniture., With a plastic scraper, start removing the finish (when it's ready, obviously). ""Plastic"" here is key -- a metal scraper could scratch your table. Do as much as you can, but if not all of it will come off, use a bit more of the stripper instead of breaking a sweat and breaking the table in frustration. Repeat the process multiple times if need be.








Remove as much paint or varnish as you can with a scraper or putty knife. Round the edges of your scraping tool to prevent it from gouging the wood. Follow-up with medium grade steel wool. Soaking the steel wool in the stripper may help remove stubborn spots. Some finishes, particularly enamels, will require multiple applications of stripper to get the job done.












Despite what you may read on the back of a can, if you want to do a really good job, some sanding will still be required after the old finish is removed by the stripper.

, With a fine-grade sandpaper (#000 is good), sand the surface lightly in the direction of the grain. If there were any discolorations or irregularities, they'll be gone in no time.








If you did a great job with the stripper, your sanding woes may be lessened. Use your 120 grit sandpaper to clean off any remaining finish and smooth out any not so pretty places. Then, with 220 paper, go over the whole piece. And as always, make sure you go with the grain. The better job you do now, the happier you'll be in the end.Clean the surface. Wipe the entire table with a cloth to remove any remaining dust and residue.

Juggle three balls.,
Work on the over-the-top method.,
Move onto four and five balls.",How to Juggle2," Try to make three passes in a row. Start out slowly, simply seeing how the three work together in the air in one rotation. Juggling three is often a matter of understanding the balls' trajectories and how they intertwine. For the majority of the time, one will be in the air while each hand has the other two.









First hold two balls in right hand and one in left-hand. (Vice versa if you are left handed.)
Begin with passing from the right hand. (Again, vice versa if you are left-handed.)
Throw the ball to your left hand and when ball 1 is at the peak, throw ball 2 (the only one in your left hand) under ball 1 to your right hand.
When ball 2 is at the highest point (at this point, you should also catch ball 1 in the left hand) throw ball 3 under ball 2.
And when ball 2 is in the right hand just catch ball 3 and this should be it. That's all you do! Repeat away.

If you can't seem to get the hang of it, work with light, small scarves. They'll give you the time hanging in the air to understand how it all comes together.



, Now that you've got the simple three-ball cascade down, start juggling ""over the top."" This is the name for scooping in the opposite direction with one hand. Instead of scooping under and releasing the ball, you catch it, scoop to the outside and throw it over, hence the name.









You can start by juggling a normal ""Three Ball Cascade,"" and then letting one of the balls do an over-the-top all the time, so that 1/3 of all throws are over-the-top throws. If you make one hand throw over-the-top throws every time, you are juggling a ""Slow Shower,"" and if every throw is an over-the-top-throw, you are juggling a ""Reverse Three Ball Cascade."" When you have learned this, you can advance onto things like cross hand juggling, columns (one in the middle, two on the sides), and ""Mills' Mess.""


, Learn to juggle two in one hand, then do two in your left hand and two in your right hand at the same time. For some, juggling four is simpler than three!


Juggling five balls is just like juggling three, but you have to move your hands a lot faster and you need to throw the balls higher. Keep practicing –– it takes time and patience to master.

Fill the grain.,
Apply sand sealer.",How to Refinish a Wood Table2," That is, if your wood has an open grain -- like oak or mahogany. If you want a smooth even finish for an open grained wood, it has to be filled. But if your wood has a tight grain, you can skip this part.








You can buy grain filler in a whole bunch of different colors. If you'd like the grain to stand out, purchase a color that will contrast with the final color of your table (post-staining). If grain isn't your thing, fill it with a color that will match the finished color of your piece.
To apply the paste, use a rag or stiff paint brush. For this step, it's best to follow the directions on the packaging. Work it into the grain well and let it dry. If there's excess in certain places, remove it with your scraper or putty knife. Make sure to hold the device at angle to avoid damaging the wood.













, This is much like priming the wood. Some woods have a tendency to absorb stains unevenly, and this prevents that from happening. They can be applied after staining, too, in place of a finishing coat or two.









Apply a coat liberally over the entirety of your piece. Let it get a good soak in for a few minutes. Then, with a clean rag, wipe off the excess. Make sure it's completely dry before you go over it light with sandpaper. 220 grit is good here.Take the stain off your table. If the finish is stain, you will want to use sandpaper and sand with the grain of the wood until all the stain is gone. Use a hand power sander if you want to, but be careful not to gouge the wood. Begin with 100 grit sandpaper and move to a finer paper to finish for a smoother surface.













"
"
Apply your stain.,
Add the final finish.,
Finished.








",How to Refinish a Wood Table3," To get the look you're going for, it's important to apply it evenly and to get the excess off promptly (depending on the shade you desire, of course). Since you've put in the dirty work of stripping and sanding, it'll be thirsty for the stain, so time is of the essence. Once you have your stain on, grab a piece of cheesecloth to remove the excess. If it's still too light, just repeat the process once more, still maintaining an eye for evenness.








Apply at least 2 coats of stain, using a light grade sandpaper in between coats to smooth the surface of any fibers sticking up.













If you're looking to go green, liquid water-based stains should be your pick; they're better for the environment. They work much the same as oil-based stains, as more applications equals a deeper color. They're also very convenient in that they clean up well with only soap and water. The only downside is that they can raise the grain of the wood. To minimize this effect, dampen the wood with a moist, clean rag., The work's not quite done yet. You want to protect all your efforts with a coating of polyurethane, wax or tung oil. Polyurethane is the most popular option, but paste wax does a great job, too. The latter adds a warmth and protects from water damage, too.








The type of finish you choose is just a matter of your personal preferences. Penetrating oil finishes are soft, natural, and easy to apply, but offer less protection than varnish or lacquer. Polyurethane, on the other hand, is hard, durable, and comes in a variety of sheens (and Estevezes). Unfortunately, good as lacquers look, they take a bit of skill to apply on well. What's your confidence level like with this particular piece?Stain your table. Apply the stain liberally with a paintbrush. When brushing it on, go with the grain of the wood. Allow the stain to soak in for a few minutes and then wipe off the excess with a cloth. The longer a stain sits on the surface, the darker the hue will be.

",How to Make a Table,"









Use brainstorm sketches first, don't worry about dimensions.
Once you have settled on a rough design, pencil in some rough dimensions. Your dimensions will vary based on the kind of table you intend to construct. In other words, a dining table will have different dimensions than a bedside table.
Consider where you intend to place the table when creating your dimensions. It doesn't have to be any size other than the size you need.;
, Always add a little extra, just in case.








, For most beginners using a soft wood like pine is a good place to start. For a slightly better finish try poplar. If your table will be used outdoors consider redwood or treated woods.








, There are two ways to do this:









Using planking. The advantage of planking is that it is less expensive than a single sheet. Tongue and groove planking is easiest, but if you can use a dowel or biscuit cutter to create a butt joint then you might consider that route for a flat top.
Use a single sheet of wood. If you go this route save some money and use hard wood veneered construction plywood.

,, The under-table is a basic square of wood that attaches to the table top and helps support the legs, preventing them from moving from side-to-side. To create the under-table:









Measure in from the edge of your table top a few inches. The exact width will vary depending on the dimensions of your table. Make a mark at your position.
Turn the table top over and draw a square on the bottom of your table at your mark.
Cut two pairs of wood for the two front pieces and the two side pieces.
Glue and clamp these pieces at your lines on the underside of the table. You may choose to screw these into the table top either permanently or to help hold until the glue sets if your clamps do not have the depth they need to reach your inset.

,

Cut one leg to the size you wish.













Cut the three other legs to the approximate size.













Clamp all four legs together.













Cut all four legs to the same length while they are clamped together, using the first leg as a guide.













Sand your table legs using a power sander so they are smooth and ready for a fine sand. Be careful not to sand the top or bottom of the legs as this is likely to ruin your right angle cuts.














,


Turn the table upside down if it is not there already.













Place the first leg in one corner of the under-table with the top flat against the underside of the table top and the sides flat against the under-table.













Apply glue to the top of your leg and to the interior side of the under-table that will butt against the leg.













Secure the legs by fastening screws — do not use nails — through the under-table and into the leg.













Check that your legs are at a right angle to the table top. Adjust the screws as necessary.













Repeat for the rest of the legs.













Once everything is set up and square, glue and clamp the legs in place.













Optionally, you can place a screw into the top of the leg from the top side of your table, however, this is often unsightly, and you risk splitting the tops of your legs by nailing or screwing into the end wood.

Download and print the handle pattern used in this tutorial: http://www.juggle.org/ija/howto/files/2013/08/green-club-project.zip

,Gather the other items you will need, listed under ""Things You'll Need"" below.,

Mark each dowel.,

Using a drill with a 3/32"" (2.3mm) bit, drill a hole as deep as your screw in the center of the smoothest end of each dowel.
,

Drill a hole through the exact center of the bottom of each 16oz (473ml) or 20oz.,

Make the tennis ball end caps.,

Make the handle wrap from a 2 litre (67 oz.),

Fit the 16 oz.,

Attach the tennis ball end cap.,

Attach the handle wrap to the club.,

Wrap the handle with vinyl tape from the end to the center.,
Add finishing tape.,

Use additional tape, stickers, and creativity to decorate the clubs.",How to Make Green Juggling Clubs,",, Mark it 45.7 cm (18"") from one end. Using a wood saw, cut each dowel in half to produce two 18"" (45.7cm) dowels.

Many hardware stores will cut dowels to length free of charge at the time of purchase.

,, (591ml) bottle., You will need to cut the tennis balls in half. There are many ways to do this:


Measure a strip of light cardstock or stiff paper 1¼"" (3.17cm) wide and at least 8"" (20.3cm) long. Wrap the strip around a tennis ball tightly and secure it with tape. The strip will now form a ring 2½"" (6.3cm) in diameter and 1¼"" (3.1cm) tall. You may wish to reinforce the ring with duct tape. To do so, wrap the ring with tape and then trim the tape to the edge of the paper.
Place the ring on a smooth, firm surface and place a tennis ball down into it. The ring will come exactly halfway up the ball. Trace the top of the ring to draw the equator on the ball.




 Be very careful!

Using a small, sharp knife make a small incision along the equator.
Cut all the way around the ball along one of the circles you drew. Then cut around the other circle.
Tennis balls are hard to cut. Go slowly, being careful and always cutting away from yourself. You may need to experiment with techniques to find a comfortable and easy way to do this.

, bottle.

Print out the handle wrap pattern from the booklet, using the appropriate page size. Whatever paper size you use, be certain that the result is at 100 percent.
Wrap a pattern snugly around a 2 litre (67 fl.oz) bottle as shown and secure the overlapping tab with tape. Trace the pattern using black permanent marker. The pattern may not lie flat at the top-most point where the bottle curves towards the neck. That's okay; just trace as close as you can in a smooth curve.




 Cut the handle wrap.

Using a good sharp pair of scissors, cut out the handle wrap along the inside edge of the tracing. Cut cleanly to prevent nicks and burrs. This can be a bit tricky. Experiment to find a method that works for you.

, (473ml) or 20 oz. (591ml) bottle to the dowel.

Place the bottle over the dowel so the screw holes line up. Mark the dowel just below the bottle.




 Wrap tape...






Wrap the dowel with masking tape just above the mark you made until the bottle fits tightly on the dowel.
Fit the bottle onto the dowel with the screw holes lined up.

,

Place a finishing washer onto one of the drywall screws. On a work surface, drive the screw through the top center of one of your tennis ball halves using a drill with a Phillips bit.




 Flip right side out and press into place around the bottle bottom.

Invert the tennis ball half over the screw head. Place the screw into the hole on the bottom of the bottle. Make sure the screw holes in the bottle and dowel are lined up properly. Brace the bottom of the dowel against a hard, non-slip surface so the bottle bottom faces you. Holding the bottle by its neck with your bottom fingers around the dowel, drive the screw into the dowel. Make sure the screw is tight, but don't risk stripping the screw or the dowel. A medium-high setting on a clutch drill works great here.
Turn the end cap right side out. It will look crater-shaped and flare out away from the bottle bottom. Press the edge of the end cap down and in against each of the five ""feet"" on the bottom of the bottle. This will dent the bottle and provide a good surface for the end cap to seat against.

, This may be the trickiest part of the whole process. It is also a part that will make a big difference in how nicely the clubs turn out. The objective is to wrap the handle around the neck of the bottle and the dowel very tightly to provide a good spring handle. There is more than one way to do this. What follows is one way that is fairly easy and will happen quickly:

Line up the middle of the top curve of the handle wrap with the collar at the base of the threading on the neck of the bottle. Wrap the handle three-fourths of the way around the bottle neck, seated against the collar all the way around.
Place the club on a the edge of a firm surface with the collar just off the edge and the handle wrap pinned against the surface below and wrapped over the threading on top.




 Secure the top curve with a staple.

Using a staple gun with 3/8"" (9.5mm) staples, secure the top curve of the handle wrap to the bottle and dowel.
Put the staple in parallel to the dowel and make sure the handle is seated against the collar on the bottle.

Using a small hammer, finish seating the staple firmly into the dowel. The bottom prong on the staple may go off to one side and not set in the dowel. That is okay; it will still work fine.






Wrap the handle around the dowel getting it as tight as possible. The end of the wrap should just line up with the end of the dowel. Secure the bottom corner of the handle wrap with a staple or with vinyl tape. If you use tape, be a bit liberal with it and wrap it tightly. Make sure the handle wrap is as tight as you can get it. If it loosens up as you are securing it, rewrap it at secure it again. For this reason you may prefer tape until you get the hang of it.
It is possible to secure the handle wrap using only tape. This is a bit trickier, but may be necessary if you do not have easy access to a staple gun.
You can secure the top with a small nail or screw. If you do this, make sure the fastener has a broad head so it doesn't pull through the handle wrap and drill a pilot hole so you don't crack the bottle neck or the dowel.
You may prefer to use ½"" (12.7mm) staples for the top to secure farther into the dowel, or ¼"" (6.35mm) staples for the bottom.
However you do it, just make sure that the top curve of the handle wrap is secure and flush against the collar on the neck of the bottle, the bottom edge of the wrap is even with the bottom of the dowel, and that the handle is wrapped as tight as you can get it.

, Give the end an extra wrap before you begin to help keep the handle secure. Wrap in a spiral, overlapping the tape slightly (1/16"" or 2mm) is plenty, but you can go up to half the width of the tape if you want). Keep the tape stretched slightly as you go to get a smooth wrap. Finish with an extra wrap just below the collar.,

Put a single wrap of contrasting vinyl tape at the top of the handle just below the collar.
Put a wrap of dark vinyl tape around the junction between the bottle and the end cap.






Fit the rubber tip onto the end of the club as a knob. It will be a very tight fit and does not need to be secured, or you can take the tape over the edge of it if you want.

, Contrasting colors will help you see the clubs to catch them."
"
Get three tennis balls, some balloons, and some pennies (washers will also work).

,
Cut a small slit in the tennis ball with a sharp knife.,
Insert five pennies into each ball.,
Get several small round balloons.,
Stretch and pull the balloon over the ball.

,
Do this with two or three balloons in order to completely cover the tennis ball ""fuzz"".

,
Repeat for the other two balls.",How to Make Juggling Balls from Tennis Balls,", The slit should be slightly wider than the penny

, (Any small, low value, coin will do.) Once they are in, they will not fall out. These balls will jingle as you juggle, and when they hit the ground, they will not bounce and will not roll away.
You can use fewer or more coins, but remember to use the same number of coins for each ball! If you use sand, weigh it, and use the same amount for each ball.






Start with fewer coins and add more as necessary; they are easier to put in than to take out.






The balls may be filled with sand, rice, or any inert granular material as an alternative to pennies. If you use sand, you may want to seal the slit in the ball with electrical tape or hot-glue.

, Cut the neck off a balloon.;
,,,


There you go, colorful and cheap!
And they make music (jingle).
And they have a good grip to them.
And they stay put when you drop them.
You can also cut duct tape in half lengthwise about as long as your tennis ball, then wrap around, you can also put electrical tape over the duck tape

Note the measurements of the table, listed here.,
Gather all the tools and materials.,
Make all the cuts to the planks as follows:


2 pieces 82 cm (32,3 inches) long of 2,5 x 10 cm (1×4 inches) plank
4 pieces 177 cm (69,7 inches) long of 2,5 x 10 cm (1×4 inches) plank
2 pieces 168 cm (66,1 inches) long of 2,5 x 10 cm (1×4 inches) plank
17 pieces 92 cm (36,2 inches) long of 2,5 x 10 cm (1×4 inches) plank
4 pieces 74 cm (29,1 inches) long of 5 x 10 cm (2×4 inches) plank

,
Start sanding.,
Start with the assembly of the table as shown in the picture above.,
Drill a hole one or two sizes smaller than the screw.,
After the frame is completed, you need to put two 168 cm (66.1 inches) planks on the left and the right side of the frame, as shown in the picture above.,
Choose the plate planks.,
Attach the planks.,
Use the appropriate planks for the legs.,
Attach the legs with 7 cm (3 inch) wood screws.,
Paint your table in the colour of your choice.",How to Make Your Own Garden Table," Check the sketch (image above) to get the basic idea as well.


Height = 76,5 cm (30,1 inches)
Length = 186 cm (70,9 inches)
Width = 92 cm (36,2 inches).;
, For this project, you'll need the items listed below in ""Things You'll Need"".

,, Use a sander to smooth all the previously cut pieces.

,


Use a clamp when assembling every piece and make sure that all the joints are at 90 degree angles.

, Then put the screw through that hole. That ensures the screw will get where you wanted it to go.


Do not try to put the screw in if you haven't drilled the hole first.

, The planks enhance the stability of the legs and add to the visual appearance of the table.

, Now it's time to put the plate of the table on the frame. For the plate of the table you will use 92 cm (36.2 inches) planks.

, Every plank must be screwed down on four places; that means on every plank of the frame. This is important because it is very hard to acquire completely dry wood and if you don’t tighten it down, it will bend and your table will be ruined. On the picture you can see how to assemble the plate on the frame.


Leave 1 cm (1/3 of an inch) space between every plank on the plate, for visual appearance.

, For the legs you will use 74 cm (29.1 inches) planks.

, Put three screws on every leg, so that they form a perfect triangle.

,


Make sure that the chosen paint protects the wood against the elements and always put on at least two coats of paint. A sealant layer is also recommended for longer wear and making the table spill-proof.

Level and secure your table.",How to Make a Live Edge Hanging Table," There are different types of live edge wood that you can select when creating your hanging table. Popular types of live edge wood include burl round and tree round. Burl round is cut from the trunk of the tree and often boasts unique patterns but is also usually the most expensive. Tree round is a horizontal cut from a tree and is generally rounder and lighter than burl round., Many places that sell lumber will also have a kiln. If you purchase freshly cut live edge wood, it will need to be dried before you can convert it to a shelf. If there is moisture in the wood, it can crack and warp after you seal and coat it., Use a handheld electric sander to sand the entirety of your live edge wood. Maintain good pressure on the tool and sand towards, not against, the grain.For a larger surface area like the top and bottom of your wood, use 80 grit sandpaper. For cracks and crevices, 60 grit sandpaper works best. Once you’ve leveled out your wood, you can sand it again with a higher grit 220 sandpaper until the entire piece of wood is smooth.Sand your wood in an open and well-ventilated area.
If your live edge wood has bark, refrain from sanding it off.

, Wipe down your live edge wood with a tack cloth to remove any remaining sawdust or dirt debris. Tack cloth is specially designed to pick up dirt and dust. You can purchase them at home improvement stores or online.You can also use a slightly damp rag to wipe down your wood. Don’t use a light cotton that will come off on the wood or it may get trapped under your seal.

, Use a basic wooden paint mixer to stir the sealer, and make sure it’s long enough to reach the material that has settled on the bottom of the can. Never shake your can of polyurethane because it will create bubbles that can ruin the finish on your table.A polyurethane seal will protect your table from dirt, debris, and moisture. Lightly dip your brush into the sealer and use long, broad strokes towards the grain. Continue to paint until there's a coat of sealer on your wood.


A thin coat will ensure that the sealer won’t run or drip.
Thick coats of sealer will make your finish uneven and will attract dust., It will take water based sealers 4 to 6 hours to dry, while oil based polyurethane will take 24 hours to dry. You must wait until your sealer is completely dry before trying to apply another coat. Use a 220 grit sandpaper and go over the entirety of the wood one time to sand out any dust or dirt that may have been trapped in your finish as the sealer dried.You can test to see if your polyurethane is dry by sanding a small area of the table. If the sealer bunches up in one area, it’s not dry yet.

, Apply the last coat of polyurethane and allow it to dry overnight. Your live edge wood should now have a shiny protective finish over it. This will make it safer to place drinks and plates on it.

, Use a tape measure to measure 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from each corner of your wood and mark it with a pencil. Try to make these markings equidistant to one another and to each edge of the table so that the table is stable when you hang it. You should put one mark in each corner of the wood for a total of four markings., You’ll need to use a long in diameter brad drill bit and a strong drill to get through a thicker wood. Get a drill bit that’s at least ½ inch (1.27 cm) in diameter to accommodate the thickness of your rope. Drill all four holes that your marked all the way through your table., Use a tape measure to gauge the distance from the ceiling to where you want your table to hang. Take that number and multiply it by two and add a foot (30.48 cm). This should be the size of each piece of your rope. Measure out two pieces of rope with a tape measure and cut them to size.Make sure your rope is durable enough to hold up the table but thin enough to fit through your drill bit holes.
⅜ inch (0.95 cm) and above thick rope is adequate for this project.

, Thread one end of the rope through one of the holes. Continue pulling the rope over the bottom of your table and thread the other side of it through another hole that you drilled. Pull the rope through so that there is an even amount of slack on each side of the rope. Repeat the step with the other two holes., Measure the length of your wood and write it down. Take that length use it to distance two eye screws into your ceiling. Eye screws are metal hooks with a screw in the end that you can manually twist into wood. Once your eye screws are in, tug on them to make sure that they are secure.

, Take your S hooks and hang two of them on each eye screw. You don’t have to screw or attach them in any special way, simply hang them off of the eye screws. These will be used to attach to your rope and will hold your table in place., Get a friend to help lift the table in the air and tie each side of the rope to its own S hook and secure the end with a knot. Once you’re confident your knots are tight, have your friend slowly lower the table to see if the single eye screw can handle the weight. If it can, then have your friend lift the table and secure the last rope to the last two S hooks.Use a hitch knot if you're not confident that the ropes will stay on the hooks.

, If one of the sides of your table is coming up higher than the other sides, it won't be flat and things will slide off it. To fix this, undo the knot for the corner that's hanging too high and release some slack before re-tying the knot in place. Use a level on the top of your table to ensure that it isn't on an angle. Double check that the knots are secure by softly pushing down on the table. If everything holds together, your table is ready for use."

Mount a standing desk in the corner.",How to Make a Standing Desk," The perfect standing workspace is one that’s specifically suited for you. Before you attempt to construct your own desk or go on the hunt for another option, it will help to estimate a few basic body measurements. Make a note of your overall height, the level of your eyeline and the distance between your hips, elbows and the floor.These rough measurements will come in handy later while working out the specifications for the standing desk that fits your build.
No need to break out the tape measure. Eyeballing it will give you a basic idea of what size and shape your desk should be.;
, You shouldn’t be slouching while you’re working in a standing position, so try not to slouch while you take the necessary measurements. Adopt a natural, comfortable stance that you can maintain for long periods of time. Not only will this allow you to determine the optimal height and orientation of the desk, it’s just better for you all around no matter how you slice it.If you get tired after long hours of standing, it’s advisable to sit down for a short spell rather than hunching or resting in a posture that could cause strain.
Your computer monitor should be even with or just below your eyeline.

, Ideally, the top of the desk should be at the right height for you to rest your elbows on. This will be especially important for people who use have to use a mouse while working, or who do a lot of writing or drawing. Your materials will be more accessible to you without the need to stoop or lower your center of gravity.A little higher or low is fine, so long as you’re not forced to raise or lower your arms too much to work comfortably.

, Don’t throw out that old office chair just yet. Rather than standing nonstop throughout the day, studies demonstrate that the healthiest course of action is to find a golden balance between standing and sitting. When you feel the need to take a load off for a while, have a seat. Alternating between up and down provides the greatest number of health benefits.For most people, this will be a simple ratio or proportion—10 minutes or so of sitting for every hour of work you perform from a standing position.
Convertible or adjustable desks offer the advantage of being able to change positions at will while working.

, It isn’t hard to construct a simple standing desk setup yourself. All you’ll need is a few basic materials: a desktop or tabletop piece, lumber or pipes to serve as the legs of the desk and tools for measuring, mounting and adjusting. After that, it’s just a matter of arriving at the right dimensions and putting it all together.Many DIY desk builders recommend starting with pieces like the Gerton table or Viktor shelf from IKEA, then fitting them with customized legs separately.With the right base components, you can cobble together a standing desk that’s made to fit your needs for less than $100.

, Buy the materials you’ll be using for the legs in the right specifications. You also have the option of modifying them later based on the initial body measurements you took. Wooden boards or posts can be sawed to the exact size you need and will be easiest to work with and fine-tune. If you prefer to use metal pipes for the base, double check their length and width before you take them home.Use a tape measure, T-square and level to ensure that the specifications of your standing desk are precise.
A person of average height (somewhere between 5’7” and 5’11”) will likely have the best results with a desk that’s about 3’-4’ tall.

, Center the desktop with the base. The base should be flat and spaced relatively wide to allow taller desks to stand without wobbling or leaning. Use wood screws to secure wooden legs to a wooden desktop. Metal legs and stands should be bolted into place for added stability.Measure a couple times to avoid making careless mistakes.
Test the sturdiness of your desk before you begin piling your things on it.

, If you’re feeling particularly crafty, you can add clamping joints at the intersection of your desk’s legs that will enable you to control its height. That way, you'll have just one desk that functions as both a sitting and standing workspace. Adjustable desks can be useful if you don’t have enough space for a dedicated standing desk, or you’re not willing to make a permanent commitment just yet.Constructing an adjustable desk will require you to use telescoping legs. These legs must be made from pipes of a couple different diameters that can slide into one another to let you find just the right height.
Adjustable desks are a great compromise that make it easier to heed physicians’ suggestions to split your time between standing and sitting.

, Take a look around your home or office and see if you can find a taller alternative to the desk you’re currently using. This could be a kitchen counter or bar top, an elevated cafe-style table or even dresser of a medium height. You can then move your laptop, books or paperwork to the new workspace and stretch your legs a bit.A no-frills drafting or crafts table can function as an excellent standing desk.Look for a work surface that places your materials at roughly elbow height, or slightly lower.Working from a different place can disrupt the monotony of constantly sitting at a traditional desk and give you a much-needed break from sedentary postures.

, This is an effortless, no-cost solution solution to rigging up a standing desk setup. Simply stack a low box, tray or some other platform onto your existing desktop and use it as a “lift.” You’ll then be free to work from an upright position, and you can simply remove the underlying object as needed.Be sure that the platform you use is sturdy enough to hold your computer, devices and anything else that’s fragile or expensive. The last thing you want is for something to break due to a collapse.
One common practice is to use a small side table (like the IKEA Lack) to support your work materials on top of a sitting desk., Any type of furniture with shelves at different heights can make an effective standing desk when you start thinking outside the box. A large bookcase, for instance, will easily hold your computer, paper documents, books, utensils and other accessories like framed pictures or a mug of coffee. Best of all, this creative setup comes with its own built-in storage system.Surround your workspace with books and reference materials related to your work or studies.
If necessary, drill small holes to provide access to electric outlets or wall mountings.

, You don’t have to be a master builder to fit a wall-bracketed desk space in an out of the way area of your home or office. Just find a desktop of a preferred size, locate a couple studs for support and bolt the whole thing into place. You can store supplies and materials in the area beneath the desk when it’s not in use.Though it won’t offer the greatest view, a corner mounted standing desk is easy to install and takes up little space.
A wall-mounted desk can double as a shelf for displaying books, candles or an attractive flower arrangement.
