Fill the box.",How to Make a Memory Box Table," Choose a wooden window frame that is the size you want your table to be. Inspect the frame. If the frame has grooved sides with rubber stoppers, it would be a good idea to cut these off using a table saw. This will give you a smoother finish.


You can have a plain window or a window with a grid on it.;
, Choose some boards that are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick and about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide. Cut them down to the length and width of your window frame. Make sure that they match up with the outside edges of your frame.


If you want a shallower memory box, choose boards that are 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide.If you want a deeper memory box, choose boards that are 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) wide., The board needs to fit the inside dimensions of your box. You can get these by subtracting 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) from the length and width of your side boards. Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the board.

, Take two side boards, and line them up along the outer edge of the base board. Nail them together that the corner, then nail them to the board itself.

, Take the third board, and nail it to the base board and one of the side boards. Take the last board, and nail it down as well. When you are done, you should have a box. Don't worry about the top (window) part just yet.

, The legs should have screws set into the top for attaching to brackets. When buying the legs, make sure that you buy the matching metal brackets.


If the legs are too long, cut them down with a saw.

, Flip the box over so that the bottom is facing you. Place a metal bracket in each corner, aligning the edges with the base board's edges; exclude the side boards. Use a pen or pencil to make a dot in each screw hole., Remove the metal brackets. Drill a hole over each dot. Make sure that the holes will fit the screws that you will be using., Place the brackets back over the corners. Match up the screw holes. Insert the screws, then drill them into place. Make sure that it is a tight fit., Take a table leg, and place it over the metal bracket. Fit the screw into the hole, then twist it until it tightens., Flip the frame over so that the underside is facing you. Place the hinges on the frame, with the hinge parts lined up with the outside edge. Use a pen or pencil to make a dot in each screw hole.


Make sure that the hinges are on the same side of the frame.
The hinges will be on the back of the table.

, Use a drill to make a hole over each dot. Blow the sawdust away when you are done. Make sure that the holes will fit the screws that you will be using.

, Place the hinges back over the frame. Line up the screw holes on the hinge with the holes on the frame. Insert the screws, then drill them into place., Set the frame down on top of the box. Flip the hinges down so that they rest against the side board. Use a pen or pencil to make a dot in each screw hole.

, Use the same method as you did for the frame. Flip the hinges up first, then use a drill to make a hole over each dot. Blow off any sawdust.

, Flip the hinges back down. Insert a screw into each screw hole. Drill the screws into place.

, You do not have to do this, but it will give your table a nicer finish. Mask off the glass using painter's tape first, then paint or stain the table using your choice of paint or stain.Consider painting the inside of the box as well.

, This would be a good idea, even if you did not paint or stain the table. It will give your table a nicer finish, protect it against stains, and make it easier to clean. You can use a matte, satin, or glossy top coat.If you did not paint or stain the table, be sure to mask off the glass with painter's tape.
If you did paint or stain the table, make sure that you use a top coat suitable for the type of paint or stain you used.

, This is not completely necessary, but it could give your box a nicer finish. Cut down some velvet-textured mat board to fit the bottom of your box and set it inside. Secure the board with some wood glue, if desired.


If you like to travel, consider pasting down a map into the bottom of the table instead. Paint Mod Podge or decoupage over it to seal it in., The beauty of memory box tables is that they are essentially memory or shadow boxes. Open up the table, and set down some treasured items. Include some large, medium, and small items. Group them together. Try to match the theme (such as all baseball-related).


If you'd like some additional texture, set down a piece of fabric in the bottom of the box so that it creates mountain-like folds.
If you choose a beach theme, consider filling the bottom of you box with sand."

Secure the top.,
Add sides (an apron), if you like.,
Cut the pieces for the legs.,
Piece the legs together.,
Stain or paint your coffee table pieces.,
Attach the legs to the top.",How to Make a Coffee Table1," Use a table saw or hand saw to cut boards to the length you would like your coffee table to be. 32 inches (81 cm) is a good length to try, if you’re not sure what size to make it. Cut four standard boards approximately two inches thick and eight inches wide, known as 2x8s, to this length to serve as the top of your table.You can also use 2x4s or other boards. Just cut enough so that the overall width of your coffee table, when the boards are laid side-by-side, will be to your liking.
It is also possible to make a coffee table top from a single, wide slab of suitable wood. However, this might be harder to find at your local hardware store.;
, Put wood glue on the long, two-inch thick sides of the boards you are using for the top, and slide them together so that they form one large, flat surface. Make sure that the ends line up evenly. Use long clamps to hold them in place while the glue dries.You only have to glue the sides of the boards that are touching each other.

, Cut 2x4 boards so that you have two lengths of 32 inches (81 cm) each. Position them so that they lie across all of the boards that you glued together to make the top. Place one on each side a couple of inches from the narrower edge of the top. The narrow ends of the 2x4s should be flush with the long sides of the coffee table top. Attach them to the top using wood screws., This step is optional, but can add a bit of extra charm to your project. Cut two 2x4 boards the length of your table, and two more its width. Cut the ends of each board on their narrow side at a 45 degree angle. Glue the boards to the sides of your coffee table top so that they are flush with the top. Clamp them in place, and nail or screw them to the top once the glue has dried., Using 4x4s, cut four pieces to the height you would like your coffee table to be. Approximately 17 inches (43 cm) should be a comfortable height. You will also need to cut two pieces of plywood to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 26 inches (66 cm). Finally, cut two pieces of 2x4 to the length of 19 inches (48 cm)., Take one of the pieces of plywood you cut and attach one leg to each end, screwing the plywood down on the top (square end) of each leg. Position one of the 2x4 pieces you cut 4.5 inches (11 cm) from the bottom of the other end of the legs. Screw through the legs into the 2x4 so that it sits between the two legs. Repeat this step for the other set of legs., You can choose to paint your table in a vibrant color, use varnish for a natural look, or choose a stain to give it a rich, rustic look. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and paint/stain all of the pieces of your table, allowing plenty of time for them to dry before continuing.Usually, manufacturers will recommend sanding the wood surface before you finish it with paint or stain.
For a classy look, you can use a light-colored stain for the tabletop, and a darker one for its legs.

, When everything is dry, turn the tabletop over so that the bottom with the 2x4s is facing up. Turn the legs over so that the plywood attaching them at the top is sitting on top of the 2x4s. Attach the legs by driving screws through the plywood into the 2x4s. Turn everything over, and your table is done!Make sure that the legs are evenly spaced on the bottom of the tabletop before you screw them into place.

Build a modular coffee table out of crates.,
Put a pallet on legs.,
Use an old door as a coffee table top.,
Repurpose an old window as a table top.,
Repurpose an old suitcase.,
Use reclaimed wood.,
Give an existing coffee table a makeover.",How to Make a Coffee Table2," Look for any kind of wooden crates, like those that hold wine, apples, eggs, or milk. The crates can be new or vintage, but you will need four of the same size. Stain or paint them as you like. Once they are dry, lay the crates on their sides and screw them together so that they form one large square.The sides of the crates will serve as the tabletop.
Use the parts originally meant to hold the wine, milk, or other items as storage or shelf space below the tabletop.

, Find a wooden pallet used for shipping, and four legs from an old piece of furniture or purchased new from a hardware store. Screw one leg into each corner of the bottom of the pallet. Paint or stain the whole table.Add a piece of plexiglass on top of the pallet for a smoother feel., Look for an old wooden door at a thrift store or flea market. Cut the door to about half its size (unless you want a very long coffee table). Attach four furniture legs (new or old) to the flat surface of the door, one to each of its corners. You can paint or stain the door if you like, but for extra vintage charm, leave it as-is.For a sturdier coffee table, you can screw the door to the top of an existing coffee table, or two small end tables of equal size, instead of just attaching legs to the door’s corners.

, Glass makes a nice surface for any coffee table, but the frame of an old window adds a chic touch. Attach furniture legs to the corners of the window, or simply screw the window on top of a basic end table to have a small but unique coffee table.If you have a wooden box approximately the same size as your window, you can attach the two pieces together at their edges with hinges. That way, the window will still serve as the coffee table top, but the box will provide added storage.

, For this project, all you have to do is drill a hole in each corner of the back of a vintage suitcase, with the front-facing portion now facing up. Then, drive screws through the holes and into the tops of four wooden or metal table legs. The closed suitcase serves as a coffee table, but opening it reveals a stylish storage space.For added strength, you can cut a piece of plywood to the size of the interior of the bottom of the suitcase. Place it in the bottom, and drive screws through it into the tops of the legs you are attaching.

, Many cities now have locations that offer reclaimed wood for sale. You can often find beautiful and unique pieces that are great for coffee tables. Find a slab that’s a good size for this purpose, and use a simple finish like varnish or polyurethane to preserve the natural look. Then, attach existing table legs to the bottom.Leave imperfections like knots in the wood for a touch of rustic charm.
You can also build your own legs by using 4x4 wood cut to your preferred length. .
Some reclaimed wood centers also sell stumps or thick slices from tree trunks. If you find one of these, you can also just place the glass top from an old round table on top of the chunk of wood for a simple coffee table., For a really simple project, you can take a coffee table you already have, and paint or restain it. Remove the glass, if it has any, and use paint/stain remover to strip the old finish off. Add a new paint or stain color that you prefer.Old coffee tables can usually be found at thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales, just waiting for a makeover.

Buy a cocktail table with a center piece of glass.,
Buy some mood moss, sheet moss, and deer moss.,
Buy some plywood for under the table, with pieces also for the sides.,
Attach the plywood base to the underside of the table.,
Decide how you would like to place the pieces of moss in the holding base.,
Add Styrofoam pieces underneath the moss pieces.,
Add decorative sand for the third element.,
Keep adding the design pieces.,
Attach the glass on the top.,
Done.",How to Make a Moss Table,";
, Having different types of moss will allow you to create a variety of colors.

, Measure the pieces to fit under the glass-top area of the table – one base piece and four sides measuring the same length as the table. Making the sides deeper is better, to create a feeling of depth. Form the base from the plywood for the moss to be assembled on and attached under the coffee table.


Measure twice, cut once.

, Use L wood brackets and some very small screws to keep the holding base in place.


You can purchase thin pieces of wood veneer to include in the design.

, Choose to put different colors alongside each other, to vary the appearance of the moss, and include such additions as pieces of driftwood or branches, to create visual breaks and interesting effects.


Use a good pair of scissors to cut moss into the shapes desired.

, Doing this will help to create a raised effect. This can be done here and there or all the way across, depending on the design you're aiming for.

, The sand can be placed in gaps, to add more visual appeal and a color variant. It can also help bring forth the landscape effect.

,


Make adjustments as you go until you're happy with the design.

,


Note the side table; this is how the cocktail table looked initially.

, Now you have a beautiful moss table.

Assess your collection.,
Find the right table.,
Purchase glue to hold bottle caps or your collection in place.,
Assemble supplies that will help you build a barrier around the perimeter of your table.,
Purchase resin.",How to Make a Bottle Cap Table with Resin Surface1," For full coverage, you will most likely need a vast collection that that will provide full coverage. When using bottle caps look for caps that are not rusted and still in decent shape. Consider only using bottle caps that hold meaning or significance to you--or just look really cool.;
, Depending upon your collection you may be either looking for a table that can simply display your collection or you may be looking for pure decorative function and plan to cover a piece of necessary furniture. Either way, your collection must be able to completely cover the table top.

, Liquid Nails or Super Glue work well or you could use contact cement for a very permanent solution.

, When you pour the resin, you don’t want it to run off the sides of the table so building a barrier is imperative. Barrier materials can include heavy cardboard, aluminum foil, duct tape and/or any other material that will help you keep the resin on the table and off the floor. Also, locating an exacto knife or box cutter will help you trim away the barrier once the resin has dried.

, Most hardware or home improvement stores will carry pourable resin. Look for something with high gloss in order to give the table that polished finish.

Sand and smooth the entire table.,
Apply chalkboard paint to the top of the table.,
Add at least 2 to 3 coats to the table top.,
Grab a chalk and enjoy your new table.

",How to Make a Chalkboard Table," Hit the top with extra vigor. You want the tabletop to be smooth and even. Use your clean cloth to remove debris as you work and continue sanding until you have achieved the desired smoothness.


Sand the table legs. Make sure you remove any wood that is splintering or rough.





;
, Apply a smooth even coat making sure the entire top is covered. Don’t glob on the paint as you will be adding several coats.


Allow first coat to dry before adding second coat. For best results, allow your table to dry in a cool, non-humid area.







, The number of coats depends upon your preference and wood consistency of the table (some material absorbs paint more than others).

Lay out collection on clean tabletop surface.,
Glue bottle caps and/or your collection in place.,
Build a barrier around the perimeter of the table.,
Mix and pour resin.,
Remove barrier and tape using your knife.",How to Make a Bottle Cap Table with Resin Surface2," Make sure the table is free of debris, dust or dirt before beginning the project. Lay out bottle caps or your collection so you can determine if you like the design.

, Once you are happy with the design, glue the caps in place so they won’t move when you pour the resin. Allow ample dry time before proceeding to the next step.

, Secure the base of the barrier with duct tape and/or painter’s tape. You don’t want any gaps so the resin could drip out. Make sure the barrier is high enough around the sides to hold the poured resin.

, Follow the instructions on the resin box for mixing and then slowly pour over the tabletop. If the resin is not getting between the bottle cap gaps, use a knife to gently spread it over the tops and in between the gaps.


Allow the resin to set and dry for up to eight hours (or according to the resin box directions).

, Carefully run the knife around the edges of the barrier to release the tape. Be careful not to scratch the table as you remove the tape and barrier.

Search for salvaged materials for your table top.,
Purchase a precut tabletop from a furniture store.,
Select a wooden board from a hardware store.",How to Build Your Own Coffee Table1," One of the surest ways to make your DIY coffee table unique is to repurpose a piece of salvaged material for the tabletop. An old door can be sawn to size for this purpose, as can a piece of wood salvaged from an old building.;
, Some furniture stores sell ready-made desktops and tabletops in several standard sizes. Buying a top like this will help make your DIY coffee table an inexpensive and easy project. Tabletops in solid wood can even be stained or painted to suit your preferences.

, Many home improvement stores will cut wood boards to size for free upon purchase. This option will give you the most control over the exact dimensions of the coffee table without even having to make any cuts yourself.

Lay top long boards on the outside, along with the 2 top center boards on the inside of each side.
Lay top side and middle boards on each end of the table to complete the design.
Add planter boxes in the middle upside down (hole facing down).

, Use wood glue to bound the wood planks together and then use the 2 ½” wood screws to attach the center boards to the middle boards through the pre-drilled pocket holes.


Hold boards in place while attaching with either glue or screws.
Repeat this step on the other side of the table.

, You will also need to use wood glue to hold boards in place after you’ve screwed boards together for further security.


Use a pencil to mark off the places where you will drill more holes using your Kreg Jig. You want 6 holes where the side and middle boards connect with the long board.

, These must be made to fit the middle of the table and hold the plastic planter boxes.


Screw together the sides of the box by screwing wood together and then adding wood glue between boards. Use the 1 ¼” screws to attach the frame together.
Create 5 evenly spaced holes along one open side of the box. Use your T-square to line up holes as they must be able to line up evenly.

Consider ready-made table legs.,
Look for hairpin legs online.,
Choose no-hardware legs for easy and flexible installation.,
Salvage legs from an old piece of furniture.",How to Build Your Own Coffee Table2," Furniture stores that sell precut tabletops often sell ready-to-install table legs as well. Ready-made legs offer one of the least costly ways to build your coffee table, and are available in a range of different styles and materials, including wood and polished metal.

, To give your DIY coffee table a nod to classic mid-century Scandinavian design, you can fit it with metal hairpin legs. Vintage hairpin legs can be found readily through Internet classifieds or auction sites like eBay. You can also have new ones made through an online metal shop.

, Some companies manufacture table legs that can be installed without any fasteners; this allows you to install them easily and swap out the tabletop if desired. One such product is the Tick Clip, produced by the German company Linie 58.

, If you have an existing table, dresser, or other piece of furniture with attractive legs, you can remove them and give them new life as part of your DIY coffee table. This method can help you preserve a piece of furniture with sentimental value in a new form.

"
"
Purchase the right type of fasteners.,
Drill pilot holes for the fasteners.,
Secure the fasteners.",How to Build Your Own Coffee Table3," Screws are the most effective and versatile type of fastener for affixing legs to a table top. Purchase wood screws or metal screws depending on the material your tabletop is made from. You can further strengthen a joint using glue if desired.

, With the tabletop on the floor, position the legs where they will be installed. Use an electric drill to create pilot holes for the screws, which will prevent the drill bit from binding or the tabletop from splitting.

, Once the pilot holes are drilled, use your drill or a screwdriver to tighten the fasteners and secure the legs to the tabletop. Once all the screws are tightened, turn the coffee table right-side-up and move it to its new home.

Enjoy your new picnic table!",How to Build a Small Cedar Picnic Table," You will need:


1-5/8in deck screws (x36)
2-1/4in deck screws (x8)
a small can of weatherproofing stain. A half-pint of semitransparent stain and a small disposable foam brush works fine. Deck screws are made for this material, and work much better and last longer than cheaper alternatives like drywall screws.;
, You will need:


8ft 2x4 cedar (really 1-1/2in by 3-1/2in) (x4)
8 feet (2.4 m) 5-1/2in x 5/4in cedar deck boards (x3). Cedar lasts well outside, and these dimensions because they were easily and cheaply available. Have the lumber center cut the 8 feet (2.4 m) deck boards in half (4ft lengths) for you. You will use 5 of the 6 pieces.

, Of course, you should always read, understand, and follow all the safety rules that come with your power tools. Be aware that pressure-treated boards can contain dangerous chemicals. Breathing in sawdust during cutting operations of any wood can be hazardous to your health. Take a firm grip, check your balance, and watch all sharp edges.

, Tables have a frame under the top called the apron. Cut your apron pieces to length. From the 2x4s, cut two 40in lengths and two 24in lengths. Each piece will have a 45degree miter cut on each end, like a picture frame. The measurements are from tip to tip of the long side. Also square cut some small spacers from the 2x4, approximately 1-1/2in long. Assemble the apron sides and spacers on a flat surface (like the floor) with the spacers and clamp around it with the band clamp. Check for square with a framing square and/or measure diagonals. - The diagonals measurements will be equal if the assembly is square.

, Cut 4x 5in mitered braces to connect the apron corners. These should fit inside the apron corners as shown. Attach them using wood glue and 1-5/8in deck screws at the angle shown. Drill and countersink holes for the screws. A quick-change countersink bit for your drill is handy. There are several different kinds.

, From 2 of the 8 feet (2.4 m) 2x4s, cut 4x 29in legs. Try to find the most presentable lengths of wood for the legs, as these will show the most.

, A small taper on the legs relieves the ""blocky"" look and makes the table look less heavy. Cutting a taper on the legs is not difficult if you have a table saw. First, make a tapering jig (sled) to reliably carry the leg across the saw at a slight angle. The taper should end below the top 3-1/2in where the leg will connect to the apron. Cut the taper slowly and watch for the raised saw blade. Afterwards, sand the leg to remove saw marks. Do not try to slide the sled back across the saw after the cut is made while the saw is running - there is a high danger of kickback. Hold the sled after the cut and turn the saw off between cuts. Of course, one should always use a saw blade guard and an anti-kickback device when making through cuts on the table saw.

, Adding glue to mating surfaces, slide the legs into the slots created between the apron sides. The fit may be tight, so you may need to use a hammer to tap the leg into place. Use a small block when hammering to protect the leg itself. If tapered, the taper goes towards the inside of the table. When the leg is in place, clamp it and drive 2x 2-1/4in deck screws through the apron brace into the leg from the inside of the apron. Repeat for all 4 legs. Be sure the leg is vertical and flush to the floor before attaching. A small mistake here will make for a wobble, so it is worth double-checking. Use a wet rag to remove any extra glue squeeze-out.

, Cut the deck boards into approx 4 feet (1.2 m) lengths. Choose the best sides of 5 of the 6 4 feet (1.2 m) deck boards. Find the middle of each apron short side, and mark it. Measure 2-3/4 out on each side from the middle and mark that. These are where the edges of the middle board on the top will cross the apron frame. Align the board with the marks, leaving an even overhang on both ends (approx. 3in). Clamp into place. Measure 1-1/2 in from the side of each board down the middle of the apron side, and mark. Drill and countersink, then attach middle board with 4x 1-5/8in deck screws, 2 on each side.

, Add additional boards on each side of the middle board. Use a temporary 1/4 in spacer strip between boards to leave a space. This space allows rain to drain off and increases the overall width of the table. A speed square (orange) is handy for lining up the screws with previous ones. Line up the overhang as evenly as you can, but the boards may be slightly different lengths. This will be fixed in the following step. Notice that the final outside boards will be screwed down into the top of the legs. Check your screw spacing carefully so that you hit the leg. This is an important part of the leg support.

, Just as when building a deck, the ends of the top boards will be slightly uneven. Draw a straight, square line across the ends, saving as much of the overhang as possible while still allowing a cut with your saw. Clamp a straightedge on the table and run a circular saw along the line to square the ends. Use sandpaper to clean up the cut and remove splinters between the top boards.

, Using a foam or other brush, apply the weatherproofing stain on all sides of the piece, including between the top boards. Follow application directions. Wipe additional stain off of the piece with a rag, removing any puddles or runs. Allow to dry.

, The piece is small enough to move indoors for storage or to place on an apartment balcony, yet still seats four. Adjust the size of the aprons and top pieces or legs to make a longer or shorter table.

Obtain the perfect rotating stool.,
Purchase four KNUFF magazine holders.,
Pick up liquid nails or enough small screws (along with an electric screwdriver) to attach the magazine holders to the stool base.",How to Make a Coffee Table from Magazine Holders1," This will be your base for your coffee table so you want something not only reliable and sturdy but one with legs that compliment your style.

Head for the junkyard and try to find something you can recycle.



 


Consider a stool that either provides you with a sturdy, hard base or one that allows you to mount a piece of plywood or a shelf insert on top.
Examine the stool top to ensure you have enough room to place the magazine holders (all four) on top in a rotating, surrounding fashion.;
, If you cannot find this brand look for four magazine holders that will fit together around the stool seat and have a flat base and sides.

, This is not the kind of coffee table you will want your kids or niece and nephew rough-housing around and could easily break if only secured with liquid nails. However, if you have a rambunctious German Shepherd or a spouse that insists on putting his or her feet on the table, you may want to secure the top with both screws and liquid nails to re-enforce its strength."

Remove the stool seat and prepare it for magazine holder mounting.,
Arrange magazine holders around the top of the stool seat so that the backs of each holder is butting up to one another.,
Apply liquid nails to the back of the magazine holders once you are confident you like the way they fit together on top of the stool.,Re-attach the pre-cut plywood to the stool base

,
Add some strong adhesive.

It's up to you if you want to color it (photoshop rendition).

",How to Make a Coffee Table from Magazine Holders2," Unless you can easily get underneath the stool and still work while it's mounted on the base your best bet will be to remove the top.

Add the shelf insert or pre-cut plywood to the top of your stool. If there is any way to remove stool seat padding to create a flat, hard surface you'll have better table.







, You should have a circular, rounded table with the magazine holder openings facing out (for storage).

, Lay the magazine holder down on top of the stool and press firmly. Give each holder time to dry before adding the next holder to ensure the holders don't slide.


First apply liquid nails and allow it to dry before attaching the stool seat to the plywood/shelf insert with screws.






Glue all four magazine holders until you complete your shape.

Understand what makes a table of any kind.,
Begin with the top.,
Build the apron using wood cut to the size you need.,
Take pieces of scrap wood, approximately 1 x 2 x 6-inches (2.5 X 5.2 X 14.6 cm) and screw them onto the inside of the apron.,
Make the legs from whatever material you decide on.,
Attach the legs to each corner of the apron.,
Turn the coffee table top upside down and put the apron, with the legs attached, on the bottom.,
Sand the surfaces with progressively finer sandpaper beginning with 120-grit and finishing with 220-grit.,
Apply a natural finish, which is particularly nice if you have a great grain pattern.,
Apply carnauba wood wax to the surface for added protection.

",How to Build a Coffee Table," This knowledge helps you understand the process of building your new coffee table. Any table is composed of 3 parts - a top, apron or stringers and legs.;
, The easiest top to make is from .75-inch (.19 cm) plywood. The plywood can have a finished side that is made from just about any veneer you choose, from pine to mahogany or cherry.


Cut the plywood to the size and shape you need. Most coffee tables are rectangular.
Generally, plywood edges are rough. Therefore, you will want to add banding or edging to the outer perimeter. Edging, with thin self-adhesive veneer on one side, can be applied to the perimeter following the manufacturer's directions. The edging must be slightly wider than the plywood.
Trim the edging until it is flush with the plywood surface using either an edge or utility knife.

, The dimensions discussed below are general measurements.


Use 1 x 4-inch (2.5 x 10.2 cm) or 1 x 6-inch (2.5 x 14.6 cm) stock.
Cut the stock to length approximately 3 inches (7.5 cm) less than the length and width of the table top. You will cut the ends with a miter saw at 45 degrees.
Take the apron pieces and assemble with the beveled 45 degree ends together by gluing and using corner clamps. Secure these with 2-inch (5.4 cm) brad nails.

, You need to screw a minimum of two on each side for cleats to attach the top.

, The most common for this project are made from untreated pine 4 x 4-inch (6.2 x 6.2 cm) posts cut to the length you chose for the height of the table minus the top thickness.


With the legs cut to length, sand the edges with sandpaper or use a round-over bit in a router. Also, chamfer the bottom of the leg to keep from chipping the ends when the table slides over.

, The most secure way is to screw it into place using deck screws. Pre-drill holes and counter-sink the screws to keep from splitting the ends of the aprons. Then fill with wood putty to hide the screw heads.

, Center the apron on the table top.


Now attach the apron and legs to the top with screws through cleats attached to the inside of the apron. Pre-drill the hole to keep from splitting the wood used for the cleat.

,


Wipe the dust from the coffee table using a lint-free cloth.

, Start by applying a coat of linseed oil rubbed into all exposed surfaces.


Rub down with ""000"" steel wool after the linseed oil has dried. Now, begin applying 3 coats of varnish with a brush or rag. Rub down the finish between coats with ""000"" steel wool and wipe with a lint free cloth.

Make assumptions.,
Don’t read your insurance schedule and policy wording.,
Don’t have a legal eye glance over your contracts.,
Go ahead, breach a contract.,
Over-extend yourself financially.,
Stand surety for someone else's debt.,
Purchase real estate, timeshares or property fractions without physically viewing the property.,
Use the internet without the correct security / anti-virus settings.,
Try to fix a man/woman.,
Try to teach someone a lesson.,
Engage in an extra-marital affair(this one doesn't apply to open marriages if it's within the terms of your mutual understanding).,
Take justice into your own hands.,
Gossip about, slander or demean someone.,
Believe everything you hear or read.,
Make promises you cannot keep.,
Read contra-indications on medicines and ingredients on natural health products and foodstuffs.,
Believe HIV and STD’s only happen to ""other people"".",How to Become a Fool," It's said that assuming ""makes an ass out of you and me"". Well, nothing has changed. It does. The caution is that sometimes people don’t like being checked up on, and although you have the best intentions, to avoid assumption, still you may end up being slapped or told off by someone if you ask ""too many"" or the ""wrong"" questions. A healthy balance between the two is recommended.


Making major decisions on assumptions is very dangerous. People should however be more tolerant of one another when it comes to assumptions about smaller, minor things. It is human nature to assume and we should be more forgiving of our brothers and sisters for this.

Learn not to sweat the small stuff. Be ready to defend yourself with good reasons if someone does make an assumption about you or your life. Live a clean, transparent life of integrity that will leave little room for assumption. Don’t be quick to judge others. Make every effort to live at peace with everyone.;
, If you have had an insurance claim declined by your insurance company, you will know that this is one of the more detrimental acts of foolishness one can commit.


Totally relying on your broker to represent you -- not ""the company"" -- is foolishness. At the point of your claim, there is nothing stopping your broker from merely proving that they sent you the documents for you to read and approve, you didn't, and they covered themselves, while you fumbled your opportunity. Read supporting documents thoroughly and ask many questions. This is an area where you need to be as pedantic as possible. It could save you a lot of money and disappointment in the long run.

, Those believing they can do this alone are somewhat foolish. Unless you have a sound knowledge of law, having a legally qualified person approve your contracts is a must. The impact of having a clause against a person’s constitutional rights in a contract for example is a sure pathway to trouble. Ask many questions.


Check for gray areas as these will always be turned in favour of the person who drafted and offered the contract. Don’t be tricked through ""unread"" contractual obligations and small print (get out the magnifying glass). Insist on openness, transparency and using language that is easily understood. Highlight areas you wish the other party to a contract to pay particular attention to by either typing the same in bold or underlining it so that you cannot be accused of ""hiding things"" in the small print of a contract at a later stage.

Get one or two trusted advisers to read over a contract prior to signing it and do not accept anything you are not satisfied with until you fully understand the impact of what you are committing to by accepting the contract.



, Once your contract is signed, a sure way to drink of the cup of foolishness is to breach (violate) your contract. Although, breach of contract can be a strategic move, yet generally, this should be avoided.


There are better ways to exit a situation if you need to than to deliberately breach a contract. The impact could turn out to be more trouble than you can handle and can see you wrapped up in expensive litigation for a time to come.

, Governments that have passed National Credit Acts and have imposed strict laws surrounding borrowing and lending of money are to be commended.


Few things are more stressful than being over-extended financially. People have taken their own lives over this. The shame of bad debt, judgements and asset repossessions is hurtful not only to the person who experiences it, but their loved ones too. It is just not worth it.

, The bible teaches that this is foolishness. Standing surety for someone else's debt is often an emotional decision.


An emotional decision about money is usually a foolish decision. Saying ""no"" might just help the other person to re-evaluate their needs and priorities. If you can’t afford it with honest declaration or without surety, don’t buy it. As simple as that.

, A saying exists – ""In God we trust, everything else we audit"". The same should be for property or real estate prior to purchasing it.


Avoid unproved or unimproved real estate: you want to physically see paint, the bricks and mortar, or see land before investing in it. Buying ""off plan"" is risky business, but this is excluded from the advice here. Many people have been caught buying ""non-existent real estate,"" fractions, undivided land shares, or have invested in timeshare only to be sorely disappointed.
Only use reputable companies (and use title insurance) for this kind of investment and please do visit the location if possible prior to signing on the dotted line. The wrecking yard or pig farm next door -- that you never saw -- may trash you plans completely.

, Want your money stolen out of your bank account? Your hard-drive infected with scary viruses? Your hard drive crashing on you at that crucial moment? If not, don’t do this.


A computer accessing the internet without the correct security and anti-virus is a risk to all of us. Make sure you load a reputable anti-virus system. Try avoid the ""free trials"" available on the internet. Instead, purchase the original software belonging to a reputable anti-virus and security company.
Update your anti-virus regularly or buy a product that automatically updates every time you access the internet. This is a non-negotiable.

, Objecting to certain unappealing traits or aspects of the men/women in your lives is not always a bad thing. We should sometimes be prepared to engage with others in an effort to ""call them higher"". Foolishness lies in believing that you were sent into someone’s life to fix them.


The need to fix a person is often rooted in one’s own insecurities, or a need to be needed. Look out for the warning signs. The old saying ‘a leopard does not change its spots’ is a wise saying. Expect people not to change and become accepting of them as they are. If they do change, it will be a rarity and very often out of the courage of their own life experience or convictions, and will very unlikely have anything to do with you. This is very often not an effort worth making and should be avoided.

, This is similar to taking justice into your own hands (see below). It always backfires. Always. It is said ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’. This is true. An active, strategic effort at trying to teach someone a lesson is never a good thing. We should trust that God has their lives in His hand, and that he will take them on the journey he intended them to be on.


Strategic interference in people’s lives generally backfire, and you will end up being viewed as the perpetrator. This is not a risk worth taking and will convert you into a fool in no time.

, Need I say more? This always ends in heartache and pain. I am yet to hear of an extra-marital affair that did not end in this way. The whole idea of ‘he is my soul mate’ when you or he/she has committed to someone else etc. etc. is foolishness. We are all victims or victors of the choices we make.


Take a whole long time to make the decision to commit to marriage in the first place, and revere the responsibility of the commitment you have made. An extra-marital affair always brings about shame, betrayal and dishonour to all parties involved. Many powerful leaders have seen their worlds crashing down at the mercy of this foolish act. Resist and the temptation will flee.

, We have seen this happen in the movies a few times, haven’t we? Sometimes, a hero emerges. This is once again, very rare. Often, engaging in this behavior will see you revert from hero to zero in a few minutes flat. There is a time and a place for everything – and that includes dealing with injustice.


Your country’s judicial system should sufficiently offer you protection and redemption for any injustice you have experienced. If you perceive an injustice has occurred to you or another, seek legal counsel prior to attempting to take justice into your own hands.

, Want to see yourself in court over a defamation case? Go ahead and whisper untruths (or perceived truths) to another about someone else. Gossip happens so quickly and is especially rampant in closed communities, like offices and churches.


The consequences to this are great, and often irrevocable in the victim’s life. Poisonous seeds planted in a person’s mind about another will grow into a tree and relationships will always be sorely affected by this foolish act. Stop this before it starts.

, This piggy-back’s on the comment above regarding gossip and slander. Once those poisonous seeds have been planted, you have an opportunity to exercise wisdom or foolishness in how you react to these seeds.


You can uproot weeds of gossip by taking them back immediately when you or another may plant them, or allow them to set in and take root in your hearts and minds. Keeping our consciences clear and restoring people in love by correcting it when they gossip about others is definitely the solution.

, It is frustrating and disappointing when you are on the other side of a broken promise. There are often financial and legal consequences to this too, for example breaking off an engagement or breach of contract. Sometimes, circumstances cannot be prevented and you have no choice but to break off a promise.


The trick is to exercise caution before committing in a promise to someone, whether it be verbal or written. Think of all the consequences prior to making a promise. Consider whether you in fact have mandate or permission to make that promise. Avoid being a people pleaser by telling people what they want to hear as opposed to the truth. The break of a promise on your part (whether perceived or factual) ruins your reputation. Once that is lost, you are marginalized to be among the counsel of fools. Try avoiding this by being pro-active and thinking before you act (or make a promise in this case).

, Many healers come in the name of ‘natural therapy’ with the intention of deceiving people. Be careful prior to purchasing these products and always ensure some scientific research or medical research supports the product you are using. Most illegal drugs are also derived from natural sources. Go figure!


Check ingredients of foodstuffs and vitamins and minerals. Even trace elements of allergens such as iodine could result in the loss of your life if you are sensitive to this. This is definitely not a risk worth taking. Many people have been made a fool of or have flippantly used these products, only to be laughed at by professionals or caused themselves further damage or harm in the long run.

, Unprotected sex and promiscuous behavior, including sharing needles with drug use etc. is foolishness. Receive education about these issues, which is freely available in most countries.


Take responsibility for yourself in these circumstances. Irresponsibility in this area causes a ripple effect and many lives can be damaged or destroyed by foolish acts such as these. Also, you could see yourself in court for attempted murder. Take responsibility before things get out of hand. Adopt the philosophy that no man or woman can be trusted in this area, and protect yourself. It only takes once to fall into this trap, and very often a lifetime to recover, if at all.

Build a model boat.,
Build a model house or a dollhouse.",How to Make Wood Crafts3," Model boats are a bit tricky to shape and it's best to find individual patterns for these, depending on the type of boat you're after. A very basic one can be made from a rectangular block of wood with a dowel hole drilled in the center, a dowel inserted for the sail pole and a sail (cloth or paper) attached to the dowel pole. It's not the most elegant but it's quick and simple, and from there, you can start building more advanced versions., Wooden model houses can be made in many ways, depending on the end use. They're great for model railroads, war gaming setups, displays and doll play. Even simple square or rectangular blocks of wood can be turned into model wooden houses, using paint to add all of the interesting features.

See How to build a wooden dollhouse for more details.

Take your stilts off.",How to Make Stilts," These will be trapezoid pieces of wood which will hold your feet. Get a piece of 1








Use a table saw to cut out the two triangles. When you have them cut out, measure down 1 inch from where the two 8 inch sides meet (top point). Make a mark one inch down on both of the 8 inch sides.
Connect these two points using a pencil and a ruler. Take your table saw out again and cut along the line. Make sure you do this to both triangles.
Finally, take a piece of sand paper and smooth over the edges. You should now have two trapezoid shapes with 10 inch bases, and 7 inch sides (triangle with the top cut off).;
, You will need to purchase two 48 inch 2X2 boards at your local hardware store. Take the boards back to your workspace and lay them down on a flat surface. Mark the middle point of each of the two boards (24 inches) with a ruler and pencil. Take your table saw and cut the boards along the mark you just created. You should now have four pieces of 2X2 wood, each 24 inches long.







, Do this so that the four long sides, not the short ends, are next to one another. You can use a clamp to press the boards together to make the next few steps easier. Go to one end of your four boards. Make a mark 1 inch down and 5 inches down on one of the boards using a pencil and ruler. Do this again on another one of the boards.








Take your ruler and line up the two 1 inch marks. Draw a line connecting them which runs across all four boards.
Take your ruler and line up the two 5 inch marks. Draw a line connecting them which runs across all four boards.
On two of your boards, draw an extra dash 6 inches down the board.

, Take two boards (one with the 6 inch mark and one without) and place them separately from the other two boards. You will only work on two at a time. Lay the 6 inch marked board on the table, with the pencil lines facing up. Take the board without the 6 inch mark and turn it around 180 degrees. Lay it on top of the bottom board, also with the pencil lines facing up.The edge of the top piece should lay right on the 6 inch line of the bottom board. The 1 and 5 inch marks of both boards should run parallel with one another. Note: there is only 6 inches of total overlapping board.
Clap these two boards together in between the 1 and 5 inch marks of the top board.

, On the 1 and 5 inch marks of the top board, mark the middle of those lines with a pencil and ruler. Since they are 2X2 boards, the middle of those lines should be 1 inch. Take a drill and make a hold on those two middle marks. Drill all the way down until you go through both boards. Make sure that you are doing this in a safe location like a shed, as you don't want to drill down and damage a nice table.








Once you have drilled the holes, lay down a washer over each hole and then slide 4 1/2 inch bolts into each of the holes.
Take off the clamp once the bolts are all the way through.

, This is the piece you cut earlier. Place it underneath the two connected 2X2 boards so that the short edge of the trapezoid is parallel with the edge of the top board. Take out a hammer and gently tap on each of the bolts. This will make two marks on the trapezoid where you will drill holes into.








Separate the trapezoid from the other boards. Use your drill to drill holes where the two marks are.
Place the trapezoid back underneath the boards in the same position, only this time feed the bolts through the two holes you just drilled.
Put two washers on the ends of the bolts (side of the trapezoid) and then place a nut on each of the bolts. Use a wrench to tighten and secure the nuts all he way down to the face of the trapezoid.

, Get out another piece of plywood. Measure out a rectangle that is 10 inches long and 4 inches wide. Cut the rectangle out with a table saw. Smooth over the edges using a piece of sandpaper. Flip your attached 2X2 boards around so that the trapezoid is facing up. Place the flat side of the board against the long, 10 inch edge of the trapezoid and the 2X2 board it is parallel with. Drill a hole through the rectangle down into the board underneath.








Then take a 2 inch screw and place it in the hole. Use a screwdriver to attach the rectangle to the underlying board.
You can ass as many screws as you would like for added durability. Add a screw to each of the side of the rectangle where only thew trapezoid is underneath. Always pre-drill the holes so that the plywood doesn't split.

, Bend your knee so it is at a 90 degree angle. Take a tape measure and measure from 1 1/2 inch below the knee to the floor. We will call this length Z. Measure length Z from your footing, up the length of the stilt. Make a mark using a pencil. Then, take your table saw and cut at this mark. This way the stilts will be suited your particular leg length., Purchase plastic piping from your nearby hardware store. The piping should have a 4-5 inch diameter. Once you have purchased the pipe, mark 3 inches down from the edge of the pipe. The pipe should have grooves which will allow you do draw a line all the way around the pipe 3 inches down. You should use a Sharpie or magic marker to make the line.








Take your table saw and cut along this marker line. You can also use scissors if your plastic piping is thin enough

, Take your 3 inch pipe piece and cut it in half along the top, not the side, with a table saw. One of these halves will go on one stilt, while the other half will go on the other stilt. Take one of the halves and place it above the footing, about 1 inch from the top of the stilt. The pip should curl inward. Pre-two holes into the pipe, halfway through the 2X2 inch board.Place nails into each of the holes and screw them in using a screwdriver.
Make sure to add the piping to the other stilt as well.

, You will want to find ones that are rather thin in terms of their thickness. Place the each shoe on the appropriate footing (left shoe, left footing; right foot, right footing). Clamp the two shoes down to secure them. Take out your drill and drill 3-4 holds through the inside-bottom of the shoe into the footing below. Make sure not to drill holes through the heel, which could make it uncomfortable to stand in.Place a screw in each of your holds you just drilled. Take a screwdriver and screw each of them all the way into your footing.
Wiggle your shoe slightly to make sure that it is secure. You don't want it to slip off when you stand up in them.

, Drill a hole into each of your stilts on the upper part of the backside stilt boards. This hole should be in the middle of plastic pipe, but on the reverse side. Cut a piece of one-wrap velcro that is a little longer than the circumference of your calf. To determine this, wrap a long piece of one-wrap velcro all the way around your calf, and continue for another 2 inches. Cut at this point using scissors.








Take the end of the strap of velcro and place it overtop the pre-drilled hole. Then place a fender washer overtop of the overlap. Drill again through to the pre-drilled hole to make a hole through the velcro.
Place a wood screw into the hole, and screw it in using a screwdriver.
Make sure that both stilts get a piece of velcro.

, It is best to sit high-up, like on a bar stool, when you put your stilts on. Also, make sure that the stool is next to a higher structure, such as the edge of your house, or a fence, so that when you stand you have something to hold onto. Sit on the stool and put on each of the stilts on one at a time.








Place your foot in the appropriate stilt. Slide it into the shoe and tie the shoe. Then, wrap the velcro around your leg tightly, and attach it around (the velcro sticks to itself).
You do not want to wrap too tightly, otherwise you could lose circulation.

, Get out of your stool and stand up on your stilts, as you lean against a taller structure (fence, house, etc.) Walk back and forth slowly, holding onto the structure, to get used to how they feel. Once you feel comfortable enough, let your hands go, but continue to walk near the tall structure in case you fall.








It is best to have an extra person nearby to catch you if you fall in the opposite direction.
After you have mastered walking near your structure, begin to venture out. Continue to have someone follow you just in case you fall. It is best to walk around in your yard, in case the worst happens your fall won't hurt so bad.

, Once you are done walking around, sit back dow in the stool. Undo the velcro strips, and step out of the shoes. Place the stilts some place you won't forget them and they won't get damaged. You are now free to decorate your stilts if you would like. Add a coat of paint to them. You can stain the wood to protect it from moisture. You can even add stickers or pen designs. The possibilities are endless, and all up to you!

Set up your workstation.,
Saw the board into two pieces.,
Drill a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) hole in the wood.,
Wrap black tape around the board.,
Connect the two boards.,
Screw the boards together.,
Finish the toy.",How to Make a Wooden Gun1," To build this toy gun, you will need a wooden 2x4 length of board, a saw, black tape, sandpaper, a drill and screws.;
, Start with a 2x4 piece of wood about 60 centimeter (23.6 in) long. Cut the board into two pieces, one 40 centimeter (15.7 in) and the other 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long. Place the longer board in a vice.

, Place the hole in the center of the plank about 9 centimeter (3.5 in) away from one end of the board.

, You should wrap tape around the board from the opposite end of the hole to just before you reach the hole. Make sure the hole is still exposed.

, Place the longer board over the smaller, making sure the hole is on top. The boards should be positioned to form a right angle. Just envision the longer board as the barrel and the shorter board as the stock of a gun.

, Using your drill, attach a small screw though the previously-drilled hole and into the shorter board underneath. Be sure the head of the screw is larger than the hole so it doesn't slip through.

, You can either sand the ""stock"" of the toy gun, wrap it with black tape or leave it as it is. Feel free to add further decoration with paint or markers. If your child likes playing cowboys or armies, this would be a great birthday or Christmas present.


You can make the gun a more realistic toy by adding a ""trigger."" Glue a wooden clothespin under the ""barrel"" of the toy gun, making sure that the shorter ""clip"" end is pointed outward. Later, your child can even stretch a rubber band from the clothes pin to the end of the gun's ""barrel,"" releasing and ""shooting"" the rubber band by opening the clothespin ""trigger."""

Begin by selecting the type of photo, picture or art that you wish to make the puzzle from.,
Decide on the size of the puzzle that you wish to make, which will usually depend on the size of photo that you plan on using for the puzzle.,
Select a good quality plywood substrate no thinner than a 1/4"" thick.,
Prepare the substrate by making sure that all imperfections are filled with a quality wood filler.,
Glue the desired photo to the substrate.,
Properly tune up your jigsaw.,
Install the smallest blade that you feel comfortable using.,
Cutting the puzzle can be accomplished in two ways, freehand or with a template.,
Glue the template to a 1/8"" thick piece of plywood or heavy cardstock.",How to Make a Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle from a Photo," Digital photos make a great choice because they are simple and inexpensive to print from your home computer. Until you feel comfortable with the process of puzzle making, it is highly recommended that you do not use an original photo. Mistakes can happen when cutting a puzzle, so stick with a photo that can easily be reprinted.;
, Some things to keep in mind are whether you want someone to spend hours putting the puzzle together, or you want the puzzle to be solved quickly. As a general rule, larger puzzles usually are considered to be more difficult.

, Baltic birch plywood is great if you have a source for it, otherwise the plywood sold at most most craft stores will be sufficient. Either way, the more cores, or layers the plywood has the more stable it will be. For this reason avoid home center plywood. Not only will they have a minimum number of cores, the poor quality of these cores may lead to voids in the center of the panel that won't be evident until it is too late.

, Sand the substrate with at least 180 grit sandpaper, and use a vacuum or compressed air to remove all dust. Any dust or debris left on the substrate prior to gluing will telegraph through your photo, or even damage it. If time allows, press the panel between two 3/4"" plywood cauls for several days to ensure it is absolutely flat.

, This is the most important step in the process of puzzle making. The best method is probably to use a vacuum press, but if this type of equipment is not available to you spray adhesive is also acceptable. Whichever method you choose, it is important that the substrate is completely covered with glue. Any voids in the glue will be exposed during the cutting process, and may damage the piece beyond repair.

, Properly mounting the saw to a stable bench will reduce vibration. Square the table to the blade, and clean and wax the saw table. If your saw has a large throat opening, make a simple zero clearance insert by cutting part way through a business card and taping it to the table. Zero clearance helps to prevent smaller pieces from becoming damaged by falling through the opening.

, A 2/0 blade is by far the largest I would recommend. Thinner blades, though easier to break, make for much tighter fitting puzzles. The best option is to order 4/0 or 8/0 jeweler's blades from an online source or catalog.

, Freehand, while more difficult to master, will lead to less predictable (and therefore more difficult) puzzles. This method also allows you the freedom to cut around important sections of your puzzle as opposed to cutting through them. (i.e. a loved one's face or another important element of the photo) Templating is a good way to begin to learn the art of puzzle making. Templates can be printed from online sources or drawn freehand by you, the craftsman. If you choose to use this method, you will need to read below, otherwise continue to cut freehand.

, Once the glue has dried, stack this glued template onto your puzzle blank and wrap both pieces with clear packing tape. It is important that you completely wrap around the entire ""sandwich"" to ensure that it doesn't come apart while cutting the puzzle. Simply follow the lines of your template, remembering that slower is usually better. Do not get frustrated if you stray from the lines of your template. Once the template is removed from the cut puzzle, you will be the only one to ever know.

Choose a piece of wood.,
Mark the basic outline of the gun's profile on the wood.,
Cut the gun from the wood.,
Sand the wood.,
Cut appropriate holes in the gun.,
Attach a barrel.,
Finish the toy gun.",How to Make a Wooden Gun2," Select a piece of wood that is big enough to accommodate the size of the gun you plan to carve. Choose a wood such as pine that is soft enough to carve, but tough enough to be a durable toy. You can even try to find a board with a natural grain suitable for a gun's stock.

, Using a photograph from a book or magazine as a guide, draw the basic shape of the gun you hope to replicate, be it a hand gun or a rifle. Unless you are trying to make a scale replica, a free-handed outline should be sufficient., Saw around the gun shape you drew. Use a jig saw for curves and short angles or straight edges. If you have longer lengths to cut, you might prefer a circular saw.

, Smooth over the contours of the gun shape with a small hand grinder and a coarse sanding disc. If you don't have a hand grinder, you can use coarse sand paper and some elbow grease.

, Use a drill to create holes where they should occur on the gun, such as the trigger area and in the stock. The location of the holes will vary based upon the gun you are carving. Reference the original photograph to determine where to cut.


Use a small saw to expand the small holes to the appropriate size and shape. Sand the edges of the holes by hand., You can extend the barrel of the gun using a wooden dowel. Cut a wooden dowel to desired length and sand the ends.Mark a center line on the top of the gun's body. Carefully use a router to cut a groove along this line for the dowel barrel. The groove should be just wide enough to set the dowel in it.
Run a bead of wood glue down the groove and position the dowel in groove.

, You can choose to decorate the gun using paint or markers, drawing details, making the gun camouflaged or painting it a solid color. If you prefer the natural wood look, you can either leave the wooden gun unfinished or rub a wood stain over it.

Create a toy gun that makes noise.,
Cut five large sticks.,
Stack the three cut halves.,
Attach the first two sticks to the newly-made gun handle.,
Create the barrel of the gun with smaller sticks.,
Create a trigger for your gun with two more small sticks.,
Place the ""trigger"" in between the two sides of the gun's body.,
Attach one of the leftover segments from a small Popsicle stick to the gun.",How to Make a Wooden Gun3," A wooden click-clack gun can be made using two sizes of tongue depressors or Popsicle sticks, toothpicks, glue and rubber bands.


Separate the sticks into two groups of five sticks each, one of large sized and the other of the smaller size.

, Using a drill with a small wood bit, bore a hole in the center of two of the sticks. Cut the other three sticks in half, then cut one rounded edge off of three of those halves, creating an angled corner., Place them so the newly-cut angles match up. Glue the stack together to make the handle of your toy gun using wood glue or super glue.

, Create the body of your toy gun by placing one of the bore-holed sticks on each side of the stacked handle. Angle the sticks as a gun's body would be positioned against its stock. Make sure each side of the body is lined up with the other, and glue them to the handle.

, Stack three of the smaller Popsicle sticks and glue them together, much as you did with the gun's handle. Glue the stack in between the two body sticks to extend the gun's ""barrel."" Make sure you place the barrel beyond the holes you drilled through the gun's body so it is not in between the holes you drilled through the larger sticks.

, Form a cross shape with two of the smaller-sized Popsicle sticks, gluing them together in the center. Bore a hole large enough to insert a toothpick through the center of the cross., Line the hole in the middle of the trigger up with the holes you previously bored through the center of those two larger sticks. Insert a toothpick through the gun body and the trigger hole.


Glue the toothpick to the gun body, but be careful not to let the trigger stick to the toothpick. Once the glue is dry, cut away the extra sections of the toothpick on either side of the gun.
The trigger should rotate freely inside the body of the gun without sliding in either direction.

, Place the segment lengthwise across the back side of the gun, just behind the trigger. Attach the segment to the gun using a rubber band. Simply spin the trigger to make a clacking sound as it drags across the final segment."

Assume you’ll be pranked.,
Know who is likely to prank you.,
Know what date it is.",How to Avoid Being Pranked1," If you get pranked a lot at school or at work, you can assume that there’s always a chance it will happen. Being prepared for a prank, rather than having to try to dodge one as it’s happening, is the best way to avoid it all together!, Maybe you have one or two friends who are always the ones pulling the pranks. When you’re around them, make sure you’re extra aware of where they are and what they’re doing. By keeping a close eye on those most likely to prank you, you can avoid giving them the opportunity to get started!, A prank can happen at any time and anywhere, but a lot of people will try to pull off April Fool’s Day pranks. Knowing that April Fool’s Day - April 1st - is near will help you to be more aware and avoid the most embarrassing pranks."

Make or bring your own food.,
Keep track of your stuff.,
Avoid overly specific directions.",How to Avoid Being Pranked2," A common way to prank someone is by messing with their food, so it’s best to bring your own food to school or make your own food at home. That prevents anyone from having the chance to mess with it.


If someone who is a prankster offers you food, refuse it. It’s likely they did something to it before they handed it to you!
Check condiments that you might use, too, like ketchup and mustard or salt and pepper. Loosening the lid so the next person to use it gets a whole lot more than they wanted is a classic prank!, Keep your gym clothes in a bag locked in your locker so no one can take them. Keep your phone in your pocket when you’re not using it so someone can’t take it and change the language in settings., If someone gives you a direction that sounds overly specific – like asking you to sit in a very specific chair – avoid it! This usually means they’re trying to set up a prank."

Change your passwords frequently.,
Be suspicious.,
Spend less time on the internet.",How to Avoid Being Pranked3," Changing the passwords on your phone, computer, and tablet can prevent people from getting into them and messing with your settings or posting to your social media accounts. You should consider doing this especially if your friends are likely to know what your password might be, like a pet’s name or the street you grew up on., If something – a news story, an offer from a friend, or a situation like “$100 gift cards in the break room!” – seems too good to be true, it probably is! Make sure you follow up on these types of instances. See if other news sites have the same story, or check with friends and coworkers to see what they've heard and if it matches what you know. Some of your friends might be in on the prank, but not everyone will be!Avoid news sites that are notorious for doing things like this, especially around April Fool’s Day. Google usually pulls an April Fool’s Day prank, as does the Village Voice. The British press in general also loves a good prank at the beginning of April, so take news from these sources with a grain of salt!, This suggestion is probably the hardest to follow through on, but the easiest way to avoid getting pranked on the internet is to spend less time there! Instead you could read a book or magazine or even watch the news on TV. Giving people fewer opportunities to prank you helps you to avoid getting pranked!"

Determine how much height you would like to gain on your stilts.,
In the standing position, have someone measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to your elbow.

,
Add the measurements from #1 and #2 together.,
Make the stilt poles: Cut the 2”x2” board into two pieces which are each the length determined in #3.,
Make the footholds: Cut another 2”x2” piece to a length that exceeds the width of your foot by 1”.,
Make the foothold supports: Cut the 2”x4”x4” board into triangles such that two sides of each triangle are 4” long (the hypotenuse is therefore longer than 4”).

,
Nail these triangle footholds into the 2”x2” stilt poles.,
Take the footholds and place each perpendicular to the stilt pole on top of the triangle foothold support for each stilt.,
If any of the nails are too long, hammer them so that the point faces downward, so as to avoid injury if you fall off the stilts.

,
Sand down any rough spots on the top of the boards or on the hand holds to make the stilts more comfortable to grip.

,
Voila!",How to Make Beginner Stilts," One foot (about 30.5 cm)is recommended for beginners. ;
,, This will be the length of your stilt poles.

, Be cautious to cut the ends so at least one end on each pole (the bottom) is flat, as this will be the surface on which you will be walking.

, A good size is usually 4”-6”. Again, insure that at least one side on each piece is flat, as this side will line up with the long stilt poles.

,, You will want to measure to make sure you are nailing these pieces in at the right height. From the bottom of the stilt poles, measure the height you want to gain (from #1) and subtract 2”. This will be where you nail in the top of the triangle, so that one of the 4” surfaces is perpendicular to the stilt pole and the other is parallel to the stilt pole. Two nails should be used to secure each triangle. Hammer one nail in through the bottom of the triangle (1” from the bottom) through the stilt pole first. Hammer the other about 1” above that through the triangle first.

, The foothold should fit nicely on top of the triangle. Make sure the flat side of the foothold is next to the stilt pole. To fix the foothold into place, nail the footholds into both the 2”x2” stilt pole and the foothold supports. Three nails should be hammered in through the top of the foothold, at a 45 degree angle to the foothold, through the support and stilt pole.

,,, You can now try to walk on your stilts! Happy walking!

Collect a suitable stick or twig.,
Cut the wand to a length that reaches from the tip of your middle finger to your elbow.,
Scrape all the bark off it.,
Round off the ends using a cutting knife.,
Make additions to your wand if you wish.,
Also be sure to use sandpaper to make your wand smooth.,
Finished.








",How to Make a Wand1," Pick one that you like the most. Some people choose the wood very carefully for its special meaning or properties. If that idea appeals to you, you may need to spend more time and dedicate more research to finding the appropriate wood.






;
, This is your personal cubit.








, Or, leave some bark on it if you prefer a more gnarled, natural appearance to your wand.








, Do this very carefully so as not to cut yourself. For those of you making a wand for fun (for example, Harry Potter fans), you can stop here if you like. Your wand is done!








, If you want to create a friendship token or you wish to incorporate your wand into religious ceremonies, you may wish to add items that carry significant meanings for you. These can include a crystal, a bunch of mixed herbs, or any type of magical stone. Use these items and rub them over the wand. You could also attach them if desired.









If you are making a friendship token, it is a good idea to look up the meanings of the wood and herbs so that you can reflect the nature of your friendship through the meanings of the plant material that you use.

, You might also want to paint or stain it. Any number of colors can be used. It may be possible to carve designs into the wood as well but this takes a great deal of skill and patience and should not be undertaken lightly.

Note how the puzzle interlocks.,

Draw the outline of the elevation, plan and end view.,
Set out a square (A, B, C, D).,
Project the lines D A and C B upwards as at 1.,
Project the four points of your dovetail downwards into the end view.,Cut the joint.,
Glue the joint.,
Determine how big (in width and thickness) you want your puzzle to be.,
Cut dovetails square to the ends of the wood.",How to Make a Double Dovetail Puzzle," This is the true view of what is happening in this puzzle.,
The end view in the first instance is indicated by 3, 4, 5 and 6, and it measures 17⁄8 ins. square. A 17⁄8-ins. square is simply used because 2-ins. wood generally finishes this size after it is planed up.

, This should stand corner-ways in the larger square (3, 4, 5, 6)., On to this drawing (1), set out the dovetail according to your own idea of length, width and bevel., Where these lines cut A, B, and D, C, draw them downwards and rebate them into your original plan. This will give the true shape of the two dovetails and it is to this shape that you must cut your joint.,, Once the glue has dried, plane and waste off the four corners of your model. The end view shows one corner shaded D, 3, A; this and the other three corners are wasted away. The result is that the dovetails are thrown into a plane different from that in which they were made., The length is not affected. Obtain a piece of wood that is larger in width and thickness by about a third. E.g., if your puzzle is to be 2"" (50mm) square (in section) then start with a piece of wood 3"" (75mm) in section.
, Assemble and when glue has set, mark a line from end to end down the middle of each side and cut the corners off along these lines. Sand smooth."

Prepare the pieces required.,
Fit the puzzle together.,
Make the First Stage.,
Make the Second Stage.,
Create the key.,
Put the ""key"" in place.,
Place together.,
Undo the puzzle.",How to Make a Chinese Puzzle," In making these twenty-one pieces, what should be borne in mind is that the different parts fit closely into each other. Consequently the slots, in width, must be cut so as to grip the thickness of the wood; in depth they must be exactly half this thickness:
Six pieces, 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) long, with a half slot cut in the centre as shown. This slot must be exactly the width of the wood's thickness, and cut exactly halfway through, so that, if two pieces are placed across by means of the halved joint, their surfaces will be flush. The slot must also be exactly in the centre.



 


Six pieces, size 2 1/2 ins. long, with a half-cut centre slot similar to the previous slot.






Six required, these being 1 1/2 ins. in length, and with slots in the middle as before.






One of these last six requires special treatment, as it forms the key block of the puzzle. After its slot has been cut, one half of the narrow part must be sawn away, as shown. The inner edge must also be gently rounded. The special use of this vital piece, which we will call the ""key,"" will be fully explained presently.






In addition to these, there are three central bars to make. Like the other parts they are 1/2 in. by 1/2 in., but are each 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) long, and are cut as shown. The end projections a are 1/2 in. long, and the cut-away part is exactly half the depth of the wood. Two of the three pieces (X and Y in Fig. 374) are similar, but the slot b of the third one (Z) is only 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) wide instead of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). As will be noticed, this 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) slot is not in the centre, but corresponds with the right-hand half of the larger slots of X and Y.





;
, The three central bars must first be joined, as those form the skeleton framework of the structure. This illustration shows them in position, but as it is a puzzle in itself as to how they can be got thus some explanation is necessary.

, First take the bars X and Y (see Figure E) and arrange them as shown in Figure G.
It is most important that the projections a of ""X"" face upwards, and that the projections a of ""Y"" face towards the centre.






Then take the bar ""Z"" and bring it flat into the slot of ""X"". The little slot of ""Z"", however, must remain above the slot of ""X"".






Then slide the bar ""Y"" along to the centre, so that the part lettered ""c"" slips into the little slot of bar ""Z"".






This may seem confusing to read, but it is easy to follow when the pieces are in one's hand. The result of this rather clever arrangement is that the six arms of Figure F are all exactly the same length, width, and thickness. They are also arranged so that in each arm may be clasped one piece each of Figures A, B, and C. The three central arms may, of course, be set up in a different order, and here we have merely chosen the way that is the most simple to describe and illustrate.







, In the remaining part of the work, the chief difficulty is to keep the puzzle from falling to pieces before the key finally locks it. Take the longer cross parts, Figure A, and clasp one to each arm. The six need not all be put on meanwhile, but only those which are most easily handled. The next size (Figure B) may then be put on.

, In the ordinary course, each arm could be completed with its three cross pieces until the sixth is attempted, and here the reader would find that, at the last moment, the attempt will be frustrated. You will not get the last small piece in, as other bars lock the puzzle. Here it is that the ""key"" comes in.
Three of the arms may straight away be fitted complete with their three cross parts. These are the ones where the longer crosspiece (Figure A) lies flush with the back of the central bar (shown in Figure H). This is easily found out when at work on the puzzle.






In the case of the other three arms there is, of course, a gap caused by the long slots of the central bars. Adjust the parts on the first-named three arms, and then deal with the fourth arm, putting in all three cross parts. For the little one here, use the ""key"".

, Place the ""key"" so that it overlaps the end projection of the arm (Figure I). A space is left at the centre, and means is thus afforded for getting in the three cross parts on the remaining two arms.


This practically ends the puzzle. While the ""key"" is in its overlapping position the parts may be separated, but if it is turned round on its narrow neck, so that it is in exactly the same position as the other five small cross parts, it locks the whole thing so tightly that nothing but sheer force could loosen the twenty-one pieces.

, So far as the order of putting together is concerned, there are many equally satisfactory ways, these being determined by the ease or difficulty that one experiences in holding the half-finished puzzle. It all comes to the same in the end, and the ""key"" must be placed on one bar before the last three arms can be completed. The ""key,"" moreover, must be on one of the bars where a gap is left at the centre, and not on one where Figure A lies flush against the central arm as in Figure H.

, To take the puzzle to pieces, all that is required is to turn the ""key"" half round and push the other two cross bars on that arm towards the outer point. The cross bars below may then be removed, and the whole structure falls to pieces.

Get materials.,
Trim the dowel rod.,
Trim the spindle.,
Make the dowel pinhole.,
Place the dowel pin.,
Add any finishing details.",How to Make a Wand2," You will need a dowel rod (with roughly ½” diameter), a second dowel rod or dowel pins (roughly ¼” diameter, as it must fit inside the first dowel rod), a wood spindle (sometimes called a chair spindle or a decorator spindle), wood glue, a saw, sandpaper, and a drill with a bit similar to the dowel pin you use.








, This will form the main part of the wand. It can be whatever length you prefer (in Harry Potter, Hagrid’s wand is 16” but some wands are a small as 9”). Measure it and cut it to size using the saw. You can sand and round the tip using the sandpaper if you want to.








, The spindle will form the handle. You can usually get two handles from a single spindle. Cut it into whatever pieces you feel are appropriate using the saw.








, Drill a hole at the center of both the handle and the main section of the wand where the two will join together, going up into the core of each. Be careful to drill straight and not use a drill bit which is too large for the pin you will place.








, Using either a much thinner dowel rod trimmed to size or appropriately sized pre-cut dowel pins, cover the pin in glue and place it in the handle hole. Once it is in place, put the other end into the hole in the main section of the wand. Push them together until they are solidly joined. If there is too much resistance, you can use a hammer or other heavy object to gently tap them into place.








, Remove excess glue and sand any rough spots. You can also paint or stain your wand to whatever your desired color may be. You can use tools, such as an awl or screwdriver, to gently tap texture into the wood of the handle (like that on the Elder Wand in Harry Potter). You can also add polymer clay to the wand (before painting or staining) to make it look more like the wands from the films, if you have the skill to sculpt and texture it. Once your desired details are added, you’re done!

Trace your pattern onto plywood and use a saw to cut out the shape.,
Shape the airfoil.,
In the middle of the boomerang, blend the two airfoils together.,
Give it a final sanding with fine grit paper.",How to Make a Boomerang1," There are many types of boomerang designs to choose from and a good pattern can be found online. You also need some sort of saw that can cut curves, such as a band saw, coping saw or bow-saw.









Not all plywood is the same. Use Baltic or Finnish birch; something sturdy.
If making the standard ""V""-shape boomerang, the 107 degree angle size is not critical, just optimum. It can be more or less than 107 degrees. If you make the angle greater than 107 degrees, know that the rotation plate becomes small and it can be difficult to keep the boomerang spinning.;
, Use a sanding block (and a lot of elbow grease) or an orbital sander to give each side of the boomerang an airfoil shape. The direction the airfoil faces depends on the hand with which you throw.









First, mark the top of the boomerang. As with airplane wings, the airfoils on a boomerang have a leading and a trailing edge. The leading edge is a quarter-round shape and the trailing edge tapers off the top of the boomerang like the cross-section of a typical airplane wing. Mark the two leading edges and the two trailing edges so you do not file them incorrectly. The bottom face of the wing is completely flat.
Lay out the leading and trailing edges of the wings based on which hand will do the throwing. A marking gauge can be used for this (or the old trick of holding a finger against the edge). Mark in on the top the distance that the contour retreats back from the boomerang’s edge to its top surface.
The quarter-round shape generally extends about 1/4″ (6 mm) from the edge, while the trailing edge extends about 1″ (2.5 cm) to 1 1/2″ (3.8 cm) into the material. Note that you only have to shape one face of the plywood. The other face is left flat.The traditional Australian boomerang has positive dihedral (an angle formed by two plane faces). The best choice is to find a position in which the boomerang wings tips are up., The boomerang needs leading and trailing edges, just like an airplane. In addition, you want the whole surface to be smooth. Remove all the rough wood protrusions.









Shape the airfoil with rasps, files and sandpaper. There are a variety of rasps available out there. No. 49 and 50 cabinet rasps are good places to start. The optional finishing touch to shaping the airfoil is to slightly bevel the back edge of the wing (if you wish).

, Then, apply a thin coat of spray paint or clear lacquer to help protect the boomerang and make it look nice.









Don't decorate the boomerang until you're sure you're all finished. Take it out for a test drive before you break out the paints.

Grab a sheet of printer paper.,
Fold it in half, hot dog style (the long way).,
Fold it in half again, the same way.,
Fold, fold, fold.,
Unfold the entire paper except for the original left side.,
Close the top half of the right side.,
Fold down the left side.,
Take the bottom layer of the left side and lift it up.",How to Make a Boomerang2," A4 paper works, fine too. Either way, work with something similar to 8.5"" x 11"" (21.6 x 28 cm).









Normal, run-of-the-mill paper is best. Cardboard or stock paper is unnecessary.

, It's important to be as precise as possible. Make a firm crease along the top of the paper, fold it backwards along the same crease, and split it in half.








, The firmer the crease, the better. Open the paper, and you now have a line directly in the middle.









Use the line to fold twice more. Fold each side directly next to this line. Not on top of it, but right next to it. If you fold it on top, it may become too bulky. We're talking millimeters away here. Make two more firm creases.

, Take one end of the paper and fold it onto the other. Fold it so it becomes half the length it once was. Line it up edge to edge, line to line. At the end, make a crease.









Take both corners where the crease is and fold them into the center. This forms two little triangles next to each other. Unfold them and fold them backwards.
Open it up and tuck the folded corners in. Then, reclose the flaps. Do this with both sides. You should now have a screwdriver-like shape.

, Your paper should now be as long as possible, right side unfolded, left side folded in. You'll see a diamond underneath the right fold. Make the creases of that diamond firm and distinct.








, Squash the diamond, folding the corner of the diamond up against the top right of the paper. You should now have a loose ""L"" shape.









Fold the bottom left side into the pocket of the ""L"" shape.

, This should create a mountain shape where the two perpendicular lines meet. Take the right side and fold it down, forcing the mountain to the left.








, Place what was the top layer on the bottom, leaving the end (or pocket) open. Fold the end original bottom layer into the pocket, inverting the sides. You now have a very distinct L shape.









Open either end and fold down the edges into two triangles. Unfold the one on the right, but not the one on the left. Open the right side, tucking the corner in. Then, open the left side triangle, close the boomerang and place the edge sticking out in the pocket you just formed on the right. It's a good idea to flatten every edge once created. Repeat for the other side.
Make sure the model is really neat; every crease should be streamlined. If it's not, it won't fly well.

Tracing paper
Pencil
Cardboard
Scissors
White glue or stapler
Colored markers or crayons

, A good basic one can be found online.Cut out the pattern.









If you don't have a printer, you'll be working with two strips of cardboard, roughly 5"" (13 cm) long and 2.5"" (6.3 cm) wide.

, Do this twice and cut out your two blades. Make sure the blades are the same size. If they're not, shave one down to match the other.








, Measure the blades so that they intersect at the very middle. If your blades aren't evenly placed, your boomerang will be unbalanced and will not fly.








, Do not attach anything that will weigh your boomerang down. Use colors in any medium, stickers, or glitter.








, The folds should be about 1"" (2.5 cm) from the end of each blade.









To fly the boomerang, hold it vertically with the ends curved toward you. Snap your wrist as you let it go. Adjust the flaps as necessary.

This method can be replicated with popsicle sticks. As last as the sticks are slightly curved, 2 sticks glued in the center are all you need.

If you or someone who will help you is very good at cutting wood, you can do something fancy (like a hot dog or a car with windows.) If its your first time, you may want to do something simple.

, There are plenty of kits available, but the pine wood and nails can come from any hardware store. You will probably need to buy the wheels from a hobby store, because many races require a certain size of wheel. See below for the list of supplies.

, If you will do it yourself, get a coping saw and a clamp. Many scoutmasters or hardware stores will cut the wood for you if you ask.

,,, Sanding makes the paint stick better, and also makes the car go faster. You can use 120 grit sandpaper to start.

Wind it up and let it play.",How to Make a Music Box," Wooden boxes are usually a good choice. Make sure that the box is large enough to fit the entire musical mechanism, if not a little larger.


For most standard sized mechanisms, you'll need a box that is at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep, 3 inches (7.6 cm) long, and 2 inches (5 cm) wide.Larger boxes may work better since they can hold more than just the mechanism.
Wood is sturdy and relatively easy to work with, but you can experiment by choosing a box made from different materials. For instance, you could recycle an old tin or use a sturdy paper mache box.;
, Paint both the inside and outside of the box using a sponge brush and acrylic paint in any color. Allow the paint to dry completely before continuing.


This step is only necessary if the box isn't already finished and decorated. If you choose to recycle a box and like the way it already looks, you don't need to paint over it.
Apply as many coats as needed to achieve the desired look. You can technically use any type of paint that is approved for use with wood (or whichever material your box is made of). For wooden boxes, you can even use wood stain.

, Use a hot glue gun to attach square beads to each outside corner of the box base. Position each bead roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) in from the surrounding edges.


The beads should be large enough to support the weight of the box. For a standard sized music box, 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) wide cubes would work well.
Make sure that the beads are already painted in a manner that coordinates with the color scheme of the box.
You can use other elements for feet if you don't like the look of square beads. Rounded beads, decorative moldings, and brass feet are a few other options.

, You can leave the outside lid plain or opt to embellish it. Since the musical mechanism won't touch the lid of the box, such decorations should not interfere with how well it works.Use stencils to paint a pretty design onto the lid.
Personalize the music box by using spray adhesive and Mod Podge to attach a laser-printed photograph to the lid.
Consider gluing a flat-backed cameo or cabochon to the center of the lid for something simple and classy.

, Place the musical mechanism onto a sheet of paper and trace around its perimeter. Use scissors to cut around this outline.


Once you cut out the template, flip over the mechanism to reveal the bottom and rest the template on top. Lightly mark the screw holes and keyhole onto the paper template using a pencil.
If you cannot see the holes through the paper template, use a small ruler to measure where they lie on the mechanism in comparison to each side. Mark dots on the template using those same measurements.
Note that some mechanisms do not have screw holes. In this instance, the key will usually be enough to hold the mechanism in place; do not attempt to create holes for screws in the mechanism since doing so could prevent the movement from working.

, Place the paper template inside the box, positioning it where you want the mechanism to sit. Use clear tape to hold the template down in its final position.


Choose an area along the base of the box, rather than using the sides or lid.
Typically, the mechanism should lie to one side of the box or in one of the back corners. If you use a small box just barely big enough to fit the mechanism itself, though, it might be better to center the mechanism inside its base.
When determining the best placement, make sure that the screw holes and keyhole will be clear of the feet you previously attached.

, Carefully drill two screw holes and one keyhole through the paper template and through the bottom of the box. Follow the markings previously made on your template to ensure correct placement.


The screw holes should each be 1/8 inch (3.175 mm), and the keyhole should be 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).
Use a hand drill to create holes in a wooden box. If you opted for a paper mache box or recycled tin, create the holes using an awl, rubber block, and hammer.

, Remove the paper template and clear away any shavings or other debris before continuing.


Small particles of debris can easily work their way into the inner workings of the musical mechanism, and if that happens, the mechanism may stop playing.
Both the box and work area must be clean before you continue. If necessary, vacuum the area before working with the mechanism.

, Use a small screwdriver to remove the screws holding the plastic casing onto the mechanism, then snap away the casing itself.


You can technically keep the casing over the mechanism, if desired, but removing it will allow you to view the movement as it plays and may create a more aesthetically pleasing result., Position the musical mechanism inside the box, directly where the template previously rested.


Carefully turn the box over to reveal its bottom. Make sure that the screw holes in the box match the screw holes in the mechanism. Likewise, the keyhole in the box should match the key hold of the mechanism, too.

, Place an 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) screw through each screw hole, then secure both screws in place. They should go through the bottom of the box and into the screw holes of the mechanism.


After you fix these screws in place, the mechanism should lie flush and secure at the base of the box without being held in place.

, Wind the key clockwise through the keyhole at the bottom of the box and into the keyhole of the mechanism.


You may feel the key ""click"" into place inside the mechanism. If not, simply continue winding it until the mechanism produces sound.

, Trim a thin piece of wood, making it as long as the width of the box. Sand down any rough edges.


You'll use this piece of wood to separate the mechanism from the rest of the box, thereby allowing you to use the empty portion of the box to hold trinkets.
Note that you do not need to create a divider if the box is only large enough for the mechanism and nothing else.
The wood divider should be roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) thick. The width of the wood should match or exceed the height of the mechanism, but it must also be at least 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3.175 to 6.35 mm) shorter than the side of the box.

, Use hot glue or wood glue to adhere the divider to the back and front sides of the box.


Position the divider so that it lies just next to the mechanism without actually touching the movement.
Let the glue dry completely before continuing to the next step.

, Measure the compartment holding the mechanism, then score a thin piece of plexiglass to match those measurements. Snap or cut along these score marks to trim down the plexiglass.


Sand down any rough edges before installing the plexiglass cover.
The plexiglass will protect the movement from dust and debris while still allowing you to watch it as it plays. If you kept the plastic casing on the movement, however, you do not need to install a plexiglass cover.

, Use hot glue or super glue to adhere the plexiglass to the sides of the box and the divider.


Keep the plexiglass level while installing it, and make sure that it does not touch the movement or otherwise interfere with it.
Allow the glue to completely dry before handling the box further.

, Your music box should be finished at this point. To enjoy its music, simply wind the key and let it play.

Gather your supplies.,
Fit the stretcher bars together.,
Tap the sides lightly with the hammer.,
Cut the canvas to fit the wood frame.,
Attach the canvas to the frame.,
Prime the canvas.",How to Make a Canvas1," To make a canvas on a wood frame, you will need the following supplies. You can find these supplies at your local art store.A long piece of art canvas. You should get a canvas that is long enough to create your ideal canvas size.
Four stretcher bars. These are wooden bars that have notches on one end. You should get two stretcher bars that are the ideal width you want for the canvas and two stretcher bars that are the ideal height you want for the canvas, for example, 16 x 24 or 11 x 15.
A hammer.
A staple gun.
A pair of scissors.
Acrylic based gesso.
A paintbrush.
Sandpaper.
Palette paper.;
, Take one long stretcher bar and one short stretcher bar. Slide the notched ends of the stretcher bars together, pushing with your hands until the two ends side together. They should be flush with each other, forming a diagonal line where the two ends meet.








Repeat this with the two remaining stretcher bars until you have built a wooden frame composing of all four stretcher bars.

, To ensure the sides of the canvas are fitted properly and securely, you can use the hammer to tap the sides. Do this on the outside of the wooden frame and tap lightly so the ends are firmly joined together.







, Spread the canvas out on a flat surface, such as a table. Then, place the wooden frame on top of the canvas. Gently fold the canvas so it covers the length of the wooden frame and the ends fold over the wooden frame so the stretchers are covered by the canvas.








Use the scissors to make a cut and then use your hands to tear the canvas so the excess canvas comes off. Do this by holding down one half of the canvas and tearing the excess canvas off at an angle. Repeat this on the other side of the wooden frame until the canvas fits the wooden frame.

, Use the staple gun to attach the canvas to the frame. Fold over one short side of the canvas so it covers the stretcher bar and then staple the canvas to the stretcher bar. Place one staple on one end, one staple in the centre, and one on the other end for a total of three staples.








Rotate the frame and pull the canvas very tightly on the opposite end. Then, attach the canvas to the other short side of the canvas with three staples. Leave the centre staple for last.
Turn the frame to the longer side. Fold the canvas over the frame. You will notice a notch of canvas that sticks out when you fold the canvas over the frame. Use your index finger to gently push in this notch so it tucks into the fold. Then, pull the canvas up as tight as possible and push it down over the frame. Attach the canvas to the frame with a staple over the folded corner.
Repeat these steps for the other corner, making sure to push down the notch, pull the canvas tightly and fold it over. Secure the canvas with a staple.
Finish attaching the rest of the canvas to the frame by pulling tightly on the canvas and staple it down. You can put six staples on the longer ends of the canvas to ensure it is secure.

, To make the canvas smooth, tight, and ready for painting, you will need to prime it. Do this by applying acrylic based gesso to the canvas so it dries stiff and taunt.








Start by shaking up the acrylic based gesso. Then, pour the gesso onto a sheet of palette paper.
Use the paint brush to paint the entire area of the canvas. You should do one thick coat of the paint, making sure to get the sides of the canvas as well.
Let the gesso dry. Then, use the sandpaper to sand the canvas. Sand the canvas using small, circular motions. Do one layer of sanding on the canvas and don't worry too much about making it very smooth.
After one sanding session, pour gesso onto the palette paper and use the brush to add another layer of gesso to the entire canvas. You can use a hair dryer to dry the gesso faster.
Once the gesso is dry, sand the canvas one more time. Try to make the canvas really smooth. After a good sanding, the canvas is ready for use.

Allow the canvas to dry.",How to Make a Canvas2," You will first need to purchase either non-buckle board, masonite, hard board, or birch plywood. The first can be found at your local arts and crafts store and is traditionally labeled Gator Board. The latter three can be found at your nearest hardware store. You will need 1/2 inch thick panels. The dimensions of the board should be the size you wish your painting to be. If you can only buy pre-cut panels, make sure to get one larger than your final project. You will also need:


Linen or cotton canvas material. This usually comes in rolls and can be found at arts and crafts stores. A typical precut canvas size is a 21 inch (53.34 cm) height x 50 inch (127 cm) width roll of canvas, which will give you two 20 inch x 24 inch (50.8 cm x 60.96 cm) canvas panels.Miracle Muck Glue
Rotary blade and/or scissors
Ruler
Pencil
Rubber paint roller
Heavy rubber roller
Paper towels
Sand paper
Rotary saw (for masonite, hard board, and/or birch plywood)
Brown wrapping paper

, This is only if the sheet of board you bought was pre-cut, and therefore larger than your final project. First measure out, using a ruler and pencil, the dimensions of your board. You can draw lines directly onto the board. Try and make sure to use the back of the board, this way pencil lines won't appear on the front. When you are done you should have a rectangular shape outlined on the board.If your board is non-buckle board such as Gator Board, use a rotary blade to cut along the lines you drew.
If your board is masonite, hard board, or birch plywood, you will need to use a rotary saw to cut it down to size. Cut along the lines that you drew on the board.
Make sure that you are in a safe area, such as outside or in your construction garage. Always wear goggles when cutting, and make sure that your hands do not get near the blade.
No matter what board you are using, after it is cut, sand the edges down gently so that they are smooth.

, Outline a blueprint to cut along, approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) longer than the board on each side. You can do this with a simple ruler and pencil. If your canvas material has two sides (one for show, one for backing) make sure you are drawing pencil lines on the side meant for backing. Lift away your canvas.For example, if your board is 20 X 30 inches, the rectangle you draw onto the canvas should be 22 X 32 inches.
Cut the rectangle out with either a pair of scissors or a rotary blade. If you use a rotary blade, make sure that you are cutting on top of a safe surface such as a cutting board.

, Take some of your Miracle Muck Glue (or off brand) and pour it onto the middle of the canvas sheet (middle of the drawn rectangle). Take out your rubber paint roller and begin spreading it around the sheet. Try your best to keep the glue contained within the drawn rectangle.Then pour some glue onto the middle of one side of your board. Take the same roller and begin to spread it around. The corners and edges are especially important.
The glue spread over both surfaces should be a relatively thin layer. Do not pour too much otherwise it will ooze out the sides when you place them together.

, Take your board and flip it over. Press the glued side of the board against the glue side of the canvas (on table, facing up). Line up the board as best you can with the drawn rectangle on the canvas. Then, take your heavy roller out and begin to run the roller against the board. This will get the air bubbles out that are likely to be present between the canvas and board.While you are rolling the board, you may have to readjust the board as it might slide.
After you have rolled against the board, press down with your hands. Place one hand overtop of one another and apply pressure firmly and evenly throughout. This will further secure the board to the canvas.

, Place two heavy books side-by-side on top of your canvas so that they cover the entire space. Then begin to stack other books on top of them. You can even add other heavy objects such as paper weights to the top of your pile. This pressure needs to be created in order for the canvas to seal with the board.If you have not already done so, transfer this pile to a safe location. This should be somewhere where there is not a lot of movement going on. Do not place this near a children's play space. The best place is a basement, or a secluded room.
Your canvas will need an entire day to properly dry and set. The following day (after 24 hours) you can remove the books/weights.

, Do so by cutting a diagonal slice into the canvas in line with each corner of the board. Then fold each side of the slice so they are lying on top of each other in a perpendicular manner. One option to get them to remain pulled back is to apply some super glue to the underside of the canvas edges. Then press each edge, one at a time, against the edge of the board. Hold each edge for at least 1 minute.If you use the glue method, make sure that the glue is spread evenly over the entire strip so that it does not begin to peel away.
The second method is to use sewing pins. Curve your edges backwards and stick two to three pins on each side, through the canvas and into the board. This method only really works on Gator Board; however, you can try to tick the pins into a harder surface.

, Take your rotary blade and cut the canvas as close to the board as you can possibly get it. Make sure that you are cutting on a safe surface such as a cutting board. Depending on the thickness of the canvas you may have to pass over the same area multiple times in order to cut it., Outline and cut a sheet of brown wrapping paper about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) shy of the actual size of the mounted canvas on each side. For example, if your mounted canvas is 20 X30 inches, the brown wrapping paper should be 19 1/2 X 29 1/2 inches. Simply use a ruler to measure the edges, and draw out the dimensions onto the paper using a pencil. Then cut with either scissors or a rotary blade., Make sure that the canvas fabric is facing down. First, pour some Miracle Muck Glue onto the back of the board. Spread it out evenly using your paint roller. Then take your brown wrapping paper and press it against the glued board. Use your heavy roller and roll against the brown paper. Make sure that there are no air bubbles left over.Put two heavy books on top of the brown paper so that they cover the entire space. Put other heavy books and/or objects on top of those two books.

, The canvas should once more be kept in a safe space. Wait 24 hours before you remove the books and/or objects. Once the canvas is dry, it is ready for use.

Now take the twelve 1 ½” wide strips and place them beside each other making a board 9” wide by 15” long by 1 3/8” thick.,
Now that you have the boards laid out like you want it take your pencil and make two wavy lines through the width of the board.,
Next set up your bar clamps and get the glue ready (I suggest you use Titebond glue this glue has been approved for use in making cutting boards).,
Carefully assembled the twelve strips to minimize cutting problems later (squaring across the top of the board will make the assembly easier with less sanding) and applied clamping pressure, add just enough pressure to pull the joints together.,
Let the glue dry for at least one hour (follow the instructions for the glue you choose to use).,
Now that you have your board glued together and cleaned up, take it to the table saw and using your miter gauge (make sure your gauge is square with the blade) square up one end of the board and then cut it off at 14” long.

Finish with a board oil made from mineral oil bee’s wax and lemon oil.",How to Make a Black Walnut Edge Grain Cutting Board," Make sure you have a sharp blade that makes a smooth 90 degree cut, because you have to glue these strips together to make your cutting board.;
, It is also a good idea to turn the grain of each piece (end grain) 90-degrees to the one next to it, for both strength and to enhance the look.

, This way you have a reference on each joint during the gluing process so you don’t have to worry, do I have the strip turned the correct way. You can also number each board if you like.

, Apply glue to one side of each strip and smooth it out with your finger or a putty knife making sure the entire surface has been covered.

, Also make sure the pencil lines are in alignment that you placed on them in step #3. It’s also a good idea to wipe away the excess glue that squeezed out during clamping; this makes the following step much easier.

, After removing bar clamps, sand the top and bottom of your board smooth with a belt sander. Start with 80-grit sandpaper, then 120-grit and a final sanding with 150-grit using a random orbit sander. If you have access to a surface planer it would be better and faster to use it instead of the belt sander.

,,,, This type of oil is thicker than standard mineral oil helping to preserve and protect the wood from moisture. Also, it does not form a hard film on the surface that would be damaged by normal use of a cutting board. You may ask how much oil. When you oil your board let the oil soak in for 10 to 15 minutes. If the board soaks up the oil right away add more to surface and let stand, after 15 minutes remove any excess oil from the surface with a clean paper towel. This process will protect your board against moisture and extend the life of all your cutting boards.

Decorate the cork/styrofoam with either a piece of contact or shelf paper or paint the cork area.,
Add a picture hanging kit to the back of the drawer in order to mount it on your wall.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Bulletin Board from a Drawer," Select a drawer that you will no longer need--perhaps one from a dresser you plan to throw away (not give away to charity) or one that hold special meaning but is no longer functional.


Make sure the drawer is fully in tact and has no damage. Patch up any hanging nails or loose ends before using as a bulletin board.






Wipe the drawer using mild dish soap and warm water. If you are using a wooden drawer, consider using furniture or wood cleaner.






Depending on the drawer, you may want to paint or refurbish the drawer before using it as a bulletin board. For example you may want to update the knob at the top, remove the knob or painting the top and outside to match your room or office space.





;
, This includes corkboard/styrofoam board, contact or drawer lining paper.


Select durable paper for the liner. You will puncturing the paper with thumbtacks so you will want something that will withstand repeated punctures.
Consider painting your corkboard instead of covering it with paper. That way you won’t have to worry about puncturing paper and damaging it with thumb tacks.






Pick up heavy-duty glue such as liquid nails or Super Glue so that your corkboard is permanently stuck to the inside of the drawer.

, Before doing so, take measurements so you have a precise fit.

Use your ruler or measuring tape to map out the surface on the corkboard. Use a pen to draw lines where you should cut.






Use sharp sewing scissors to cut the corkboard shape. Don’t worry about pen marks, as you will be either covering the cork with paper or painting it. However, if you plan to use it in its “naked” state you can turn the cork over so the pen marks will be glued face down inside the drawer.







, Make sure you hit all the corners and the middle of the cork/styrofoam for full coverage.


Lay the drawer on a flat surface to join the cork to the inside of the drawer. Press down to make sure the cork adheres to the drawer and allow the drawer to sit on the flat surface for several hours while the glue dries.

, If you plan to paint, get our your acrylics and get creative! Be sure you give the cork enough time to dry before using. Also, because cork is porous, you may need to choose more vibrant colors and/or use a little more paint to make the colors pop.


Take cork measurements if you plan to use paper. You will want the paper to fully cover the cork so you will need to be precise with your measurements.






Cut paper using sharp sewing scissors for a clean edge and cover the back of the paper with glue. Don’t use too much glue to avoid having it bleed through. Carefully place the paper on top of the cork and press down. If you are using self-adhesive contact paper, peel off the backing and stick to the cork.

, You may need to use two wall hangers, especially if the drawer is heavy.


Use a level and a tape measure to find the top center of the drawer for hanging. Especially if you are using two wall hangers, you will need to be very careful about how you place and space your hangers on the back of the drawer.

Know what type of wood you have before you begin.,
Consider a wood conditioner for soft woods.,
Keep in mind that hard woods will take more coats.",How to Stain Wood1," This will determine how you proceed and the effect you can expect at the end.









Basic wood types are:

Softwoods- Pine, Fir and Cedar. (etc.)
Hardwoods- Oak, Beech, Ash, Elm, Birch and Walnut.(etc.)


This is sometimes confusing because you have:

Box wood and Aspen: A very soft Hardwood.
Fir: A very hard Softwood.

;
, If the wood has uneven wood grain, or blotchy patterns to it, chances are it is a softwood. When you stain it, it will stain unevenly. You may want this, to let the stain enhance the natural beauty of the wood. If you do not want this, place a pre-stain wood conditioner on your wood. It seeps into the wood fibers so that the wood will stain evenly. Check with the manufacturer.








, If the wood has a consistent flow or pattern to the grain, it's probably a hardwood. Use whatever stain you wish to enhance the wood grain.









Hardwoods, such as oak, may take a few more coatings of stain than softwood, but the results are still very pleasing.

"
Choose your stain for the project.,
Check the veneer carefully to see that it is smooth.,
Sand carefully if necessary, starting with a 180 grit sandpaper and being sure to follow the direction of the wood grain.,
Clean veneer thoroughly.

,
Stir stain vigorously before use and every 30 minutes while working.,
Brush on a wood conditioning product if your veneer is a soft or porous wood such as pine.,
Apply stain to veneer with a rag, soft bristle paint brush or a foam brush, following the wood grain.,
Allow to dry for 8 to 10 hours.,
Allow to set up for 24 hours before applying a sealer if desired.

",How to Stain Veneer1," You have a choice of oil based, water based and gel stains. Each one has slightly different qualities that make it ideal for one wood but not another.


An example of this is that some trees, such as teak and rosewood, have more natural oil in them than other woods such as oak or hickory. The oily wood will not take a water based stain as well as one of the less oily woods, so this has to be considered when choosing stains.
The basic steps for staining veneer are the same but setting and waiting times are different for each of the stains, gel, oil and water.

, Most mill sawn veneer and backed veneer will not need sanding. Mill sawn veneer is very thin, 1/42 inch (0.60 mm) and will not stand up to heavy sanding.

, Stop and check frequently to avoid damaging the veneer.

,, Test for correct color on a piece of scrap veneer or in an inconspicuous spot.

, Allow the conditioner to stand for 5 to 15 minutes, and wipe off with a clean rag. Do not wait more than 2 hours before applying gel stain.

, Allow it to set for 3 minutes and wipe off stain with a clean rag, again following the grain of the wood.

, If the color is not deep enough, apply additional coats in the same manner as the first until you have the desired look.

,"
"
Check to make sure the wood is free of dirt, grease etc.








,
Decide what type of sandpaper you should use.,
For flat surfaced pieces, use a lower grit sandpaper (60 or 80) to remove any blemishes and scuffs.,
Go with a high grit number (200 or more) and add multiple coats of stain.,
When sanding is complete, wipe down wood with damp cloth, making sure wood is free from any debris.








",How to Stain Wood2,", The lower the grit number, the rougher the wood will be, the more stain will absorb into the wood and the darker your project piece will be. (And that's on the first application). The opposite is true as well. The higher the grit number, the smoother the wood will be, the less will absorb into the wood and the results are a lighter stained project piece.








, Next use a higher grit number (100 or 120). Keep in mind what depth of stain you are looking for in your finished piece. If you want a finished (med.) depth of stain, stop with the 100 or 120 grit. If you want it lighter, go with a higher grit number.








, Experiment on a scrap piece of wood to see what is right for you.








,"
"
Know the types of stains, and what they do:

Oil-based stains provide long lasting wood tone color.,
Put your rubber gloves on.,
Using a sponge, brush, rag or clean cloth, apply stain to wood generously.








,
Make sure you work in one continuous movement across your wood, going with the grain.,
Wait 5 to 15 minutes for stain to absorb.,
When you are satisfied with the stain color, place the piece(s) on something flat (workbench, garage floor) and let dry for 6 to 8 hours.








",How to Stain Wood3," They penetrate deep into the pores to seal and protect the wood, bringing out its natural beauty
Water based stains provide an even stain color. They will not absorb unevenly like an oil based stain.
Gels add natural colors to a wide range of wood and non-wood products but it can be difficult to get out of grooves in wood.
Pastels are an oil-based wood stain which provide a soft pastel color while highlighting the grain of the wood.
Pigment stains will fill the grains and leave the wood surface with less colorant.
Dyes will stain the grain and the areas between the grain approximately the same color.

, Make sure stain is stirred well.








,, Make sure the entire piece is brushed well and evenly.








, The longer you wait, the darker it will be. If you are not sure how fast your wood will take the stain, use a clean cloth and wipe on, and then wipe off again immediately. This will give you a good idea. It's easier to add more stain than to have to take it off.








,"
"
Use polyurethane for protection and beauty.,
Make sure that your wood is free of any debris.,
After a couple hours, reapply if you wish.








,
If you are using the liquid type, wearing gloves, brush it on with the grain.,
Please refer to the manufacturers instructions and times.",How to Stain Wood4," It comes in satin, semi-gloss and high or clear gloss.








, If you are using a spray can, stay 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) from piece being sprayed. With long even passes, apply the polyurethane. Don't over-spray or you will get runs. Make about two passes and go on to the next piece.








,, If you put too much on, you must continue to brush it out. You will have to babysit the wood, making sure that it doesn't hold bubbles or run. Once it looks like it is setting up, leave it alone for another 4 hours. Then reapply if you wish.








, Every brand is a little different, so you'll ned to know your own.

Apply oil stain with a cloth or soft bristle brush, following the grain of the wood.,
Apply second coat of stain, if needed, once the 1st coat has set up, usually 4 to 6 hours.

,
Allow to dry for 8 hours before applying a sealer if desired.

",How to Stain Veneer2," Wait 5 to 15 minutes to allow stain to penetrate the veneer, and then wipe off excess stain with a clean cloth, again following the grain of the wood.;

Remove any existing stain or paint using a chemical stripper, coarse sandpaper, or both.,
Use a medium-grit sandpaper, around 120 grit, on the entire piece of wood.,
Finish sanding with a fine-grit paper, 200 grit or above.,
Wipe the wood down with mineral spirits after sanding.,
Apply a wood conditioner, helping absorb pigments more thoroughly.,
Be ready to stain within two hours of applying conditioner.,
Test a small area of wood with the stain.,
Mix up your stain with a paint brush, foam brush, or rag.,
Apply a thin, even coating of stain on the entire piece of wood.,
Make a final pass along the grain of the wood with your brush.,
Wipe the stain off with a clean rag after 5-15 minutes.,
Allow the coat to dry.,
Sand the surface with 240 to 280-grit if you're adding a finish.,
Apply your preferred sealer or finish.,
Let the wood cure at 70F (20C) for 2-4 days.",How to Stain Alder Wood," Stains generally come in two varieties -- oil and water based. Oil based is easier to apply but harder to clean up, and requires a well-ventilated work area. Water-based stains are cleaner, non-toxic, and tend to have lighter colors. If you have lots of space and fresh air, oil-based stains are generally preferable.


Gel stains are hybrids that are easy to apply and clean. However, they can be significantly more expensive.;
, If you want to stain the wood a darker color than it is now or the wood is unfinished (its original color), you can skip to the next step. If not, you need to remove any coatings or old coloring using a chemical stripper. To do so, use a coarse-grit sandpaper (60-100 grit) to sand off as much as possible. For deep stains that sanding doesn't cover you can use a chemical stripper:


Work in a well-ventilated area, with eye and hand protection.
Apply a thick coat of stripper over everything, letting sit according to the directions.
Use a putty knife and steel wool to remove the stripper after the required time.
Wipe any excess stripper off with a damp cloth and let it all dry., Use a hand sander to smooth the wood. Make sure you sand in the direction of the wood grain, along the natural lines in the alder wood.


Wipe the wood down with a cloth after every sanding, removing the dust from the surface. Tack clothes will work the best at picking everything up.

, Hit the wood again with a nice, fine-grit paper, which will smooth it out attractively. For the best results you should work your way up, using 180-200 sandpaper, then 200-220, and then a final pass with an ultra-fine grit. Wipe off the dust with your tack paper whenever you switch to a new grit., This helps clean the wood and brings out its natural coloring. A rag is fine, and can be used to rub a light coating of mineral spirits on everything. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, then wipe off with a clean cloth., Alder wood is not an easy wood to stain, as it absorbs the stain unevenly.If you want a weathered, rustic look then this is a good thing -- skip the wood conditioner and move on. However, for a nice even coat, you must apply a wood conditioner.


Stir the wood conditioner thoroughly.
Use a clean rag to apply a thin, even layer of conditioner on the wood.
Let the conditioner soak in and dry for 15 minutes.
Remove any excess conditioner with a clean rag., The conditioner will get the wood ready for stain, but it will start to evaporate out if you wait too long. Conditioner should be applied, dried, and wipe clear within two hours of staining., Choose an inconspicuous area and apply a thin square of stain on it. Wait a few minutes for the stain to soak in, then wipe it all off with a clean cloth, making sure you timed how long you waited to remove it. If you want a darker stain, you'll need to let the stain sit longer. If you want lighter coloring you'll have to wipe it off faster., Make sure you completely stir up the stain, allowing you to get a nice even coloring on the wood.

, Using a rag may allow a more uniform coating, but brushes work well too. Work slowly, adding a thin, even coat instead of big globs of stain. You shouldn't need more than a little bit of stain on your brush at any one time.

, Wipe away any places where the stain pools, avoiding bubbling, puddles, or blotches. Your final brush of stain should be following the wood grain for the best results.

, You don't want the stain to dry on the wood. If it does, it can make it much harder to add more stain or a finish later on. Instead, wait several minutes and then wipe the stain all off with a clean rag.


The longer you leave the stain on, the darker the coloring will be.

, This usually takes 6-8 hours, but check the can for specific instructions for your stain. After the stain has completely dried you can always add another coat of stain to get an even darker finish.

, Stain is decorative, but finish is what you need to protect the wood from scratches, moisture, and scuffs. Use a fine-grit paper to lightly sand the surface, just like you did before sanding. Wipe the surface down with a clean cloth once you finish.

, Once you finish, sand again with the very fine grit sandpaper and apply a second coating. Your options for finish, in order from most durable to least durable, are:


Polyurethane
Water-based polyurethane
Wood lacquer
Finishing oils., The wood will take 48 hours to several weeks to cure completely. This allows the color and finish to set attractively.

Note the measurements of this object's two pieces of wood, consisting of:




 

an upright piece; and






a base block.,
Mark out the pieces accurately according to the above measurements.,
In sawing out the pieces, cut a trifle outside of the outline, then finish up to the line with a plane.,Center the upright piece on the base block, and fasten with brads driven through the base block.,Stain the wood and wax it before the pad and the hooks are attached.,
Make the calendar pad about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and 3 1/2 inches (5.1 cm) long.,
Add a strip of light-weight felt, broadcloth, or other heavy cloth, glued to the bottom of the base.",How to Make a Calendar Board and Pen Rack," (Click on images to enlarge.);
, Where you have a piece like the upright of the calendar-board to mark out, with opposite sides alike, it is best to draw a center-line first, then lay off the measurements each side of this line, and connect the points with straight lines. Alternately, lay off the measurements on one side of the center-line, draw the lines connecting the points, make a careful tracing of the outline, reverse the tracing, and trace it off upon the opposite side of the center-line., The round corners of the upright piece of the calendar-board can either be cut with a chisel or be filed round. The bevel on the top edge of the base block can be made with a plane or chisel.,,, This used to be a standard size that can be purchased at stationery stores when this article was written initially. If you don't find such a calendar easily, you can print a calendar pad of your own using the computer to create one. The brass screw-hooks which screw into the front edge of the base block, to form the pen-rack, should be 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) long., This will prevent the base from scratching surfaces it sits on, and will give the gift a finished, professional feel."

Opt for cans for simplicity’s sake.,
Choose spray guns for large or numerous projects.,
Purchase thinner for spray guns.,
Decide between working indoors or outdoors.,
Create a safe, clean work area.,
Wait for optimal temperature and humidity.,
Choose the right wood.,
Sand your wood.,
Prevent build-up in pre-cut areas.,
Read and follow the can or gun’s directions.,
Keep a consistent distance between nozzle and wood.,
Start spraying before you reach the wood.,
Overlap half of each row.,
Keep each coat light and consistent.,
Sand after each coat.,
Repeat.",How to Spray Lacquer," Lacquer can be applied either with disposable, pre-filled aerosol cans or spray guns, which require you to mix your lacquer, load the gun yourself, and adjust settings and attachments. To reduce prep- and guesswork, go with aerosol cans. However, be sure to factor in the surface area(s) of the wood to be sprayed when choosing between the two methods, since aerosol cans are not ideal for very large surface areas.When applying each coat, you want to cover all of a given surface area before the lacquer starts to dry anywhere. However, lacquer dries very quickly, which makes doing large surface areas with aerosol cans problematic.
For instance, coffee tables and chests are probably too large for aerosol cans. Boxes and cabinets, however, are more ideal.;
, If spraying lacquer is something you’re going to be doing repeatedly, invest in a spray gun. Also use these for projects with surface areas four feet (1.2 m) long and over. There are numerous brands and models on the market to choose from, but spray guns are mainly divided into these categories:Air assisted airless sprayers (AAA): ideal for very large projects, with less labor needed for each piece of wood.
Gravity feed guns: easy to clean and operate, making them perfect for DIY beginners.
High-volume, low-pressure guns (HVLP): also suitable for DIY projects, although they require some precise setup beforehand for best results.
Pressured guns: adjustable pressure allows for more varied results if you like to tinker with your finishes.
Suction feed guns: lacquer can be used in these by practiced hands, but are not advised for beginners.

, Aerosol cans are ready to use straight off the shelf, but spray guns require you to mix your lacquer with thinner before filling the gun. How much to add depends on your project, climate, and current weather conditions, so purchase both your lacquer and thinner from a local brick-and-mortar store. Ask the staff what ratio is recommended based on the type of lacquer to be used, your current weather, and the nature of your project.For instance, colored lacquers may require equal parts thinner and lacquer, while clear lacquers use substantially less thinner.
In areas with constant high humidity, staff may also advise that you add a retarder.

, Working indoors allows you more control over the elements (which can affect the quality of your finish), but always prioritize safety over results. Lacquer is toxic to inhale, so base your decision on the amount of ventilation that your workspace receives. Only work inside if your workspace is constantly replenished with fresh air. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and work outside.For instance, a two-car garage with both doors open and industrial fans set up to circulate air should be fine. A basement with shoebox windows, on the other hand, should not be used.
Whether you work inside or outside, always wear a full-face respirator with carbon filter cartridges.

, Lacquer and other materials used are highly flammable, so do not use near open flames or heat sources.Inform family or other housemates to keep themselves and any pets away from the area while you are spraying, since the mist created by spraying lacquer is dangerous to breathe. Additionally, do the following, depending on whether you are working indoors or out:


Indoors: Clean the work area of dust and bugs, both of which can become trapped in lacquer as it dries.Cover your worktable, floor, and any other nearby surfaces with drop cloths or other protective covering. Open all windows and set up exhaust fans.
Outdoors: Pick a shaded area to avoid direct sunlight, which can ruin your finish. Always choose a calm, windless day to work, but also pick an area shielded from wind just in case. Cover your work surface and the surrounding ground with drop cloths to reduce fire hazards caused by over-spray.

, Both temperature and humidity can adversely affect the quality of your finish, so only spray when conditions are right. Remember the number 65. Avoid spraying when the temperature dips below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) or when the humidity rises above 65%.Wet lacquer can absorb the moisture in the air, which will cloud the lacquer as it dries, a defect known as “blushing.”

, Lacquer doesn’t work well with all woods, so make sure you’re not about to use it on an unsuitable type. For the best finishes stick with cherry, maple, mahogany, and walnut. Refrain from using it on:Woods with coarse, open grains, like ash and cherry.
Soft woods, like cedar and redwood.
Oily woods, like cocobolo.

, Sand each piece of wood to be sprayed to get rid of any imperfections. Begin with P120-grit paper and then go over each piece again with P150-grit. Then use a damp cloth to moisten the surface, which helps highlight any remaining irregularities. Finish with P180-grit to smooth the surface down.Sanding is necessary because lacquer will highlight defects once applied. However, the dust created is a problem, since it could end up settling in the lacquer when wet.Sand everything to be sprayed first to get it out of the way so you can clean your workspace thoroughly afterward. Then allow time for any airborne dust to settle.
Breaking your project up into two days (one for sanding, one for spraying) will help keep the air clear of sawdust.

, With furniture, cover any areas that have been pre-cut for joinery and later assembly (such as the slots for shelf pegs in a bookcase). Avoid filling these keys and slots with spray, which can build up and block the pieces that will eventually fit into them. Do the same with any rabbets, where the face or edge of the wood has been trimmed so that another piece can line up with it there.If your furniture is already assembled, it’s always best to break it back down into individual pieces, rather than spray it as is.

, Whether you’re using aerosol cans or spray guns, always read the instructions before operating. These may vary between types and manufacturers, especially with spray guns. Ensure safe and efficient use by following its recommended use., Again, with spray guns, the distance that you should maintain between the gun’s tip and the wood may vary. However, expect it to be between 8 and 12 inches (20 and 30 cm). Maintain this distance from start to finish to ensure that the lacquer disperses consistently over the entire surface area., Instead of starting at the very edge of your wood, start spraying a little bit past it, directly over your dropcloth. Then move over the edge and down the length of the wood. Similarly, go right over the opposite edge before stopping your spray. Spraying well past either end will ensure a consistent spray over the whole length of the wood, including the very edges., If your wood is too wide to cover in a single spray from end to end, spray cross its narrowest edge first. Then, as you apply a second row below that first spray, aim so that half of it covers the first row of spray. Prevent unsightly build-ups along the edges of each row by applying an even amount of spray throughout., Thicker coats may cause build-up and runs, so plan on applying three to four light coats instead of one big thick one. Maintain a consistent speed as you spray without slowing down (which can cause build-ups) or speeding up (which will result in an uneven coat. Don’t worry if the first coat appears blotchy despite your consistent speed, since the following coats will correct this., Again, always refer to directions since drying times between products may vary, with some advising a 20-minute wait for each coat to dry, while others advise two hours.Then sand the wood down with P320-grit paper to smooth the finish. Wipe the wood down with a tack cloth to remove the dust and wait for any particles in the air to settle before continuing with the next coat.You can also use 0000 steel wool instead of sandpaper.

, First, if you’re using a spray gun, follow the gun’s directions regarding cleaning, since some may require you to clean it in between each coat if you are using a water-based lacquer.Also, a different ratio of thinner to lacquer than you used for your first coat may be recommended for additional coats. Apply three more coats, sanding after each one. After your last coat, buff it with P400-grit sandpaper dampened with mineral spirits, then finish with 0000 steel wool."

Choose the box size.,
Consider painting or staining the pine craft wood.,
Cut the rulers and box base pieces to size.,
Place the base piece on a flat surface.

,
Glue the two side ruler pieces on.,
Slip the two end pieces in and glue them in place.,
Glue the dividers at your chosen spaces, if adding.,
Varnish the completed box.,
Done.",How to Make a Box Out of Rulers," The size of the box is up to you; it's limited only by the side ruler's length. You'll need precise measurements for the side and end pieces (length only––the depth is already determined by the ruler), and for the wooden base. The rulers will sit on the wooden base, so the base measurement needs to account for this. Finally, you may wish to make dividers inside the box; use either the ruler or the craft wood for these (ruler pieces will probably look more interesting); if so, measure these pieces too.


If you want the whole rulers to form the sides (without cutting them at all), you'll need a third ruler that is okay for sawing into shorter end pieces. Or, you can use the pine craft wood.






Larger boxes can be made using yard or meter rulers.






Tiny boxes can be made by sawing up standard size school rulers even smaller.





;
, If the craft wood is a different shade from the rulers, paint or stain it to match.


Alternatively, you can choose to stain the whole completed box, using a stain that won't cover up the ruler markings.

, Following the measurements you've determined, use a handheld saw to cut the rulers to size. If you're not cutting the length rulers, you'll still need to cut the end ruler into the right sizes.


Cut the base piece from the craft pinewood.
Cut any divider pieces too.

,, Hold in place until they set––if you don't want to physically hold them, use large balls or blobs of poster tack on each side to hold in place while they dry, then remove the tack. Wipe away any excess glue.

, Again, hold in place until they set. Wipe away any excess glue.

, Wipe away any excess glue.

, This will allow it to shine and improves its overall quality. Allow to dry before using.


Before varnishing, check for any wood glue blobs. Sand these off before proceeding.

, You can now use the ruler box to keep bits and pieces. It's ideal for things like buttons, paperclips, safety pins, beads, craft items, etc. They also look neat sitting on a desk.

Make sure you leave the rental store with an air compressor, a blasting gun, blasting media and a blasting bucket. You may also want to pick up sheets of sandpaper and wood filler. Ask the clerk what materials will be best for your project.;
, If you cannot open windows in the room where your cabinets are placed, then you may want to remove them from the wall and place them in an open area or well-ventilated garage.

, Make sure there are no more dishes or objects inside the cabinets, because they can be ruined or soiled in the sandblasting process.

, If you sandblast the doors and drawers while they are laying on a surface, you will achieve a better finish. However, you may be worried that sand will be hard to clean in the cabinet's interior, in which case you can leave the doors on and sand and clean the corners by hand.

, Sandblasting will spread wood and sand particles throughout the area. You can also use tape to connect the drop cloths to walls and other surfaces.

, This should include long pants, boots, a long-sleeved shirt, safety goggles and a face shield. Using a face shield with a hood will protect you from breathing in wood particles that can cause respiratory problems.

, This will be the particulate that you blow over the cabinets' surface to sand it.

Dry for eight weeks.",How to Stabilize Wood3," A “cookie” or cross-section of wood can be successfully treated with precautions taken to keep it drying at a steady rate.

, You want to dry it slowly to avoid cracking and warping. This is the reason you are using the stabilizer.

, Take the wood piece and your Pentacryl to a well-ventilated workspace. Cover the workspace in drop cloths.


Keep in mind that the amount of Pentacryl you will need will depend entirely on the size of the wood. This method can be used for small cookies or very large wood cross-sections.
Pentacryl can be very expensive in large quantities.

, Make sure it fits in the container without touching the sides. A Tupperware is perfect for a small piece, while a kiddie pool covered in a drop cloth works great for large cookies.

,, Let it pool about three inches on the bottom. Brush the Pentacryl over the top at once, especially if it is a large, thick piece; however, this is not extremely important for small, thin pieces.

, Plastic drop cloths are perfect for this use.

, You will see the top of the wood start to darken from the inside out as it absorbs the wood stabilizer. Keep it saturated for two to three days, or up to a week with very large cookies.

, If it doesn’t seem thoroughly coated, you may want to repeat the soaking process. If it is, place it in a basement or area without direct sunlight or air movement.


Stand it on end so that the moisture dries from both sides of the exposed wood.

, If the wood is drying too quickly, cut cardboard sections and tape them over the exposed sides to slow down the drying process.

Get a fair supply of Sandpaper with two choices of grains: Rough to do the initial work (getting rid of the undesired paint) and Kind-of-Smooth Sandpaper (to finish the sanding and then polish the wood that will appear underneath).,
You will do a far nicer job if you use an electric sander.,
When you are done sanding and polishing, get rid of any wood dust on a wood by dusting the wood with a rug lightly imbibed in paint solvent and just then you can start painting.",How to Remove Paint from Wooden Objects and Refinish Them2," Sand firstly with the rough one then the soft one. Don't sand too hard and friction causes heat!

, Sanding all through is a very hard and frustrating job as the Sandpaper gets clogged up with the paint in no time.The most sensible thing to do is soft sanding once you're done with the old paint. Make sure you're sanding following the wood grain, if you don't, you'll scratch the wood surface and ruin the whole project.

, Make sure the surface is really smooth. If it is a small object, just simply dust it with a brush or blow it away. If there is wood dust on the floor, sweep it away.

"
"
Now you may use a very dangerous but easier method.,
Warm small areas of the wood up (but not too much so the wood doesn't turn to crisp or there isn't a burn mark).,
While the old paint is tender because of the heat - scrape the paint up as it wrinkles.,
Now you may pack everything up and turn off the Heat Gun so that nothing gets in your way.,
Now you can make it smooth - scrape the object with Sandpaper and your choice of grain.",How to Remove Paint from Wooden Objects and Refinish Them3," You will need a heat gun. Make sure you are wearing gloves to do this, goggles and a face mask and make sure water is close so the wood you're working on doesn't catch fire. Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on.

, Slowly move the heat gun over the surface. Pass the heat gun over the surface of the section of wood you are currently working on. Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing.

, Once the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle, immediately scrape the paint up with a broad paint scraper. Work on and on likewise on the next small areas until you do the whole object.

, Now this is the hard part: The above mentioned final sanding and polishing.


Stay calm if a fire starts. They are usually small flames. If a fire does start, turn off the plugs first then move out the heat gun and sprinkle the water onto the fire.


, You use sandpaper because it makes the object smooth and it get rids of the paint you couldn't scrape off with the heat and the spatula.

"
"
Now if it gets too bumpy, you may use a chemical stripper.,
Shake the can with the liquid and then you may pour all the content onto an open type of container.

,
Coat your paintbrush with enough liquid to cover a medium-sized area in a number of strokes.,
Cover the object with the liquid using your coated paint brush.,
Leave it for a while (about 30 minutes to one hour/varies on how much you put) and you may realize that the paint is 'softening'.

,
Test if the paint worked.,
When you think it is soft enough to be scraped off, you can use a painters spatula to scrape all the 'softened' paint off.,
Then, sand the object with sandpaper either with an electric sander (ample flat surfaces) or sand by hand (carved or difficult areas).

,
Wash the wood surface with a cloth soaked sensibly in paint solvent to remove any rest of chemical stripper.",How to Remove Paint from Wooden Objects and Refinish Them4," Choose the right type of stripper as some vary from the purpose you are using it for. Read the instructions thoroughly before use. While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary. Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper.


Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers.

,, You can also use a spray but spray 4 inches (10 cm) away from the wood.

, Brush the paint stripper on in one direction. Do not brush over areas that have already been covered by paint stripper.

,, Rub the blade of a paint scraper over the surface in a circular motion. If the scraper cuts into the paint, the chemical has worked correctly.

, For a door - work likewise in the adjacent areas until you do the whole door.

,, Sand and polish and proceed to paint as explained before.

"
"
If the situation is where the paint is thick or in large amounts such as a blob, you could use a scraper.

,
Sharpen your scraper by scraping the scraper across a metal surface in a direction where the tip of the scraper can become more sharp.,
Please realize that you have to be careful during these steps because the scraper could scrape the wood with the paint.",How to Remove Paint from Wooden Objects and Refinish Them5,", Do the scraping both ways. It should be now easier to scrape the paint off.


If it's still to hard, apply some vinegar, spirit or water. After each time of scraping you may notice that the scraper is blunt again so sharpen it again.

, This method is only good if the wood is polished or if it a wooden floor.


Due to accidental scenarios of scraping the paint with the wood you should scrape the paint off in a straight position and do it calmly.

"
"
Prepare all your chemicals used to remove the paint and make sure nothing is obstructing the event.,
Apply some of the chemical on the paint using a cotton.,
When scraped up, wipe it with a clean cloth.",How to Remove Paint from Wooden Objects and Refinish Them6," It's best to use to method if the paint is on a polished wood piece.


You could try using detergent, linseed oil (and boiled), acetone, lacquer thinner or paint thinners. Keep in mind that lacquer thinners and paint thinners are very strong. Also, detergent shouldn't have contact with your skin as it can make your hand feel dry, slippery or wrinkly. After use, wash your hand.


, Now you can start scraping the paint with a scraper or wipe it with a cloth.



BEWARE: If poisoning occurs please tell someone else to call your country's Poison information center or the ambulance if the pain is unbearable but it is not likely that it would occur if you do wear the objects above. Just be very careful about everything you do.

Sand the wood to make it smooth.,
Wipe off sawdust to avoid getting wood particles stuck in your sealant.,
Stain the wood, if desired, before you apply your sealant.",How to Seal Wood1," Before applying any polyurethane, prepare the wood by sanding it.


Progress from rougher grit to finer grit sandpapers, which allows you to reduce major irregularities before achieving a fine finish.
Use increasingly finer grits until you like how smooth the wood is.
Sand with the grain (following the lines of the wood grain straight back and forth) to avoid leaving behind swirly marks.
Wear a dust mask while you are sanding to avoid inhaling wood particles.;
, Use a dry rag or a tac cloth (special sticky cloth) to remove the dust from your wood.


Avoid using water on unsealed wood, because it can alter the wood's grain.
Use a dry rag before the tac cloth, because the tac cloth is stickier and will remove the fine particles that resist removal.

, You may want to stain the wood before sealing, because it is impossible to apply a stain to sealed wood.


Stain is usually applied with rags.
Wipe your stain on with a wet rag and let it set.
Then, wipe it off with a dry rag.

Wipe fresh acrylic paint with a wet cloth.,
Moisten a fresh cloth with hot water and put some soap on it.,
Scrub the remaining paint gently with the soapy cloth.,
Wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove the soap residue.,
Use a dry cloth or towel to dry the area.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Wood1," Dampen a washcloth or rag slightly and try to wipe away as much of the paint as you can. Switch out the cloth as needed if it becomes too saturated.


This may be ineffective on paint stains that have been dry for awhile. Soap and water are most effective on fresh paint stains.;
, Use a basic glycerin soap, like dish soap, that will produce a good lather and get into the grain of the wood. You can use liquid or bar soap for this.

, Keep scrubbing and adding more soap until all the paint is gone. Rub the cloth in straight lines with the grain of the wood to try and get all the paint out of the grooves.

, Continue to wipe at the spot until the soap suds are gone. You may need to rinse the cloth once if the spot was really soapy.

, Wipe away as much excess water as possible. The wood will remain damp, and may take up to 48 hours to fully dry depending on the size of the spot."

Try to find out how old the wood piece or furniture is.,
Test for a shellac finish.",How to Remove Shellac1," Shellac was a common wood finish before the 1920s; this may be enough to indicate to you that you have a shellac finish. Shellac is also the principal way to make French polish and has been used for this purpose on quality furniture over the past century.;
, Old or new, here is the way to check the finish on the furniture or woodwork:


Dab a little denatured alcohol on one section of the wood finish. Try to find an inconspicuous spot.
If it is shellac finish, it will liquefy and dissolve.A result of softening without dissolving suggests there is shellac present but that it has been mixed with lacquer as well.
Any other response and you're probably looking at a different wood finish. If in doubt, talk to someone familiar with furniture restoration.

Soak a soft, clean cloth rag in warm water.
Wring out some of the excess water to prevent the rag from dripping over unaffected areas. Scrape the paint away
Wipe away the spot of paint. You may need to rinse and re-soak the rag several times to get all of the paint up.
Wipe the wood dry with a separate, dry rag.;
,


Apply enough alcohol to a clean rag to dampen it without making it dripping wet.
Pass the alcohol-soaked rag over the paint spot to remove it. Rinse, resoak, and repeat as needed.
Dry the spot with a clean, dry rag when finished.

, Oil-based paint will continue clinging to the wood if you use plain water, so wipe it away with a soft rag dabbed in mineral spirits.


Dip a soft, clean rag into a small dish of mineral spirits. Instead of soaking the entire rag, only soak the area you plan on bringing into contact with the paint splatter.
Wipe up the paint by passing the mineral spirit over the splatter. Rinse and resoak as needed until all the paint has been removed.
Dry the area with a separate dry rag.

, Dry spots of paint can be softened by soaking and rubbing them away with boiled linseed oil.


Soak a clean rag in boiled linseed oil.
Press the linseed oil rag against the paint spot and hold in place for 30 to 60 seconds. This permits the oil to soak into the paint.
Wipe away the softened paint with your linseed oil soaked rag.
Dry the area with a separate dry rag.

, If you cannot wipe the paint away even after softening it with boiled linseed oil, carefully use a putty knife to scrape beneath the splatter and lift it off the wood.

, Any dried paint residue that remains can be removed by rubbing it with a paste made of boiled linseed oil and rottenstone.


Combine enough boiled linseed oil and rottenstone in a small disposable dish to form a thick paste. Use a disposable wooden chopstick to stir the ingredients together.
Scoop some of the paste onto a clean rag and rub the paste into the wood along the grain.
Wipe away the grain using another clean rag.

Oil whenever the wood feels dry.,
Clean off dust and dirt.,
Select an oil or commercial product.,
Gather materials.,
Mix in solvent if appropriate.,
Rub the oil in slowly.,
Wipe up excess oil.,
Apply more coats, sanding in between.,
Consider applying additional protective products.,
You can use a ""wood preservative"" to add pesticide and fungicide.,
Minimize the wood's exposure to both moisture and sunlight.,
Wipe off dirt often.,
Stain or paint regularly.,
Maintain good air flow.",How to Preserve Wood," Outside of industrial uses, rubbing in oil is the most common way to preserve wood. The right oil will soak into the wood's pores, keeping the wood strong and slowing absorption of water that can cause rot. A couple coats of oil can protect wood for years, but this depends greatly on the oil and environment, so check regularly. If a dab of oil is rapidly absorbed, the wood has dried out.


Even if you plan on painting the wood, you may want to oil it first, especially if the wood is old and in poor condition.Teak is a uniquely long-lived wood which does not need to be oiled, although once it has been oiled it may require regular reapplication.;
, Prepare the wood by dusting off any dirt or debris. Use a clean, dry towel or rags to wipe off the wood. Note and repair any imperfections or flaws in the wood.

, There are many available oils and wood preservation products suitable for home use. Follow this advice to select the best one for your wood:


Tung oil gives good protection, if you can accept the high price and hours of drying time.A finish that contains tung oil gives better water protection than 100% tung oil, but avoid varnishes that create a top layer instead of soaking in, and be wary of products sold as ""tung oil"" that have no relation to the real product.For cutting boards and other kitchen applications, use food-safe mineral oil, or coconut, walnut, or almond oil. Avoid the last two if nut allergies are an issue.Mix in ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) melted beeswax for each cup (240 mL) oil for additional protection.There are many synthetic products out there, including pretty good ones that use linseed oil as a base but provide additional protection.Modern water-based finishes are cheap and easy to apply, but not good for long-term preservation.
Boiled linseed oil (""BLO"") is a common choice, but provides poor water resistance and yellows over time. Its main advantage is price.(Raw linseed oil is even less effective, although environmentally friendly.)

, Find a clean, dry rag for rubbing in the oil, and newspaper to catch spills. Because many of these oils are flammable, keep a metal container nearby to store these materials after the oiling. Have access to water or a fire extinguisher so you are ready in the unlikely event that some of these materials spontaneously ignite.The flammability is greatly reduced once the oil dries. When the job is finished, air-dry the rags and newspaper in a single layer away from buildings and heat.

, Commercial products may not require this step; refer to the label. If using tung oil or linseed oil, mix a small amount of the oil with an equal amount of turpentine, mineral oil, or other solvent. Mix in more solvent if the oil won't penetrate the wood.


Never use solvent for cutting boards or other wood that will come into contact with food.

, Use the cloth to rub the oil into the wood, covering the entire surface. For the most consistent results, dab the oil on one splash at a time, rubbing it across the wood bit by bit.


Applying more oil at once is acceptable if you'd like to save time. The more you rub in at once, the more variation there will be in color and shine, but this isn't likely to ruin your wood's appearance.
If you are using a product sold as a wood protector, refer to the label for more precise instructions.

, All excess oil should be wiped from the surface within a few minutes, unless your product label states otherwise. The oil that soaked into the wood will provide the protection; excess surface oil will only add an unnecessary surface layer that may become gummy or discolored with time.If the oil has already dried on to the surface, wet a cloth with a little more oil to wipe it up again.

, At least two or three coats of oil are recommended for long-term preservation. Follow these steps each time:


Wait until the previous coat is dry. This can take under an hour for some synthetic products, to a week or longer for raw linseed oil.
Sand the surface lightly.
Mix more oil-solvent mix, if necessary. Use less solvent for each coat, making a thicker and thicker mix.
Rub in the next coat.

, Once the last coat of oil is dry, the wood should be much more resistant to decay and weakening. There are some dangers oil does not protect from, however, and these can be handled by an additional finish once the last coat of oil is completely dry. All of the following are optional:

, Some of these products may not be safe for use around children.


Water repellent will provide additional protection against water, which may be useful if the wood will be exposed to serious humidity.
A layer of paint provides additional protection, depending on the paint type.
To protect against scratches, use polyurethane or another wood finish.

, This will help the wood last longer. Shovel snow and dust snow from wood furniture immediately. Cover wood furniture with durable, waterproof tarps or such during periods of extreme heat, cold and wet weather.

, Sweep wooden decks regularly since dirt and plant fibers hold moisture and fungus. Sweeping is preferable to hosing water, since it remove abrasive sand and doesn't introduce damaging moisture., Apply any chosen stain to the wood without removing its current finish. Use a tough exterior grade paint when applying a primer and painting furniture.


Check all sides of a wooden house each year for signs of wear. Sides exposed to strong wind and rain may need repainting sooner than others.

, Ventilation helps fight moisture buildup, so keep the wood free from leaf litter, vines, and soil buildup. If you have a wooden structure in your garden, considering building a trellis for the nearby plants, so they can grow around the structure without causing issues."
"
Apply polyurethane to the wood.,
Spread the polyurethane around your wood piece.,
Apply multiple coats of polyurethane to achieve your desired finish.",How to Seal Wood2," Pour your polyurethane over the end grain of your wood piece, and let it run down the sides smoothly.


Wet a clean rag with polyurethane, and smooth it around the face of the wood.
Polyurethane is self-leveling because it is thin enough to spread out on its own, meaning that you should not have to worry too much about achieving an even coat.

, Use long strokes with a clean brush or rag (a rag with wipe-on polyurethane is the easiest method) to spread out the polyurethane.


Make sure to use extra polyurethane for the end grain (the exposed, cut part of wood on the end of the piece), because this is the most absorbent part of the wood.
Work from one side to the other, trying to keep the distribution of polyurethane on the surface of the wood equal and smooth.
Wear gloves during this entire procedure to avoid staining your hands.







, Apply several coats of polyurethane to the surface of the wood, waiting for each coat to dry in between applications.


Keep an eye out for any polyurethane drips, and smooth them out to avoid a bumpy finish.
Sand between coats to smooth out any uneven areas.
Reapply coats of polyurethane until your desired finish is attained.
Use fine steel wool after the last coat to take away dust particles and buff out the last coat, but don't do this if you are using a glossy polyurethane.
Drying time varies, so make sure you read your polyurethane's instructions and keep an eye on the ambient temperature and humidity.

Get your sponge wet to apply the shellac.,
Apply the shellac in bands.,
Don't interfere with the shellac drying.",How to Seal Wood3," Shellac is usually applied with a sponge, to maintain the wet edge.


Get your sponge as saturated with shellac as possible before beginning your application.

, Be sure to maintain a wet edge as you apply each band, working quickly across each face of the wood, one band at a time.


Start at one end of the wood face and work across quickly, making sure that the shellac doesn't dry as you apply the bands.
Shellac is a challenging sealant to apply, because you need to keep each band wet as you work on the next one.

, In contrast to polyurethane, you should not interfere with the shellac's drying process or manipulate it in any way.

Do not use steel wool.






Do not sand the shellac in between band applications.






The shellac melts into itself with each subsequent coat, creating a smooth finish on its own.






You can apply anything over shellac if you have another finish you like.

"
Understand lacquer before attempting an application.,
Apply your lacquer in thin coats to avoid an ""orange peel"" effect.,
Maintain a ventilated area and beware of sparks.",How to Seal Wood4," Lacquer is a very durable finish that is applied with a spray gun.


A spray gun can be purchased for $50-$100, and is necessary to use lacquer.
Lacquer is a very high performance finish, drying quickly to a hard, durable finish.
It is not easy to apply as an amateur, and is not forgiving of mistakes made during application.

, Lacquer should only be applied in very thin coats with your spray gun, never allowing a buildup of lacquer in one specific spot on the wood.

Pull the trigger as you get close to the piece, move the gun over the surface, overlapping the previous spray path by about 50%, and release the trigger just after moving beyond the edge.






When you spray your lacquer, move the spray gun back and forth over the surface quickly.






Wait for the lacquer to dry in between coats, and apply 3-4 coats of lacquer total.






Don't let the spray gun point at one area for too long in order to avoid drips and the ""orange peel"" effect.







, Make sure to take the proper safety precautions when spraying lacquer.


Lacquer is highly toxic when inhaled, so make sure to maintain a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator.
Additionally, lacquer is highly flammable, so beware of sparks.
If you are using a fan for ventilation, make sure it doesn't spark.

Scrape the paint stain with a putty knife.,
Apply some alcohol on a cloth.,
Rub the remaining paint with the cloth.,
Wipe the alcohol away.,
Wipe the surface with a dry cloth.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Wood2," Try to gently chip off as much of the top layer of paint as possible. Any paint you can remove this way will be less paint that the alcohol has to cut through. Be careful not to dig into the wood and leave scratch marks behind.

, Use basic rubbing alcohol, which can be purchased at most drugstores or grocery stores. Place the cloth on top of the open bottle and shake it once or twice to saturate a small section of the cloth.

, Keep adding alcohol to the cloth and continue rubbing until all the paint is gone. Alcohol can damage the wood's finish, so only use it on the exact area of the paint stain., Moisten a clean cloth with a bit of water and wipe the area with it to remove all the remaining residue. The wood may still smell of alcohol, but that will dissipate over time.

, Rub the damp spot until all excess moisture is removed. The wood will still be wet, but should dry within 24 hours."
"
Determine if the painted area is large enough to use a heat gun.,
Read all product instructions carefully.,
Aim the gun at the paint and turn it on.,
Scrape at the stain with a putty knife.,
Wipe down the surface once it’s cool.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Wood3," If you're removing paint from an entire door or piece of furniture, using a heat gun may be worthwhile. If you only need to remove a few small spots, then other methods, like soap or alcohol, may be a more practical choice.


If you decide to use a heat gun and wish to buy one, they are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased at craft stores and hardware stores.

, You can char the wood, and even start a fire, if you use too high a setting. Read the safety instructions to be sure you know the proper way to use the heat gun.


Melting paint can also create harmful vapors, so be sure to wear protective gear like safety goggles and a mask or respirator., Hold it 3-4 inches (7-10 centimeters) away from the stain for about 10-20 seconds at a time. Try moving it in small circular motions to heat a larger area at once., While holding the heat gun with one hand, try to get under the stain with the edge of the knife. The paint should begin to soften and peel away. Clean off the putty knife as needed and continue scraping until all the paint is gone.


Turn off the heat gun any time you set it down to clean the putty knife.

, Wait until the wood is no longer hot, and wipe it with a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. You can add some soap to the cloth for added cleaning power (see method above for full instructions)."

Choose a solvent.,
Put on safety gear.,
Create proper ventilation.,
Roll or brush on solvent.,
Scrape off bubbled paint.,
Cleanse the area with mineral spirits.,
Wait a week to refinish the wood.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Wood4," The most common paint stripper is methylene chloride. It’s extremely potent and should be used with care. There are solvents that are citrus-based and more environmentally friendly, but these are still dangerous and proper safety precautions should be taken.Solvents can be purchased at your local hardware or paint store.

, Wear eye protection, like safety glasses or goggles, and a ventilation mask to protect yourself from the harmful vapors. It’s also a good idea to wear gloves and long sleeves since the product could splash., Work outside if possible, but if the wood can’t be moved, open all windows and doors. Set a fan behind you so that the airflow blows the fumes away from you and out a window or door.

, Use a paintbrush or paint roller to apply a thin coat of the solvent to the paint. Allow it to sit for about 20 minutes, or however long the instructions recommend.The paint will begin to bubble as the solvent is working.

, Use a blunt plastic scraper to scratch off the paint that has begun bubbling and peeling. Avoid using sharp metal tools that will gauge the wood. Collect the peeling paint in a disposable container or plastic bag.

, Some manufacturers claim that water alone will clean the area, but the best way to ensure the wood is neutralized is to wipe it with a rag soaked in mineral spirits., Give the wood at least a week to completely dry and air out before you attempt to apply any stains or waxes."
"
Rub the paint using steel wool or sandpaper.,
Clean the wood with a damp cloth.,
Refinish the wood.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Wood5," Use #0000 steel wool or fine sandpaper (150-180 grit). If there’s a lot of paint to remove, start with a coarser sandpaper, like 80-120 grit or, in extreme cases, 40-60 grit.Do this very gently to remove only the paint.


Large areas can be sanded with power sanders, but be sure to wear a protective mask and safety glasses and read all product instructions carefully.

, Run a wet rag over the wood to wipe away sawdust and debris. Swap the cloth out for a fresh one if it becomes too dirty while you’re cleaning.

, Once it’s dry again, touch up the wood using the same finish or stain that was used on it before. If you don’t have any extra or don’t know what was used on it, try to match it as closely as possible with samples from your local hardware store.

Always work to avoid jobs rather than create them when restoring furniture and woodwork!,
Buff with a clean rag.",How to Remove Shellac2," Where the shellac finish appears stained or has dirt embedded in it, try the following first:Sprinkle a mild abrasive compound over the surface. For example, pumice or rotten-stone.
Work this in.
Rub off with a cloth.

, If the surface looks good again, you're spared having to remove the shellac.

Use denatured alcohol to remove shellac.,
Using a small brush, brush the shellac with the denatured alcohol.

,
Allow the denatured alcohol to sit for a few minutes.",How to Remove Shellac3," Also find a piece of 4/0 steel wool.

,, This will help it to begin naturally stripping off the shellac.

"
"
Put on some rubber gloves to protect your hands.

,
Rub the shellac with the steel wool.,
For curved, grooved or harder areas, use a carpet knife.,
Remove the remaining shellac by wiping with a rag.,
Remove all soft pieces and any debris before proceeding with adding a new finish.",How to Remove Shellac4,", Remove as much as you can with the steel wool.


This part does require some effort and hard rubbing. You may need to take breaks and come back to it, depending on the size of the job. Getting others to help is always a good solution!

, This will be able to reach into narrow spots where the steel wool is just not able to reach.

, Change the rag frequently, to avoid reapplying the shellac on stripped parts of the surface.

, It's also important to sand the surface before applying a new finish.

"
"
Hold a heat gun near the surface of the wood.,
Slowly move the heat gun over the surface.,
Scrape the paint up as it wrinkles.,
Stay calm if a fire starts.",How to Remove Paint from Wood2," Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on.Use an electric heat gun or electric paint remover. A blowtorch will also provide the necessary amount of heat, but blowtorches come with a greater risk of scorching or setting the wood on fire, so they are not recommended.
Wear protective gloves and goggles as you work with the heat gun.
Do not let the heat gun come into contact with the wood or come too close to the wood. Doing so may result in scorch marks or fire.

, Pass the heat gun over the surface of the section of wood you are currently working on. Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing.


Do not let the heat gun linger in one spot for a prolonged period. Doing so will cause the wood to burn and potentially catch on fire.

, Once the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle, immediately scrape the paint up with a broad paint scraper.


If possible, continue to heat the paint with the heat gun in one hand as you scrape up bubbling paint with your other hand. If you have difficulty balancing both tasks, though, switch the heat gun off temporarily and scrape up any heated paint immediately.

, Even though it is possible for the wood to catch fire, these fires are usually small at the start and can be put out safely as long as you think clearly.


A small flame can usually be put out by smothering it with the flat side of your paint scraper.
Keep a bucket of water nearby as you work. If a fire starts to catch and cannot be smothered out, quickly soak it with the water.

"
"
Protect yourself.,
Sand the paint off by hand when possible.,
Switch to a mechanical sander for larger jobs.",How to Remove Paint from Wood3," Wear safety goggles and a face mask to protect yourself from paint and wood dust as you sand, regardless of the sanding method you use.

, When removing paint from a crack or crevice or stripping it from a small, delicate wooden object, you should sand the paint off by hand.


Mechanical sanders use considerable force and can damage delicate pieces. Moreover, they can be difficult to use on small, confined spaces.
Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper since other types may clog with paint and wood dust too quickly.
Sand with the grain of the wood instead of against it.
Decrease to a medium grit paper once you can see the grain of the wood peeking through the paint.
Decrease to a fine grit when small bits of paint are all that remain.

, For larger areas of painted wood, including large pieces of wood furniture, large wooden chests, or wood trim, rely on a mechanical sander to save time.


Choose between a mechanical hand sander and a power sander. A hand sander will be a little gentler and makes a good option if you want to preserve more of the wood beneath the paint. A power sander will finish the job faster, though, making it a good choice for especially large projects.
Belt, disk, and drum sanders are all good options worth considering when picking a power sander.
Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper on your mechanical sander since less coarse options tend to clog up with paint and wood dust too easily.
Always sand with the grain of the wood rather than against it to minimize the amount of damage to the wood.
Switch to a fine grain sandpaper, if desired, once the majority of the paint has been sanded off and only a few small specks remain.

Choose the right type of paint stripper.Look for a paint stripper labeled for use with the type of paint you want to remove.,
Pour a small amount of paint stripper in a wide-mouth metal can.,
Brush the paint stripper on with a paint brush.,
Alternatively, spray the paint stripper on.,
Let sit for as long as directed.,
Test the paint.,
Scrape the paint off with a metal scraper.,
Touch up the surface with soaked steel wool.",How to Remove Paint from Wood4," Also choose between a liquid or paste paint stripper.


Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers.
Paste chemicals are brushed on and are used to strip many layers of paint. If you need to remove 10 layers or more, choose a paste.
Read the instructions thoroughly before use. While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary. Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper.

, Pouring a small amount in a small can makes it easier to use the paint remover.


If possible, use a can with a plastic resealable lid.

, Use a broad flat paintbrush to apply the chemical thickly and evenly over the surface of the painted wood.


Brush the paint stripper on in one direction.
Do not brush over areas that have already been covered by paint stripper.

, If using an aerosol paint stripper, point the nozzle of the bottle roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the surface of the painted wood and apply the chemical in an even, thick layer.


The chemical will create a foaming, clinging layer.

, Usually, the paint remover should be left on the surface for 20 to 30 minutes, but exact times may vary.


Keep the windows and doors of the room open to prevent potentially harmful fumes from building up as the chemical sits.

, Rub the blade of a paint scraper over the surface in a circular motion. If the scraper cuts into the paint, the chemical has worked correctly.


Make sure that the scraper you use is chemical-resistant.

, Glide the paint scraper beneath the softened paint to peel it away.


Remove as much as possible with the first few passes.
Work in one direction.

, If some paint still remains, soak medium-grade steel wool in a small amount of paint remover and scrub those spots until they lift up.


Old rags or abrasive scouring pads will also work.

,
Align the square surface plate against the side against the corner.,
Screw the top portion of the hanger bolt into the plate.",How to Attach Table Legs1," You should have a number of choices at your closest home improvement store. This method is best for attaching legs to an already finished piece of furniture.;
, This will save you a step in the process. If they don’t have the screw already inserted, buy a package of hanger bolts for larger tables and dowel screws for small tables.

, Compare the hanger bolts to the surface plates to ensure the screws are a compatible size. Try straight leg plates first, although you can also purchase plates for slanted legs.

, Measure to the center of the leg and mark it with a pencil or marker. Drill a pilot hole that extends into the center of the leg, and then screw a hanger bolt tightly into the top of each leg.


Start by twisting the screws in by hand. Then, use a set of locking pliers to twist it in until it feels very secure.,, Clamp it into place or ask someone to hold it. Screw it into place with four screws.


If you bought a table plate kit, it may have been packaged with four compatible wood screws.
Repeat in the other three corners.

You will want to try them out for size, shifting them in or out along the rail until they are comfortable for you. When you have these rails in a desirable position, mark the location of the outer seat board, remove them, and saw a 45 degree angle on the rail so none of it will protrude from beneath the seats.








, Drive nails through the table top boards into their rails to finish securing them.








,, You can use a silicone waterproofing sealer, an exterior polyurethane (many so-called polyurethane products actually degrade in ultraviolet light), or a semitransparent exterior wood stain for this purpose.

Gather the required materials (see, Things You'll Need, below).,
Mark the basic hexagon shape of the hub, or center of your table on your work table or a sheet of plywood.,
Use the drawing on the table surface to establish the length of the members that will form the ""band"" (outer edge boards) of the hexagon.,
Fit the ends together to form a hexagon with equal sides, then fasten the ends with 2 1/2 inch (6.35cm) galvanized or corrosion resistant wood screws.,
Check to make sure each side is equal after the sides are fastened together by measuring across parallel sides.,
Cut a two by four to fit between two opposite corners, making a 30 degree cut, at each end, off the corner on each side to the center of the 2 inch (5cm) way.,
Fasten this 2X4 (5cm X 10cm) at each end with wood screws.,
Cut the four spokes.,
Fasten these spokes in by screwing the first two on one side through the center board, and the opposite by toenailing with wood screws through the bevelled end.,
Check the finished frame to make sure it is symmetrical and all sides are equal.,
Cut 6 boards for the standards that will support the table top on the base frame, and 6 diagonal braces to help support them.,
Pre-drill holes where fasteners will attach the supports to the frame.,
Fit each standard in place.,
Place an 8 foot (243cm) 2X4 inch (5cm X 10cm) across two opposite corners on top of these posts and center it between them.,
Mark the center of this board.,
Fasten these spoke members in place on the center board and on top of the posts at each end.,
Cut 2X4 inch (5cm X 10cm) boards 12 inches (30cm) long with 30 degree off each end (i.e.,
Cut six 14 inch (35cm) 2X4 inch (5cm X 10cm), square on each end, and six 10 inch (25cm) diagonal braces with 45 degree angles on each end.

,
Fasten the 14 inch (35cm) boards on the end and flush with the bottom of the spoke boards radiating from the center hub of the upper section of the framework you have assembled.,
Fasten the diagonal braces to these legs, again, making sure the assembly is square and tight-fitting.

,
Check the finished assembly to make sure all fasteners are holding tightly and everything is sturdy and sound.,
Roll the framework off the assembly table so that it stands on the ground upside down from the assembly position.,
Begin fastening the table top lumber on the hub assembly.,
Center the first plank on the center line between two opposite corners, checking the distance from opposite edges on opposite ends.,
Make a line parallel to the supporting frame about 3 inches (7.5cm) outside that frame and cut the planks off with a circular saw.,
Finish laying and fastening the table top planks.,
Place the seat boards on the 2X4 inch (5cm X 10cm) extending to the outside of the base frame.,
Fit all of the seat boards, taking care to recheck angles and adjusting them so each fits tightly to the adjoining board.

,
Sand any edges that may have splinters or rough surfaces and round the corners with a sander to avoid injuries to shins as people seat themselves at the finished table.

,
Finish the table with an exterior sealer or weather resistant paint, then enjoy your new table.

",How to Build a Hexagon Picnic Table," You want to buy good quality materials with minimal knots, splits, or warping. Cedar, redwood, or even the new recycled plastic decking is best for flat surfaces. In this article, treated southern, yellow pine lumber is used.


Set up a work area so you can cut and assemble parts conveniently. You will need a workbench or table at least four feet square, as well as saw horses and a bench for your miter saw.;
, This will help you place pieces in the correct position.

You can lay out the hub with a framing square, drawing a center line, transversal (with its length roughly 1 1/2 inch (3.75cm) longer than 2 spokes placed end-to-end), then marking two 60 degree angles on each side at the center so the third angle between them on each side will be 60 degrees also (for 6 x 60 = 360 degrees), then measuring out from the center point equal distances (in the length of the spoke), and finally, connecting these points to form the outline of the hexagon (for 6 equal outer edge boards).







, For the table in the illustrations, the six sides are 24 inches (61cm); cut off a 30 degree angle from each end (leaving 60 degrees). Of course, when pairs of sides are put together while forming the band, the resulting table corner is 120 degrees.

, Pre-drill the holes through one side of these corners so they grip tightly and don't split.

, For the example project, each side is about 45 inches (114cm). A simple trick to keep the sides from slipping or moving, toenail two sides with wood screws to the table top until the spokes, or internal framing members are fastened.

, You might scribe these cuts, if you are unable to get an accurate measurement.

, Again pre-drill the band so the wood doesn't split and the screws pull up tightly. This assembly will be the basic support for the tabletop, and fitting everything flush (straight and aligned) and tightly joined together will give you a good, solid finished table.

, Measure the length of the spoke from the center of the transverse 2X4 inch (5cm X 10cm) out to one corner. Cut your spoke to that length.
To cut the angles on the spoke, first scribe the center of the 2 inch (5cm) way on each end. Then cut the outer pointed-end of each spoke by cutting off 30 degrees from each edge to your scribed center.
The hub-end will be cut 30 degrees to the center mark off one edge only, and 90 degrees off this end cut, from the center, to the other edge, thus dropping 60 degrees -- or after cutting 30 you could cut off 60 degrees to the center off the second edge, which would automatically leave that desired 90 (since 30+90+60 = 180).

, Again, pre-drill holes where possible, especially when fastening very near the end of the board.

, Check that the edges are flush on both the top and bottom. Be aware that even finished lumber may vary slightly in width and thickness, so this step is important for a good finished project.

, The leg pieces in the illustrations are 10 inches (25cm) long, and the diagonal braces are 6 inches (15cm) long, 45 degrees on each end.

, Then fasten the braces to these members. Keep the screws flush to the frame so each member can fit tightly in place. Use the same 2 1/2 inch #10 corrosion resistant wood screws.

, Secure the braces and check to make sure everything is in the proper location.

, Then fasten it in place with screws.

, Draw a line down on each side with a square to mark the location where the radial boards that will support the seats will be fastened. Cut four of these with the same 30 degree angles centered on each side of one end.

, Then brace them with diagonal braces, if you want, for extra support.

,: 60 degrees angles). Then fit them between the spoke boards to brace them. Make sure they are equal, as these will keep the seat support boards in position during the rest of the table assembly.

,, Use a larger, heavier screw for this attachment, since it will be supporting the weight of the table and its occupants when the project is finished and the table is in use.

,, Add screws to any connections that seem loose, and replace any boards that have split or do not seem sound., The legs should rest firmly on the ground or your work surface. If any seem to be too long or out of square, you might trim them, but that shouldn't be necessary, if they are all cut and fitted correctly.

, The illustrations show 5/4 X 6 inch (3cm x 15cm) deck boards with radius edges, cedar or redwood, or 2 X 4 inch (5cm x 10cm) treated yellow pine can also be used.

, Let one end overhand about 3 inches (7.5cm), and screw the plank down to hold it in place. Continue adding planks until one side is almost covered.

, Save the drops (cut off ends) of these planks to finish the side you are working on and to start the other side. Make sure you fasten the planks securely; they may warp or twist, if exposed to the weather.

, Then trim all sides so they are equal and symmetrical to the base frame. Sand the edges to make sure there are no splinters or rough material to injure users of the table.

, Each will have a cut approximately 30 degrees, the outside should cover the top of the legs where they fit the ends of the seat supports. Drill pilot holes in the ends of the seat planks so they don't split.

Purchase four table legs, T-nuts, nuts and hanger bolts at a home improvement store.,
Drill four holes through the base of your tabletop.,
Tap the T-nut into the hole with a hammer from the top of the base down.,
Install four hanger bolts that match the size of the T-nuts into your table legs.,
Twist the legs into the bottom of the base until they are even with the top.",How to Attach Table Legs2," You can find unfinished legs and all the hardware necessary to install them at most large hardware stores.

, Ensure that they are equidistant, so that your table is level. This form of attaching legs is best for unfinished tables that will be covered, upholstered or layered with another piece of wood.


Make sure that the hole is approximately the size of your T-nut and no larger.

, Continue until it sits in the hole and there isn’t any space between the top of your table base and the metal.

, Measure and mark the exact center at the top of the leg. Drill a pilot hole, then twist the hanger bolt into the leg.


Use a pair of locking pliers to tighten the hanger bolt.
If you purchased legs with pre-installed hanger bolts, you can skip this step.

, Then, twist a regular nut onto the top of the bolt to keep it in place. Repeat with the three additional legs.Test your table to ensure it is level before you finish it or attach the top layer.

Dab the dent with water.,
Place a damp paper towel or piece of cloth over the dent.,
Give the water time to soak into the wood.,
Heat up a clothes iron.,
Run the iron over the dented area.,
Rewet the wood and repeat as needed.,
Let the wood dry completely.,
Smooth out the wood with sandpaper.,
Brush on a protective finish.,
Repair large dents with a filler material.",How to Remove a Dent from Wood," Pour about an ounce of water over the affected area, just enough to cover the dent and a small part of the surrounding wood. Make sure the dent is completely wet. Pooling inside the depression itself is a good sign that the spot has been thoroughly soaked.Using an eyedropper or kitchen baster will give you more control over where you apply the water.
If there’s any serious breakage or chipping around the dent, you may need to have the surface repaired professionally to avoid making it worse.;
, Wet the cloth or paper towel and wring out the excess water, then lay it directly on top of the dent. This will provide a little added moisture while also creating a buffer that will help protect the wood from being damaged by the heat of the iron.It may be a good idea to use an old t-shirt, dusting rag or some other piece of fabric that you don’t care about potentially ruining.
If the dent is located on the side or corner of a piece of furniture, you might need to hold the cloth in place with your free hand while you steam the wood., Let the wood sit for a minute or two to absorb as much moisture as possible. As the water seeps into the wood, it will cause it to soften and become pliable. Once you apply heat to the spot, the wood will expand and the dent will lift right out.


The deeper the water penetrates into the wood, the more effective the steaming process will be.

, Plug the iron in and turn it on to the highest setting. Give it a few minutes to start warming up—it needs to be nice and hot in order to work effectively.The iron will be very hot after you’ve turned it on. Touching the surface could result in a painful burn.
When you’re not using the iron, set it on a hard, level surface where it won’t get tipped over.

, Press the iron into the cloth above the dent and move it around using slow circular motions. Make a few passes, gradually widening the area that you’re ironing. Keep heating the wood until the cloth is dry, then lift a corner to check your progress.The heat from the iron (coupled with the moisture of the water) will cause the compressed wood in the dent to swell, returning it to its original form.
Try not to let the iron sit in one place for too long, or it may scorch the cloth or the wood underneath., A single ironing might be all you need to deal with minor dents. For more severe depressions or areas with multiple marks, continue adding water and ironing slowly until the worst of the dents have been raised.Between attempts, be sure to dampen the cloth with fresh water or grab a fresh paper towel.
You might not be able to remove deep dents entirely. However, steaming will help to level them out and make them less noticeable., Wet wood is soft, which makes it prone to splitting and breakage. Allow the surface to air dry before handling it. In the meantime, hold off on replacing furniture or setting other objects on it to avoid further accidents.The heat of the iron will have evaporated most of the moisture, but it may take a few hours to regain its full hardness and rigidity.
The wood will shrink somewhat as it dries, which can cause problems if you begin sanding or putting pressure on it too soon.

, In some cases, small flaws may be left behind in the wood, or the water might produce a slight discoloration. You can remedy this by running a square of high-grit sandpaper over the area until it blends in with the wood around it.Use light, smooth strokes to avoid scratching the wood surface, which may have been weakened by the dent.

, When you're done buffing imperfections out of finished surfaces, be sure to touch them up with a fresh coat of paint or laminate. This will help conceal any remaining traces of the dent and act as a barrier against knocks and bumps in the future.In most cases, a single coat will do to cover up the spot where the dent was.
Allow the refinished surface to air dry overnight before touching it., Steaming won’t always be enough to eliminate dents. Deep gouges and spots with breaking, splitting or chipping should be looked at by a professional. Extensive damage can usually be repaired with a durable epoxy or lacquer filler.For bigger jobs, have a woodworker cut a special wood inlay to fit the damaged area.Afterwards, the repaired surface will likely need to be resealed or stained.

Cut the upper attachment pieces to 7” long. Chamfer the width dimension to a 60 degree angle. Chamfer the thickness dimension to 15 degrees.







, Use a pocket-hole jig to drill the connection holes. Think ahead at this point to make sure the holes are on the bottom (floor) and under the table top. Add glue to the joint before screwing together.

,, Chamfer the thickness dimension on both ends to 15 degrees – see picture.

,,, Use wood filler to cover the screw holes and any gaps in the wood. Sand to remove wood filler and clean up the joint lines.

, This version used white for the legs and green for the top.


, Drill a small hole at the intersection of the upper attachment assembly. This will be the center location for the round top.

, Find the center of the round top. Measure the diameter. Use a string or tape measure set to the radius and draw a light arc. Move the string to another point on the edge of the table and draw another arc. The intersection of these two arcs is the center. Try a third arc to verify. Drill a hole at the intersection.


, Use a nail or rod to line up the hole in the leg assembly and the hole in the round top. This will keep the top centered on the leg assembly. Drill pilot holes through the upper attachment subassembly. Use wood screws to attach the leg assembly to the top. Make sure the screws don’t protrude through the top.

Measure and mark the cut lines first, then cut the lumber with a miter saw. Cut five 2x10 boards to 69 inches (180 cm) in length.


If the miter saw is too small to make one cut, cut halfway through, then rotate the board and cut again.
Refer to the end of this article for a list of all lumber and supplies required. If you'd like to change the measurements of your table, draw a diagram first so you know how much lumber to buy.;
, Find the flattest surface you can, such as a garage floor. Lay out the five 69"" boards in a row, as flush as possible. A little warp is fine, but try a different order for the boards if there's a major gap.

, For each border between two boards, draw a series of marks along one side, spacing them 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) apart. This is where you'll drill pocket holes to hold the tabletop together. In addition, mark two spots on each end of each board, where you'll be attaching breadboard ends.

, Insert a drill bit into the depth guide on your Kreg Jig, until the step touches the 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) mark. Tighten the depth collar with an allen wrench.The step is the edge between the wide and narrow portions of the drill bit. Don't use the tip of the drill bit as your guide.

, Manually loosen the screw on the back of the jig so you can move the hole guide. Raise or lower it until set to the 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) mark, then tighten the screw.

, Stand the edge of a board into the Kreg Jig, centered on one of your marks. Drill through the hole on top of the Kreg Jig to make a pocket hole in the board. Repeat with each mark on each board.


It can help to rest the board on a 3/4"" spacer, to keep it level.
Don't forget the marks on the end of each board. Stand the board vertically to drill these.

, Sweep the floor of sawdust and lay out your boards again, in the same order. Confirm that all ends are flush before you continue.

, Place the screw into one of the pocket holes you just drilled, and drill it in to fasten the boards together. Keep the boards as level and flush as possible while you do this, and check afterward to make sure they haven't shifted. Repeat for each pocket hole between two boards.


Clamp together the boards if possible. It also helps to weigh down the boards with heavy objects.

, Run your orbital sander over the surface of the boards, as well as both ends of the tabletop.

, Measure the width of your tabletop to find out how long the breadboard ends should be. Cut two more lengths of 2x10 to this length. This should be about 46¼""., Line these up level and flush with the two ends of the table. Drill 2.5"" Kreg screws through the remaining pocket holes to attach these two boards. Your tabletop is now complete.

, Cut these with a miter saw, adjusting the saw to cut at an angle where described below. You'll need the following cuts of lumber to form the two ends of the table:Two 4x4s to 43"" length (end tops)
Four 4x4s to 25⅜"" length, with ends cut parallel at a 10º angle (table legs)
Two 4x4 at 36¼"" length, with ends cut not parallel at 10º angle (end braces)

, As before, run an orbital sander over the cut wood to smooth out the surface.

, On a flat surface, lay out a table end as follows:


Put down one of the 43"" ""end top.""
Position two 25⅜"" legs against the first board, leaning inward in the style of a picnic table.
Place a 36¼"" board between the two legs as a horizontal base. Adjust the position of this piece and the legs until they are flush against each other, and centered under the top board.

, Drill in three 6"" torque screws at each point where two boards touch (twelve screws in all). Put together the second table end the same way you did the first.


An impact wrench makes it easier to drill in the torque screws, and reduces the chance of stripping the bit.

, Position the end pieces upside down on either end of the tabletop. Measure the distance between them (it should be about 73""), then cut the following lumber to that dimension:


Two 4x4s for braces
Two 2x4s for the apron
As before, sand the cut surfaces smooth before you continue.

, One of the 4x4 braces connects the top of the table ends. Keep the table ends upside down so you can rest this brace on the floor. Drill each end into the brace with two or three 6"" torque screws.

, Drill two pocket holes in each end of each 2x4, using the same 1.5"" setting as before. Lay these parallel with the 4x4 brace you just drilled, running between the two ends right where the table legs connect to the rest of the table. Drill each pocket hole with 2.5"" Kreg screws, as before.


For greater strength, stand the 2x4s vertically rather than laying them flat., You'll have to attach this one in midair, running parallel with the other 4x4, between the two end braces. Either have a friend hold it in place, or raise it with two jack clamps. Use two or three 6"" torque screws for each end.

, Lay the tabletop flat on the floor and place the base on top of it. Drill torque screws through the bottom of the boards and into the tabletop. Place them as follows:


Two 4.5"" torque screws near each end of the end top, outside of the legs
A 4.5"" screw about every 5-6"" on the end top, between the legs
More 4.5"" screws every 5-6"" along the central lengthwise 4x4 brace.
Switch to 2.5"" torque screws and drill one every 5-6"" through the 2x4 apron boards.

, Flip the table on its side. Measure the length of a line running at a 45º angle from the end of the central 4x4 inward to the lower 4x4 brace. (This should be about 26⅛"".) Cut two 4x4s to this length, cutting the ends to a 45º angle so they are not parallel with each other. Sand them, then drill them in with three 6"" torque screws on each end.

, The tabletop surface may be rough, especially if you used construction-grade lumber. Wear down the worst offending areas with a hand planer.

, Start with obvious dents using a 40-60 grit sanding pad. Next, sand the entire table using progressively higher grit, ending with 120 or 220 grit. Be sure to sand the sides of the tabletop as well, especially where the breadboard ends attach to the main surface.


Optionally, smooth out the corners and top edge of the table with the sander.

, If you prefer a well-worn look, you can mark the table with nail dents, saw marks, or any other surface damage you'd like to inflict.

, You may refer to our detailed guide, or follow the instructions on the wood finish of your choice. Wipe on the finish with a clean rag. Wait a few hours for the finish to dry, or as directed on the finish instructions.


You can make your own rustic finish by letting steel wool dissolve in white vinegar. This takes about two or three days in an open Mason jar. Filter the liquid through a paper towel, then wait a few additional hours until it turns an amber color., A polyurethane sealer will protect from spills and enhance the wood's color. Brush on two or three coats of polyurethane, letting the wood dry for 12+ hours between each coat. For best results, sand the table before each coat and wipe it off with damp rag.


Follow the safety instructions on the product. Work in a well-ventilated area or wear a respiratory mask.
Use a well-made brush in good condition to avoid losing bristles in the polyurethane.

Acquire the wood for a barn siding table by tearing down an old barn, or get it from someone who has already done that.,
Clean and mill the wood.,
Set your bar clamps on a flat surface and lay out the edges on the end.,
Remove the clamps after the glue dries and begin to even the areas by using your plane or by sanding the top flat once the glue has dried.,
Sand the edges smooth and route any shape desired once the top is smooth and flat.,
Build the base, legs and aprons next.,
Attach the top to the base.,
Secure the top to the legs by pre-drilling through the apron.,
Choose your finish and apply it to the barn siding table.,
Begin to apply the finish with the table turned upside down.",How to Build a Barn Siding Table," Either way, you must mill and clean up the wood before using.


Visually, and by using a handheld nail finder, check for left-over nails and other metal that has been left in the wood. Remove the metal before you use any power tools on the wood for obvious safety reasons.
After removing all nails and metal from the barn siding, cut the wood down to a manageable size. Some of this siding and framing timber can be very large.
Once you have cut down the wood to a size slightly larger than the finished product, take it to the clean up and mill area. This will square up and prepare the wood for cutting the parts necessary for the table.;
,


Cut the table top slightly longer than you need. Once it has been cut, mill the wood so that you have a uniform depth and a straight edge.
Put the edges together and match up the grain for the best look. Mark the edges so that you will know which one joints up to the other.

, Apply glue liberally and lay the boards flat, matching up the marks on the exposed surface.


You are now ready to clamp. Begin by placing clamps on the tops as well. Tighten up the clamps evenly so as to increase the pressure evenly along the edges. Wipe off the squeezed out glue with a damp rag or sponge.

, Use either a hand-smoothing plane or a belt and random orbital sander.

, Cut the table to the desired length with a circular or jigsaw.

, These can be in whatever style or size you design.


Cut the apron from materials matching the top and shape, or cut into any design your plans call for.
Attach the legs to the apron using a jointing method that is within your skill set. The mortise and tendon method provides a nice fit.
Brace the legs by using corner brackets once the legs and apron are attached. These can either be metal or wood brackets attached to the aprons then bolted onto the leg corners.

, This requires a flat area to lay the top upside down. Place the base apron and legs on top of it, centering the legs.

, Use screws to attach the top to the legs. You can also cut a groove with a table saw or a hand-held router. Also, make a guide about .5 inches (1.3 cm) from what will be the top of the apron. You can also use metal table top fasteners, which are available from woodworking supply houses.

,


Any finish is only as good as the preparation put into it. You don't want to hide the character of the wood, since the look of the table is rustic. This means no filling or patching knots and nail holes.
Just sand all exposed wood parts of the table, beginning with 120 and then 180 and moving to 240-grit sandpaper until all parts are finished. This is the most time-consuming part of the process and it can also make or break the piece.

, This gives you easy access to the table bottom. You don't want to leave the bottom of the table top unsealed.


The type of finish used will depend on the look you want. It can be anything from multiple applications of varnish (rubbing between coats with ""000"" steel wool) to the use of a milk dye followed with several coats of varnish or polyurethane (to give color to the wood). You will then have a table built from the barn siding that you can take pride in.

Puzzle glue
Paintbrush (or sponge)
Parchment paper (or wax paper)
Any clear adhesive, like shellac or decoupage glue, can be used to glue your puzzle together, though some glues might leave a cloudy finish or not glue as firmly as puzzle glue.;
, You'll want to work on a level, clear space while gluing your puzzle. Sometimes, glue can seep between puzzle pieces, causing the pieces to stick to your work surface. To prevent this, you should put a layer of parchment paper between your puzzle and the surface on which you're working.The parchment paper you lay beneath your puzzle should extend several inches beyond its outer edges.
If you don't have parchment paper handy, you could also use wax paper to prevent puzzle pieces from sticking to your work surface.

, If you are able, slide your puzzle over the top of your parchment paper. If this is not possible, you may need to get a thin, stiff piece of card stock to slide underneath your puzzle to help you transfer it to the parchment paper.


At this point, your puzzle should be facing picture side up atop your parchment (or wax) paper, and your paper should extend a few inches beyond the outer edges of the puzzle., To ensure an even layer of glue is spread over your puzzle, you should start at the center of the puzzle and work your way to its outer edges. Start with a moderate amount of glue first. You can always add more later, if necessary.


Working from the center of the puzzle out will also help prevent you from using too much glue, which can cause unevenness in the glue., Add your glue a little bit at a time and use your paintbrush or sponge to spread your glue from the center to the outer corners of your puzzle. You should only need a thin layer of glue to hold the puzzle pieces together.


Adding too much glue to your puzzle can sometimes cause the pieces to curl when the glue is dried.Some brands of puzzle glue come with a plastic glue spreader that you can use to distribute your glue over the surface of your puzzle.
If you find that a brush or a sponge doesn't work well for spreading glue and if your puzzle glue did not come with a spreader, you may be able to use a plastic spatula to distribute the glue more quickly. However, dried glue can be difficult to remove from your spatula once you are finished.

, In many cases, when you reach the edges of your puzzle, you'll find that you have some excess glue. Remove this by pushing it off the edges onto the parchment paper with your paintbrush, sponge, or plastic spreader.If you are using a plastic spreader/spatula, you may be able to remove extra glue by scooping it up and wiping it onto a piece of paper towel.

, Depending your the brand of puzzle glue you have bought, this may only take a few hours or may require an entire night to dry. When waiting for your puzzle to dry, it's best to err on the side of caution. Moving your puzzle too soon can cause wet glue to deform the puzzle pieces.


You should check the label instructions for your glue to determine the amount of time your glue needs to dry., The bond created by your glue on the front of your puzzle should allow you to easily pick up the puzzle by hand and turn it so the cardboard side of the puzzle is facing up. Larger puzzles can sometimes be more unstable. In this case, you might want to use a piece of cardboard or stiff card stock under the puzzle to provide stability while flipping.Glue can often seep between the spaces between puzzle pieces. When this happens, gently peel the puzzle free of the wax paper before flipping it.
For especially stubborn glue, you might need to use a firm plastic edge, like a spatula, to break the bond between the puzzle and the parchment paper. Use firm but gentle pressure when doing this.
After you flip your puzzle, you should reinsert parchment paper beneath it to prevent glue from sticking pieces to your work surface.

, Add a moderate amount of glue to the center of your puzzle and spread a thin layer toward the edges using your paint brush or sponge. Much like when gluing the front of your puzzle, you should aim for a thin, even coat of glue.You should add glue to your puzzle a little bit at a time to prevent wasting glue and to ensure a thin, even coating over the pieces.

, Once you reach the outer edges of your puzzle, you'll likely have some extra glue left over. Use your paintbrush or sponge to push this glue off the edges of the puzzle and onto the parchment paper., Once the glue on the back of your puzzle is fully dry, your puzzle should be firmly connected together. In many cases, this will be stable enough that you won't have to worry about framing or mounting your puzzle if displaying it on a flat surface. However, framing or mounting your puzzle can provide even more stability to puzzles you plan to hang., Over time, the glue of your puzzle will deteriorate naturally. This can cause pieces to come loose and become lost. To ensure your puzzle stays in one piece, you should mount or frame it when hanging.You should consider mounting your puzzle especially if you are planning on moving it to a different location. If the puzzle is bent, the glue can crack or cause the puzzle to warp. A rigid backing will prevent this from happening.

, With a piece of plain cardboard that is larger than your puzzle, you can make an effective mount. Simply take your puzzle glue and apply a moderate amount to the back of your puzzle. Lay your glued puzzle onto the cardboard. Allow the glue to dry, then:


Take a utility knife and cut the excess cardboard free from your puzzle. Do this by cutting with your utility knife around the border of the puzzle.

, A sturdy, relatively thin foam board is often attached to the back of puzzles before framing. Foam board will have more flex than other kinds of mounting material. This can make your puzzle easier to insert into a frame.


There are many kinds of foam board you might use to mount your puzzle. These are often available at hobby or craft stores.
If you are unsure if the foam board you selected for mounting your puzzle is thin/sturdy enough, the service representative of your local hobby/craft store should be able to offer advice., A frame can give your finished, glued puzzle the appearance of a work of art. First you'll need to measure your puzzle dimensions and purchase a frame that will fit it. Lay your puzzle inside the frame and seal the back of the frame to protect and showcase your puzzle.Most frames come with catches or tabs at the back that can be used to either hold the puzzle in place or to sandwich the puzzle between the glass of the frame and a piece of cardboard.
If you're trying to save money, you may be able to find a suitable, inexpensive frame at a secondhand store and re-purpose the frame for your puzzle.

If the tree is too old or too young, you won't have the support you need for your treehouse and you will be putting yourself and anyone else who goes into the treehouse in great danger. Your tree should be sturdy, healthy, mature, and living. Ideal trees for treehouse include oak, maple, fir, and apple. It's a good idea to have an arborist inspect your tree before you start building. An ideal tree has the following qualities:


A strong, sturdy trunk and branches
Roots that are deep and well-established
No evidence of disease or parasites that could weaken the tree;
, Take the time to learn about local regulations or ordinances that may be relevant to your treehouse project, such as height restrictions. You may even need a permit to build. If you have protected trees on your property, there may be restrictions on building in them.

, As a courtesy, it's a good idea to speak with your neighbors and let them know your plans. If your treehouse will be visible from or overlook a neighbor's property, they will be glad you're taking their opinion into consideration. This simple step can head off future complaints and even potential lawsuits. Though your neighbors will most likely comply, this will help make them more amenable to your project.

, Make a quick call to your insurance agent to make sure that a treehouse is covered under your homeowner's policy. If it's not, then any potential damage that is caused by the treehouse won't be covered by your insurance.

, If you're building a treehouse in your backyard, then you may only have so many trees to choose from. Once you chosen a healthy tree, you can start thinking about the design of the house that can go on it; or you can take the opposite route and think of the design first, and then make sure that you have a fitting tree. Here are some things you keep in mind as you choose the tree for your treehouse:


For a standard 8'x8' treehouse, choose a tree with a trunk at least 12"" in diameter.
To calculate your tree's diameter, measure its circumference by wrapping a string or measuring tape around the trunk at the point where you want the treehouse to sit. Divide that number by pi (3.14) to get the diameter.

, It's important to have a firm idea of the design of your dream treehouse before you hammer in the first nail. You can find treehouse designs online, or if you're knowledgeable about building, you can create your own. You need to make accurate measurements to ensure that your design works with the tree you've selected.


You may find it helpful to make a small cardboard model of your tree and treehouse to identify any potential issue areas.
In creating your design, don't forget to plan for tree growth. Allow ample space around the trunk of the tree for the tree to grow. It's worth doing some research on your specific tree species to determine its growth rate.

, There are several ways to support your treehouse. Whatever method you choose, it's important to remember that trees move with the wind. Sliding joists or brackets are essential to make sure your tree and treehouse are not damaged by winds. Here are the three main support methods for your tree:


The post method. This method involves sinking support posts into the ground close to the tree, rather than attaching anything to the tree itself. It is the least damaging to the tree.
The bolt method. Bolting the support beams or floor platform directly into the tree is the most traditional method of supporting a treehouse. However, this method is the most damaging to the tree. You can minimize the damage by using proper materials.
The suspension method. In this method, you would suspend the treehouse from strong, high branches using cables, rope or chains. This method will not work for every design, and it is not ideal for treehouses that are meant to carry any significant weight.

, Before you build your treehouse, you'll need to decide on a method of access, such as a ladder, which easily allows a person to enter the treehouse. Your method should be safe and sturdy, so this rules out the traditional treehouse ladder, which is made up of boards nailed to a tree trunk. Here are some safer methods of access for a treehouse:


The standard ladder. You can purchase or build an ordinary ladder for climbing into your treehouse. A ladder made for bunk or loft beds can work as well.

The rope ladder. This is a ladder made of rope and short boards, which is hung from the treehouse platform.

The staircase. A small staircase is the safest access method, if it's compatible with your vision of a treehouse. If you choose this method, make sure to build a railing for safety.

, How will you build around pesky branches? Will you cut them off, or incorporate them into the plans of the treehouse? If you decide to incorporate branches into the treehouse, will you build around them or frame them in a window? Ask yourself these questions before you start building. That way, your treehouse will reflect the care and preparation of its builder when finished.

, Before you begin to build your treehouse, you should remember to keep safety in mind. Falling out is one of the biggest hazards of a treehouse. There are a few precautions you can take to make sure that everyone who is building the treehouse stays safe.


Don't build too high. Building your treehouse too high could be dangerous. If your treehouse is going to be used mostly by children, the platform should not be any higher than 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m).
Construct a safe railing. The point of your railing, of course, is to make sure that the treehouse occupants don't fall out. Make sure the railing around your platform is at least 36"" high, with balusters no more than 4"" apart.
Cushion a fall. Surround the area below the treehouse with a soft natural material like wood mulch. This won't entirely prevent injury, but it will provide some cushioning for a fall.

, You'll use this tree into order to rig up your treehouse. The ""V"" shape will add extra strength and support, providing an anchor point at four places instead of only at two.

, Drill a 3/8"" into each prong of the ""V,"" making sure that the holes are all level. If they are not level with one another, the structure could be slanted and the support compromised.

, Depending on the tree, the holes may be spaced farther or shorter apart.

, Make a mark at the other end using the original measurement between the two holes in the tree. This will ensure that the 2x10s will be perfectly centered and bear equal weight when you hoist them onto the ""V"".

, This is so that the trees can sway in the wind and move without damaging the structural integrity of the treehouse. Do this by drilling two 5/8"" holes, each 2"" to either side of your mark. Then use a jigsaw to cut between the holes, creating a 4"" slot, with your mark completely centered.


Now when the tree sways in the wind, the platform actually moves a bit to accommodate the swaying. If the platform were simply bolted onto the tree, it would move along with the tree. This is not good for the platform, as it could gradually or suddenly be pushed in different directions and begin cracking.

, Choose two sturdy pieces of 2x10 (2x12 will do, too) and place them flush against your tree. Drive four 6"" or 8"" long, 5/8"" diameter galvanized lag screws into the four 4"" slots of the 2x10 using a wrench. Place washers in between the screw and the wood board. Repeat with the other board on the opposite side of the trunk, making sure both boards are at equal height and flush with one another.


Pre-drill both the tree and the 2x10s for an easier time installing the screws, and to minimize cracking in your boards.
Undercut both supports at each each for an aesthetic finish. Of course, do this before mounting the supports to the trunk with your screws.
Consider doubling up each support with another 2x10 for added strength. In effect use two 2x10s on each side of the trunk, flush against one another. This allows the supports to bear more weight. If you do decide to double up on your supports, use bigger lag screws (at least 8"" long and 1"" diameter).

, Instead of placing them flat across the main supports, place them up on their side so they stick up two feet into the air. Secure them with 3"" deck screws.

, Lay each 2x6 flush across the four ends of the 2x6s and nail them into place. Your platform should now be a square attached to the main supports. Check that your 2x6s are centered and square.

, Use 8 galvanized rafter ties to attach all four of the perpendicular 2x6s to the main supports.

, Use 8 galvanized joist hangers to attach the ends of the perpendicular 2x6s to the abutting 2x6s.

, As it stands now, the platform is still a bit wobbly. In order to make the platform more sturdy, you'll need to add at least two braces. These will be attached to a lower portion of the tree and then again on both edges of the platform.


Cut a 45 degree angle out of the top ends on each 2x4. This is so that you can attach the 2x4 to the inside of the platform.
Form a ""V"" with your 2x4 so that they overlap at a straight part of tree but also cleanly abut onto the inside of the platform.
Attach the top of the bracing to the platform from the bottom and on the inside. Make sure both are completely flush before you drive nails into them.
Drive an 8"" lag screw through the overlapping 2x4s at a sturdy point on the tree. Use a washer between the 2x4s and the lag screw for best results.

, Make a measurement of where the the trees come through the flooring and cut around the trunks with a jigsaw, leaving 1"" to 2"" around.

, Once your deck boards have been cut to accommodate the trunks of your tree, it's time to screw them into place. Use a ladder to hoist yourself up onto the platform and start screwing down with a drill. Leave a slight 1/4"" or 1/2"" distance between each floorboard.

, Add covering and verticals to the platform to make a rectangle. Now an awkward part that formerly jutted out of the platform has been turned into a handy-dandy entrance.

, Nail the two 2x4 (they should be at least 4 feet high) together, and them screw them to the platform at each corner.

, Use 2x4s as well, and if you want, mitre the edges of the handrails. Then, nail them down to the uprights. Next, screw the handrails into one another through their mitered corners.

, Nail any available woods — planks or plywood work fine — flush into the bottom of the platform. Then nail them into the railing at the top so that they form an effective fence.


Use whatever you want for siding. You can successfully use meshed-together rope if you want, as long as little kiddies cannot slip through. Safety should be a first priority, especially when you're dealing with small children.

, There are a number of ways that you can do this. Have fun with this part of the project!


Build a rope ladder
Build a ladder using 2 12-foot 2x4s and 2 8-foot 2x3s. Place the 2x4s side by side in perfect symmetry, marking off where each rung should go. Cut out 2x3 notches about 1 1⁄8 inches (2.9 cm) deep into both sides of the 2x4s. Cut the 2x3s the appropriate length for rungs and glue them into their notches with wood glue. Secure your rungs with deck screws and wait for the glue to dry. Stain your ladder to give it a nice hue and protect it from the elements.

, This roof is made from a simple tarp, although you can also get more elaborate in designing and constructing your roof. Drive one hook into both trunks about 8 feet (2.4 m) above the bottom of the platform. String a bungee chord between the two hooks and slip a tarp overhead.


Next, build four outriggers several feet high and attach them to the four corners of your railing. Nail the tarp to the four corners of the outriggers, securing with a washer. Now your roof should have a better overhang.

, If you want to weatherproof your treehouse, or just give it a more appealing look, now's the time to stain or paint it. Consider a stain or paint that will work in combination with your house.

The ideal thickness for a puzzle backing, be it cardboard or plywood, is one-eighth inch (0.3 cm).Look for a piece of backing that’s as close to the size of your puzzle image as possible to avoid waste.
You can use the cardboard from on old box to back your puzzle, but make sure it’s clean, undamaged, and flat. Thin cardboard like that from a cereal box will work for a simple puzzle, but thicker cardboard is preferable.

, Aside from the image and your puzzle backing, you will also need glue, spray lacquer, a ruler, and a pencil. For a cardboard-backed puzzle, you will need sharp scissors or a hobby knife. For a wood-backed puzzle, you will need either a coping saw(a hand saw used for intricate shapes)or a scroll saw, an electric or pedal-operated saw that’s good for intricate curves.


Liquid craft glue or spray glue will work best for your puzzle because it’s multi-purpose and won’t damage photographs.
If you are using a photograph for your puzzle image, be sure to find lacquer that’s safe for it.

, Place your backing on a sheet of wax or parchment paper to protect the surface underneath. Place it good side down. Spray or cover the surface of the backing with glue and spread it around so there’s an even coat all over it. Place your picture onto the backing. Use your fingers to slide it around so it’s centered and straight. With a roller or old credit card, apply even pressure to the picture to help the glue adhere and remove bubbles.Let the glue dry. Glues have different drying times, but give your puzzle several hours to set if possible.

, Take your puzzle outside or to a well-ventilated area. Place it back on the parchment or wax paper. Spray an even coat of lacquer over the image. Check the can for drying time, and allow it to dry.

, If your puzzle image is smaller than the backing, begin by trimming down the edges of the backing. For a cardboard puzzle, use your scissors or place your puzzle face up on a cutting mat and use your hobby knife. For a wood puzzle, use your saw to carefully trim the border so that the backing is the exact shape and size as the puzzle image.


With a hand saw, place most of the puzzle on a solid, flat surface (like a table) with the side you want to cut overhanging the edge. Firmly hold the puzzle with one hand to keep it in place and use your other hand to hold the saw and cut.

, Flip your puzzle over and place it image-side down. Use a ruler to mark out and draw a grid pattern made up of squares that are three-quarters of an inch (for a puzzle with more, smaller pieces) or one inch (for a puzzle with fewer, larger pieces).


Instead of drawing your own puzzle template, you can print off templates from sites like Tim’s Printables.

, To create puzzle pieces, begin adding ball and socket shapes (concave and convex half-circles) along the edges of the grid squares so that the pieces will fit into each other when the puzzle is cut.You can also use inverted and protruding triangles, squares, or other shapes.


For pre-drawn puzzle templates that you’ve printed off, glue them on to the back of the puzzle and allow it to dry., For cardboard puzzles, follow the puzzle piece template you’ve drawn on the back and use your scissors to cut out the pieces. Or, if you’re using a utility knife, put your puzzle face down on your cutting mat and carefully cut the pieces. Or, cut out the pieces with your saw, being careful not to cut yourself. When you have finished, use an eraser to remove any remaining pencil marks.


To make it easier, don’t cut out pieces individually. Rather, cut entire rows or columns at a time, and then go back and cut out the individual pieces.The lacquer will help protect the image from damage as you’re cutting out the pieces, and this is especially important if you’re using a saw.

Gather the tools and materials you will need to start the project.,
Select a piece of appropriate wood.,
Set up a sturdy table.,
Set your vise on the work surface, and build a standard, or device to support the other end of your stock.,
Clamp a drill motor in the vise jaws, securing it as shown in the picture, with the handle and trigger up, so it can be turned on and off as you work.

,
Align the center of the drill chuck by sliding the vise to a position where the chuck is almost touching the standard, and marking this point.

,
Drill a hole through the standard, being careful to keep it in line with the drill chuck, large enough for a number 14 wood screw to pass through.

,
Drive a number 14 wood screw into one end of the stock you are going to make the yo yo from.,
Mark the center of the other end of your stock, and drive another number 14 wood screw into it, after first pushing the screw through the hole in your standard.,
Tighten the screw in the opposite end of your stock into the drill motor's chuck, positioning the vise so it is aligned with the standard and spaced so that the stock is supported and will turn freely.

,
Clamp or screw the vise down to the work surface so it cannot move.,
Start the drill motor slowly, lock the trigger so it stays on, and use the drill's variable speed control (if equipped) to turn the stock piece.,
Set the speed of the drill and lock the switch in the on position, and begin to remove material slowly from the stock with a 4 inch (10.2 cm) sander/grinder, or a piece of very coarse sandpaper on a sanding block.,
Increase the turning speed when you have turned the stock into a balanced cylinder, and continue removing material until it is the desired diameter.,
Using a wood-cutting blade on a hacksaw, or a sharp, fine toothed wood handsaw, cut grooves for the string in the stock.,
Using a piece of sandpaper, sand the grooves smooth, inside and out, and sand the edges too, while being careful to maintain equal force (for smooth sanding) and minimal pressure.

,
Use the saw to cut the stock, giving your yo yo its final shape.,
Sand and finish the yo-yo as desired.",How to Make a Yo Yo," A drill motor and a vise are essential, and if you don't have these, you will need to either borrow or buy them.;
, In the project pictures, a dead limb from a red cedar is used, since it is attractive, lightweight, strong, and available. You will most likely not want to use green woods, very hard woods, or knotty woods, since they are difficult to machine. Here are some things to look for in selecting your wood:


Availability. Of course you will need to be able to obtain your stock. We simply walked in the yard and pulled down a dead limb from a tree there.
Machinability. The wood you choose should be cured and soft enough to machine. Green wood has too much moisture in the wood to sand easily, and will shrink and crack when it cures. Very hard woods are difficult to machine, drill, and shape.
Soundness. The wood you will use should be sound, with no cracks, checks, loose knots, or holes in it.
Appearance. A wood with nice grain and color will give you a better finished product if you do not intend to paint it.

, The project we undertook was done on a 2 X 10 piece of lumber set on a chair's armrest, This is not recommended. A good work bench is the best choice, but a good, strong table will work, if its surface is protected.

, This is done by nailing a vertical piece of lumber to the work surface, then attaching a diagonal brace to make it secure.

,,,, It should go deep enough to get a good bite (or grip) on the wood, and needs to be centered as closely as possible. Cut the head off this screw, so it can be chucked into the drill motor.

, Again, make sure the screw has a good bite, at least one inch, into the stock piece. This screw will support the stock while the stock is turning, and if it fails, it can injure the person working the stock, or damage the drill motor.

,, Vibrations and torque from the turning process cause a lot of force on the vise and drill motor if it is not closely aligned.

, You will notice it is not turning true to begin with, but if the screws that form the axle are aligned closely enough, it will true up as you remove material.

, Move the sander/sandpaper slowly toward the stock, so that it removes a little material each time the stock rotates. The speed of the drill should start out slow, since the stock is not a true cylinder, and therefore is unbalanced. As material is removed, it should become more and more round, until you have a cylinder.

, You will want to stop the drill and make sure there are no defects in the wood once this is done. Also, mark the places you will remove material to actually shape the yo yo.

, You will probably want the stock to be turning about 250-300 RPM for this process, and be careful to apply pressure gradually and lightly to accomplish this cut. Remember, you are supporting the workpiece on improvised centers!

,, Cut to within 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the center while the piece is turning, then shut the drill off and finish the cut the conventional way, using the saw.

, Tie on a suitable string, and test it out!

Assemble the materials and tools you will need.",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon1," For the project in the illustrations, rough sawn treated yellow pine privacy fence boards were used because they are inexpensive and lightweight. They also resist rot and insect damage, making it suitable for use as a planter box. You will also need:


Drill and circular saw
Corrosion resistant screws
Basic hand tools;
"
"
Build the basic platform for the wagon.,
Build four wheels by gluing two 1X6 boards to each other (with perpendicular grain direction).",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon2," The platform shown in the illustrations is about 18 inches (45.7cm) wide and 24 inches (60cm) long, but you can modify the size easily to fit your needs.

, Then scribe a circle on them, and cut them out with a jigsaw or bandsaw. Drill a 1/2 inch (1.2cm) hole in the center of each for the mounting bolts (described later).

"
"
Make the front axle swivel assembly by ripping two boards 2 X 2 inches (5cm x 5cm), the same length as the width of your wagon.

,
Drill a hole in the center of these two boards for the swivel pin.,
Cut a section of pipe (or wood dowel, if preferred) 2 1/2 inches (6.3cm) long to fit in the swivel assembly holes.,
Use a large screw or lag bolt to through-bolt the swivel and hold it in place.,
Drill the ends of the moving section of the front axle swivel assembly for the wheel bolts.,
Drill a hole though the axle assembly and the bolt that attaches the wheel to the assembly.,
Attach the assembly to the bottom of the wagon base you started with.

",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon3,", The illustrations show using a piece of metal pipe 3/4 inches (1.9cm) in diameter, so a 3/4 inch hole is drilled for this purpose.

, Use a flat washer as a bushing to allow the swivel to move freely when it is assembled.

, You may find you need a large fender washer to allow the screw to tighten if the hole is so deep the wood will not hold it.

, A 1/2 inch (1.2cm) steel bolt works well for this assembly. Drill through the center of each wheel, slide the bolt through, slide a flat washer on the bolt, then stick the bolt into the hole in the end of the axle assembly.

, Install a wood screw to lock it in place. You might grease the bolt so the wheel will turn freely and to reduce wear on this surface, or you may choose to install a metal bushing in the center of the wheel to reduce wear even further.

Bend two angle clips to attach the wagon handle with.,
Mount these brackets at the center of the swivel/axle assembly, allowing space for the pull handle to fit between them freely.,
Rip the stock, (described in the step, above), sand the edges smooth, and position it between the brackets so the attaching bolt can be inserted.,
Build the yoke that will hold the grip at the other end of the handle.,
Fit a block of wood 1 inch (2.5cm) square between the ends of the yoke.,
Thread the bolt or all-thread rod through the yoke, the handle block, and out the other side of the yoke.,
Tighten the assembly.",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon4," Here, a 1 inch (2.5cm) by 1/8 inch (3.1mm) piece of aluminum flat stock is a good material to use, being easy to form and drill, and weather/corrosion resistant. Each side of the angle should be about 4 inches (10cm) long, and you will need to drill 3/16 inch (4.7mm) holes for the mounting screws on one side of each piece.

, You might rip this piece of stock (1 1/2 inches (3.8cm) square by 3 feet (91cm) long) before mounting the attaching brackets to make sure they are positioned correctly.

, A 1/4 inch (6.3mm) bolt 2 1/2 inches (6.3cm) long will hold this piece in place. You can dimple the end of the bolt where the threads come out of the nut to prevent it from loosening during use.

, Again, the aluminum flat stock is an easy material to use for this step. Form two matching pieces in a squared zee shape (see illustration), drill it for the mounting screws, and smooth the edges with a file or sandpaper so there isn't a risk of scratches when handling it.

, Then center drill it for a 1/4 inch (6.3mm) bolt (or all thread rod) to attach it. Be sure to drill as nearly in the center as possible, using a bit long enough to drill completely through.

, Then thread a nut on the end (or both, if you are using all-thread rod).

, Cut off and grind smooth any protruding bolt threads.

"
"
Build the solid rear axle.,
Drill and screw the spacer blocks and rear axle into place.",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon5," Cut a 1 1/2 by 1 1/2 board the same length as the width of your wagon, and cut two spacer blocks to support it and allow clearance for the wheels to turn.

, Then drill the ends to allow the wheel mounting bolts to be inserted. Drill and pin these bolts into place the same way you did on the swivel assembly.

"
"
Cut and fasten the sideboards on the wagon platform.,
Sand any rough or splintery edges with a power sander or sandpaper.,
Finished.

",How to Build Your Own Kid's Wagon6," Use wood screws or brad nails to attach these sides.

, Be especially careful if this wagon will be used by a child.

Paint the popsicle sticks.,





Dab some instant glue on a popsicle stick.
,





Place another popsicle stick on top of the glued one.,





Make each stack with 3 sticks each.,





Create your spiral from here as you glue each stack together.
,





Place a nail on the top being very careful in not destroying the spiral in the process.",How to Make a Chinese Spiral," It is up to you on how long you want your spiral to be and the colors you want for it. You can either do a mix of colors or a degrade or fade from one color to the next. The image provided shows a degrade from green to yellow.
,, You want to make it a little ""off-sided"" so that the ends are right next to instead of being on top of each other., Take one stack of 3 and continue gluing stacks together, using the same gluing method as before.,, Tie a piece of lengthy thread on the nail."
"
Prepare wood background.,
Trace heart onto the tracing or craft paper.,
Transfer the paper onto the wood surface.,
Add nails around the perimeter of the heart.,
Wind string around nails to create your heart.,
Remove paper from wood backing.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Homemade String Heart," Sand and cut wood if necessary (or purchase a pre-cut, pre-sanded square).

Apply stain or paint. Since the wood piece will be your heart’s background you will want it to look as good as possible. Determine if you want to simply stain the wood grain or paint over it. Either way, apply two coats for best results.



 


Allow paint or stain to fully dry before proceeding to the next step.





;
, You can either freehand draw the heart or go online and print out a template of a heart that will fit on your block of wood. Make sure the paper size matches the wood and you have enough room to easily create your heart.

, Hold the paper in place by adding a few strips of painter’s tape to each corner. Use painter’s tape because it will hold your paper in place, while at the same time not disturb the stain or paint when you are finished.

, Tap nails into the pencil lines, spacing them evenly apart and being sure that the nails are all the same height. One way you can determine if the nails are even is to use a level that you can lay across the nails.


If nails are not level you can tap nails in further or pull them upward.

, There is no specific pattern you will need to follow for the string as the nail pattern will act as your guide.

Tie one end of the string to the first nail (your choosing) and then wind it around the nail head and then around the next nail.






Pull tightly so the string is stiff and holds the design.






Wind around the nail head before moving onto the next nail.
Continue winding the string until you have a full heart pattern.







, Carefully tear paper away from the wood, taking extra care to peel any pieces of paper that are stuck underneath nails. You don’t want any evidence that you used the tracing or craft paper.

,, Use a stud finder to search for wall studs. If possible, find two studs and secure the bookcase with two straps to ensure a good hold.


Secure the bookcase into wall studs whenever possible, instead of using wall anchors.
It is best to secure the bookcase without the books in it, and then fill it up once you are finished.

, Draw a vertical line. The two cross-hairs are the locations where you will drill your wood screws into the wall.

, Make sure the adhesive layer is facing down. You will peel back the clear plastic cover after you are done drilling.

, Use a cordless drill. The number of screws may depend on the brand of Velcro straps you use.


If you couldn’t find a stud, you will need to make pilot holes and insert the wall anchors. Then, screw the wood screws directly into the wall anchors, where your lines meet.

, Peel back the clear cover from the sticky adhesive and press the strap onto the top of the bookcase. For best results, don’t remove the adhesive strip to realign, or it may lose some of its hold."

This is mostly up to personal preference, but factors such as opened doors and stud placement should be considered when choosing a location.;
,


A stud is the wood framing that comprises the inner structure of the walls. It's essential to find a stud when putting up shelves because shelves drilled into dry wall are not well supported and will collapse.

, Mark it with a pencil.


Studs are usually placed every 16 to 24 inches (40.62 cm to 60.96 cm) apart. Ideally you want to put up shelves with the incorporation of at least two studs. If your shelves are shorter than the distance between two studs, you will want to use one stud as a center point for your shelves.

, Decide on the height of the shelves.

,


If you are putting up shelves at more than 1 height, make sure to make marks for that as well.

, Draw a straight horizontal line to the next stud.


Repeat this step for the shelves at other heights.

,, Screw the 2-inch (5.08 cm) wood screws in so that the bracket fits tightly.

Select a blank, that is, a piece of suitable lumber large enough to trace or draw out the outline of your pistol.,
Position the gun (or template, see next step) on the blank so that any large knots fall near the location where the grip meets the action of the weapon.,
Trace the outline of an actual Colt pistol if you have one available.,
Draw only the basic outline or shape on the blank, keeping your pencil perpendicular to the edges so you do not get distortion in the actual shape.,
Use a bench top bandsaw with a scrolling woodcutting blade to cut the outline of your pistol out of the blank.,
After the rough blank is cut out, cut the actual traced line with the band saw.,
Rip the stock to the correct width after the blank is cut to the actual shape of the gun.,
Use a power sander to round the edges of the grips, the font of the barrel, and the trigger guard, being careful not to remove too much material.,
Cut the trigger out with a spiral cut saw (RotoZip, or die grinder with a spiral cutting bit).,
Use a sharp knife or a carving chisel to cut the recessed areas such as the trigger/trigger guard assembly, the cartridge ejection port, and the taper underneath the barrel near the muzzle.,
Use a rasping bit or drum sander on a die grinder to smooth the recesses in the trigger guard, as well as the flats between the grips and the frame.,
Use the die grinder with a cut-off wheel to make the lines in the frame, barrel, and action, as well as cutting any checkering or knurling you want to add to make the gun authentic looking.

,
Use a chisel or carving tool to clean up and finish shape the contours and curves of the frame, action, and barrel of your gun.,
Sand the carving with a medium and then fine grit sandpaper to give a smooth, finished surface.",How to Carve a Model 1911 Colt Pistol," A knotty piece of southern yellow pine at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long, 8 inches (20.3 cm) wide, and 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick will work well. Note that the knots or gnarly grained wood will not split or crack as easily as a straight grained piece, making your finished gun more rugged.;
, This angle cut through the blank is the weakest area of your project, and as mentioned above, a tight, solid knot will make it stronger.

, If you do not have access to one, or a replica like an Air Soft version, you will need to find a photograph of one which can be duplicated to a life sized scale and cut out for a template, or draw one free hand.

, Make sure the lines are dark enough or contrast the color of the wood well enough to be clearly visible when it is cut.

, Working an inch or so outside the lines at the beginning will allow you to cut very sharp corners more easily, and give you more room to turn the blank on the band saw bed (table).

, You will find it is easier to cut into line intersections beginning at the edge, then remove the blank, and cut an intersecting line rather than trying to make very sharp corners.

, The grips on the Colt should be about 1 1/8 inches (20.3 cm) thick, the action and barrel about 7⁄8 inch (2.2 cm), but you can leave it a bit thicker so the excess can be sanded away later, when you are finishing the weapon.

, A mini-grinder, or 4 inch (10.2 cm) angle grinder with a 60 grit sanding disk on a flexible backing pad works well for this task, but a die grinder or Dremel type tool with a drum sander attachment will also work, and is a bit safer for inexperienced people.

, Holding the workpiece in a vise makes this process much easier and safer.

, You can also shape the area on the grip where the metal frame and the grip material (usually high impact plastic or hardwood) meet.

, These tools make cutting these irregular and curved surfaces much quicker and easier.

,, A very sharp tool will require less force when cutting, reducing the risk of slipping, which can result in a serious injury or damage to the carving.

, Sanding with (in the direction of) the grain will give the best results.

Design your shelving based on your available space.,
Make a shopping list for your base frame: 1"" x 12"" lumber, measuring the length of your outer box, your vertical supports, and your shelving.,
Make a list for your other materials- supporting 1"" x 2"" strips x the length of your shelving; 1/8"" plywood to cover the back; 4 supporting pins per shelf; lots of wood screws (standard drywall screws work fine) and small wire brads to mount the back.,
Cut the wood to fit the design of the base box.,
Drill the necessary holes.,
Mount the vertical sections.,
Finished.








",How to Build Wooden Bookshelves," If you're making built-in bookcases, measure the space available, both at the bottom and the top- don't assume your walls are plumb and square. You will want to break up your shelving with vertical sections every 30"" or less- anything more and your shelving will sag. Use no more than 18"" to 24"" spans for typical 1"" wood. If they do start to sag, you can go back and cut small square 1"" side panels and mount them vertically in the shelf below for additional support. For built-in bookshelves, design a box to fit the space, and then plan for vertical sections and the shelves to fit into it. You can build it and then slide it into place and mount it.






;
, Remember most wood comes in 96"" sections, so you will have some waste. If you plan ahead how you're going to cut them, you can buy some shorter (72"") or longer (120"") sections to fit your design. Use poplar or maple over the low-end pine boards, since the knots make the wood hard to work with and paint.








,; paint;








, Remember to add/subtract the width of the wood itself depending on which way your joints lap. Assemble the box and mount on the plywood backing. Re-measure each vertical section and cut.








, Before mounting the vertical sections in the box, either drill holes for the supporting pins or cut grooves (dados) to mount the shelves into. Measure the pin diameter with calipers and find the right bit for a somewhat loose fit, or do trial and error on a scrap of wood. Make sure to drill the holes perpendicular to the wood- use a drill press if you have one. A template to mark the holes is very helpful; If you're not tool-handy skip this step and you can use L-brackets to hold up the shelves later. It's ugly, but functional.








, Test the joints to ensure they are square. Measure each shelf length and cut. Install pins and test fit. Remove shelves and add 1"" x 2"" supporting strip to the front for additional support. Re-install shelves and paint. Optionally, use 1-1/2"" x 1/4"" strips along the vertical supports, sides, and top to cover the joint-work.

Measure the area where the shelf will hang.,
Drill four holes in your plank using a paper guide.,
Sand, paint and distress your plank (if desired).,
Attach screw eye hooks to the ceiling.,
Secure the rope to the shelf and ceiling.",How to Make a Hanging Rope Shelf1," Take a measurement from the ceiling down to the place on the wall where you want the shelf to end. Multiply that number by two, so you can double each piece of rope. Add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number for the knots you’ll make in the rope.For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) tall and you want your shelf to sit five feet (1.5 m) from the floor, you’re designating three feet (91 cm) of space between the ceiling and where the shelf ends. Double three feet (91 cm) and you get six feet (1.8 m); add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number. Thus, you’ll want two pieces of rope that are 7½ feet (2.3 m) each.;
, Cut a piece of paper into a square with one and a half inches (38 mm) on each side. Place the paper on the end of each board and mark a dot at each corner of the paper to indicate where you’ll drill.You can buy a wood plank cut to size at a local home and building supply store, or cut your own.

, For a rustic look, you can leave your plank as is. Alternately, sand your plank by starting with coarse sandpaper and working your way up to fine grade sandpaper, rubbing with (not against) the grain. Paint the plank with any medium compatible with wood. Distress it by using contrasting coats of paint, and wiping the top layer with a damp cloth when it’s almost dry.


For example, you may want to paint the whole board with acrylic paint in a fun accent color, or paint just the edges of the board. Dilute the acrylic paint with water if you want the wood grain to show somewhat., Take note of the distance between the holes you drilled. Using that measurement, lightly mark those places on the ceiling with a pencil. Screw in screw eye hooks into the ceiling where you’ve made markings.If you’re inserting the hooks into drywall or sheet rock, use anchor bolt inserts as well., Pull the rope through the hooks. Adjust the rope so that both sides hang equally. Run the rope through the four holes in your plank. tie an overhand knot in each of the four rope ends underneath the plank.If you want to prevent fraying, place tape around the rope ends before you pull them through the holes.The rope tails don’t have to be even, but if you want them that way you can use shears to even them up.

Cut or purchase equal-sized boards.,
Drill four holes in each board, using a marked paper as a guide.,
Measure where the rope will hang.,
Run the rope through the holes.,
Hang the shelves from screw hooks or picture hangers.",How to Make a Hanging Rope Shelf2," You can buy wooden shelves cut to size at a local home and building supply store, or cut your own (just make sure they’re even). Use two to five boards, depending on how many shelves you want. For example, you may want five boards that are 11” (28 cm) deep and 48” (122 cm) long.You can sand and paint or stain the boards, if desired. For instance, you can use acrylic paint for the boards and the rope. Let it dry before installing.If you’re using thin plywood, you may want to clamp two pieces together for each shelf., Cut a piece of paper into a square three inches (8 cm) on each side. Place the paper on the end of each board and mark a dot at each corner of the paper to indicate where you’ll drill.Practice on scrap wood first, if desired. Use scrap wood underneath the shelves to protect your work surface.
Use a drill bit that is larger than your rope.

, You can hang your rope from ceiling up against the wall, or from the wall itself. Take a measurement from where the hanging hardware will go (such as the ceiling) to where you want the shelves to end (above the ground). Double that number. Then add eighteen inches (45 cm) for each knot. Each length of rope will have one knot under each shelf.


For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) high and you want the shelves to end four feet (1.2 m) from the ground, the shelves will hang in a four-foot (1.2 m) area. Double the number four to get eight feet (2.4 m). If you have five shelves, you’ll need to add 7.5 feet (2.3 m) to each length of rope (18” x 5 = 90”, or 45 cm x 5 =2.3 m). Thus, you’ll want 15.5 feet (4.7 m) for each length of rope.
Knots can take up a lot of room; it’s better to end up with excess rope than not enough. You can trim off any excess later.

, Fold each length of rope in half so that the bent half will be where the rope hangs. Tie a knot below each hole, for each shelf. Make sure to leave the same amount of space between each shelf. Trim and fray the rope ends, if desired, to make tassels.


Screw on cable locks if you want to hang heavy items on your shelves.If your rope is thin, you can twist it together to make larger strands as long as they fit in the holes.

, Knock on the wall or ceiling with your hand or use a stud finder to ensure the best place to hang your shelves. Measure between the width of your holes and mark those places on the wall or ceiling where you started your measurements. Attach screw hooks or picture hangers where you made your markings. Use two hooks, one for each length of rope. Check the weight limit on the type of hooks you use before you start decorating your shelves.If you knock on the ceiling or wall, it should sound solid, not hollow. This indicates there is a wood plank or stud to screw the hardware into, rather than drywall or insulation.

Screw the shelf into place.",How to Make an Adjustable Peg Shelf," A small peg shelf can be made with only a handful of basic components. To make a simple mounted shelf, you’ll need a 2’x3’ wooden panel board (around ½ inch thick), a 8’x6”x1” board, a power drill with 1” hole saw attachment, a few 1” wooden dowels, 1” tube straps, multiple ½” screws, four 4” screws, four wall anchors and a package of washers. You’ll also need a straight edge and a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper, as well as a pencil for marking your measurements.The measurements given in this tutorial will refer to peg shelves made with the specifications given here.
Home improvement stores will sometimes cut wood for you at no additional charge. If you’re unsure of yourself or don’t want to bother with all the measuring and sawing, ask an associate to do it for you.;
, Plot where you want the peg holes to be placed on your shelf. The number, configuration and spacing of the pegs is mostly up to you, though it will be easiest to work in a simple row-and-column pattern. Measure out where each peg will be placed, using a straight edge and a level to confirm that the points are lined up precisely. Trace a pencil line to mark each row and column until you have a grid of intersecting lines.For a simple peg configuration, draw your vertical lines at 4 inches, 12 inches and 20 inches along the 2’ side. Then, mark your horizontal lines at 4 inches, 13.5 inches, 22 ¾ inches and 32 inches down the 3’ side of the board. Make a dot at each intersection.It may help to draw out an initial design for your peg holes on a piece of paper.

, Lay the panel board down on a flat, steady surface. A drill press is ideal; otherwise, place the board on a woodworking desk or outdoor work surface. Take your power drill and attach the 1” hole saw bit (a spade bit will also do the trick). You’ll be using this to drill the holes for the pegs. Drill halfway into the board at each intersection of the grid. Then, flip the board over and finish drilling through from the other side to ensure that each hole is precise and even.You'll achieve the best results using a drill press, which will guarantee that each hole is consistent. If you don’t have access to a drill press, stick with the power drill and hole saw and try to drill the holes at as close to a 90 degree angle as possible., Run a sheet of sandpaper over the outside and along the inner edges of each drill hole. This will remove tiny splinters and wood chips left behind as a result of drilling and clean up the general presentation of the holes. Blow away any dust that has collected around the holes.Use a fine-grit sandpaper to get a smooth, rounded finish.
Raw edges left around the holes could cause cuts or scrapes.

, Take a 1” wooden dowel and use your hand saw to cut it into pieces that are each 7” long. These will serve as the actual pegs for the shelf. Sawing will leave one end sharp and uneven, so be sure to sand down the rough edges when you’re done.Make your cuts precise so that each peg is uniform.
You may have to go through a few dowels in order to fashion enough pegs to fill every hole on the board.

, Grab your 8’x6”1” board. Use your pencil to mark multiple lengths of 12” to 20”, or customize the shelves to your own preferred dimensions. Saw the board into sections at whatever intervals you choose to create small shelves that can be fitted over the pegs for more versatile storage. Sand the sawed edges of each shelf.Cut as many shelves as you want. These can be traded out, repositioned or removed at any time and will be useful for supporting items that can’t be hung from the pegs.

, To complete the removable shelves, you’ll need to have a way to hold them in place. Open up a couple packages of tube straps—each shelf will need 4 straps to secure it. Make sure you align the tube straps the same distance apart that the peg holes on your board are arranged. Use the ½” screws to attach the tube straps to the shelves.If you’re building the standard 2’x3’ shelf outlined here, space the tube straps 8” apart in two columns for the shorter 12” shelves. For the longer 20” shelves, the tube straps should be about 16” apart.
Once the tube straps are in place, the shelves can be slid directly on or off the pegs at any position on the board.

, Lay your panel board flat. Measure 2”—2.5"" in from each corner and mark the spot with your pencil. Drill a screw hole through the board in each corner. This is where the shelf board will be mounted to the wall.It's important for these holes to be even. If they're not, the finished shelf will be lopsided.
Let the ends of the board hang off the edges of a table to prevent drilling into your work surface.

, Line up the panel board in the exact spot you want to hang your shelf. Fit the end of the drill through the holes you already made in the corner to make sure they match up and drill into the wall about 4” deep.


Take care to measure these holes precisely so that the shelf hangs evenly.
Mounting the shelf directly to the wall will offer the most stability. However, if you don’t want to drill holes in your wall, you could also drill shallow holes in the back of the panel board and suspend the shelf from detachable wall hooks., Insert a cylindrical wall anchor into the holes you drilled in the wall. Tap it firmly into place using a hammer, the handle of a screwdriver or some other blunt tool. To mount the shelf, you’ll screw it into the wall anchors, which will make sure that it doesn’t budge.Wall anchors contain threaded grooves designed for screws to fit into. They’ll give the screw something to hold onto once it’s drilled in.Try not to damage the holes you drilled into the wall as you guide the wall anchors in.

, Fit a 4” screw into each hole you drilled in the corners of the panel board. The head of the screw should be flush with the face of the board. Stack washers onto the wall end of the screw until they’re even with the thread. Position the tips of the screws in the openings of the wall anchors, then use your drill to drive them down one by one. It’s as easy as that!Slip the same number of washers onto each screw. The stack of washers will create a little space between the wall and the back of the board so that the pegs will stay in place better once they’re inserted.
Jostle the shelf lightly to test whether it’s been firmly mounted. A wobbly shelf may be the result of misaligned screw holes, a loose wall anchor or insufficient screwing.

Get an engraving tool.,
Choose a metal object to practice on.,
Clean the metal.,
Draw or print a design.,
Transfer the design onto the metal (if necessary).,
Clamp your metal in place.,
Cut into the design.,
Learn more.",How to Engrave1," The best choice for most purposes is a pneumatic graver. This is an affordable tool that fits in the palm of one hand, and uses air to drive the point into the metal. Gravers come with many different shapes of tips, but a square ""V"" cut point is a good versatile option to start with.Alternative tools:Hammer and chisel: Cheap but slow, requires two hands.Dremel with carbide tungsten drill bit: Difficult to control. Use only if you happen to have one, on simple projects.Craft knife or compass point: Difficult to control, only works on soft metals.

, If this is your first engraving project, you might want to stay away from that heirloom watch. Practice on an item that you won't mind damaging. A softer metal such as copper or some brass alloys will be faster and easier to engrave than steel or other hard metals.

, Use a damp cloth to clean the surface of the metal, then a dry cloth to remove the moisture. If the metal is still grimy, scrub it with soapy water, then dry.


If the metal is coated with a protective finish, which is often the case for brass, you do not need to remove it. However, the engraving process will cut through this finish, so you'll need to apply a new finish afterward if you want the metal color to remain consistent., If you are working on a small object, or engraving for the first time, draw or print out a design that has simple, well-spaced lines. Finicky, detailed work is difficult to do without practice, and may end up looking muddled or blurry once engraved. You may be able to draw the design directly on to the metal. If not, draw or print it out at the correct size, then follow the next step to transfer it onto the metal.


If engraving letters, make them as even as possible by drawing them between two straight, parallel lines drawn with a ruler., Follow this step if you want to transfer a design onto the metal; if it is already on the metal, move on to the next step instead. If you cannot find the specialized materials necessary, search online for one of the many other ways to transfer an image. Note that most of these also require some type of specialized equipment.


Add a varnish or shellac to the area you want engraved, waiting until it is mostly dry and slightly tacky.
Draw the design onto polyester film (Mylar) using a soft lead pencil.
Cover the drawing with scotch tape. Rub the tape thoroughly with your fingernail or a burnisher, then carefully lift up the tape. The design is now on the tape.
Stick the tape over the varnished metal. Rub it in with your fingernail in the same way, then remove it., Engraving will be much easier if you use a clamp or vise to prevent the metal from slipping. You may use a handheld clamp that allows you to hold it in one hand with a steadier grip, but be aware that this increases the chance of cuts or scrapes. If you are using a powered tool, or a hammer and chisel that requires two hands, a clamp holding the metal to a table or other stable surface is highly recommended.

, Use your chosen tool to turn the drawing into an engraving, putting pressure on the point at an angle to chip away pieces of metal. For your first attempts, try to keep the end of your tool at the same angle throughout the engraving. Begin by working a straight line in both directions until it is a noticeable, deep cut. Use this as a starting point to move on to the remaining lines. To engrave a line with a complex shape, such as a J, finish the straight portion first. Once this is complete, move on to the more difficult non-carved section., Engraving is an art form that people practice and improve upon their entire lives. If you are interested in new techniques, machine engraving, or practical advice on expanding your set of tools, there are many resources available:


Search for ""engraving forums"" online to find communities of engravers. If you are interested in a specific type, you may be able to find a forum or subforum dedicated to precious metals, steel, or other types of metal engraving.
Find books on engraving. A book on engraving will likely go into more detail than you'll find online. If you're not sure which book to start with, an engraving forum may be a good place to ask.
Study with local engravers. This might mean enrolling in a community college course, or finding a local engraving studio that holds one-time workshops. If you're serious about continuing in the engraving world, consider offering free labor to apprentice with an engraver, or enroll in a one-year engraving program."

Paint the wood (optional).",How to Engrave2," Almost any dremel or router bit will cut through wood. A table router can be set to cut to a constant depth for ease of use, and is recommended for signs and other simple wood engravings. Always wear eye protection when using a rotary tool.


Alternative tools:Handheld wood chisel or graver: Slow but makes angle adjustments easier. Good for experimenting.CNC Machine: A computer-controlled device for extremely complex designs.
, There are many different bits, or burs, which you can attach to the end of your power tool to achieve different types of cuts. A few of the most common include bull nose bits for hollow surfaces; cylinder bits for flat surfaces; and the teardrop-shaped flame bits to give you fine control over the angle.


Additional bit shapes:Pear & Oval: for rounding edges and carving bumpsTaper: to reach crevices and make concave cutsBall: to hollow out an area or create U-shaped gouges
, When engraving wood, the level of detail is only limited by the width of your carving tool, and the precision of your hands. If you aren't comfortable drawing freehand onto the wood, print a pattern on a thin polyester film such as Mylar, and tape it over the wood., Turn on the power tool and gently lower it into the wood. Move it slowly and steadily across the entire design. It takes surprisingly little depth to achieve a three-dimensional appearance, so try starting with a shallow groove, then going over it a second time if you're unsatisfied.

, If you'd like to make the engraving stand out more, try painting the cut area. Paint the original, flat surface a different color to make it stand out. Paint, or a transparent wood finish, will also help protect your wood from wear and tear.

, You'll need a flat, open work space to work efficiently. Your work bench/table should also be sturdy so it doesn't wobble during your shelf construction. Remove any obstacles or potential tripping hazards, like unused equipment and electrical cords.


If you plan on painting or staining your shelf, you should do so in a well ventilated area. Choosing a well ventilated place, like an open garage, for your work area will prevent you having to relocate later when painting or staining.
As part of your preparation, you may want to cut your boards down to size. The width of your shelf is customizable to your needs, so long as all boards are cut to the same length., By using a drill bit slightly smaller than the width of your screws, you can drill ""pilot holes"" to guide your screws and prevent splitting in the wood. For an 8-foot shelf:


Measure and mark four holes at regular intervals along the face of both long, thin sides of a 1x4, with each hole a quarter inch (6.35 mm) from the bottom edge. Then, drill a shallow pilot hole at each mark.
Position your undrilled 1x4 so it stands upright on its long, narrow edge. A quarter inch (6.35 mm) inward from the bottom of the long, narrow edge, measure, mark, and drill four more holes at the same increments as your first 1x4.
Position your 1x2 so it stands upright on its long, narrow edge. A quarter inch (6.35 mm) inward from the bottom of the long, narrow edge, measure, mark, and drill four more holes at the same increments as your 1x4s., Pocket holes are drilled into a flat surface on an angle so the fastener, in this case a screw, passes through a board to emerge at a 90° angle (forming an L shape) with a flat face of the board. This kind of hole will be a less noticeable way of connecting the 1x4 back and the 1x2 lip of your shelf to the 1x4 base of the shelf. First:


Measure and mark four pocket holes at regular intervals along both long sides of a 1x4 so that each hole is ½"" (1.27 cm) from the edge.
Adjust your pocket hole jig so the hole you drill emerges at a 90° angle (forming an L shape) to the face of the long, narrow side, and is ¼"" (.64 cm) from the bottom edge.
Use a pocket hole jig to drill holes at the marks on your 1x4 so the screws emerge at a 90° angle (forming an L shape) to the face of the long, narrow sides of the 1x4.
The 1x4 with holes in the long, narrow faces will form the base of your shelf. At the holes, your other 1x4 will attach to the back as a mount, and the 1x2 to the front as a lip., Lay flat the 1x4 with holes drilled along the middle of both faces of its long, narrow sides so that the holes of both sides are accessible, with a quarter inch (6.35 mm) of wood separating each hole from your work surface. Orient your second 1x4 so it stands on the long, narrow edge where you've drilled holes. Then:


Line up the 1x4s evenly so that an L shape is formed between the flat and upright boards. The pilot holes, having been drilled at the same increments, should also align.
Take a screw and place it onto the screw bit of your drill. Push the screw lightly into the pilot hole, so the tip sinks into the wood and steadies the screw.
With your free hand, realign the boards, if necessary, so that both are even, then hold the boards firmly to prevent them from slipping while screwing.
Hold the drill at a 90° angle to the board so it forms an L shape, apply moderate pressure to the drill, and slowly press the drill's button until the screw is flat against the board and fastens both boards together. Repeat this for each of the four holes., Take your 1x2 and stand it on the long, narrow edge along which you drilled holes. Align it with your flat 1x4 so that the ends are even. The holes drilled in both the 1x2 and 1x4 should align, and the 1x2 and 1x4 should form an L shape. Then:


Place a screw onto your drill bit and push the tip of the screw lightly into a pilot hole on your 1x2. Make sure both boards are aligned with your free hand, then use that hand to hold the boards together firmly.
Hold your drill at a 90° angle to the board so it forms an L shape, apply moderate pressure to the drill, and slowly press the button until the head of the screw is flat with the wood and fastens the two boards together. Repeat this for all four holes., Your shelf is all put together, but you may want to add some paint or staining to give your shelf a nice, finished look. One of the benefits of building your own shelf is that you can choose a color or stain that matches your home decor.


Even if you don't consider yourself much of an artist, you can make simple spray paint stencils and use these to create cool designs on your shelf., For the safest installation of your shelf, you should find stud(s) in the wall where you plan to hang your shelf. Studs will be more stable and prevent your shelf from pulling free of the wall. Then:


Measure and mark where on the wall's stud(s) you will attach the back of your shelf (the upright 1x4). For an 8-foot shelf, you should have two opposite side stud anchors (one on the right of the shelf, one on the left, for example). Each anchor should have two to four screws connecting the back of the shelf and wall.
You should always check the levelness of your shelf with a carpenter's level before screwing in any screws.
Hanging a shelf incorrectly can result in an unsightly slant. Having a second set of hands to help can prevent these kind of errors."

Use a window that has special meaning.,
Shop for an old window.,
Purchase a new window pane and make it look like new.",How to Create a Hanging Picture Frame from an Old Window1," If you've inherited a piece of family history or carried something special from your past, use that window as your display.


Make sure your vintage piece is able to be hung or displayed. While it may hold sentimental value you want to make sure the piece is functional. Check for cracks in the glass or issues with the pane itself.
Consider if the window needs to be restored. Your vintage window may be charming the way it is but may need some restoration. Think about what may need to be done and what is needed to restore it.;
, Hit garage sales, estate sales or second hand stores to find that perfect window.


Visit a “going out of business” sale. Retailers or restaurants may be selling everything at a very good price, including pieces like window panes.
Check out foreclosure sales. Sometimes the lender or bank may be interested in unloading old appliances or pieces of a home that is no longer needed.

, Just because you don’t have access to a vintage “stumble upon” window doesn't mean you can’t complete the project. Hit the home improvement stores to uncover a variety of possibilities.

Experiment with your approach.,
Add ink to the woodcut.,
Transfer your design onto paper.,
Clean your tools.",How to Engrave3," There are a variety of unpowered, handheld engraving tools you can use. To make detailed pictures, such as you might see in a 19th-century book, select two or three tools for different effects. Here are three common types of traditional, handheld engraving tools:Spitstickers are used to carve fluid lines.

Gravers produce lines that swell or shrink as you cut, depending on changes in the tool's angle.

Scorpers, with round or square tips, gouge out large areas of the wood to produce white space in the printed image. This tool is probably not necessary if you are not printing.

, Take a bottle of black pen ink, and use a brush or a cloth to barely cover a flat, wooden block.This will make the areas you've already cut stand out, so it's important not to use so much ink that it soaks down below the surface.

, Let the ink dry completely. Once it has, check whether there is a rough ""nap"" to the wood. If there is, remove it by burnishing firmly with a paper towel., A small, leather sandbag makes an excellent support for the wood, providing a firm backing regardless of the direction you push.Clamping the wood to a table is not recommended, since you'll need to move the block around as you engrave.

, Hold the tool as you would a computer mouse, with your hand lightly cupped around the handle. Press against one side of the metal stem with your index finger, and press the other side with your thumb. Let the heel of the handle rest in your cupped palm; when engraving, you'll push against the heel to provide pressure.

, Press the tool into the wood at a shallow angle to engrave. Use your other hand to turn the wooden block slowly as you push forward with the tool. Cut no more than 1 centimeter (less than ½ inch) at a time before adjusting the position of your hand. It will likely take some practice before you can cut smoothly.


If the tool quickly embeds itself and halt, the angle is probably too steep.""Graver"" tools can be gradually moved to a steeper or shallower angle to widen or narrow the line drawn. This can take some practice to use correctly, but it is an excellent skill to develop for wood engraving.

, One way to start a woodcut is to cut the outline of the image first, making it slightly too large so you can refine the details with a smaller tool.There are many stylized forms of shading, but a series of small, mostly parallel lines in an overlapping ""falling rain"" pattern often creates the most natural effect., Once the wood is cut, you'll be able to transfer the image onto paper as many times as you like. Purchase a tube of oil-based black relief printing ink for this purpose. Squeeze a tiny amount onto the flat, curved portion of the wood, and use a hand roller, or ""brayer,"" to spread a fine layer over the entire surface. Add more ink if necessary, and keep rolling with even pressure until the surface is smooth., Lay a sheet of paper over the wet block, taking care not to move it once it comes into contact with the ink. Rub over the back of the paper using a burnisher tool, or any smooth, flat object. Lift the paper once it has been rubbed, and you should have a print of your image. Repeat this as many times as necessary, rolling out additional ink whenever the block dries out.


If the burnisher is not sliding easily, rubbing it against your hair may provide just enough oil to help, without staining the paper.Look for a ""burnisher printing tool,"" since there are tools used in other professions also called burnishers.

, After a printing session, wipe away ink from the woodcut and tools using mineral spirits (white spirit) or vegetable oil and a clean rag.Store your woodcut for later use, if you plan to print it again.

Decorate your 1x2 boards, if desired.,
Assemble your 1x2 frame.,
Attach your picture frame to your 1x2 frame.,
Fasten wall hangers to the 1x2 frame.,
Install your shelf and show off your pictures.",How to Build a DIY Picture Frame Shelf2," This simple shelf is made from a picture frame. You can often find suitable, inexpensive frames at thrift and secondhand stores. Prioritize thick frames, as these will better hide the wooden 1x2 ledge you'll adding behind the frame. Including these, you'll also need:1x2 boards (equal in length to the outside perimeter of your frame; thinner boards can be used for thinner frames)
2-inch screws
Drill
Glue
Level
Picture frame
Saw
Wall anchors (x2)

, You're going to need to cut your 1x2 boards to the dimension of your picture frame, so you'll want to choose a work area where you can easily clean up sawdust, like a place with a hard floor. You'll also want a wide, sturdy, flat work surface, and a surrounding area clear of obstacles and tripping hazards.


If you don't have a hard floored work area available to you, you can cut down on cleanup by making a backyard work bench. Lay a wide, flat board between two saw horses on a flat stretch of ground and you're good to go.

, Your 1x2 boards will follow the entire perimeter of the back of your picture frame, creating a ledge on which you can place your pictures. However, your 1x2 frame should be slightly smaller than the outer perimeter of the picture frame, but bigger than its inner perimeter. Cut your boards to the dimensions of your picture frame using your saw.


Since you have chosen a thick frame, the outer perimeter around the outside of the frame will be larger than the inner perimeter on its inside.
A 1x2 frame smaller than the outer perimeter but larger than the inner will allow part of the frame to extend beyond the 1x2 frame, hiding it, while the inner perimeter will extend beyond the frame on the inside to create a lip., The unpainted wood of your 1x2 frame can be made more appealing many ways. For example, you might add a coat of paint the same color as the wall on which you plan to hang your shelf, or you could stain the wood.


It'll be easiest to paint your 1x2 boards before they're assembled into a frame or attached to your picture frame.
When painting and staining, follow the label directions carefully. Different brands may have special procedures or techniques to improve the outcome.
Allow sufficient time for your decorations to dry before putting together your 1x2 boards into a frame.
Paint and staining can give off harmful fumes. Work in a well ventilated area when doing either to prevent the injury or death., Lay out your now cut 1x2 boards so each board corresponds to and forms a similar shape to your picture frame. Use your drill to connect each board to its neighbor with at least two screws.


Before you fasten together any boards with screws, take your picture frame and place it atop your 1x2 frame. If the width of the picture frame extends beyond the 1x2 frame inside and out all around, your 1x2 frame has been cut correctly., Depending on the kind of picture frame you've chosen for this project, the glue you use to fasten your picture and 1x2 frames together may vary. Lay your 1x2 frame so it stands on its long, narrow edges and:


Apply your glue to the entire upward face of the long, narrow edges. In most cases, your picture frame will be wood, and a general purpose wood glue will be most effective.
Carefully lower the back of your frame onto the adhesive so the inside and outside perimeters of the frame extend beyond your 1x2 frame. The long edges of both frames should be parallel.
Follow the instructions on your glue to determine the length of time you'll need to wait until it is dry. Working on your frame before it has dried could cause it to fall apart., Because of the way the wood is positioned, it may be difficult for you to hang your picture frame shelf without wall hangers. These should be screwed into place on the back of the 1x2 frame, in the upper left and right corners., For most medium sized frames, you should only need a single stud to mount your shelf sturdily to the wall. Large to very large frames might best be supported by two studs. Measure and mark where on the wall's stud(s) you plan to hang your shelf, then:


Align your wall hangers with the marks you've made to indicate the placement of your shelf on the wall. Check the shelf with a level and adjust it until it is perfectly flat.
Use your drill to fasten the first wall hanger to the wall with a screw. Re-check the levelness of the shelf, and then fasten the final wall hanger with a screw."

Gather your supplies and equipment.,
Ready your work area.,
Draw a notch-line on your pine board.,
Chisel out the notch.,
Sand the board.,
Prepare the leather straps.,
Attach the leather straps and shelf to the wall.",How to Build a DIY Picture Frame Shelf3," Using a single pine board, you're going to make a simple shelf hanging from leather straps. The board can be as long or short as you like, though for the purposes of providing a guided example, a length of 12"" (30.5 cm) is used. All said, you'll need:


Chisel (approximately ¼"" (.64 cm) wide)
Clamps
Hammer & nails
Leather punch
Leather strap (x2; each 20"" (50.8 cm) long)
Level
Pencil
Pine board (1-1/8″ (2.86 cm) thick, 12"" (30.5 cm) long)
Ruler/tape measure
Sandpaper (optional; recommended)
Saw (optional), You'll need a flat, stable surface to work efficiently and safely. Clear any obstacles or tripping hazards, like electrical cords and unused equipment, out of the way.


You may want to work somewhere with hard floor, like your garage, where it'll be easy to clean up wood dust and shavings.

, Lay your board flat on its long, wide face. With your pencil and ruler, measure and mark a line a ¼"" (.64 cm) in from one of the long edges so the line extends completely from one end of the board to the other.


This line is where you will remove some wood to create a notch in which your pictures will be held., Clamp your wood to your work surface so the wood is firmly held in place. Take your chisel and place it on your notch-line. There should be at least ¼"" (.64) of wood between the edge of your notch and the edge of the board. Then:


Angle the chisel low with respect to the board, with the slanted part of the chisel facing up. Slowly and carefully tap your chisel with a hammer to remove shavings and form your notch.
Follow your notch-line with your chisel and hammer from end to end, longways, to create a shallow notch. Generally, your notch doesn't have to be very deep to effectively hold your pictures in place.
If you plan on putting unframed pictures on this shelf, you'll only need a very thin notch that's not very deep. Pictures with thick frames will require thicker notches.
If you are a little more familiar with woodworking and have the tool available, you may find it quicker and easier to use a wood router to cut your notch.
In some cases, if the frame of a picture is too large, it may not fit easily or stably on this kind of shelf., After chiseling out the notch in your board, you may have burs, splinters, or rough spots that remain in the wood. This can give your wood an unfinished look. Run a medium (60 - 100) grit sandpaper over your notch until it's smooth., If necessary, cut your strap material so you have two straps each measuring 20"" (50.8 cm). Use a leather punch to create holes in both ends of both strips. A nail will fasten the ends of each strap to the wall.


Depending on your home and space restrictions, you may want a low hanging shelf, or you may want one that doesn't hang much at all., It's always safest and most reliable to hang things on studs, but this small shelf will likely hang on most sturdy walls without causing damage even without a stud. To attach your hanging shelf:


Mark and measure two points about 10"" (25.4 cm) apart, where each strap will attach to the wall. Use a level to make sure the line between the marks is flat.
Slide a nail through both punched holes of each leather strap so the strap forms a closed loop. Then use your hammer to hang the strap at the first mark on your wall, then do the same with the second strap.
Slide your wooden board, notched side facing up, into the loops formed by your leather straps. Slot pictures into the notch and enjoy your handiwork."

Select your artwork/photos based on where you plan to hang the window and the window style.,
Determine if you plan to enhance the photos.",How to Create a Hanging Picture Frame from an Old Window2,"


Consider the overall theme with the project. Do you hope to display photos your child through the years or focus on a recent trip overseas? Know the photo theme and how it plays on the window style.
Take the room into consideration. You may not want to hang intimate family portraits in the living room so consider the location destination.

, You may not want just straight photos but instead something with more of an edge.


Try black and white photos for extra drama. Or you can add a splash of color on the black and white photos for a color pop.
Use a computer photo program to change or enhance the photos. Try creating a watercolor look or a pencil drawing from your photos for your project.
Alternate between color and black and white photos. Some photos in your window could be color whereas others could still be black and white-there are no hard and fast rules so tap into your creativity and have fun.

Finished.

",How to Create a Hanging Picture Frame from an Old Window3," You may want to give the photos the look of “floating” so you may want to size them smaller than the pane or you may want to fill the pane.

, If you plan to add a border, make sure the design not only compliments the picture but also the window frame.

, One way to mount the photos is to spray the edges with spray mount and affix to the glass. Or you can lay the photo down on the glass and use invisible tape to secure it to the glass.

, You most likely do not have a backing to your window so think about if a back support is necessary. If so, use heavy cardboard cut to size. Add sliding hooks to each side of the wood on the window frame and rotate in place after the cardboard has been put in place.

, Remember, this window frame will be extremely heavy so you must use a kit design for industrial hanging. Follow the directions on the kit and consider using up to three hangers to fully secure the frame.

Obtain sheet metal.,
Measure your cuts and bends.,
Cut the squares out.,
Bend the top edges over.,
Hammer the lip down.,
Bend the walls up.,
Secure the corners.,
Attach the corner securing plates.",How to Build a Box1," You’ll want metal that’s thick enough to make for a sturdy box, but thin enough to bend. Duct metal is a good material. You’ll want to start with a rectangular piece.;
, Layout line on your sheet metal to designate where you will be cutting and bending. You will be bending the four sides up to make the walls, so measure out equal lines parallel to the edges. These lines will mark where the walls are bent.


You will also be bending over the top of each wall to hide the sharp edge. Draw a parallel line a short distance down from each of the edges.






Mark out equal squares on each corner of the rectangle. This square may already be present because of the bending lines that you drew earlier. This square will be cut out to create flaps that become the sides of the box.

, Clamp the sheet metal to the workbench so that it doesn’t shake or vibrate during the cutting. Use a jigsaw or other metal saw and work slowly to ensure that you are cutting straight lines.

, Once all of the squares are cut out, you’ll be left with the four flaps. You’ll be bending over the edges of these flaps to make smooth edges for the top of the box. Insert the first edge into a bending brake. Make sure that it is lined up with the line you measured earlier. Bend the edge 90°. This will create a lip.


If you don’t have a bending brake, lay the sheet on the edge of a table and place a piece of wood on top. Clamp the wood to the table as tight as possible. The piece of wood will act as the brace of the bending brake, allowing you to bend the metal by hand or with a mallet.







, Continue the folding process by hammering the lip down so that it is flush with the flap. Repeat this process on all four flaps.

, Now that the tops of the walls are finished, it’s time to start raising them. Insert one flap into the bending brake, lining up the bending line you measured earlier. Bend the wall up at a 90° angle. Repeat this process for each wall.

, At this point, you box should look almost complete. The four walls should all be up, and the top edges all folded over. Now you will need to secure the corners with smaller pieces of metal.

Measure the height of the box. Cut four strips of metal, each long enough to reach from the bottom to the top of the box, and wide enough to be bent in half and secured (usually about an inch or so on each side, so 2-3 inches total width).






Insert each strip lengthwise into the bending brake, with half in and half out. Bend each strip lengthwise at 90°







, Once they’ve been bent, place a corner securing plate onto the corner of the box, and drill holes through the plate and the box. Place tow holes on each side of the fold, at the top and the bottom. Insert rivets into each of the holes. Use a ball-peen hammer or rivet gun to set the rivets.


Once all the rivets are set, the box is complete.

Prepare the corners.,
Lay out a long piece of packing tape.,
Glue the bottom to one of the walls.,
Apply glue to the corners.,
Roll up the walls.,
Add a lid.,
Decorate the box.",How to Build a Box2," You will need to make sure that all of your wall pieces are the same height. The opposite walls need to be the same length. You will also need a bottom piece that will fit inside of the finished box.

, At the ends of each of the wall piece, cut a 45° angle out from the inside of each edge. These 45° angles will meet and create flush corners with no grain showing.


Use a miter box to create exact angles. This will make for seamless joints. Make sure that when you cut the 45° angle that you do not affect the overall length of the wall pieces.

, Place each wall piece end to end on the tape so that the edges are touching. The pieces are laid out as if the box walls have been “unrolled”.

, Let the glue set and keep pressure applied by using a clamp. Once the glue is set, apply glue to the rest of the exposed edges of the bottom piece.

, Apply a strong wood glue to the 45° wall corners. Score the edges with a file before applying glue to improve the strength of the bond.

, With the tape still attached, roll the walls up so that the 45° angles fit into each other. If it was measured correctly, the bottom piece should fit snugly into the wall pieces. Clamp the sides and let the glue set.

, You can create a simple lid by measuring a piece of wood that extends an out beyond the edge of the box. Glue small pieces of wood around the edge of the new piece to keep the lid from falling off.

, You can sand the edges down if you’d like them to be more curved. Paint the box to your liking.

Nail or staple the top and bottom of the shelf to the frame.",How to Build Suspended Corner Shelves1," Measure the two walls where the corner shelves will fit with a tape measure. Keep in mind that you'll want both of your shelves to be the same size on each wall. For the purpose of this shelf, we'll be creating a shelf with a 23-inch (58.42 cm) face. Measure from the corner of the wall to the space where you want your bookshelf to hang., Lay your board on the thin edge. On one end of a 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board cut a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. Once you've made one cut, measure 23 inches (58.42 cm) down the board and mark an X. Cut another 45-degree angle, pointing outward, on the end of your board at the X that you drew. This piece of wood will become the face of your shelf.


Each end of your 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board should be cut at a 45 degree angle.
Read the instruction manual for your miter saw and remember to keep your hands away from the blade.
Wear goggles and a face mask when cutting wood.
This board will act as a pattern that will help you build the rest of your shelves., Lay the 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) measuring wood diagonally on the surface of a piece of plywood. Flush the edges of your board to each side of the plywood. This should look like you are laying the wooden board over the corner of the plywood and creating a triangle. Draw a line straight across the plywood, using the board as your stencil. This will create what will be the top shelf., Repeat the process that you just did, but this time on a thinner, 1/4-inch (0.63 cm), piece of plywood. Lay the 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board that you cut previously over this piece of plywood and use a pencil to draw a straight line to create a triangle. This piece of wood will act as the bottom of your shelf.

, Cut each piece of your plywood with a circular saw. Each of these pieces of plywood should be equal in size because you used the same piece of 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board as a stencil to draw your cutting line.

, Lay the triangle piece that you created with plywood over the piece of 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) wood that's laid out on its thin edge. Use a pencil to outline the triangle and make two diagonal lines on both ends of your 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) wooden board. Marking this line with a pencil will create lines for your cuts.Doing this will give you the exact dimensions of your frame without having to re-measure.

, Cut the 45-degree angles to create the frame for your shelves on the 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) piece of wood. This piece of wood will be the front of your frame.

, Take the excess board that you cut away from your 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) board and line it up on the 45-degree angle of your freshly cut board. The boards should fit together flush on a the 45 degree angle that you cut. It should look like two sides of a triangle.

, Lay the plywood triangle over the 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) piece of wood and use it to create another line on the excess piece that you just created. This piece should be longer than your other piece, and the excess will need to be removed. Draw a straight line where the plywood meets the wood, so that top of the shelf will run flush with your frame., Using the circular saw again, cut the line that you just created on the 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) piece of excess wood. This cut will be a straight line, at the bottom of the triangle, rather than a 45-degree angle.

, To get the proper length of the last piece of your frame, line up all three of the pieces of 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) board. Lay your plywood over the frame again and make a mark on the last piece of 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) wood, using the plywood as a stencil. Take a tape measure, and measure 3/4 of an inch (1.905 cm) in from that mark and draw a straight line across to make the final piece of the frame shorter.Cutting the last part of the frame 3/4 of an inch (1.905 cm) shorter will allow all pieces of your frame to line up.

, Line up the three sides of your frame and drive nails into all three corners of the frame. The nail should be driven through two sides of the triangle each time. Make sure that the nails connect each piece of the wooden frame together, securely.

, Use the original 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) piece of wood that you used for a stencil to fit over the front of your corner shelf. Use nails or screws on each side of the faceplate to secure it to the rest of your frame made up of 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) pieces of wood ., You can choose to keep your corner shelf the color of the wood that you created it with, or you can paint or stain your corner shelf. If you plan on placing things that can create moisture on your shelves, make sure to seal it to prevent damage to the paint., Line the frame with your corner shelf into the corner of the room. Use nails and drive the parts of the frame that are touching the wall into your wall. You may need to put multiple nails into your frame depending on how much weight you want your corner shelf to be able to support.


If there are studs near the corner of your wall, drive the nails into them instead of the sheetrock.
Use wall anchors and screws to better support your corner shelf if you are using more weight.

, Take the triangular pieces of plywood that you cut previously and set the thicker piece on top of the shelf. Drive nails or screws into the surface of the plywood and into your wooden frame to secure the top of the corner shelf to the frame. Your project is now complete and you can use your corner shelves to store things.

Cut a wooden ladder in half.,
Use a stud finder to find the studs in your wall.,
Measure your walls and cut your ladder to length.,
Screw L brackets into the wall to support the ladder.,
Mount your ladder to the L brackets.,
Screw your ladder into the L brackets.,
Repeat the process with the other half of your ladder.",How to Build Suspended Corner Shelves2," Use a hand saw or circular saw to cut a wooden ladder in half, width-wise, so that you have two halves of a ladder with complete rungs. Each half of the ladder will act as a shelf on both walls and will create a corner shelf., Use an electronic stud finder that you can purchase at most home improvement stores. Slowly go over your wall with the stud finder until the indicator light flashes, indicating the presence of a stud. Find two studs on each of the walls and draw an X. When you are done, you should have four Xs. You'll use the studs to anchor your L brackets.

, Use a measuring tape to determine the width of each of the walls that you want your ladder bookshelf to be on. If your walls are smaller than the length of the ladder, you'll have to cut down each half to accommodate the size of your walls. Use a circular saw to cut down the ladder again to the measurements that you recorded.

, Use screws to screw in the L bracket firmly where you marked the studs. This bracket will be where the bottom of the ladder rests. Use a tape measure to gauge the height of your ladder. Once you get the ladder's height, use a tape measure to draw another X on each of the studs that correspond with the height of the ladder. This will designate where the top L brackets should be screwed in.Once you've screwed in all of your L brackets you should have a total of 4 L brackets on each wall.
Screw in the top L bracket so that the ladder hangs over the L bracket.
Screw in the bottom L bracket so that the ladder rests on top of it.

, Lift one-half of your ladder and place it onto your L brackets. Make sure that the brackets line up with the top and bottom of your ladder. After you mount your ladder to the bottom L brackets, you can work on securing the ladder to the brackets themselves.

, Use screws to screw the wooden ladder to the metal L-brackets on the wall. Use a power drill to drive the screws halfway into the holes of the L brackets and into your wooden ladder. Once all the L brackets have been screwed in half way, use your power drill to tighten the screws and secure the ladder to the wall.

, Hang and drill the other side of the ladder to the other wall in your room. Once you're done securing it to the wall, you'll have completed creating a corner shelf using a wooden ladder.

Add the final touchups.",How to Decorate a Folder or Diary with Wooden Ice Cream Spoons," Choose a diary, scrapbook or a folder with a flat front, as it is easier to work on even surfaces than the uneven ones.

Even if you want to decorate an old diary, just make sure to place it under a heavy pile of books overnight so that it flattens the surface and gives you a perfect area to work on. For an old file, you could simply take the pages out, work on it and put the papers back when you are done decorating it. This way you could even try this DIY on an old, grungy file or diary you want to preserve.;
, Take a spoon and make a slant cut from the bigger part going down towards the smaller part.


It might feel a bit difficult to cut as the spoons are of hard texture but once you get used to it really won’t matter.






Cut around 8 to 10 spoons and keep them aside







,


Make a cut from both sides moving from the circular part towards the “v” part.






This will give you the petals for smaller flowers.







, This will make the body of the butterfly.


Take a spoon and repeat the cutting process, from the centre of the big part making a curve to the end. Do the same for the other side.






For its head, cut the smaller part curving it in the shape of a circle.







, Place the petals to and wings where you want them to be. Cover the empty areas with small flowers.


Once you are satisfied with the layout it’s time to move to the next step.







, Small details like polka dots or lines would definitely make them look more attractive. Even small strokes of shading with two entirely different colours makes them look artistic and exquisite., This may be done in variety of ways. You can either spray-paint it, simply paint it, paste a colourful or a patterned sheet or either use different pieces of colourful sheets to cutout and create clouds, sky, grass, plants, trees, water or literally anything that comes in your mind.

, Now it’s time to paste everything in its place. Put the flower petals (same technique for smaller and bigger ones) in sequence and start pasting them one by one, so that you don’t make a mistake and leave little spaces between them. Do the same with butterflies, first paste the body and head and then finally the wings., After the pasting part is over, it’s only the little sequins that are left to placed. Carefully make a small circle with glue in the centre of the flower and then put the sequins on it quickly, arranging them in a circle accordingly with the glue., After the glue is dry and the sequins are set into their places, it’s time to add some detail-work to the diary. You can use different pens (sparkle, florescent or markers) to make curved lines on the body of the butterfly, or add little antennas and eyes to it also. You can also make some grass details or outline the grass and the clouds, make raindrops or a sun or anything else.

Choose a body style for your guitar.,
Evaluate your options for wood species.,
Pick a color for your guitar.,
Decide on a bridge style.,
Design the fretboard of your guitar.,
Select pickups for your guitar.,
Determine what color the guitar's hardware should be.,
String your guitar.",How to Design Your Own Guitar," Most custom shop guitar builders will offer a small range of available body shapes, some of which are riffs on classic body styles like the Stratocaster and the Les Paul. Choosing a body shape is largely a matter of aesthetic preference, but it will also have an effect on how the guitar sits against your body during play.;
, The wood out of which the guitar's body and neck are constructed has a significant impact on the instrument's tone. Mahogany is the standard for solid body guitars, but alder and ash are popular alternatives that provide a brighter sound. Exotic woods like koa are also available; these woods look especially dramatic when allowed to show through the guitar's finish coat.

, The paint or stain color of your guitar is purely an aesthetic preference. Solid colors tend to be inexpensive, while stains, quilted finishes, and ""burst"" finishes that include a gradient between several colors are more dramatic in appearance. You will also need to decide whether the headstock finish should match the body finish.

, The primary consideration you'll face when choosing a bridge is whether or not to include a tremolo or ""whammy bar."" Another consideration, however, would be the choice between a stop-style tailpiece and a string-through-body tailpiece.

, The fretboard can be made out of many types of wood, with maple, mahogany, and ebony being the most popular. Fret markers or inlays also pose a design consideration. The classic white dots are the most common style of fret markers, but complex and beautiful inlays made from mother of pearl or abalone are attractive alternatives.

, Your selection of pickups will perhaps have the most significant impact on the overall sound of your guitar. Generally, high-output or ""hot"" pickups are preferred in loud, abrasive styles of music like rock, while softer, low-output pickups work well for blues, jazz, and folk. The pickup and bezel color is a matter of aesthetic preference.

, Again, this is an aesthetic matter. Guitar hardware, including the bridge, strap buttons, and tuners, is typically available in chrome, gold, or matte black. Coordinate the hardware finish with your guitar's paint or stain color for a cohesive appearance.

, Finally, choose a set of strings for your custom guitar. Medium-gauge, nickel-wound steel strings are the standard choice, but you can vary your gauge and metal preferences to suit your style of playing.

Choose your materials.,
Create a rough draft drawing of your bridge.,
Draw your final draft.",How to Build a Balsa Wood Bridge1," Before you begin the planning phase of building your bridge, you’ll want to ensure that you have all the materials that you will need.


You’ll need balsa wood for your structure. Before you buy the wood sheets, estimate how large your bridge will be. With these dimensions, overestimate how much wood you’ll need; it’s best to have some extra. Balsa wood is affordable and strong.Look for a medium- to high-density balsa. If you can’t find it in your local hobby store, order it online.
For planning, you will need large-sized 1/8-inch graph paper, a pencil and eraser, and a ruler.
To assemble your balsa bridge, you’ll need sewing pins, a large piece of foam board, a wood cutter, parchment paper, and masking tape.;
, You don’t have to use graph paper for this draft. Draw both the side and top views of your bridge. Feel free to make as many rough drafts as you need to.


There are several types of bridge construction.Think about what you want yours to look like.
Most balsa bridges are types of truss bridges or arch bridges, as the wood lends itself well to this type of construction. Plus, these are two of the simpler types of bridges to engineer.
Truss bridges are type of beam bridge supported by crossing posts above the bridge, and arch bridges are supported by large arches below the roadway of the bridge. Trusses have triangular frames of varying frequencies.Different types of bridges carry loads differently.When thinking about your design, you can build your own based on a type of bridge, e.g. truss or arch, or simply find a template for the type of bridge you want to build online and print this instead of using your drawings.

, After you finish your rough draft and decide what type of bridge to create, use it to make a scaled rough draft.


Draw both the sides of your bridge with the trusses included to scale and the overhead view of your bridge.
You want your drawing to be the actual size that you want your balsa bridge to be, not a scaled-down drawing. It’s fine if it takes up the entire sheet of graph paper.
On the side-view drawing, write in all the measurements for easier cutting.
If you plan to enter your bridge into a competition, like the Science Olympiad, make sure you comply with any competition-specific regulations or dimensions."

Add clear coat or glaze to seal the completely dried piece.,
Finished.

",How to Add a Pop of Color to Wooden Items," This could include a set such as a bowl, large spoon and plate or it could be a piece of furniture.;
, This will ensure that each item is ready to accept paint.

, Run a clean cloth over the wooden item; use a slightly dampened cloth to avoid soaking the wooden piece.


Use light sandpaper to buff out any rough areas of necessary and then smooth over with your cloth.

, For smaller items, keep the design simple. Seek for just a pop of color rather than overwhelming it.


If doing a set, you might like to carry the pattern across each piece, to keep it in theme.

, Use the tape to block off your color design. Keep in mind you will be painting within the tape barriers, so precision is key.


Make painter tape strips narrow or slanted using scissors in order to create a variety of designs.







, Don’t over-saturate your brush with paint; instead, just dab it into the paint and then apply gently to the surface.


Use consistent brush strokes, to ensure that the same amount of paint has been dispensed across the piece.







, Always allow proper drying times in between coats.

, Add at least one coat, possibly two coats of glaze.

Start with a piece of wood that's relatively square and is already as long as the chain that you wish to carve.,
Cut a notch into the length of the wood on each corner of the wood so that the wood's profile becomes a cross instead of a square.

,
Draw the desired shape of each link onto the piece of wood using a lead pencil.,
Begin to rough out the shapes with the knife, following the lines you've marked.,
Refine the shapes of each link, and shape the individual profile of each link.,
Make use of the chain.",How to Whittle a Chain out of Wood," Basswood is recommended and you can get this fairly easily at lots of woodworking supply stores.


You could also use a 2x2 from the lumberyard, but pine wood splits easier than basswood and this will be frustrating until you get more advanced at wood carving art.
You will also need a sharp wood carving knife or a jack knife.;
,, The example shown in this tutorial has a variety of shapes. While you can use any shape that you wish, it is suggested that for your first attempt at whittling a wood chain that it is best to select one shape only to ensure consistency and ease of getting used to the whittling. For example, choose all rectangles or all ovals.

, Carefully hollow out the insides of the links, freeing the links of the chain as you go.

, For the tutorial example, the octagon links have an octagonal profile, the diamond shaped links have diamond shaped profiles, the square links have a square profile, while the round links have a round profile. For your first attempt, it is suggested to keep to using just the round profile.

, You could use the chain as a decoration, a piece of jewelry or perhaps as a baby or pet toy.

Set up a work table.,
Draw or scribe a circle on the work surface.,
Cut blocks of wood 3/4 inches wide and thick, 4 inches long.,
Lay a ring of blocks around the inside of the circle you scribed on your work table.,
Put a drop of quality wood glue (think Tight-Bond 3 or Liquid Nails) on each end of each block.,
Place another layer of blocks on the first, staggering them to center on the joints of the first row, and keeping the edges in line.,
Put a drop of glue on each end of the second row of blocks, and start your third row the same way you started the second row (layer) of blocks.,
Run two or three more rows the same way you ran the previous ones, leaving a block out with each subsequent row.,
Keep adding rows, but allow each row to slide inward from the previous row about 1/3 the width of your block.,
Continue running rows as described earlier until there are only three or four blocks left in the top row.,
Flip the whole thing over, being careful to keep it supported, and lay it flat on your work surface.,
Stand the planter box up, line the bottom with plastic, fill it with potting soil, and add the plant of your choice.

",How to Build a Wooden Block Planter Box," You will need a flat work surface about three feet square, a piece of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood on saw horse will work fine.;
, The planter described in the steps is about 24 inches around, but you can make it smaller or larger if you want. You may need to adjust the size of the blocks you cut (see next step) for radically different sizes.

,  Cedar, juniper, cypress, or other weather resistant woods are good choices, but you can use pine or other softwoods (or hardwoods, although they may split more easily).  Shape them if desired, sanding and rounding the edges, depending on how finished you want the final product to be.

, Place them inside the line, allowing about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) of space between the ends of them.  The exact spacing will probably need tweaking as your complete the circumference of this circle.

, You can work sections if the glue is subject to drying quickly.

,  As you progress around the circle, use a finish nailer with 1 1/8 18 gauge brads to tack the ends of the second layer to the first layer.

, You will not go all the way around this time, stop the row one block back from an end point ( opposite the side you are working from works best).

, You may decide to take a break after a while, to allow the glue between blocks to set so the whole thing will be more stable.

, Here, you will need to be careful with your glue placement at nailing, since overflowing glue or nails that miss the underlying block will have to be cleaned up later.  You should begin to see the edges start to slope inward, forming the bowl of the basket.

, Now, you will need to invert the whole assembly, so prepare some stacks of blocks to support the full round (bottom, but soon to be top of your structure.

, Now, all you have to do is repeat the process you started on the first side.Once each side is symmetrical you are done, let the glue cure before standing the planter box up.

Spread your drawing out on the foam board.,
Cut your balsa wood strips.,
Organize your materials.",How to Build a Balsa Wood Bridge2," For this, you want to use your drawing showing the side of your balsa bridge. This will be your guide for piecing your bridge together.


Use pieces of masking tape to tack down the drawing of the side of your bridge.
Cut a piece of sheer parchment paper larger than the foam board. Tuck its edges around the back of the board and tape them. The parchment paper keeps glue off of your drawing and allows you to use it to create both sides of your bridge.

, You can use the measurements on your drawings or just use the drawings as a template to mark each measurement with a pencil. Cutting your own strips from sheets will save you money.


Use your woodcutter in conjunction with a straight edge.
Make sure to account for all the pieces you’ll need: truss pieces, lateral bracing, and the roadway.

, After you’ve cut all your pieces, organize them into piles based on which part of your bridge they represent.


Make two piles for your sides, separate your lateral bracing pieces, and set aside your roadway.

"
"
Put together each side.,
Glue the two sides to the roadway.,
Add your lateral bracing.,
Remove your bridge from the foam board.",How to Build a Balsa Wood Bridge3," Use the drawing you’ve created, and lay each strip of wood where it needs to be on the drawing.


To keep pieces secure while you lay them out, stick two sewing pins into the foam board at each joint. Cross them over the wood to secure it.
After you’ve completely laid out one side, remove the pins one joint at a time, and glue the strips of wood together with wood glue.
Use the wood glue sparingly. If you want to, you can dilute it slightly with water. As a rule of thumb, if you can see the glue, you’ve put on too much.
The glue will dry in about half an hour. Just before this point, you should take a damp rag, and wipe off any excess glue.
If you have the time, it’s best to leave this side to dry for an additional day or two. After that, remove it from your foam board template, and repeat the process for the other side of the bridge.

, Before you start to glue, pin your roadway to the foam board.


Put a thin line of glue on each edge of the roadway. Push your sides against the roadway. Use straight pins around the edges of the sides to keep them in place while the bridge dries.

, The lateral bracings of the bridge are the cross sections, often forming “X”s, on top of the trusses.While your bridge is still supported by pins around its sides, glue on your lateral braces.
If you need to, you can use clothespins as tiny clamps.
Again, let your bridge dry for as long as possible.

, Now, your bridge is ready for your class or competition.


If you’re testing it with weights, make sure you do wait a full two days for the glue to cure.

Slide in the picture.",How to Build a Picture Frame from Recycled Wood1," The length should be the height and width that you want the picture frame to be. The wood can come from sources such as old frames, old furniture, old wooden items, etc.


If you can't cut wood yourself, have a hardware store do it to your required measurements. You may need to make a token payment for the help.;
, Glue the ends, then place the width sides on top of the longer lengths. Overlap the wood, to make it interesting to look at.

, Glue to the back of the frame on three sides but leave the top edge unstuck. This allows room for you to slide in the picture.

, Personalize the frame with your choice of designs. Suggestions include:

Fill in holes and imperfections on the pine.,
Sand the pine.,
Apply a primer.,
Choose a paint color for the pine.,
Apply a second coat of paint.,
Leave the pine alone for 1 week.",How to Paint Pine," Check for any scratches or scrapes in the wood, and use putty or a wood filler to even out the marks or holes. This will create a smooth surface on the pine. Wood fillers can be found at hardware stores.;
, Use a hand-held sanding pad or an electric sander and rub it over the wood to make the surface smooth and even. This process will prepare pine for painting.


After sanding, make sure the pine surface is smooth. Run a damp cloth over it. This will eliminate any dust or debris that resulted from the sanding step.

, This step is essential before painting because it will provide a treated surface, and will ensure that the paint sticks to the pine. Use a brush to apply primer in the direction of the wood grain. It may look splotchy on the wood, even when applied in consistent strokes. It does not go on uniformly, and it does not have to look perfect at this stage. Leave the primer to dry overnight.

, Use a paint brush to apply the paint over the primer. Using a 2 inch (5.1 cm) paint brush will ensure even results. A medium sized brush will cover the furniture with large strokes of paint while still allowing for attention to detail around smaller parts of the pine. Paint in the direction of the wood grain with smooth, even strokes. Leave the first coat to dry overnight.

, Once that coat dries, apply a third coat to get an even color covering on the pine. Three coats will give the pine a bright, consistent shade.

, To make sure the paint has dried completely, do not use or touch the pine furniture for 1 full week.

",How to Make a Bamboo Wind Chime," If you are lucky, bamboo may already be growing wild in your area, and it is simply a matter of obtaining permission and cutting the bamboo plant to a proper size. If there is no local source, you may be able to purchase a common bamboo pole, used for fishing. You can also often find bamboo poles of varying sizes at garden supply stores.


Make sure your bamboo is thoroughly seasoned and is not split or rotten.

, Each length should be composed of two of the plant's ""sections"", with one end above the partition-like segment end, and the other below it, so you have an open tube to work with.

, This can be done with a very sharp knife, but care must be used, since both the splinters from the bamboo and the knife can impale or cut you. If you have a vice, it might be easier (and less risky) to fix the bamboo in the vice and cut it with a saw, especially if it is quite tough. Taper the last inch (2.5cm) or so off at an angle.

, This will ensure the hollow, concave bamboo ""channel"" will be facing out on each tube when they are assembled.

, In the photos, each piece was about 1 inch in diameter, so the plywood disk is 7 inches (~18cm).

,, The string should be about 48 inches (1.2m) long to begin with; any surplus can be cut off after each tube is tied in place. Heavyweight fishing line can be used for hanging the tubes, as in the photos, but a more flexible string will give better results.

, Continue doing this until each bamboo is hanging under the plywood disk, then tie off the end of your line.

, This is what changes the tone of each bamboo, so you can experiment here until you obtain a pleasant sound with the tonal variation you desire.

, Measure and cut three equal lengths of string, about 30 inches (0.75m) long, and tie them together on one end, allowing a small loop to be formed.

,, Drill three 1/8 inch (3mm) holes spaced equally about the center of this disk, about 3/4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) from the center. Thread the loose ends of your three center strings through these holes, allowing it to hang about 1/4 of the distance down from the top of the bamboo sticks.

, This disk will be the ""hammer"", the striker that produces the sound of your chimes.

, This will catch the wind, causing the hammer to strike the bamboo tubes as the wind makes it sway back and forth. One with a larger area will move more in a lighter breeze. Feel free to experiment with different materials in different sizes and weights.

, Sand and varnish, or paint your chimes if you like.

Decide on the frame size.,
Cut the wood pieces to size.,
Push the wood through a skip planer (or have someone experienced do this for you).,
Form the frame square on a flat surface.,
Apply varnish or shellac to the surface of the frame.,
Glue a thick piece of card to the back, leaving the top section unglued.,
Slide in the picture.",How to Build a Picture Frame from Recycled Wood2," If using wood direct from the pallet, remove pieces for using in the frame. Choose four pieces to form the frame, and ensure that they are all long enough.


Have some spare pieces; these can be added on as extra embellishment or used if you make a mistake with another piece.

, Choose the measurements and use these to guide the sawing of the wood.

, Following the chosen measurements, saw the wood pieces into both the width and length you're after for the frame.

, This will even the sizing of each piece of wood.

, Glue the four pieces together at each intersection where they meet.


Use clip clamps to hold the pieces together tightly. Aim for a very neat and close fit at each corner; the clamps will help apply the needed pressure.
Leave until the glue is fully dried before removing the clamps.

, If you would like to decorate it, do this either instead of varnishing or in addition to.


The frame can also be painted one or more colors; it depends on whether you'd like the natural wood look or you'd like it to be painted.

, The picture will slide in from the top. Add a hanger or a cardboard stand to the back.

, All done!

Gather your supplies and equipment.,
Choose and prepare your work area.,
Vacuum up dust and loose debris on the furniture.,
Wipe away stubborn dirtiness from the furniture.,
Apply the liquid deglosser to the wicker.",How to Paint Wicker1," You may have some of these supplies around your home, but if not you should be able to find them with little difficulty at your local hardware store. You could also check the home improvement section of general retailers, like Target and Walmart. You'll need:


Bucket
Diluted bleach (optional; for removing mildew and mold)
Drop cloth
Dust mask
Liquid deglosser
Mild soap
Primer (acrylic spray on primer)
Rubber gloves (optional; recommended)
Sponge
Spray paint (acrylic)
Stiff bristle brush (optional; recommended)
Vacuum (with dust attachment or crevice tool);
, Outside and away from your home may be the best location for your wicker painting. This way, you don't have to worry about spray paint spreading to items in your home or your home itself. You should also:


Always paint, prime, and stain in a well ventilated area. Fumes can build up in small rooms or in those with poor airflow and become toxic.
Lay down a drop cloth beneath your wicker furniture, even when outside. This will prevent grass, dust, and similar things from getting in the way of or sticking to your paint job.
Choose a location that is out of the wind. Wind can make spray painting more difficult, and could result in it blowing where you don't want it applied., Wicker has a tendency to accumulate dust and dirtiness in between its weaving. Use your vacuum cleaner to suck up all loose dirtiness. A dust or crevice tool on your vacuum can help you better get narrow spots and in between the weavings.


Dust and dirtiness left on your wicker will get in the way of your primer and paint bonding to it. Failing to clean your wicker first could result in a less than desirable finished result.
If your wicker chair is relatively clean, you may only need to give it a quick vacuuming before moving on to priming the wicker., Fill your bucket with warm water and add mild soap to it. The amount of soap you add will depend on the kind of soap you are using. Follow your soap's label directions for the best results. After your soapy water is mixed:


Use your stiff bristle brush to loosen dirt, flaking paint, and so on from the wicker. Use medium force; brushing too hard could damage the wicker.
Take your sponge and dunk it in the warm, soapy water. Use the sponge to clean any caked on dirt, ingrained dust, and so on.
Use a ½ cup of bleach diluted in a quart (.95 L) of warm water, rubber gloves, and a sponge wet with the bleach mixture to remove and cleanse any mildew and mold from your wicker., Allow sufficient time for your wicker to dry before applying your deglosser. The deglosser will remove finish which is often added to wicker to protect it. This finish can interfere with your paint or primer bonding to the wicker.


The best method for applying your deglosser will depend on the brand. Follow your deglosser's instructions for best results.
Generally, you should put on gloves, then wet a clean sponge or rag with the deglosser. Apply a thin layer of it to the chair from top to bottom.
When finished deglossing, allow your chair to dry completely before moving on. If your chair was especially dirty and required heavy cleaning, you may want to let your wicker dry overnight."

Select a source for your crotch cut.,
Cut the tree down with a chainsaw.,
Cut a section of trunk where a crotch occurs, or a fork in two large branches, above and below the fork.,
Stand the section of wood upright, and using a chainsaw again, rip, or split it from top to bottom to create a flat slab.,
Round the slab by making tangent cuts around the circumference of your planned circular bowl shape.,
Allow the wood blank or turning stock to dry.,
Mount your turning stock on the faceplate adapter.,
Mount the faceplate on the lathe headstock, being sure to tighten it securely, for the reason discussed in the previous step.,

Free spin the workpiece one more time, again, making sure all fittings and connections between the lathe headstock and the face plate are turning true and secure, and all tool rest locking devices are tight.

,
Turn on your lathe, beginning at its lowest speed setting, and begin truing the stock.,
Turn the stock to a true cylinder, using a speed of between 450-700 RPMs on the headstock.,
After turning a true cylinder, or at least turning the piece round, since truing isn't necessary for a bowl which will eventually be tapered anyway, move your tool rest to the face of your stock.,
Using a curved scraping knife, and starting at the center, turn the face working outward, taking a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch per pass.,
Realign the tool rest so that it is as close as you are comfortable with to the face of the workpiece, and begin to cut the concave, or inwardly curved surface of your bowl.,
Cut the concave inner surface of the bowl to the rough shape you desire.,
After making the rough concave cut to the approximate depth and shape you are looking for, stop the lathe and inspect the grain of the wood.,
Use a parting knife to remove the center, or core-like middle of the bowl if you have cut around it.,
Relocate the tool rest to the outside circumference of the stock.,
Remember to take a moment to inspect the wood as you turn it, looking for rotten pockets, splintering grain, and other conditions that will affect your finished product.,
Use a finishing, or surfacing knife to clean up the sides of your bowl once you have turned it down to your desired shape.,
Stop the lathe and make a final inspection of the turned bowl.,
Part the bowl from the base of your stock.,

",How to Turn a Crotch Bowl," A crotch, as noted in the introduction, is a fork where a tree trunk either branches in two, or a large limb forks from the main trunk. For this article, a large red oak felled by Hurricane Opal in the year 1994, and another which died from unknown causes were cut on a Florida panhandle farm.;
, In previous times, a two man handsaw, known in the south as a Gator Tail was used for this task, but they involve a lot of work. If you are fortunate, you may find access to a woodlot where storm felled, land clearing operations, or other causes have felled a suitable tree for you.

, Make sure you allow enough wood so that when it is trimmed and shaped, it will be large enough for your bowl.

, Move over, and make another cut parallel to the first, so that you have formed an actual slab of wood from the section you began with. Be sure to allow enough thickness for the depth of your finished bowl, plus an inch or two for anchoring the slab to your lathe headstock.

, Be very careful making these cuts if you use a chainsaw for this step, holding it securely while cutting. A better choice would be to use a bandsaw with a wood cutting blade.

, For green hardwood 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) thick, this may take months, or even years, depending on the moisture content and density of the wood. Black walnut, for example, can take a year for each inch of thickness to season in a climate-stable environment, and trying to speed the process will cause a valuable piece of wood to split, warp, and check.

, This is done by positioning the headstock faceplate on the wood, centering it, and driving wood screws of sufficient length and size to hold the piece while turning. The stock in the photo weighed about 8 pounds at the beginning, and three 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) number 14 wood screws were used to attach it. Because the beginning stock is not true (perfectly cylindrical), it tends to be very badly out of balance, so care should be taken to fasten securely.

, Once it is secured, you can free spin the piece by hand to make sure there is no excessive wobble, and it clears all machine parts.

, Allow room for clearance when you begin turning, but keeping it as close as possible will assure a good, solid rest for your turning knives. Make sure all adjusting bolts are tight, to prevent the tool rest from sliding into the workpiece while you are turning.

,, This first step can be done with your choice of lathe knives, here, the author uses a shaping knife and a gouge, since the oak is seasoned, knotty wood.

, If excessive vibration occurs, run the lathe at its slowest setting until the stock becomes balanced. Often, the density of the stock will vary from one side of the round to the other even after it is turned to a true cylinder, due to differences in the density of the wood. An example would be a piece that is sectioned so that one side is heartwood, the other, sapwood, which is significantly lighter than the heartwood.

, If you slabbed your stock with a chainsaw cutting freehand, the stock will not be flat, or perpendicular to the centerline, so you will need to face it before beginning to cut your concave, or the inside of your bowl.

, When the knife is continually in contact with the face during a revolution, the area you are turning is flat.

, To make removing the tough, gnarly grained wood easier, you can always use a vee gouge or even a parting knife to score the grain before cutting the bulk material with a rounded chisel.

, Remember that you have wood screws in the base that attach the workpiece to the headstock, so leave an inch or so of solid wood between your turning knife and the metal screws.


Note that you can reposition the tool rest parallel to the forming concave cut to maintain good support of your knife. When the knife is allowed to overhang the rest more than an inch or so, it requires greater strength to make the cut, and more force is applied the the blade of the knife. This is simply a matter of leverage working against you.
Keep the knife sharp as you cut. High quality German or Japanese knives will remove a lot of wood before becoming dull, but even the best knife will lose its edge eventually, causing fatigue for the turner, and undue stress on the lathe.

, You may find rotten pockets, splits, or other unforeseen conditions that could cause you to rethink your project. If you are satisfied the grain and wood condition is suitable, you can now begin a finished cut with a rounded chisel. If the wood is sufficiently balanced to allow it, increase your lathe's turning speed to obtain a smoother cut.

, In grainy, tough woods, the center can actually be left until the adjacent wood is removed, and then cut flush at the bottom of the bowl. Take a moment to reinspect the grain and soundness of the inside of your bowl, and make additional shaping cuts if desire.

, Keep it as close as you are comfortable with to the side of the bowl, and begin to taper with a shaping knife. Cutting grooves with a vee gouge again will make removal of the wood quicker, and cause less strain on the lathe motor. Keep the tool rest positioned roughly parallel with the outside circumference of the bowl as you taper it. For a large, tall bowl, you can easily find the rest several inches from the surface you are cutting if you fail to do so. Repositioning the rest may take a little more time and effort, but the results are worth it.

, Keep in mind you are continuously exposing new wood as you turn, so there is no way to predict what you will find.

, Using a fairly high RPM turning speed, and a very light touch with a sharp tool will give a good, smooth finished cut.

, Now is the time to consider any additional cutting or shaping you want to do. When you are sure of the bowl's surface, curves, and dimensions, you can use sandpaper to smooth out the wood. Turn the lathe back on, and beginning with a fairly coarse grit, somewhere around 80-100, and sand the inside and outside surfaces by holding the paper against the wood as it turns. As you achieve the desired result with the coarser grit, move on to a finer grit, between 120-150 grit, or medium. Finally, finish sanding with a 200-240 grit paper, stopping the lathe occasionally to check the finish you are achieving.

, You can use a parting knife for this step, or at least begin a groove where you intend to part it. For a wide-based bowl, you may find that the parting knife begins to bind after you have cut into the base an inch or so deep. To speed the parting process, stop the lathe, and finish the cut with a handsaw.

"
Prime the wicker.,
Touch up drips and runs.,
Spray paint the furniture.",How to Paint Wicker2," Apply at least two coats of primer to your wicker before painting it. When applying primer, use multiple thin layers for a smoother, better looking, more chip resistant finish. Shake your spray primer thoroughly and then apply it by pressing its applicator button. Spray it evenly onto all wicker surfaces, including crevices and in between weavings. Wear a dust mask when priming.


When priming, keep your arm straight and use sweeping, left-to-right motions. Start from the top of the furniture and work your way to its bottom. Keep the spray applicator a few inches away from the wicker.
For most kinds of primer, the benefits you receive from extra coats stops at five coats of primer. Save primer by applying no more than five coats.
Primer is especially important when changing colors, or when covering over dark colors. Be sure to prime in these situations., Because wicker is so contoured, drips, runs, and unevenness in your primer are likely. Use a clean sponge or paintbrush to smooth any drips, runs, or unevenness so your primer coat is smooth throughout.


After touching up, allow your primer to dry completely before adding another coat. The wait time for your primer should be indicated on its can. In most cases you can expect your primer coats to dry fairly quickly. , Shake up your spray paint thoroughly. In the same fashion you applied your primer, you'll also apply your spray paint. In most cases, it is best to paint from top to bottom, though you may want to paint the underside and less visible parts of the furniture before painting its main parts.


Much like primer, multiple thin coats of paint will look better and be more chip resistant. Use at least two thin layers of paint, and no more than five.
After you are finished spray painting each coat, check for drips, runs, and uneven spots in your paint. Use a clean sponge or brush to touch up these so each coat is smooth and even.
Give your first coat sufficient time to dry completely before adding the next one. The paint will likely be dry in a few hours, but wait two days before using the furniture so the paint fully cures."
"
Collect your tools and supplies.,
Coat your painted wicker with wood staining.,
Touch up drips and allow the staining to dry.,
Encourage drying with your hair dryer.",How to Paint Wicker3," You may have many of these supplies already on hand, but anything you're missing can be found at your local hardware store or in the home improvement section of a general retailer. This technique works best with dark colors, like green, brown, and so on. You'll need:


Drop cloth
Dust mask
Hairdryer (that has a ""cool"" setting)
Paintbrush
Paper towel (or clean rags)
Rubber gloves
Safety glasses (or goggles)
Sponge
Stain (walnut colored), But before you do, check your wood staining's label instructions. Always wear gloves, a dust mask, and protective eye wear, like safety glasses or goggles when working with staining.You may also have to mix the staining before using it. Then, take your paint brush and liberally coat the entire surface of your wicker furniture.


Apply your staining in a similar fashion as you would normal liquid primer or paint. Start from the top of the furniture and work your way to its bottom.
Use long, regular, overlapping strokes when applying your staining. This will help you prevent missed spots, and will promote a smooth application.

, Use your brush and paper towel or a clean rag to smooth out any drips, runs, or uneven spots in your staining. Pay close attention to cracks, crevices, and corners, as these are common trouble spots.

, The crevices formed by the weavings of the wicker can result in those nooks and crannies drying slower than others. Set your hairdryer to the ""cool"" setting, plug it in, and use it to blow air into crevices.


While blow drying, the force from the air may cause staining that is still wet to puddle unevenly on the furniture. Use your brush and a paper towel or clean rag to smooth these areas.
When the nooks and crannies of your wicker furniture begin to look dry, switch off your hair dryer and allow the furniture to dry overnight."

,

Measure a section about two inches (five centimeters) long.



 


Cut off that section with a saw.







, Sand off the edges using a fine file. Sanding the edge will make it easier to slide this component., You'll need a large bolt to hold the camera stand assembly in place. In our example, a bolt three inches (7.5 cm) long will work well.,,, These holes will allow you to alter the height of your cam stand. Start with a wooden rod, ideally about 30 inches (76cm) tall.

Fit the acrylic pipe over the wooden rod, and adjust until it is flush with one end.






Mark the wooden rod where it is exposed by the hole in the pipe.






Make additional marks on the rod at 1 inch (2.5cm) intervals from this mark, along the entire length.






Drill holes at these marks, using the same diameter as the bolt.







,, The hole should be at right angles to the bolt hole position.


The camera screw should be able to attach to your camera tripod head.

, This is the most important component, and must be mounted firmly for the camera to stay attached.

Position the base of the camera tightly in the hole you just drilled, with the screw pointing outward.






Fix it in place with a generous amount of gorilla glue or other strong glue that will bond to the acrylic pipe. For best results, let the glue dry overnight.







, If your wooden rod is shorter than 30 inches (76 cm) long, slot it into another length of pipe to raise it to the full recommended height.

",How to Maintain Wood Siding2,", The ideal time for this process is to apply stripper in the evening and scrape paint the following day.

, If the paint is extremely thick, you may have to scrape what will come off and apply more stripper in the same manner, followed by another scraping session.

, Sand the bare wood to provide a slightly rough surface to which the primer will better adhere.

, Dip a paintbrush into the primer, and then use it to prime over heads of nails and knots in the wood. This will add an extra bit of primer to more noticeable areas. Allow this primer to dry

, Apply an even, drip-free coat of primer, using long brush strokes. Make sure primer covers all wood surfaces, including cracks and the areas on which siding butts up to trim pieces. Allow adequate drying time, based on the primer manufacturer's recommendations.

Decide if your project is right for normal white glue.,
Purchase a white, polyvinyl acetate glue that is not meant for children’s use.,
Apply the white glue to the edge or joint of your piece with a small paintbrush.,
Affix the joint or wood pieces together on a worktable or craft surface.,
Place the wood between two scrap pieces of wood.,
Use screw clamps, C-clamps or spring clamps.,
Screw the clamps into place and allow excess glue to press out of the areas where the wood pieces meet.,
Clamp for at least two hours, but give most projects overnight to cure.

",How to Glue Wood Together1," White glue is best for indoor projects that have a low to moderate amount of wear. White glue is also preferred for smaller craft projects rather than furniture.


If your wood project will be used regularly or is large, move on to the next method, using yellow carpenter’s glue.;
, Children’s glues are usually watered down for safety.

, Be sure to apply it to one side of the entire edge that will be glued.

, Placing it near the edge of your table will make it easier to clamp.

, Cover these scrap pieces in contact paper or tape to keep them from sticking to your wood.

, Screw clamps are best with larger projects.

, Resist the temptation to wipe it up with a wet cloth, since it can dilute the glue. Instead wipe it with a dry cloth or sand it off later.

, Then, brush it to the edges with a paintbrush.

, Make sure they are aligned.

, Set cauls, or wood pieces, covered in packing tape on top of the wood pieces. Then, clamp them down with screw clamps.


If possible do this on each side., Alternate putting the clamps below the wood piece and above it to ensure an even adhesion.

, If there isn’t, it means one of your bar clamps is likely tighter than the others.

, Then, remove it with a utility knife blade. When the project is unclamped, it will be easy to sand off.

, It sets quickly at warmer temperatures, but can be used at 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2 Celsius).

Determine if your project will have contact with water.,
Use a similar method when gluing outdoor and indoor projects together.,
Set up your workstation in a warm area.,
Mix the glue together just before you glue the wood.,
Apply it to the joints and clamp.,
Wipe up excess with a dry cloth.",How to Glue Wood Together3," If so, you will need to use resorcinol formaldehyde glue to ensure adhesion. It can be used on doors, windows and even aquatic equipment.


Keep in mind that waterproof wood glue is significantly more expensive that yellow or white glue.

, You will need bar clamps, screw clamps and cauls to ensure good adhesion.

, The glue needs a warm environment to activate.

, Blend the resin and the catalyst according to package directions.

Sand the project you have made from maple wood using progressively fine sandpaper of 120 to 320 grit.,
Choose a type of stain within your skill set as it can be a challenge for the beginner.,
Brush on a commercially available sanding sealer to seal in the color before you begin to apply the final finish.,
Finish the project with a coat of polyurethane varnish applied by hand with a cloth for a satin look or by brush for a higher gloss look.,
Complete the finish by using a ""0000"" steel wool pad to apply multiple coats of tinted carnauba paste wax.",How to Finish Maple," Finishing this tight will help close up the pores of the wood in preparation for staining.


When sanding is complete, wipe down the entire maple project with a lint-free cloth. This removes dust that was left over from the sanding.;
, The easiest type of stain to use is a gel.


Wearing protective gloves, begin wiping the stain onto the surface of the maple. You need to work on small areas, one at a time. Allow the stain to sit for a few minutes and then wipe it, allowing the stain to dry. Repeat the process until you have achieved the color you want.
Rub the item down with 320 grit sandpaper between coats and on the final coat of stain. Be careful that you do not sand the corners and remove the stain you have applied.

,


Use a ""0000"" steel wood pad between coats and when applying the final seal coat.

Choose your piece of furniture.,
Decide if you want to sand the piece or not.,
Prime the piece of furniture before you paint.,
Paint the furniture a light color.,
Mix a cup of glaze.,
Dip a foam paintbrush into the glaze.,
Wipe the glaze off with a damp discarded rag or baby wipes.,
Continue glazing the furniture in one-foot areas.,
Spray a clear poly coat sealer to seal in the glaze.",How to Glaze1," Glazing is best done on antique looking pieces with nicks, carving or other details, rather than flat, modern pieces.;
, Sanding will even out the piece of furniture and prep it for painting. However, it can also remove some of the distressed portions that give the glazing character.


If you do plan to sand, use 120-grit sandpaper. You don’t want the sandpaper to be too coarse.

, This will create a durable base coat for the furniture. You can purchase primer in a spray can or in liquid, paint-like form., You will want to choose white, ivory, tan, blue or another light color. The glaze will always be darker, so you will need to ensure it will show up on your piece of furniture.


You can use paint or spray paint from your local hardware store. Keep in mind that the more you plan to use the piece of furniture, the more coats of primer and paint you should use.
Allow the paint to cure overnight after you apply the last coat., There are two ways to do this: ask the hardware store to mix it with your favorite paint color or do it yourself. Choose a dark color, such as black, brown, dark red or dark blue, to color your glaze.


To mix the glaze yourself, grab a yogurt container or plastic cup. Pour one cup of opaque glaze into the cup. Then, add several squirts or one tablespoon of your dark paint. Mix with a chopstick or paint stirrer.Add more paint as needed to achieve a dark color. This is the color that will remain in the molding or crevices on your furniture.

, Apply it to one leg or portion of the furniture. Work in no more than one-foot sections at a time, so that you can complete the section before the glaze dries.


The advantage of using glaze instead of paint is that glaze takes longer to dry than paint, so you can create the look you want without risk of it drying before you perfect it. You have about 10 to 20 minutes to work on one area.Work the glaze into the crevices and carving. Spend plenty of time getting it into these areas, because that is where the glaze will remain when you wipe the rest of it off the furniture.

, Use the rag method if you want a “dirtier” look or you want to use more glaze, because it will be harder to wipe off to the original base color. Use baby wipes if you want to remove as much glaze from the top of the furniture.


Wipe in clean, straight strokes. Don’t get the rag or wipe into the crevices, because you want the glaze to remain in these areas.
Try to get the glaze off the surface of the furniture. Then, replace your rag or wipe with another when it becomes too covered with glaze to wipe off completely.

, When you have completed the entire piece of furniture, let it sit overnight. Reassess the piece to see if you need to apply more glaze for darker accents.


You can apply a second coat of glaze in exactly the same way you did the first coat. The more coats of glaze you apply, the more dramatic the carving and crannies will look.
You can do the whole top, side or back of a piece at once. The more detailed the piece of furniture is, the more you will need to break the work down into smaller areas.

, Apply two coats to ensure it is durable.

Remove the doors of your cabinets.,
Paint your cabinets with a light color of paint or stain.,
Mix your glaze.,
Place a cabinet door on your worktable.,
Wipe a damp rag across the surface of the wood.,
Move onto the next detail you want to glaze.,
Assess your staining job.,
Finish the remaining cabinets.,
Apply a clear lacquer to the outside of the cabinets.,
Let the cabinet doors sit for one to two days before reinstalling them into the cabinet boxes.

",How to Glaze2," In most cases, this is the only place you will glaze cabinets, since this is the only area with detailing and molding.

, Don’t forget to sand and prime the cabinets before you paint them to ensure the paint will last a long time. You can simply glaze pre-finished cabinets without painting or staining them as well.

, Add a dark color of stain to a cup of opaque glaze. Mix and add more stain as needed to make the dark accent color for you furniture.


The biggest difference between glazing cabinets and furniture is the use of color. Most often, cabinets are glazed with a stain, rather than a paint color. However, you can use white and blue or brown to create a country cabin look in your kitchen.

, Dip a foam brush into the cup of mixed glaze. Apply it to the innermost edge of your cabinet molding.


Make sure the glaze reaches into the corners of all square accents or details in your cabinet. Apply the glaze with the pointed end of the brush until you feel you have pushed it into the door’s woodworking.
Since most cabinets have square details, make sure you do the entire interior square first, and then move to the bigger corners and sections.

, Use a straight motion and a folded rag, so that it leaves the glaze inside the corners and crevices alone.

, Apply stain glaze and wipe off the remainder.

, If you back away and the cabinet has a pinstripe look, with a darker color surrounding all the corners and edges, then you have achieved the desired look. If not, you can apply another coat of glaze for a darker accent.

, Allow the glaze to sit for 12 to 24 hours before you begin sealing it.

, Spray approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the wood. Then, use horizontal, straight motions to apply even coats onto the doors.


For best results, depress the spray nozzle before you bring the can across the door, and don’t stop the spray at the end. This will help you avoid an uneven, spitting at the edges of your piece.Repeat with parallel strokes until the door is covered.

Cover your work surface.,
Make sure your wood is ready to be dyed.,
Shake all the dye bottles and pour them each into a container.,
Test a piece of scrap wood.,
Dye your wood.,
Allow it to completely dry.,
If desired, spray with polyurethane to preserve the dye color.",How to Dye Wood1," It’s best to cover wherever you’re working with a plastic cloth – newspapers may soak through. Cover your hands, too, with rubber gloves; if you don’t, you’ll end up with fun-colored fingers by the end of the project. To get started, you'll need:

One container for every color of dye
Paintbrushes
Hot water
Polyurethane spray (optional);
, If you’re working with a piece of scrap wood, it may have to be sanded and wiped clean. If it has a varnish, you’ll need to strip it and sand it until smooth.


Wood bought from craft supply stores (blocks or beads, for example) is ready to go. If you haven't yet purchased wood and are looking to do so from a home improvement store, ask if they'll sand it for you.

, Mix the dye according to the package instructions – you’ll probably need ½ cup liquid dye or 1 box of powder dye with 2 cups of very hot water. Use a glass or ceramic bowl to avoid reactions with the dye colors in the microwave and stir well.


If you’re using the immersion method, you’ll need the same amount of dye with 2 ‘’quarts’’ of water (depending on the size of your product).
There are many different types of wood dyes out there, and some are just wood stains. Rit dye, like the kind you'd buy for fabric, makes a great, easy-to-use, cheap dye for woods that's widely available in craft supply stores., Dip a piece of scrap wood (or use an area of the wood you’re using that can’t be seen) into the bowl of dye. Give it a minute or two to dry as it’s darker when wet. If you don’t like it, add more dye or more water as needed.


This won't give you the exact final hue, but it'll be close. It'll also show you how the dye spreads and how you have to apply the dye to get the look you want.

, There are a number of methods you can use:



Brush-on method. Dip a foam or bristle brush or old cloth in the dye and spread it evenly over your wood surface. If dye drops splash onto your wood, you can get rid of them by sanding the wood immediately. Let it dry and reapply as necessary.

Immersion method. Place the wood gently into the prepared dye. Leave in for as long as it takes to achieve the desired color (likely 10-20 minutes. Keep in mind that the colors dry much lighter than they appear when wet.

Weather-beaten look. Chose two dye colors to apply one after the other. Start with the lighter shade and let dry. Then apply the darker shade and let dry. Once it is dry, lightly sand the entire piece, exposing the lighter shade underneath. Repeat applications as necessary. Rub with sandpaper or steel wool to create shaded areas when finished.

, Remove the wood from the dye when you're satisfied it is ready. Lay it out to dry on paper towels or some other suitable surface that it won’t stick to. Then, leave it overnight for best results.

, Polyurethane can also be applied with a new bristle or foam brush. This can be useful if the wood object is to undergo wear and tear through frequent usage, such as for beads in jewelry.Keep in mind that this method is not safe to use with baby's toys or other objects that may get placed in the mouth.

Sand down the wood.,
Repeat the sanding process with a progressively finer grain.,
Inspect the wood to determine whether or not you're satisfied with the surface.,
Wipe down your wood and remove any dust.,
Test the color before proceeding with a stain.,
Apply the stain using a rag or a brush.,
Start by applying the stain in a small area, like a leg or a drawer front, so you can get familiar with the drying time.,
Continue applying the stain, brushing on a wet coat and then wiping away the excess before it dries.,
Pick a finish for your wood.,
Apply a finish to protect the wood from water damage, dirt, or stains.,
Paint the finish onto your wood using a natural bristle brush.,
Sand the finish down once it has dried.,
Apply the second coat just like paint.,
Sand each subsequent coat.,
Repeat the application process two or three times.",How to Finish Wood," Wood will have flaws like scratches and dents. Whether marks have come from the machines at the mills, or it has become scratched or gouged during handling, or from wear and tear. Before applying any stain, finishing, or paint, you need to sand down the wood to allow you apply to new materials and prevent the flaws from being highlighted. If the flaws in the wood aren't sanded away, the finish that is applied will only highlight and expose any marks or scratches.
Start with sandpaper that has a grit of about 120. In most cases, this will remove any of the flaws without causing worse problems.
Always sand with the grain of the wood. Don’t sand against the grain.;
, You want to sand down the wood until you've reached anywhere between 180 and 220-grit.


Repeated rounds of sanding will remove the coarse-grit scratches from the previous passes.

, You can use a high-intensity light, or wet the wood with paint thinner to magnify any remaining blemishes.


If you see blemishes you may need to sand the wood again. However, too much sanding in an area that has a blemish may only make it worse.
Be careful to try and get as smooth of a surface as possible. Some areas may just have quirks that can't be completely removed.

, After you've sanded the wood go over it with a rag to wipe it down and remove any excess material. While you can use any cloth to do this, a tack cloth will pick up the most dust.

If you don't wipe down the wood before you apply your stain, you can cause uneven parts and blemishes.

, Apply a small bit of stain to an innocuous part of the wood, such as the underside, or on an extra piece of the same wood. If you are satisfied with the color of the stain you can begin staining the wood. Leaving excess stains on the wood won’t affect the color very much, but can leave blotches and an uneven surface.
When preparing the stain, always stir the can, never shake it.

, Apply the stain evenly making sure you don’t leave puddles or uneven clumps. Brushes work better than rags and will help you apply the stain more evenly. When you dip the rag or brush in the stain make sure not to let it drip anywhere you don’t want it to go.
Blend the stain into the wood thoroughly and make sure you are applying it evenly. Go over your brush strokes several times to spread the stain out and create a smooth area.

, If a stain dries too quickly, it can be re-liquefied by applying more stain, but this will make the stain darker. Wipe off the excess stain right away.


Once you know how long it will take the stain to dry you can begin staining the rest of the piece.
If the stain isn’t dark enough, you may want to apply several coats.

, Wait until the first coat has dried completely before adding another coat. Always complete one surface at a time.


Don't double up the application of your stain on any areas that have been completed because this will cause a color change.

, Water-based finishes are less harmful, non-flammable, and more environmentally friendly than other types of finishes. A clear polyurethane finish will give your wood a nice protected coat.


Choose a clear finish that has a level of gloss you want for your wood. If you get a glossy finish, your wood will have more of a sheen or glow than a finish with less gloss.
Water-heavy finishes will sometimes swell wood fibers unevenly. Apply these finishes lightly, using several coats.
You can also carefully sand off any bristles that appear after the first finish coat. Apply at least two more coats for a thorough, even finish over the first coat, which might be more heavily sanded than usual for a finish coat.

, Just like you did with the stain, use a natural bristle brush to apply the stain, going with the grain of the wood, not against it. Stir the stain in the can before applying it. Don’t shake the can. Shaking can create air bubbles which will get transferred to your wood.
Water-based polyurethane is the best finish for bare wood, as it highlights the features of the wood itself, such as the grain and the natural color.
Oil-based polyurethane will increase durability more in combination with a stain.
Wiping varnish (oil-based polyurethane thinned 50% with paint thinner) is the best application for stained, decorative pieces. It is easy to apply flawlessly, but will not help a piece withstand wear and tear.

, You can also use a foam brush that is about 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide. Allow the first coat to cure overnight.


You will want to apply several coats of finish to your wood. But allow the first coat to completely dry so that you can lightly sand it down and smooth it out before adding more coats.

, Sand the first coat using 280-grit sandpaper, or a finer sandpaper if you don’t need to do much evening out.


Remove the dust with a tack rag or a vacuum and then apply the second coat.

, When there are bubbles, remove the bubbles by brushing back over the area to smooth it down. When possible, move with the grain of the wood.


On flat surfaces, brush side to side, and front to back.
Apply the finish as thinly as possible, and line the brush strokes up in rows so that the finish covers the wood evenly.

, Just as you did with the first coat, you want to lightly sand each subsequent coat once it's cured to remove any dust nibs.


Again, remove any dust with a tack rag or vacuum.

, Once you have a few layers of finish down you can add your final coat of finish. Do not sand the last coat.


You don’t have to sand down the final coat as sanding will remove the nice shine and finished look.
Once it’s dry wipe it down with a soft rag to remove any particles.

Purchase a moisture meter.,
Test the wood's moisture content.,
Lay out a row of stickers on which to dry the wood.,
Stack the first layer of boards.,
Continue stacking stickers and boards.,
Position a heavy sheet of plywood over the stack.,
Wait for the wood to dry.",How to Dry Wood for Woodworking," There is no accurate visual or tactile test for determining a wood's moisture content. To be sure that your wood is dry enough for woodworking, you'll need a small handheld tool called a moisture meter. This tool has 2 small metal probes that are touched against the wood to produce a moisture readout expressed as a percentage of the wood's volume or weight.;
, Use the moisture meter according to the manufacturer's directions. The acceptable moisture content for most woodworking projects is about 6 or 7 percent. If your wood gives a readout much higher than that, you'll know it needs to dry before being used

, ""Stickers"" are simply 1"" x 2"" (25 x 50 mm) pieces of lumber that are used to provide airflow between the boards you are drying. Lay each sticker about 16 inches (40 cm) apart and line them up parallel to each other. You'll need enough stickers to support the entire length of the boards you are drying.

, Carefully set the first layer of wooden boards on top of the stickers, running them perpendicular to the stickers. Leave an inch or so of space between each board to allow for increased airflow.

, Next, you'll place another row of stickers on top of the boards, lining them up directly with the previous set of stickers. Continue alternating stickers and boards until you've accommodated all of the wood you need to dry. You should now have a nice stack of wood boards that are separated from each other in all directions to provide circulation.

, You'll need to apply some downward pressure to the stack to keep it from warping upwards as it dries. To do this, place a thick sheet of plywood on top of a final set of stickers. Stack a few concrete blocks or other heavy objects on top of the plywood for additional weight.


This setup is also ideal for deflecting rain if you are drying the wood outdoors.
Do not cover the drying wood with a tarp or other overhanging fabric, as this tends to prevent airflow and trap in moisture.

, Drying times vary widely based on temperature, humidity, and ventilation conditions, but of course you can continually check the wood with your moisture meter to determine its readiness. A general rule is that a year of drying time will be needed for each inch (25 mm) of board thickness.

Assemble everything you need.,
Pour a bit of each color you want into a cup, bowl, or ice cube tray.,
Dip the wood in the color for about 2-3 seconds.,
Apply dye to all sides of the object.,
Let dry on a sheet of wax paper.",How to Dye Wood2," This is great as an at-home DIY project or even as a craft project with kids – liquid watercolors are non-toxic and fun and easy to use. Here’s what you’ll need:


Pieces of wood
Liquid watercolors
Bowls, cups, or ice tray
Wax paper
Paintbrushes (optional)

, An ice cube tray is convenient as you can put small amounts of each color into each little container, but if you need a wider area (for dipping, etc.) you’ll be better off with a wider-brimmed bowl.


The beauty of liquid watercolor is that it is good to go. No mixing or heating up necessary. When you pour it in, that's all you need to do. It lasts much longer than food coloring and is cheaper, too.

, That’s really all it takes – at least at first. Dip it in for just a few seconds and see what you think of the color. Remember: it will get lighter as it dries.


It’s not a bad idea to dip in one side and set the wood down to dry on a side that isn’t dyed yet. Then you know whichever side it lays on won’t get tarnished or stick to the surface when laid down.
If the color is too light, dip it in for a few seconds once more, applying another coat.

, If you're worried about getting it on your fingers, put on a pair of rubber or plastic gloves. However liquid watercolors do wash off pretty easily if addressed quickly.


Keep this in mind for your objects, too. If they get exposed to water, the dye could start coming off – at least eventually. It's important they stay dry (out of water and out of mouths).

, Once you’re finished dyeing, set all the pieces on wax paper to dry overnight. Come back to them in the morning and see if you like the color. If not, you can always reapply.

"

Set up your workspace.,
Prepare the drink powder.,
Paint the dye onto the wood.,
Let the wood dry.",How to Dye Wood3," Before doing anything with the wood, you should have a suitable place to work in, where you can make a mess and it doesn't matter. Use a table or other surface that is comfortable to work on and that you’re okay getting a splash of dye on. Cover it with a plastic cloth or some other protective surface.


You'll probably want to put on an old t-shirt and some plastic or rubber gloves, too.

, With rubber gloves on to prevent staining your hands and fingers, add a package of drink powder to water to create a dye. Adjust your ratio of water to powder until you get the shade that you want.


Cherry drink powder will come out red, grape will come out purple, etc. If you want a darker, deeper shade, just add less water. You can also combine colors (red and yellow make orange, for example) if the color you want is unavailable in flavor form.
The best perk of using drink powder as your dye? It smells delicious.

, Using a foam brush, spread the paint everywhere on the wood, wherever you need the dye to be applied. It will soak right in and smell fruity too. Remember that it will get lighter as it dries, so wait a minute to see if you need to apply another coat or two.


You'll probably need a couple of layers, so be patient. Be sure to coat the entirety of the wood before you move onto coating it a second time to keep the color even.

, Wait for 16-20 minutes after you have finished spreading the dye. This will give the dye time to soak into the wood. Then, put the drying wood in a sunny or windy place to dry quickly. When that time is up, your art is ready.


Check the color. When the wood dries completely, see if the color is dark enough for your liking. If it isn't dark enough, dye the wood again.

"
"
Prepare a workspace.,
Place a few drops of dye in a suitable container full of warm/hot water.,
Place the wood in the water-dye mixture.,
If immersing the entire piece, let it sit in the dye for 10 minutes or so.,
When finished, let the wood dry.",How to Dye Wood4," Cover the surface with paper or some other suitable material, like a plastic tablecloth, to protect the area from getting stained. You might want to wear rubber gloves, too. You'll also need:


One container for each dye
Warm or hot water
Plastic bags (if immersing)

, The more dye that you add, the more saturated the color will be (and the less water you use, too). Light wood works the best with food coloring as it takes on color much more easily.


Mix it up well – food coloring has a tendency to take a while to dissolve if it isn't given a push in the right direction.
The darker (and bigger) the wood and the more water you have, the more dye you will need. Be prepared to clean out your stock in your kitchen for the craft.

, A resealable plastic bag is ideal for immersing the wood, depending on how large the piece of wood is. If it is really large, use a plastic tub.


You can also use a foam brush to apply the dye. This makes it easier to control and is better for smaller objects that have nooks and crannies. It does take a bit more patience, however.

, The longer it sits, the more saturated the color will be. Want it bright and vibrant? Leave it in, go watch an episode of your favorite TV show, and then come back and check on it.


If you're using the brush-on method, you'll probably need at least 3 or 4 coats to get a significant color. Apply the first coat around the entire object before you move onto the 2nd to ensure an even look.
Keep in mind that the color will lighten as it dries.

, Use paper towels or some other surface you're okay staining. Leave at least overnight, and check in the morning. If it's gotten too light, you can simply apply another coat or two.


If you're happy with the color, considering sealing it in by spraying the surface with a polyurethane spray. You can also take a brush to spread it on. This adds a varnish or shine to the object in addition to providing a seal against general wear and tear.

Brew a pot of coffee.,
Add the grounds back into the coffee pot.,
Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.,
Allow to dry.,
Add more layers until the color or effect is as you'd like it.",How to Dye Wood5," For the record, this isn't a very strong dye and is only suitable for light colored wood, such as pine. The end result will look ""weathered.” Make sure it is as strong a brew as possible; the darker the coffee, the darker the dye effect.


Dyeing a dining room table that seats 14? You may need more than just a pot.

, These will be used as part of the dye, making it richer and deeper – and that translates to fewer coats for you to spread.


Before you go to dip your rag or paintbrush in the coffee, you may want to put on rubber or plastic gloves to keep coffee stains off your hands.

, While the coffee is still warm (not hot), use a paintbrush or rag dipped into the coffee and apply it to the wood. Rub or paint back and forth, across the wood.


Don't worry about the grounds; press them in if you can but just keep moving back and forth. Leave the grounds in place for darker dyeing.

, If you're working with a smaller object, arrange on paper towels or towels to dry. Some coffee may drip down the sides, depending on your process. This is generally fine, as it will give it a perfectly-imperfect look.

, After a few layers, the effect can be quite evident. Reheat the coffee until it's warm again to bring back its potency, and reapply.


Remember to let it dry before you apply another layer. It will be slightly darker when wet.
If you like the current shade, consider sealing it with polyurethane spray or a wood varnish. This will help the color last longer, give it a sheen, and protect it against the elements.

,
Repeat the sandpaper finish as many times as you like, until the desired luster is achieved.",How to Oil Woodwork,";
,


Tung, Linseed, Danish, Teak or Mineral oil can be used with this wood oiling technique.
Mineral oil is perfect for wood projects that need to be food-safe, like cutting boards.

,


Make sure to rub the oil in the direction of the natural grain of the wood. Rub hard to work the oil well into the wood.

,,,,,, This helps to push the oil deep into the pores and really starts to enhance the appearance of the wood's natural grain.

,,,, Just make sure to remove any excess oil and allowing the wood to dry for 24 hours between each coat.

, Use a large paintbrush to apply a paste furniture stripper (available at hardware stores) to the oak piece you are treating. Work from the top, downwards to apply an even coat to the entire surface. For hard to reach spots, try using a small amount of liquid furniture stripper, which is best suited to small or irregularly shaped surfaces.If any furniture stripper gets onto your skin, stop working and flush it off immediately with clean water.

, Follow the manufacturer’s directions for how long to leave the chemical stripper on your oak item. Many furniture stripping products are meant to be left on for 20-30 minutes. Set an alarm to keep track of the time to avoid leaving the product on too long, which could damage the wood., Try inserting the knife into the paste. Begin removing it if it is soft enough for your knife to go through to the wood. Remove as much paste as possible.Soak a piece of medium-grade steel wool in the chemical stripper and use it to remove any stubborn bits of the paste.

, Many brands of furniture stripper require that you use water to wash away the chemicals from the wood. Fill a bucket with warm water and use a clean cloth to wipe down the entire surface of the wood item. Allow it to dry for several hours, or overnight., Before apply a lime finish to your oak, fill in any holes or gaps with wood filler (available at hardware stores).

, Use sandpaper for latex paint removal and mineral spirits for oil-based paint removal.








, For instance, colored paint painted over white paint, when distressed, will reveal some of the white layer beneath.








, Start hitting the wood at one end and work your way to the other end. The sock creates a buffer so that the wood's surface is marked up gradually.








, The hammer will leave deep impressions while the mallet will make slight dips in the surface.








, Attach the drywall screws to the 2x4 so that they're sticking out at a uniform level. Hammer the piece of wood repeatedly to create the wormhole effect.









For a lighter wormhole effect, use a small screwdriver to puncture the same portion of the surface of the wood lightly. Piece surface of the wood randomly rather than in the same area.

, The ring left behind by the glass is a nice effect for either a table or a bar.








, Petroleum jelly, like Vaseline or Vicks VapoRub, can create a distressed look when you're using multiple coats of paint. Lay down one layer of paint, and let it dry. Add the petroleum to areas you want distressed; be conservative with how much you use. Add your second coat of paint, let dry, and then go over the petroleum jelly areas with a bit of steel wool.








, The pointed tip of the heel will create a nice crater. Hit in random spots and use different amounts of force.








, Using a metal chain will distress the surface and will mask fresh cuts in the ends of a piece of wood.









Secure wing nuts and bolts onto your chain for a more random look. Regular chain will leave a more uniform distressing pattern on wood, whereas chains with add-ons such as small bolts will leave a more variegated distressing pattern.

, Put a strip of 0000 steel wool in a glass jar filled with plain white vinegar. Let stand overnight. In the morning, the steel wool should be mostly dissolved. Paint the steel/vinegar mixture onto bare wood with a brush. Watch as the vinegar solution reacts immediately with the wood.









This distressing technique is used primarily to grey or age the wood, as opposed to distress the wood, although it has a very similar feel. Spot test on a different piece of wood to experiment before you apply to your desired piece.

, You can also create deep grooves in the wood by dragging one of these tools across its surface.








, Create a distressed look merely by applying two coats of contrasting paint — no hitting, scraping, or scuffing. Paint the lower layer on and let it dry completely. Paint the top layer on and wait until it's nearly dry. With a damp, not wet, cloth rub the top coat of paint away from the wood in even strokes until the bottom coat of paint sees through.

The bleaching action occurs when the two chemicals come into contact with each other on the wood.Read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully before using the product. Some brands advise putting the ""A"" chemical on first before the ""B,"" while other brands suggest mixing the two before application. Know which method is advised, as some brands may be structured differently chemically and can have a different effect than intended.
For the best outcome, pick a brand like ""DALYS,"" which can be applied either as a mixture or by bottle., Allow the wood to dry for at least 10 minutes before continuing.

Wait times may vary from brand to brand. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for the exact time.
Use a brush with synthetic bristles as the chemicals will destroy natural bristles.
Wear rubber gloves and protective safety glasses when using this product. Remember that bleach is highly caustic and can irritate skin or eyes upon contact., Let this stand for 4 hours.

Use a similar amount and technique when applying part B as you did when applying part A.
For more accurate results, test the 2-part bleach in a small area where it cannot be seen. Observe how the bleach reacts to the wood. You will also be able to learn how quickly the bleach will be absorbed by the wood and how long it takes to dry.

, Wipe thoroughly to neutralize the bleach.

Some brands include a neutralizer along with the bleach. If this is the case, preparing a homemade solution is not necessary.
If you don't have white wine vinegar, simply using water is acceptable.Use either a sponge or large washcloth to apply the mixture. Be generous when using the solution.
Allow the wood to dry overnight before continuing.

, Remove as much of the white vinegar and water solution as possible.

Let the wood rest for 2 days, then check the color. If the wood is bleached to your satisfaction, proceed to the next step. If not, reapply the 2-part A/B bleach and repeat the previous steps.

, Remove any remaining finish from the wood

sandpaper with a 120-grit is medium grade. This is mostly used for removing old finish as well as scratches.sandpaper with 220-grit is fine grade and is generally for lightly sanding just before applying stain to the wood.
Avoid using coarse grade grits, which are under 100. This can damage your wood finish., Give your wood a more refined look before applying finish.

Clear gloss typically comes in an aerosol spray can. Spray cans require good technique to avoid drips and their thin films aren't as durable as brush-on finish.Brush on stain is more durable and requires less precision. Apply the stain with a brush, working both with the grain and against it. Make sure you apply a nice, even, and liberal coat.For a lighter shade, wipe the stain off immediately after application. For a darker tone, leave the stain on for 10 minutes before wiping off the excess stain.
Wear protective clothing when applying stain. Use rubber gloves and try to cover as much as your body as possible. Though the chemicals themselves aren't necessarily harmful, they are difficult to wash off., Though staining is optional, applying finish is crucial for protecting the surface of wood as well as enhancing its appearance.


Wear protective eye wear and gloves when handling finish. The chemicals can harm skin and sometimes emit hazardous fumes.For oil-based finishes, use a charcoal respirator to avoid breathing in the chemicals.

Never apply finish near stoves or furnaces. Chemicals in finish are highly flammable and pose a serious fire hazard when heated. Safely store paint brushes by sealing them in paint cans or plastic bags. Take similar precautions when disposing of rags used to apply finish.

",How to Distress Wood Furniture," If this is your first time distressing a piece of furniture, do not use a prized or expensive piece. Instead, buy a cheap piece of used furniture from a thrift store or an online auction. This will ensure that you won't ruin a favorite piece if you are unhappy with the results of your project.






;
, You're going to be doing lots of sanding, painting, and chipping, which means the area you're in is going to get dirty. Cover the area (and other pieces of furniture) with tarps or newspapers to protect them from sanding dust or splattered paint.









Or just take your piece and move it to the backyard. Whichever.

, What color is on your piece right now, whether you paint over it or not, is going to show through once you distress it. So if you don't like the color, you'll need to get it off. You could sand it off, but that'll take ages. A stripper goes much faster. You simply just rub it on, wait for the paint to bubble, and chip it off.








Lots of people skip this stage. If you do, you'll still have a piece, but it won't look as good as you want it to. Take the extra time to make it look perfect by buying paint stripper (and using it).
Once stripped, you may need to do some sanding. There will likely be a few chips of paint that are stubborn and won't come off – for those, grab your sandpaper.

, If your piece has no paint on it and is just the wood as is, you may want to add a stain. It can mute the paint that's to be added, giving it a vintage-y feel. It'll also look nice if it pops through, too (if you're only doing one color of paint, that is).









To do this, just take a clean rag, dip it in the stain, and rub it in circles. The natural grain of the wood will still show through. And if you're concerned about the circles showing through, they won't through your next coat of paint.

, Sand the piece of furniture with coarse-grit sandpaper. If the furniture is unfinished, you just need to sand enough to achieve a smooth surface the paint can adhere to. If the furniture already has a stain or a coat of paint on it, sand away most, but not all, of the finish. Letting the old finish show through unevenly will help contribute to the weathered look of the final piece.









80-grit sandpaper is a good place to start.As you're sanding, keep an eye on how much of the original layer will still pop through. Some people like quite a bit creating a more speckled look while others like the undertones to be more of a subtle surprise.

, This will remove any dust from the sanding process. You want to work with a clean piece of furniture free from dust and excess anything.








, Right now you have two options: you could use one color, your base color, and have that be the overall color of your piece. The distressed bits that show through would then be from the wood itself. Or you could have this be your base color, sand it and add wax, paint a color over top of that, and then sand it again, so the base color is the bit that pops through. Both will lead to beautiful pieces.









Always work in thin, even layers. It'll take longer, but it'll be worth it. Paint with the grain in a thin coat around the entire object, let it dry, and repeat until you get the color you want. This way you can control the shade at a more precise level and no area gets gloopy with excess paint.

, This step is optional and is only necessary if you're working with two paint colors. The wax is a protectant, keeping the top coat of paint away from the bottom color.









Take candle wax or petroleum jelly to the areas you want to distress. Most likely these will be corners, edges, and places that ""got overly handled."" These are the places you want the color to poke through.

, If you are not using a second paint color, use coarse-grit sandpaper or a sanding block to rub vigorously against the furniture's corners and edges until you achieve an uneven, rounded surface. This will give the furniture a weathered look and essentially the brunt of the job.









If you are using a second color, still do this step, just not as much; you'll be painting over most of it anyway.

, This top coat does not have to be beautiful; in fact, the less beautiful it is, the more distressed your piece is going to look. Have it be extra thin in some places so the base color or sanding shows through. The more worn and torn the job looks, the better.









Do paint over the wax – that's what it's there for. Again, work in thin, even coats – not with gloopy pools of paint. Once finished, let it dry.

, The steel wool won't do much damage to your top coat – not that it matters anyway (you want it to look distressed, after all). Rub it over the wax, getting it off so that the base coat of paint shows through.








After this stage, rub over the entire piece with a clean tack cloth. Right now, you're basically done. Now all you can do is add some extra finishing touches.

, If you want to add cracks to the furniture, you will need a chisel and a hammer. Place the chisel against the wood in the place you want the crack to form, remembering that wood will only crack along its grain. Tap the hammer against the chisel repeatedly until a crack begins to form. Reposition the chisel along the crack if you want to extend it further.









Use a hammer to add light depressions to the piece. To make the surface of the furniture appear worn, tap it in various places with a hammer to form small depressions.

, Rub a wire brush along any places in the furniture's finish where you want to add scratches. This can also be done after you stain or paint the piece.








Try to make them look accidental and not deliberate. Make the scratches light and at various angles – not straight, thick lines.

, Use a drill with a small drill bit to drill very small holes into the furniture if you'd like to up the distressed quotient. Cluster a few holes together to simulate worm or insect damage. This can make the piece seem previously used, too.









This part is entirely optional. If you're not comfortable drilling holes into your furniture, don't do it. Scratches and paint distress are enough.

, Any shiny metal parts on the furniture will undermine the aged look you want to achieve. Fortunately, antique hardware (including reproduction hardware) is a booming business; search online to find replacement parts for your furniture's latches, pulls, feet, and screws.








, Start by cleaning the furniture again with a tack cloth, and then brush the stain on in the direction of the wood grain. Wipe the stain off with a cloth after applying it; this will leave just enough stain accumulated in the cracks and dents you've created to highlight those features.









When the stain is dry, seal it with a coat of clean varnish. Make sure it's a non-yellowing varnish as certain ones (like regular polyurethane) will change color over time, destroying the look.,"

Consider drying your wood in a kiln.",How to Cure Wood," Logs should be processed into lumber as soon as possible to prevent the ends from drying and the wood from rotting. While the ideal thickness for lumber is 1 inch (2.5 cm), you may saw your logs into lumber that is between ¾ inch to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in thickness. If you are processing the wood yourself, make an effort to achieve uniform length and thickness. If you are unable to saw your own logs, find a sawmill to do the job for you.You may wish to cut your wood slightly oversized to account for shrinkage.;
, The ends of lumber cure faster than the rest of the wood. To ensure that your wood cures evenly, it is best to seal the ends immediately after sawing the logs into lumber. You may coat each end of the wood in a commercial end sealer, paraffin wax, polyurethane shellac, or latex paint. Build up a thick layer of the sealer of your choice to prevent moisture from escaping out of the ends., When air-drying your wood, the curing time is determined by a simple formula. Allow 1 year of drying time per 1 inch (2.5 cm) of thickness. This formula only provides a rough estimate. It does not account for all variables, such as the weather and the location of the woodpile.For example, if a piece of wood is 1 inch thick, it would take 1 year to properly cure the lumber.

, When you are air-drying your wood, the lumber is left outside, exposed to the elements, to cure. Search for a location that meets the following requirements:


To maximize airflow, select an outdoor location that is not surrounded by buildings or foliage that block the wind.
Choose a location that has a slight slope to prevent water from gathering below the lumber.
Find a spot that is not covered in foliage—foliage will expose the bottom layer of lumber to moisture. Lumber stacked on asphalt or concrete cures faster., In order to cure properly, lumber must be stacked in a very specific manner. Begin by creating a secure base for your lumber:


Lay out two rows of three evenly spaced concrete blocks. The rows should be the same length as the lumber. The columns should be approximately 1 ½ to 3 feet apart.
Lay a bolster, a 4x4 piece of wood, across each set of two concrete blocks., To allow air to flow freely through the pile of lumber, stickers, ½ inch to 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips of wood, are inserted between each layer of lumber.


Place 5 to 6 pieces of evenly spaced wood on top of the bolsters. Each piece of lumber in a pile should be approximately the same length.
Place one sticker across each set of ends.
Place additional stickers every 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0 cm) down the length of the lumber.
Repeat the process, stacking the successive layers of lumber and stickers in exactly the same locations as the previous layer, until all of the lumber is in the pile., A weighted roof covers the lumber to protect it from rain and snow. To make the weighted roof, do the following:


Retrieve several 4x6 inch timbers that are 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) longer than the width of your pile.
Place one timber across each end of the pile. Place the remaining timbers evenly down the length of the pile.
Retrieve a sheet of metal that is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) longer than the pile on each side.
Place the metal sheet on top of the timbers.
Place cement blocks on top of the metal sheet to keep the roof in place. Place the cement blocks in direct alignment with the stickers., The quality of your cured lumber is dependent upon the drying rate. To ensure that your wood is curing at an appropriate rate, you should monitor the moisture content of the lumber every 1 to 3 days. You can evaluate moisture content with an electronic meter. Use your readings to determine the target moisture content for your lumber.Air-dried wood’s final moisture content typically falls between 20% to 30%., When wood cures too quickly or too slow, the makeup of the lumber is altered. If your lumber is drying too quickly, you may notice checking, or lengthwise cracks in the fibers of the lumber, splitting, honeycombing, or warping. If your lumber is drying too slowly, you may notice stains or areas of decay.

, If your wood is not curing at an appropriate rate, you should alter the structure of your wood pile.


To reduce checking, consider trying the following: widen or double up your stacks, reduce the space between the pieces of lumber, use thinner stickers, or cover the pile with a shade cloth to protect it from the sun.
To reduce warping, consider trying the following: align the stickers directly on top on each other, use uniform stickers, make sure each layer of lumber contains pieces of wood that are relatively the same thickness, or place a roof on top of the pile.
To reduce staining and decay, consider trying the following: decrease the width of the pile, increase the space between piles, increase the space between layers of lumber, or clear the air of items that obstruct air flow., Instead of fully exposing your pile of lumber to the elements, you may choose to stack your wood in a shed. The shed must be open to the elements on one side and contain a series of fans on the opposite side. The fans force air through the stacked wood and decrease your curing time., If you have the resources, you may consider constructing a ventilated dry kiln. Locate or construct an enclosed building that contains fans capable of moving and recycling hot air. Place your stickered lumber inside the building to force air-dry or pre-dry your lumber., For a price, many sawmills will cure green wood, or freshly milled wood, for you. The cost is often offset by the speed with which the job is completed. Most mills will use industrial sized kilns that are controlled by computers. Sawmills can use their software to determine the ideal heat setting based on the type of wood involved, the moisture content that is present, and the amount of wood that is being cured."

Prepare your culms.,
Use heat to cure the bamboo.,
Take safety precautions.,

Decide between vertical or horizontal stacking.,
Take measures to prevent damage.,
Consider soaking the bamboo first.,

Harvest only mature bamboo poles.",How to Cure Bamboo," If you're harvesting bamboo for an at-home project, you'll first want to select the proper culms to harvest. Culms are stems of bamboo that shoot up from the ground. Look for culms that are longer and straighter in appearance. These bamboo culms may be sturdier and their width tapers off with height. This means you'll have a variety of sizes to work with when using the culms for at home projects., Before you begin curing and storing your bamboo, remove any infected culms. Culms that contain fungus, bugs, or other problems can infect the rest of the culms.


Look for circular ring patters, which can indicate fungus. While fungus is mostly cosmetic and can be removed, it can be a pain if it spreads. If you only have a few culms that look like they might have fungus in an otherwise healthy batch, you might want to simply toss the infected culms.Some viral infections leave mosaic-like patterns on bamboo culms. These culms should be discarded. You should also get rid of culms infected with a black, sooty mold.Bugs and parasites can infect bamboo culms. Watch for a white substance on shoot tips. If you notice such a substance, peel back the culm leaves and look for small, pink bugs. Such culms should be discarded as the pesticides required to treat such infections are pricey and time consuming., Once you've gathered culms and checked for infection, prepare them for the curing process. It's easiest to simply use a grill to cure bamboo for home projects. Therefore, you may want to saw the bamboo culms into manageable pieces of 4 feet or so. You can use a saw or clippers that can be purchased at most hardware stores., You can use an outdoor gas grill to cure bamboo at home. You should remove the racks from the grill and then place the bamboo culms inside one at a time.


Turn the heat to high. Watch for the bamboo to change color slightly. This indicates resin rising to the surface, important to the curing process as it strengthens culms.Take an old rag and rub the resin into the bamboo culms. The color of the bamboo should slowly change from deep green to mint green. Once the entire culm has reached this color, set it aside somewhere to cool.Wait for the culm to be cool enough to handle. Then, poke holes in its inner membranes. You can use any tool that can poke through bamboo culms, such as sharp scissors. This will quicken the drying process., Always wear protective gloves during the curing process to avoid getting burned. When setting bamboo out to dry, choose a non-flammable surface to avoid fire., If you're curing a large amount of bamboo, you need a storage area. Proper storage assures your bamboo will dry out in a healthy, safe fashion.


Keep the culms away from direct soil as this prevents fungal or insect infestations.Make sure you do not dry culms in direct sunlight, as this can lead to quick changes in moisture that causes bamboo to crack and dry out. Try covering your bamboo with a tarp.Make sure culms have decent air ventilation. This can prevent damage while drying., When drying, bamboo is usually stacked either vertically or horizontally. There are pros and cons to each stacking option.


The main upside to vertical stacking is that it lessens the chance of a fungal infection. However, a sturdier support system will be needed for vertical stacking to prevent poles from bending.Horizontal stacking works better for large stacks. You will need to stack bamboo on large platforms and place a thick, plastic sheet under stacks to prevent fungal infections. Keep on eye on the culms on the lower part of the platforms. They're susceptible to cracking.Regardless of whether you choose horizontal or vertical stacking, rotate poles every 15 days. This assures culms will dry in a uniform fashion. Bamboo should be dry in 6 to 12 weeks., Even when stored properly, bamboo polls are subject to some damage when drying. There are steps you can take to prevent damage.


Bamboo sometimes splits when drying. You can prevent this by tying wires around the ends of bamboo polls.When bamboo finishes drying, it sometimes loses some of its glossy appearance. You can restore this by gently oiling and waxing the bamboo once the drying process is finished., While the above method is the most conventional method to cure bamboo, some people soak bamboo before letting it air dry. This may make fungus and mold slightly less likely depending on where you live. In this method, you soak the bamboo for 90 days and then set out to dry for 2 weeks in a sunny area. This method may not work well in areas subject to extreme heat., If you plan on curing bamboo, you need to collect bamboo first. Understand which seasons are best when it comes to collecting bamboo.


The best time to harvest bamboo is at the end of the dry season in your area. Starch content is at its highest during this season, making parasite and fungal attacks less likely.If you have a rainy season, avoid harvesting bamboo during this time. In general, bamboo is most susceptible to damage during this season., Use a machete or saw to cut bamboo. Make sure to cut just above the first or second node above the ground. This is the best place to cut bamboo to prevent damage during storage and transportation., Once you've cut bamboo, make sure you transport it properly. Improper transportation techniques can lead to damage.


Carry the bamboo above the ground or transport in a wheelbarrow or truck. Dragging bamboo across the ground can cause damage.Do not throw bamboo culms on hard ground. This can cause damage. When you reach the storage area, set the bamboo culms down gently., When you harvest bamboo, culms should not be too young or too old. Aim for bamboo poles between 4 and 7 years old for best results.Bamboo tends to grow in clumps. Poles that are inside the clump are older than those growing outside.Talk to an experienced bamboo harvester. He or she will be able to tell the age of bamboo by knocking on the culm and observing the different sounds."

Add the decorative surface.",How to Cover Wood Paneling," If the panels are not in good shape, they will continue to deteriorate under the covering. If there is major mildew or warping, tear down the panels instead. If a panel is coming away from the wall, nail it down in the groove.


If you are reluctant to tear down the paneling, pay for a professional inspection. Some problems can be fixed by cleaning or replacing a few panels, but some damage is irreversible.;
, If your panels are fairly clean, you can get away with water and mild detergent. Dirty walls may need a commercial degreaser to prepare the surface for paint, followed by a thorough water rinse. Degreasers can be dangerous to skin and lungs, so follow label instructions carefully.


TSP (trisodium phosphate) is an effective choice, but it is banned in some areas for environmental reasons.
If you want an environmentally friendly cleaner, you might try using a brand like Simple Green.

, If the panels flex or depress when pushed, filling the grooves between them is not recommend. This movement will cause the filling to crack over time. You can paint over the panels without filling, but the grooves will still be visible. If your panels are solid lumber (not plywood), prime the area with a joint compound (such as the kind you would use for drywall) before filling the grooves. If you don't, any filling you put in the grooves will eventually crack or fall out.

, You can either paint over your panels or hang wall liner over them. Wall liner is an extra-sturdy wallpaper that will cover but not hide the grooves in your paneling.

, Move all furniture well away from the paneling, and cover the floor with drop cloth. Gloves and a face mask are recommended, especially if you're working with a large area or in a room with poor ventilation. Check all product labels for safety information. Ventilate the room with open windows or fans.

, Most paneling has a glossy finish, which needs to be roughened up for the primer. Scuff up the wood a little with a medium grit sandpaper, around 150 grit.Wipe away dust with a damp cloth.


Always wear a dust mask while sanding.
You can rub on a deglosser instead. This is faster, but you'll have to work one panel at a time, priming as soon as the deglosser dries to the correct consistency.Check product label for details.
If you cleaned the panels with TSP, you might be able to skip this step.An additional light sanding or deglossing is still a good idea.
If you do not sand away the finish, you should use an oil-based primer instead, as this will be easier for the paint to adhere to.

, Coat the surface thinly and evenly with an oil- or latex-based primer. If the roller can't reach into the grooves, prime them with a paintbrush. Let dry for 24 hours or the time recommended on the label.


Some real lumber panels will bleed resin through the paint. Prevent this with a stain blocking primer.A tinted primer contributes to the final color.

, Do this only if your boards are rigid enough to handle this (as described above), and you want to hide the groove texture. Mix a standard drywall joint compound ""mud"" with a power mixer or hand tool. You can also buy a pre-mixed compound. Spread it over the grooves in a thin layer with a putty knife, then let dry overnight. If necessary — and it usually is — apply another thin coat or two, until the compound is flush with the panel surface. Let each coat dry overnight. After the final coat is dry, sand it down with a fine-grit sandpaper.


If you have it handy, add a sprinkle of quick-setting joint compound when mixing your mud. This helps speed up the drying.Too thick a coat can warp your paneling., If there are any holes in your panels, fill them with spackle. If you are filling the grooves with joint compound, you may use it for these holes as well.

, Roll on at least two coats of paint, letting dry and sanding lightly in between. Use a foam sponge roller to avoid unwanted textures.Once you're satisfied with the look, you're finished.


If you didn't fill the grooves, use a brush to paint in between the panels.

, Wall liner, also sold as bridging material, is a heavy-duty covering that stays flat across the gaps between panels without sagging or blistering. Most wall liners are designed to have wallpaper plastered over them, but some are paintable. For most walls in good condition, a medium-grade (1200 rating) lining paper is a good choice.Pre-pasted wall liners are the easiest to use for a beginner. If you have some wallpapering experience, you might prefer an unpasted version.Patterned wall liners are available, but most are blank.

, Clean the wood surface and let dry. Most finishes will not interfere with adhesion, but check your product info to make sure. If the wood is especially glossy, rough up the finish with medium grit sandpaper. , Cut lengths of wall liner about 4 inches (10cm) longer than the width of your wall.These horizontal strips are generally best, so the liner seams don't end up in the grooves between panels.


For unusually shaped walls, plan out how you will arrange your wall liner so you can cover the wall with as few strips as possible.

, Pre-pasted liners just need water brushed onto the back to activate the adhesive. For a non-pasted liner, brush the strip generously and evenly with a special liner adhesive, getting right to the edge. Fold the paper accordion-style as you go so it's easy to handle. Typically, you'll need to let the adhesive soak in for about ten minutes., Hold the folded liner up against the edge of a wall, and unfold it bit by bit as you go. As you unfold, brush it in place with a wide wallpaper brush, flattening it against the panels. When you reach the last fold, pencil a line where it will hit the edge, cut along the line, then brush it in place.For best results, use a long level to get the first strip as straight as you can.
Brushing with too much force will stretch the liner.

, Put up each strip the same way, leaving a minuscule gap between strips to avoid bumps from overlapping.

, Wall liners usually take 24–48 hours to dry completely. Check product info for a specific estimate.

, You may now wallpaper the new surface, or paint over it if your liner is paintable. Enjoy your new look!

Cut the substrate (the material that the veneer is actually applied to) to the exact finish size.,
Select the most appealing section of the veneer pattern, which will be visible in the finished piece, keeping in mind that any excess will be trimmed.,
Place your template over the desired section of veneer and cut out that portion, leaving approximately one-half inch, or 1.27 centimeters (0.5 in), of excess on each side.

,
Center the selected pattern section over the substrate panel and apply the contact cement, following the manufacturer's instructions, to both the veneer and the substrate.,
Use extreme caution when positioning the two elements for adherence.,
Using maximum pressure, roll the veneer smooth by starting in the center and working out toward the edges using a veneer roller.

,
Still using maximum pressure, smooth the surface with a smoothing blade to verify that the veneer is completely adhered.

,
Turn your piece upside down and use a razor knife to trim the excess veneer, using the edges of the substrate as your guide.,
Allow ample time for curing and drying before finishing the piece.

",How to Apply Wood Veneer," This way, you can cut just the excess veneer with a razor knife and avoid damaging the finished product by using a table saw.;
,


One effective way to isolate your preferred section is to make a cardboard template. This will need to be cut to the identical size of the substrate panel by laying the substrate over the cardboard, marking the edges and then cutting the cardboard.

,, Allow it to set.


Be sure to mix the adhesive thoroughly before applying it. This will maximize its effectiveness.

, Since contact cement is so slip-resistant, they must be perfectly aligned on the first try

Scrub the oxalic acid solution off with a wet sponge.",How to Bleach Wood2," Use an abrasive cloth or a scraper to remove old varnish and finish.


Paint removers either come in liquid or gel. Either is acceptable when removing old finish from paint.
Set the wood aside for about two days to allow it to dry. After two days, use store-bought wood cleaners to remove grease, oils, or grime.Your wood needs to be spotless in order for oxalic acid to work properly.

, Select a spacious area as handling both the powder and solution can cause harm to eyes upon contact.



Do not mix oxalic acid with any other product. Only mix it with water.Oxalic acid comes in a dry, white crystalline powder. Because it is toxic, it can easily cause irritation to mucous membranes. Wear goggles and a dust mask while handling the dry powder to avoid eye irritation., Use a sponge to apply generous coats and scrub the wood gently.


If stains and finish do not disappear immediately, continue applying the solution until there is a noticeable difference.
After scrubbing, allow the oxalic acid to fully dry., Repeat this step multiple times with plenty of water to help remove the crystalline residue.


Try to remove as much of the solution as possible. When you go to sand this piece of wood, any residual oxalic acid will irritate eyes even more than normal wood dust."

Build a shelf for your cat!",How to Build Shelves," Select a shelving board according to personal preference, your budget and the way in which the shelving complements your décor. There are a wide variety of potential boards to use.


Softwood boards: These are easy to have cut to the desired length and can hold many items, including heavy books.
Plywood boards: This is made up of layered flat boards. The surface is often made to imitate a wood finish or it can be laminated.
Particleboard or chipboard shelves: Made from wood chips glued together under pressure, these are common shelving boards that are lightweight, affordable and easy to find. It is best to get these cut professionally, as the makeup of the boards can blunt cutting tools.
Blockboard shelves: These are stronger than chipboard and are suitable for heavy duty items, like tools and appliances kept in the garage.
Pre-made and pre-sized shelving boards: These are traditionally part of a kit and will often be made for adjustable shelves. The instructions for putting these together should always be included; if not, call the retailer or manufacturer.;
, In some cases supports are hidden but a shelf will always require a support of some type.


Wood strips: Simple but effective, wood strips or blocks can be used to keep shelves in place. A strip of wood used at both ends of shelving is known as a cleat support. It can be neatened by nailing a piece of wood across the front shelf to hide the side cleats.
Metal strips: Available from hardware stores, these can be used as shelf supports. They aren't that pretty, so they may be best for hardware storage in the garage or cupboards.
Brackets: Typically L-shaped, these can be fancy or plain. They are simple to use and are usually good for a variety of shelves. Some brackets are so fancy that they can enhance your décor but they will usually cost a lot more than plainer versions.

, The shelf boards should all be the same length; if not, cut them to the same length.


You can also use cinder blocks, in which case you'll only need one on each side rather than the two bricks.

, Since the shelf has little support, it needs to be flush against a wall, or have some sort of similar flat backing.

, Place another two bricks together on the opposite side to form the base of the shelving. The distance between the bricks should be determined by the plank length, with a small amount of plank overhanging at each side (about a 2 inches).


There should be two bricks on each side of the shelf to support it.

, You'll place the first shelf board onto the base bricks. Then place two bricks side by side on the shelf in the same position as the base bricks.


This time, add two sets more bricks on top to make a pillar.
Do the same for the other side.

, The shelf has been made. It's simple but it's adequate for keeping things like books, DVDs and CDs in order.


If you want to strengthen this structure, add a cross-brace to the back of the shelf unit, screwing it into the shelf boards.

, Choose plain or fancy, as required.

, Cut it to the length required if it's not already done.

, Mark the position with a pencil. Use a tape measure to mark the position of the other bracket at the opposite side.

, Always check for electrical wiring or plumbing before drilling. It's also wise to place a drop sheet on the floor to make it easier to collect the drill dust.


Use a masonry drill bit.
Drill to the depth that the screw requires to penetrate the wall sufficiently.
Insert a wall plug.

, Attach the screw (or screws) by screwing them in as far as they will go.

, Hold the board in place with one hand. Then, using a spirit level, hold the board across to the other mark you made earlier to check that the board will be sitting evenly. If the mark appears accurate, it's ready, if not, make adjustments as required.

, Follow the directions given for the first bracket.

, Lay the board across the brackets and screw it to them from the underside. Be sure to use screws that will not penetrate through to the other side of the board; they must remain wholly inside the shelf board.

, Gently press on the shelf to check that it is firmly attached to the wall.

, Make sure that your shelf can bear the weight of heavier objects and don't put something valuable on your home-made shelf until you know that it's secure.

, You'll need:


Shelf boards. The shelf boards should be at least 2cm 3/4"" thick.
Supports for the shelf boards. Cleats (strips of wood) are easy and ideal for this unit.
Two vertical support panels. These form the sides of the shelf unit.
A top piece. This needs to be slightly wider than the shelf boards, so that it can be hammered or glued on top of the unit.
A piece of hardboard for the back of the shelf unit. (Ask the timber merchant to cut to size if you can't do this yourself.)

,


When you're decided on this, cut the shelf boards to this width, if they're not already at the right width.
Cut the vertical support panels to the right height, if they're not already done.

, The cleat should be placed on the side of the support that you want to face inwards.


Repeat for the second vertical piece.
This forms the first shelf support.

,


Decide where you want the rest of the shelf boards to be place all the way up the first support.
For each level, use a shelf board to help you measure the exact positioning of the cleat across to the opposite vertical support panel (this helps to ensure it is level), and mark it.
Repeat the measuring and marking for each shelf level being added.

, Check that the opposite side will be level by placing the shelf board on the now attached cleat and bringing over to the mark on the opposite vertical support panel. Use a spirit level to check for evenness, then nail or glue the opposite side's cleat in place.


If nailing or screwing into position, be sure to use nails or glues that don't penetrate through the vertical support panels––they must remain wholly within the panels.

,, This level doesn't require a cleat. Instead, it needs to be slightly wider than the shelf boards, so that it can be nailed, screwed in or glued to the top of the two vertical support panels.


If you need to be able to dismantle the shelf, do not glue the top piece in place. Instead, use screws that can be easily undone and re-fixed after each dismantling and reassembly.

, The shelf risks falling over or leaning sideways if this is not added. Nail or glue to the back of the shelf unit.


Another solution is to use a cross-brace instead of one piece of board. Use whatever fits your needs best.

, The unit can be placed anywhere against a flat surface and can be dismantled for ease of carrying and storage (the cleats stay intact with the vertical side panels).

, In some cases, the only space left might be a corner. It is still possible to use it! See, for example, How to create corner shelves for a garden shed.


See also How to install a shower corner shelf if you're looking for a bathroom shelf solution.

, This type of shelf has the appearance of coming straight out of the wall without supports. Of course, it is supported but there are a few simple tricks to it.

, This shelf looks as if the books are simply hanging in the air. It's a bit of fun rather than a really useful shelf.

, This is a great way to salvage a beloved skateboard that is past its prime but that still carries many memories.

, Use shelves to hide your valuables! Or, if you're more into books than clothes, you could always turn your walk-in closet into library shelves.

, The principles of this grid-like shelf arrangement can be used to make other grid shelving in varying sizes too, such as spice cabinets, ornament display shelves and storage units.

Design and measure.,
Choose your wood.",How to Build a Bookshelf1," You can build a bookshelf to fit a particular space in your home or make one that's a standard size so that it can work in a variety of locations.









Measure the space where the bookshelf will sit. Decide how tall you want the finished shelf unit to be and how wide. Bookshelves are traditionally 12"" or 16"" deep; of course, you can customize to suit your needs.
Decide if your bookshelf will have an open or a closed back. If you keep the back open, your books may lean on or touch the wall behind the bookshelf.
Decide it you'll use it to house paperback, hardback or coffee table-sized books. For maximum versatility, this project uses adjustable shelving so any size book will fit.
Standard bookshelves come in two-, three-, four- and five-shelf varieties, but you can make as many shelves as you want for your project.;
, The wood you use will greatly impact the finished look of your piece as well as its cost and durability. Since solid wood could cost thousands of dollars, you'll likely want to use plywood with a hardwood veneer.Choose a 3/4"" plywood for the body and shelves of the bookshelf, and a 1/4"" piece of plywood for the back.









A plywood sheet is 4' wide, but keep in mind that a saw blade takes off 1/8"". Calculate how many 8' long boards you can get from one sheet and use that to figure out how many sheets you will need. For this project, you'll need just one sheet.
Wood veneers:Birch: best choice if you plan to paint your bookcaseMaple: good base for a variety of stainsMahogany, Teak, Walnut, Cherry: These specialty woods may require a special order. Use a clear finish so the beauty of the wood shines through.


"
"
Choose the right saw.,
Cut your sides.,
Cut your bookshelf bottom and shelves.,
Cut the rabbet joints.,
Drill the holes for adjustable shelving along the bookshelf sides.",How to Build a Bookshelf2," Use a table saw or a circular saw to cut your boards. Cutting plywood can be difficult and dangerous, so it's important to set yourself up for success.









Circular saw: choose a carbide tip blade made for plywood. Lay the plywood good side down.Table saw: invest in an 80 TPI plywood blade, designed for rip cuts.Lay the plywood good side up.
, Start by cutting your long boards to the width you want. Remember that standard widths are 12"" or 16""; for this project, our depth will be 12"". Push the wood through the saw at a consistent rate to ensure a cleaner cut.









Enlist the help of a friend. One of the challenges of working with plywood is that it comes in large 4' x 8' sheets,so it can be a bit difficult to handle on your own. Use saw horses or a roller table to also provide support.
Rip a piece of ¾"" birch plywood into a 12½"" wide strip. If you're using a circular saw, be sure to use a straight-edge guide.
Cut the strip into two 41¾"" pieces to make the two bookcase sides. You can adjust this measurement up or down if you want your bookshelf to be taller or shorter.

, Remember that the width of the saw blade is 1/8"" and factor that into your measurements.









Rip a strip of 3/4"" plywood 11⅞"" wide to make the shelves.
Rip a second strip 12 1/8"" to make the top and bottom shelves.
Cut the other two strips into 30½-"" pieces to make the top, bottom and two shelves.

, A rabbet is a groove cut into a piece of wood. In this case, creating rabbet joints will allow the top of the bookcase to sit squarely and securely on the two sides.

Set a saw to make a 3/8"" cut. Cut a track into the end of the shelf by making cuts straight across the shelf in 1/8"" increments until the track is as wide as the thickness of the plywood sides.













Alternately, use a router fitted with a ball-bearing-piloted rabbeting bit to make your cuts.














, Since book sizes differ and your needs may change, it's best to make your shelves adjustable so that you can arrange and rearrange them as best suits you.









Clamp a pegboard (this will be your template for the holes)in place so that the first holes will be 4"" above and 4"" below the center shelf.

If you don't have a pegboard, you make a hole-drilling template out of ¾-inch pine cut to the same length as the bookcase sides. Use a drill/driver fitted with a ⅝-inch spade bit to bore a series of equally spaced holes in the template board. Use a drill bit that's the same diameter as the shelf-support pegs and drill holes 2"" from the edge in 2"" increments.

Drill approximately 1/8"" deeper than the length of the pegs. Put a piece of tape or a drill stop on the bit to guide you in drilling to the correct depth and take into account the thickness of the pegboard.

Attach the top to the sides.,
Add support blocks.,
Put the center and bottom shelves in place.,
Attach the back panel.,
Attach the trim.",How to Build a Bookshelf3," Apply glue the length of the rabbet groove and put the top in place. Add pocket screws to secure the top.








, If you'd like, you can use support blocks for the center and bottom shelves; they'll strength the frame without adding excessive bulk. If you do add these blocks, be aware that your center shelf will be fixed; you won't be able to adjust it.

Glue 1"" x 2"" support blocks in place for the center and bottom shelf and secure them with finish nails













Drive the nails until each head is just above the surface of the wood, then use a nail set to drive it just below the surface.


Drill and countersink pilot holes for the top of the bookshelf. Attach it with glue and 2"" wood screws.














, Once the top of the bookshelf is secure, attach the bottom shelf.









Apply wood glue to the support blocks for the bottom shelf and set the shelf in position.
Drill and countersink pilot holes in the side of the bookshelf and attach the shelf with 2"" wood screws.
If you decided to use support blocks for the center shelf as well, install it now as you did the bottom shelf.

, A back panel gives a bookshelf a finished look and protects the paint on the wall behind the bookshelf.









Make sure the bookshelf is square. Tighten any screws if necessary to get the shelf to stand in place with perfect right angles.
Measure and cut the back panel.
Start in one corner and use 1"" brads to fasten the back panel in place.

, Trim or molding will give your bookshelf a custom look. If you've measured it to fit a particular nook in your home, the addition of trim can create the look of a built-in unit.

Attach 1"" x 2"" trim pieces to the side and bottom edges of the bookshelf with sixpenny nails and glue.













You may want to miter the corners of the trim pieces; the finished look is up to you.


Once the trim is in place, use a router with a 1/2"" round over bit to smooth sharp edges.













Glue and nail edge molding to the shelves taking care not to split the molding.
If you'd prefer to a sleeker look, use veneer banding instead of molding to cover the plywood edges.













Using an iron set to a low heat, apply iron-on birch veneer edge banding to the front edges of the plywood sides, shelves, top and bottom.
Then press the veneer tightly to the plywood using a J-roller. Cut the veneer to length with a utility knife.
Use a veneer trimmer to slice off the overhanging edges of the veneer and hand-sand the edges with 120-grit sandpaper so that it's flush with the plywood.



"
"
Sand the bookshelf.,
Paint or seal the unit.",How to Build a Bookshelf4," Proper sanding is essential to the final appearance of any finished surface and affects the success of the staining process. Stain will appear dark and blotchy if the surface isn't well-sanded.









For best results, use a 150 grit sandpaper to remove all handling marks and raised grain.
Use a hand block and/or pad sander to cover 100% of the surface with even pressure. Sand the entire surface, don't rely on your eye to sand only the spots that look irregular to you, sand the whole bookshelf. , The final touch is to put a protective coating on your new book shelf--whether that's paint or a clear finish.

Apply primer and paint. Primer helps the wood absorb the paint more evenly for a more uniform finish. Apply a coat of primer and let it dry. Sand the unit lightly and remove the dust with cheesecloth or a soft, cotton rag, Apply a coat of paint. After the first coat dries, sand again, dust and apply the final coat.













Choose a white primer if your paint color is light; choose gray if your paint color is dark. You can also have your primer tinted to match the color of your paint.


Apply a clear finish. If you've chosen a more exotic wood for your bookshelf, you'll want to use a clear, polyurethane finish to highlight the natural beauty of the grain. Apply the first coat and let it dry before sanding with a fine grit sandpaper. Remove the dust with cheesecloth or a soft, cotton rag and apply a second coat. Again, let it dry before sanding with a fine grit sandpaper. Apply a third and final coat of the finish.













Don’t spend a lot of time applying the finish by going over and over again. Just put on a nice thin even coat. Most small bubbles will come out on their own, or you will fix them when you sand. "

Determine if the ladder itself gels with your home/room.,
Evaluate the ladder’s condition.,
Identify an area to accommodate the ladder shelf.,
Consider what you'll put on the ladder’s shelves.",How to Turn a Broken Ladder Into Shelves1," Evaluate first whether the ladder will suit your current design style. For instance, what the ladder is made of will impact whether it suits your décor. Wooden ladders might look great in one room, while a steel one might be better in another.


Bring the ladder inside and see how the material looks inside your existing décor.;
, While you can certainly repurpose a broken ladder into shelving, you don’t want to use a ladder that is so damaged that it lacks functionality. Since the steps will be used as the shelves, there need to be at least a few of them in place or you'll need to be able to mend missing ones with ease. Do any repairs needed first.

, The ladder needs to fit; for example, a small nook space won't work if you're trying to create shelves from a 15 foot (4.6 m) ladder. Keep in mind that one half of the ladder will need to lean against the wall, meaning that you need to allow adequate space for it to protrude into the room.


Take measurements of both the ladder sides and the area to ensure a comfortable fit.

, This will help you to decide its best placement. It might be figurines, books, a collection of some sort, quilts, whatever.


Check that the desired shelf items can fit easily and safely on each step. Test out items you aren’t completely sure about before using them. You can also make use of poster tack to hold light things in place if needed.
Do you perhaps have a theme? For example, you might like to display your snow globe collection or your favorite set of leather bound books.

Calculate the dimensions of your space.,
Weld a steel frame to support the bookcase.,
Install the steel frame.,
Build the bookcase into and around the frame.,
Install a wooden doorstop above the door.,
Test the finished product.",How to Build a Hidden Door Bookshelf," First, measure how wide the bookshelf will need to be to cover the door. Then, determine whether or not you can put the bookcase far enough away from the soon-to-be-hidden door that it can swing outwards without hitting any neighboring walls or furniture. Make sure that the hidden door won’t swing into the bookshelf, either.

, Don't hinge the wood shelves directly; a steel frame made from box tubing will allow the door to swing easily and will support 500-1000lbs / 225-450kg (a full bookshelf) with no problem.


Calculate the size of the frame. The width should just cover the access door and be centered. The height should allow a minimum clearance from the floor for trim and base board and enough clearance from the ceiling for the metal frame barely below the crown.






Attach 3/4in (19mm) bolts to act as the pivot pins. First, weld a piece of scrap 1/4in (6mm) plate to each pivot point, one of which should be on the top of the frame and the other, directly opposite it on the bottom. Then,weld a bolt to each plate for extra strength. Finally, cut each bolt to 2in (5cm) long. Each pivot will fit inside a ceiling or floor mount that you will install later.






,

Build a ceiling anchor. An ideal piece of scrap steel (such as the one shown below) would already have holes in it for the pivot bolts. Size the ceiling anchor to span 3 joists. Add a short arm out to avoid rocking (which can be done with scrap steel). The short arm has to align with a joist or it will rock and break out the ceiling. Make the pivot point with a 3/4in (19mm) brass flange bearing inserted into a 1in (25mm) hole in the 2x2in (5x5cm) box.






Build a floor anchor. Unless it will be bolted to a concrete floor (in which case it can be much smaller than the ceiling anchor), simply repeat the process outlined above.






Position and place the top anchor, base anchor, and frame. Attach the top anchor loosely (letting it rock), slip in the frame and bottom anchor on the pin (with 2 washers on the pin above the bearing), then slide the whole set into place. Hang a plumb bob along the edge of the frame to tell if it is vertical in both directions.






When true, secure bolts on both ends. At the pivot point, split a tiny piece (about 3/8in / 19mm) of nylon tubing and slip it on the exposed bolt. This keeps the bearing from slipping down.






Test the swing of the door frame. For an accurate test, position 500lbs / 225kgs’ worth of people in it.







,

Build the bookcase in the frame. When sizing it, be sure to verify the clearance. You can make the swinging bookcase 2in (5cm) shallower than the other shelves to allow clearance behind it for when it is swung.






Build the two side bookshelves and install trim all around. To measure the clearance between the trim and the crown, use a credit card. The trim on the hinged side of the shelf-door should be attached to the fixed shelf; on the non-hinged side, however, it should move with the door. If the horizontal trim dives under it as the door opens, bevel notches in the trim on the right. If necessary, slightly round the horizontal pieces to slip underneath smoothly.






, This can simply be a block of wood with a strong magnet (ex. a door magnet) held in place where the frame should ideally rest. This will not only hit the steel to keep the door from closing too far, but also hold the door so that it doesn't float open.
, Make sure it swings nicely and looks inconspicuous.

Find a wall stud.,
Mount the bracket to the wall using the large wood screws.,
Stack books on the shelf.,
Finished.








",How to Create Invisible Shelves," This will become the ""sacrificial"" book that makes the shelf. Since it will be supporting other books, a large, hardcover book works best.






;
,









Open the sacrificial book's back cover and use your tape measure to find the halfway point.
Make a mark at the halfway point on the page.
Place a flat side of the L-bracket onto the page and trace the outline, using the marks you drew to keep it centered. If the bracket’s screw holes are also centered, line them up with the marks to make this easier.

,









Use your utility knife to cut into the pages of the book following the outline of the bracket. Make sure to cut deeply enough so the back cover of the book can be closed tight against the pages when the bracket is inserted.
Recycle the excised paper.
Place the L-bracket into the notch, making sure that the vertical bar of the “L” is pointing in the direction of the front cover of the book. This will enable you to flip the whole thing over and hang it right-side-up when it’s ready.
Make a notch in the top edge of the book for the L-bracket. This way the book can sit flush against the wall.

,









Get your drill out and drill through the holes in the L-bracket.
Screw the L-bracket to the book. The pages will rise up the screw as you insert it, so use your hand to hold the pages down.

,









Drill two holes near the outside corners of the book, one on each side.
Secure the pages by inserting screws into the holes.
Cover the inside back cover of the book in glue and close it.
Place a stack of books or some other type of weight on top and let it dry at least 8 to 12 hours. Unless you want the back cover of the book to flap open after you hang the shelf, cheating at this stage is not advisable.

, This is a vertical beam in the wall into which you can screw the L-bracket. To find it, knock along the wall until you find a place that doesn’t sound hollow. Another way to find a stud is to use a stud finder.









If drilling into a stud isn’t ideal or won’t work in your house, use anchor screws instead. These are suitable for both drywall and plaster walls. Make note of how much weight the anchor screws are rated to hold so that you don’t overload the shelf.

, To keep the shelf level, screw the bracket with a single screw at first, place a level across the book, make any necessary adjustments, and secure the shelf with a second screw.








, To hide the L-bracket, stack them up high, preferably from largest to smallest. Now let your friends try to figure it out.

Remove the hinges that hold the ladder together.,
Sand, clean and repair the ladder as required.,
Do any needed repairs to ensure the ongoing integrity of the ladder.",How to Turn a Broken Ladder Into Shelves2," Some ladders can be unhooked without a tool, whereas others might require the use of a screwdriver (an electric one is probably easiest). For the purposes of this project, you'll only be using one side of the ladder but nothing prevents you from turning both sides into wall-leaning shelves; simply do the same things to both sides.

, If it's a wooden ladder, it needs to be sanded to remove splinters and rough patches. Wood or super glue can be used to mend minor damage or dents.


Use a mild dish detergent and water to clean ladder.

, As noted earlier, if the rungs are damaged, you'll need to decide which need fixing and/or replacing and which can be left alone.

,, Cut out any sections needed to help the shelf platform slide onto the rung with ease. As you can see here, special cuts were required at the back of the shelf platform.

, You may wish to nail at an angle that will counteract the lean the ladder shelf will have when placed against the wall. You'll want the books, objects, etc., to stay in place and not slide off.

",How to Turn a Broken Ladder Into Shelves4," This means staining or painting the ladder if necessary. It might also need final adjustments or a last sanding.


If you're using a wooden ladder and you're going for a natural look, consider at least adding a clear coat of gloss to protect the wood.







, There are a few ways you can approach this:


If you do not have small children or overly curious pets at home, you could simply add chair leg pads to the backs of the ladder and lean the ladder piece against the wall.
However, for a more permanent solution, consider purchasing brackets and screws to secure the ladder to the wall.

, Arrange the items so they fit easily on each step––don't forget about adding something special to the top.

Repeat steps to make additional shelves as desired.",How to Build Simple Floating Shelves1," The size of the panel will correspond with the size of the finished shelf, so choose accordingly. You can either use a nice wood or plywood/MDF (medium-density fiberboard) and then apply paint or a nicer veneer later.









You should start with:

1 – 2×4
2 – Cedar Pickets


These boards are great, simple projects that work equally well will plywood, cedar, or nice sheets of maple or walnut.
When possible, use a table saw for clean, well-cut lines.;
, The first one will be cut into pieces and placed between your panels to create a hollow-core shelf that can fit over a shelf mount on your wall. The second will form the shelf mount itself. Note that the pieces forming the internal shelf framework will be placed narrow-side down within the paneling; this will add an extra 2 inches of height to your shelf.









The wood should be 1/2-1"" thick.
This piece form the u-shaped frame of your shelf.

, The two shorter pieces need to fit the width of your wood panels. The longer piece fits between these two pieces and covers the width. After cutting, place the strips onto the panel as a ""dry run."" They should form a perfect frame around three sides of the panel.









To get a perfect diagonal joint, cut one end of each short piece and both ends of the long piece at 45-degree angles so that all three pieces can fit together to form 90-degree angles in the corners.
Leave the front strip as is and cut an inch off of both shorter pieces, enabling you to tuck them behind the longer one once placed between the panels.
Always err on the side of ""too long"" when cutting. You can always cut off a little more, but you can't add it back., Set one panel down, place the three strips on the panel to form three continuous edges (a u-shape). Then run a line of wood glue along the top of each strip and place the second panel on top. Use finishing nails or a nail gun to attach the top panel to each strip.









If using wood glue, you'll need to use clamps to ensure that the the board stays in place as it dries.
For thicker wood, or for a sturdier build, skip the nail gun and use a power drill.

, Flip the first panel, the one that is now attached to the shelf framework, to expose the bottoms of the wooden strips. Again, run a line of wood glue along the top of each strip, place the free panel on top, and nail it to each strip.








, The more time, the better. Keep the clamps on to ensure it dries well, then leave the shelf until it is hardened and you can move on. Take the clamps off when it is finished drying.








, Once you've finished building, take your sander and even out the entire shelf. This make it smoother and more receptive to finishing.








, If using veneer, be sure to keep the grain of the wood consistent. From here, leave the stain to dry as you move on to the support bracket that holds you shelf to the wall.








, Do not confuse this with the overall dimensions of the shelf; the mount you make to fix the shelf to the wall will fit inside this hollow.









This is why the shelf ""floats."" The hollow part of the shelf hangs on a hidden u-shaped mount attached to the wall.

, Cut the strip so that it could fit perfectly as the 4th wall of your little shelf. When done, gently test it by trying to fit the board snugly into your shelf. This will form the base of the wall mount.









This would should be at least 3/4"" thick.
Some builders prefer to make this mount first. Then you can build the shelf around the mount, using it as a guide for measurements. Neither was is better, just personal opinion.

, These two strips are the ""arms"" that extend off the wall and hold the shelf up. They must fit perfectly into the hollow space or the shelf won't be flush. To find it the right measurement, simply measure the total width of the shelf and subtract the width of the thin strip of wood that is at the top of the frame.








, You are basically just remaking your framework, but a little thinner so that it fits inside the shelf. Using wood glue and a nail gun, create another u-shaped frame. Make sure you use a square edge to get the mounts perfectly 90-degrees. For bigger shelves or heavy wood, use a pocket joiner and power drill to create the mount -- it will be much sturdier.









For piece of mind, create a third or fourth support strip, identical to the two on the outside. You then end up with an E-shaped bracket that can old much more weight.

, Does it fit snugly inside the hollow shelf? If not, adjust it as necessary, sanding and cutting wood so that the mount fits as snugly as possible.









The wall mount will be hidden, so there is no need to polish or finish it.

, The best way to do this is to attach it directly to the wall studs within the wall. These can be located either with a stud locator or by knocking on the wall to search for places that don’t sound hollow.








, It should fit like a glove. You can either leave it sitting over the mount or take it back off, apply glue to the mount, and attach the shelf permanently.








, Note that the shelves can be different dimensions.

Cut an 18-inch hollow-core door.,
Cut cleats from a 2x4.,
Use a pencil and 4-foot level to mark where you want the shelf to sit.,
Pre-drill 1/4-inch-diameter holes at the stud locations.,
Cut away the corrugated cardboard cores at least 1-1/2 inches from the cut edge.Use a bread knife works to scrape off the glue, being careful not to gouge the wood.








,
Test-fit the shelf.,
Install the shelf.,
Nail the shelf to the cleat.",How to Build Simple Floating Shelves2," Clamp a straightedge guide to the door and make a lengthwise cut using a 40-tooth carbide blade.Don’t exceed 9 inches (22.9 cm) wide or you’ll start to weaken the cantilever strength of the shelf.








, Measure the space between the outer veneers of the door. This measurement will tell you how thick to cut your cleats. They should be as long as the inside of the door.








, Use a stud finder to mark the locations of the studs, marking these with a strip of masking tape.








, Hold the cleat straight against the line on the wall. Drill into the stud with a 1/8-in. bit and install a 1/4-in. x 3-1/2 in. lag screw into each stud.Make sure the screw is tight and straight.








,, The blank should fit over the cleat. If the shelf doesn't lay tight against the wall, use a block plane or sander along the back edge.








, Slide the shelf over the cleat. If you want the shelf to be permanently mounted, glue together the top of the cleat and the inside bottom edge of the door blank.








, Start at the middle, using a square as a guide, and work your way to each end.Use 1-inch brad nails spaced 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.Nail the bottom as well. If you wish for the shelf to be removable (and didn't apply glue), use counter-sunk screws instead of brads. Install them from the top and use a small sticker to cover the heads. The paint used on the shelf can be used to touch up the stickers to match.

Take your measurements.,
Prepare your pieces.,
Cut rabbet joints.,
Drill holes for adjustable shelving.,
Attach center shelf support blocks.,
Attach shelves and supporting materials.,
Attach your back panel.,
Attach the trim.,
Cut for the vent, if necessary.",How to Build a Built‐In Bookcase1," By this point, you should probably know where in your house you want to put the bookshelf.

The first step will be to measure that area’s height and width. Then determine a depth that it acceptable to you for your shelving.
Measure twice to make sure you got accurate measurements.
Be sure to measure the width from both the top near the ceiling, the middle, and lastly the bottom near the floor. This is because not all rooms’ walls, ceilings, and floors are perfectly square. You would want to be aware of this before you cut your supplies!;
, Once you have your measurements, begin with your desired depth and draw a straight line that distance away from the first edge of the plywood for the path you will cut.

Using a table saw, you will cut the plywood into straight sections of that width.
Remember the cut made by the table saw will take 1/8” out of the board. In order to maintain the full desired width of the shelf, position the table saw’s blade 1/8 inch outside the line you drew for your width.
After you complete that cut, measure your width from the freshly cut edge to the desired shelf width again.

Once again, cut outside your mark and repeat until you have produced the number of shelving lengths you have determined you will need.



, A “rabbet joint” is a simple groove that you will slice in the wood with a circular saw.

Set your circular saw to cut at a depth of 3/8 inch.
Cut along the top side of both the left and right ends of what will be your very top shelf.
Continue in 1/8 inch increments, cutting inward until the width of each end’s rabbet joint is as wide at the plywood.
This will allow the top shelf to rest squarely, upside down on the top for a square fit.

,

On what will be your side(s) (and center dividers, if applicable), mark the location of what will be the center shelf.
Securely clamp the pegboard on top to use as a template to drill through in order to create a grid of nice, even holes to insert pegs, allowing for adjustable shelving.
Take care with the depth to which you drill your holes. You should go no deeper than 1/8 inch less than the length of the pegs you intend to use to support your shelves. This way the pegs do not get stuck in the holes and there is enough left sticking out to adequately support your shelving. The best way to drill a consistent depth is to place a piece of tape on the drill bit and drill each hole just until the tape meets the surface of the board.
Begin by drilling 2 inches in from the front and the back edges and 4 inches above the bottom.
Continue working your way up drilling pairs of holes through the pegboard every 2 inches until 4 inches from the top.

, Measure and mark what will be the location of your center shelf. (Note: This shelf will be fastened and immobile, unlike the others, after installation).'


Position the 1 inch x 2 inch piece, cut to the depth of the shelving, as indicated above, with its top edge to where the secured middle shelf will rest upon.
Drill at least 2 pilot holes and sink screws through the 1”x2”, driving them below the surface of the wood, securing the 1”x2” to the side.
Then also drill at least 2 pilot holes and sink screws from the top, permanently securing the middle shelf to the same 1”x2”, ensuring stability and support for the unit.
Use wood filler to fill and cover the screws completely so they can no longer be seen.

, In the same manner as for the middle shelf, cut 1”x2”s the width of the shelves and use as support blocks for the bottom shelf.

Use the same steps as above. Drill pilot holes followed by 2 screws on the side securing the 1”x2” block to the side(s) and then 2 more pilots’ holes and screws from the top, securing the bottom shelf to the 1”x2” support.

Be sure to sink the screws well and cover with wood filler so they can no longer be seen.



,

Be sure that the now mostly assembled bookshelf is square.
Measure and cut a back panel of plywood.
Use 1 inch nails along the back panel, starting with one corner. Be sure to keep the bookshelf square as you finish attaching the back.

, This needs to be carefully measured and cut in order to fit perfectly.

Cut 1”x2” trim to the length of the top, sides, and bottom edges of the bookshelf. Also, cut a piece the width of the secured middle shelf that is visible from the front.
Using a miter box, cut the intersection of each piece of trim at a precise 45° angle.
Once trim is in place, nail down with finishing nails (ones with small heads that can be sank beneath the surface of the installed trim).
Use a handheld router with a ½” round over bit to make sharp edges on the trim smoother.
Fill all sunken nail holes with wood filler in preparation for staining or priming and painting.

, If bookshelf is to be placed over a heat register, you will need to create a vent so the air can enter the room.

Find a vent, similar to as pictured below and cut the needed space to accommodate the vent.
You may not want to actually install the vent until after you have stained or primed and painted the unit and attached trim.

"
"
Decide the size and number of shelves you need.,
Cut the plywood on a table saw or with a circular saw.,
Using a router and straight edge, rout slots into the sides 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) wide and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep.,
Trim the shelves.,
Lay one side flat on the ground with the slots facing up.,
Drive 2 inch (5.1 cm) screws through the side and into the edge of the shelf.,
Turn the unit over and drive screws in this side also.

,
Turn the unit over so the back is facing up.,
From the 16x48 scrap plywood, cut 5 pieces 2x32 inch.,
With the remaining plywood and/or additional scrap you have laying around, build a base that the casters will attach to.,
Decide the configuration of cans that you need.,
One problem you may have is the cans getting misaligned when they drop down.,
Another problem occurs when the gap is too large for the cans.,
Start using the rotating canned food shelf.",How to Build a Rotating Canned Food Shelf," This article will cover a 5-shelf system that is 32 inches (81.3 cm) wide, 24 inches (61.0 cm) deep and 64 inches (162.6 cm) tall.;
,


Cut one full sheet in half length-wise. From each half, cut a shelf at 32 inches (should leave 64 inches for the sides).
Cut the other full sheet in half length-wise also. Cut each half in thirds at 32 inches (81.3 cm) each.
Cut the half-sheet of plywood at 32 inches (81.3 cm). Cut the 32x48 piece in half (24x32). Set the remaining 16x48 piece aside for later. You should have 2-24x64 and 10-24x32.

, (An alternative is to attach rails that the shelves will rest on. The slot method is stronger and will not interfere with the rolling cans.)


The shelves need to have a 1:12 slope (1 inch drop for each 12 inches run).
For standard cans, the distance from the top of the input shelf to the top of the corresponding output shelf is 8 inches (20.3 cm).
For standard cans, the distance from the top of the input shelf, to the top of the next output shelf is 4 inches (10.2 cm).
For standard cans, the input shelf is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) shorter than the output shelf.
For larger cans, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to these dimensions.
Draw outlines for all slots.

, The finished outside width of the shelf system will be 32 inches (81.3 cm). The shelves will fit in a slot 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep. Therefore, the width of the shelves is actually 31 inches (78.7 cm). Each input shelf also needs to be trimmed on the back to allow a space for the can to drop. For standard cans, this gap needs to be 3.5 inches (8.9 cm).

, Insert the shelves into the slots and place the other side on top.

, Put two screws in each shelf.

,, Attach the pieces that were cut from the input shelves to prevent the cans from falling off the back.

, Turn the unit over so the front is facing up. Attach the 2x32 inch pieces to block the cans from falling out the front.

, Stand the unit upright and attach it to the base.

, Each row will need to be about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wider than the can. On the table saw, rip 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm)-wide strips from plywood, MDF, or dimensional lumber. MDF and lumber work best. Attach them to the shelves with wood glue.

,


A solution for this is to add a divider connecting the row dividing strips, filling the gap. Cut cardboard in a trapezoidal shape to fit over the two row dividers. Cut out the center material of the cardboard and glue the flaps to the row dividers.


, The can can get blocked, preventing other cans from dropping down.


A solution for this problem is to glue wedges at the back of the lower shelf. This will cause the can to roll forward before the next one locks it in. The wedges can be cut from the same material used for the row dividers. They should be large enough to move the can forward.


, Add labels to the front of each row to identify the contents and load cans in the top portion of each shelf.

"
"
Dry fit your shelf and prepare the area.,
Attach the shelf to your wall.,
Decide to stain or paint.,
Add the final touches.",How to Build a Built‐In Bookcase2,"

Remove any base molding from the area in the room where you plan to install the bookshelf.
Dry-fit the bookshelf to make sure all your measurements were precise and correct.

,

Use a stud finder to locate the studs behind the drywall and mark areas where studs are located.
Drill pilot holes through the back corners of the shelves, into wall studs you located..
Screw through the backboard into the studs.

This will give you the securest attachment to the wall.


Once again, fill all screw holes and cover all screw with wood filler.

,

Decide whether you would like to wood stain your newly installed bookshelf or prime and paint it, likely depending on your decor in the room you chose to install in.
Sand the surfaces down and wipe with a damp cloth to remove surface dust and debris.
Either apply your stain with a brush (removing excess with a rag) or prime followed by at least two healthy coats of paint
Do the same to your cut and ready-to-be-installed shelves.

,

Insert the pegs and the adjustable shelves to your desired configuration and satisfaction
Enjoy your handmade, completed, built-in bookshelf!

, This is usually a more durable than normal cotton or flannel cloth. It will hold up to wear and tear.

, A small easy chair will need four yards (3.7m) of fabric, while a large chair will need over seven and a half (6.9m) yards of fabric., You may also need sheets of thick foam core for the seat.

, These are the main way you will secure the fabric, foam and batting. Also, purchase upholstery thread, needles and tacks for a more professional look.

, Take them from all-angles so that you can refer to them if you lose or mislabel a piece of cloth.Consider drawing a diagram and labeling the diagram as well as the pieces of cloth.

, Remove the legs using a screwdriver., Use a seam ripper along the edge of the bottom, the sides and the back. Then, remove staples and tacks with pliers.


Loosen stubborn areas with a box cutter.
Note the order in which you took off the fabric. You can mimic the layering method used by the original furniture makers.

, Label them with a piece of masking tape and a pen. Be as specific as possible.

, Set them by the piece of fabric they are connected to. Later, you can cut new piece of cardboard or reuse the existing pieces.


Make notes as to what places on the couch require foam core, batting and tack strips.

, Set the pieces of old fabric atop it. Try to position them as close together as possible to avoid wasting fabric., Cut out the pieces one by one with fabric scissors. Label them immediately with the tape you used to label the original pieces.

,, Measure them. Purchase plastic cord to use as a piping base.

, Cut strips that are one inch (2.5cm) wide and as long as the original piping. Wrap the cord vertically in the middle of the fabric.


Pin it in place. Run your sewing machine needle as close as possible to the fabric near the cord, without going over it. You will capture the cord inside the fabric.If you don’t have a sewing machine, hand sew as close to the piping as possible.

,, However, use tack strips where they were originally used. They help to stretch the fabric so that it won’t come loose.

, Refer to the picture of your chair so that you can see how excess fabric on the arms is folded and attached.

, For example, start by covering the length of the arms with fabric and staples. Then, run the piping along the entire front edge of the arm.


Follow by covering the arms with foam, batting and fabric.If you are having problems creating a square edge, lay down cardboard tacking strips underneath the fabric, right behind the piping. Then, fold the fabric up and around the arm.

, You will need to reach the fabric underneath and secure it with staples. Test it several times before continuing to ensure it doesn’t catch., Then, hammer the tack strip onto the back frame of your easy chair., You’ve officially got yourself a newly-upholstered easy chair!

Plan your project.,
Choose your paint.,
Decide if you want to use stencils or decals to accentuate the bat, or if you need to mask off parts of it with tape.,
Prepare the bat.,
Use masking tape to protect any surfaces, such as gripping surfaces on the handle, or the label, that you do not want to paint over.

,
Prime the wood with a good primer.,
Sand the primer lightly with a very fine grit sandpaper, and only sufficiently to remove runs or drips.,
Spray your finished paint on the bat, using good technique for good results.,
Allow the paint to dry and cure thoroughly when you are done.",How to Paint a Baseball Bat," Most painting projects have better success if they are thoroughly planned. Decide how you want your bat to look when you are finished, what colors you will use, and how long you will need to protect it for the paint to cure.;
, You will want to use a good quality paint that won't chip, fade, or peel, so you will probably want to use an enamel, epoxy, or polyurethane paint for this project. These are available in aerosol cans, which are easy to use and offer a wide variety of colors.

, Wood bats have a manufacturer's label that should not be covered if it can be avoided, since this helps the batter orient the bat so the proper side is used to contact the ball upon swinging it, but if the bat is being painted to display, and not use, this will not be an issue.

, Lightly sand the finish so the new paint will adhere properly. Use a smooth sandpaper, depending on how rough the condition of the bat is when you are beginning. For a bat in good condition, a 200 or 220 grit sandpaper, and move to a fine steel wool to give it a smooth texture before painting. Start with a coarser grit if there is damage you will want to buff out.

,, Wood does not paint exactly the same as metal, so a primer/sealer is probably a better choice than a rust inhibitor metal primer, but for best results, an enamel undercoat can be used. This is a product used by professional painters for durability and performance under a variety of conditions, so it is up to you to decide if your bat is worth the investment. If not, use any exterior grade spray primer.

, Wipe away any dust, using a tack cloth or a rag dampened with mineral spirits, then allow to dry.

, Keep the paint spray moving, holding the can about 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the surface, and watch for drips or runs. Using several light coats will often gives better results than one heavy coat.

, Apply any new decals, striping, or other embellishments when you are finished.

Cover the staples with upholstery nail heads.",How to Web a Chair Seat," Look for webbing made of cotton or nylon for a nice look and comfortable seat. If you have a choice of colors, choose the colors you prefer. One or two colors gives you simplest look and process.


Jute webbing is another option, but this is typically used when a cushion will go over it and may not give you the look you want or be comfortable for sitting on.;
, Set the end of your measuring tape at the back edge of the chair seat. Extend the tape out and find the number that is closest to the front edge of the seat. Write this number down and label it “back to front” to keep track of which measurement it is.If the chair has an irregular shape, e.g. it is not a square or rectangle, you may need to take multiple measurements that account for the parts which may be longer. It may be easier to take a measurement for each strip so you can cut each strip to the exact length that you need.

, Set the end of the tape measure on either the right or left side of the chair, whichever one makes it easier to read the tape. Write down the number that is closest to the edge of the seat. Label it “side to side.”


Again, note that more than one measurement may be necessary if the chair shape is not symmetrical.

, Since the strips of fabric will extend over the edge of the chair, they need to be longer than the seat itself. Adding two inches (5 cm) will give you one inch to work with on each end of the strip.If you measured separately for each strip, be sure to add the extra two inches to each measurement.

, Using the tape measure, mark with a pen on the webbing the length you need for the back to front strips. Use scissors to cut the strips, laying them on the chair as you cut them to determine exactly how many you need to cut.When you web the chair, you have the option of placing the strips tightly side by side or spacing them an inch or more apart. This decision will affect how many strips you need.

, Lay the webbing out and use the tape measure to make marks based on the side to side measurements. Don’t forget to add the two inches (5 cm). Use sharp scissors to cut the strips and lay them side to side on the seat. Space them as you will when you attach them.


Again, using wider spacing means you need less strips.

, Once you have the strips cut so that you have enough for the whole seat, lay them aside. Divide them up in a pile for back to front and a pile for side to side. If you have strips of various length, try to keep them arranged in order.

, Starting from the middle will help you adjust the spacing as you lay strips outward on each side. This gives you more flexibility than if you start on one side or the other., By tucking ½ inch (1.27 cm) at the end of the strip under, you hide the frayed end. Line the strip up so that it hangs ½ inch over the back of the seat and use a staple gun to attach it to the seat.Place two or three staples if you want to make the strip more secure.
If folding the webbing over the back of the seat is not an option, e.g. when there is a bar that sits on the back edge, staple the strip on top of the seat so the folded crease lines up with the back of the seat.

, Once the webbing is secured to the back of the seat, pull it forward to the front edge of the chair so that it is taut. It’s okay to make the strips a little loose if you want to, but the tighter you pull them, the firmer the seat will be., In the same way that you pulled the strip over the back edge, pull it tightly over the front edge and tuck it under. Place one or two staples in the webbing to attach it to the chair. Be sure to keep it tight when you staple it., Following the same procedure as you used with the first strip, attach the second strip. Space it as close as you want to the first strip. Be sure to staple the back first, stretch the strip, then staple the front.

, To check your spacing each time, lay one strip to the left of the first and then one strip to the right. Then go back to the left and back to the right, stapling each in place as you go. When you get close to the edges, you’ll be able to tell if you need to trim a strip down lengthwise.

, When you get to the edges of the seat, you may not have enough room to place a full two inch strip. If this is the case, lay the strip on the seat and make a mark for how wide it should be. Cut the strip down its length and attach it to the seat.

, Take one of the strips with the side to side measurement and attach it like you did the first round of strips. Tuck the end under and staple it to the outside edge of the seat. Only staple one end of the strip for now.

, Just as you did the first time through, lay a strip to the left of the first strip and staple just one end. Be sure to staple the same side as you stapled on the first strip. Then lay a strip to the right and continue going back and forth, stapling the same end each time.

, Grab the unstapled end of one of the strips. Take it over the forward strip closest to the stapled end and under the second forward strip. Then alternate going over and under each strip until you reach the end., In the same way that you have stapled the rest of the strips, staple this one. Tuck it under and staple it to the outside of the chair seat. Place two or three staples if you wish.

, Once the first strip is woven through the first layer, repeat the same process with the rest of the strips. You can alternate the weaving pattern, if you want, by going under first and then over the second strip. Staple each strip to the seat when you finish weaving it., To finish off the webbed chair and give it an elegant look, pound upholstery nails into the chair covering all of the staples. Put two nails in each strip, or as many as you need to cover the staples. You can put more nails than staples if you like that look better.Use a rubber mallet to pound the nails.

Choose to either reupholster an existing bench or make a new one.,
Measure an existing frame or decide how large you want your bench to be.,
Purchase a piece of 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch plywood from a home improvement or lumber store.,
Buy thick foam core and in a size that is greater than or equal to the size of your piece of wood.,
Clear a large workspace or table.,
Drill holes into the corners for the legs.,
Buy a large roll of batting from a craft store.,
Cut a piece of batting in the exact size of the foam core and plywood base.

,
Set your wood base on top of the worktable.,
Glue the foam to the wood base using foam glue.,
Glue the batting to the top of the foam with a layer of foam glue.,
Pick your wood base, foam and batting off the table.,
Lay the wood base facing down on top of the sheet of batting.,
Choose a mechanical staple gun, an air compressor staple gun or an electric staple gun to affix the batting and fabric.,
Starting at the center of one side, fold the batting around the bench and onto the back of the base, pulling fairly hard to create tension.,
Staple every inch.,
Create round corners by pulling the batting around the center of the corner and affixing it right at the corner.,
Continue stapling until the entire edge of the batting is wrapped around the foam core and secured.

,
Cut the excess batting from the bottom of the base.,
Lift the bench up again.,
Replace the bench base face down on top of the upholstery material.,
Wrap the fabric around one end of the bench and secure it with the staple gun.,
Continue around the perimeter of the bench.,
Cut excess fabric outside of the staple line.,
Consider placing a bottom cover on the bottom of the bench to protect the upholstery.,
Staple the bottom cover over the raw upholstery edges every inch or two.

,
Reattach the legs or base.

",How to Upholster a Bench," If you are reupholstering an existing bench, you will need to unscrew the legs and reattach them later.


If you are reupholstering a bench, you will also need to remove staples at the back of the base with needle nosed pliers. Then, remove the fabric, batting and foam so that you can replace them. It is a good idea to replace them unless they are relatively new.
Keep your piece of fabric to use as a template for your fabric bench cover.;
, If you are creating a bench from scratch, you can customize it to the space you want to fill. Measure the area in inches.

, Ask the store to cut it to the exact size that you measured.

, Your foam core should be at least three inches (7.5cm) thick to assure comfort. Purchase one and a half times the size in upholstery or outdoor fabric.


Just as home improvement stores will cut plywood for little to no cost, large fabric stores can cut foam core to size.
Use an electric knife to cut foam core at home., It is easiest to upholster a bench if you are able to slide the fabric and batting along a smooth surface.

, Practice attaching them before you start upholstering to ensure they work for your piece of furniture. You will need a drill and screws for this process.

, You will need two and a half times the amount of batting as you need foam core.

,, Then, get ready to layer your foam and batting.

, Make sure to apply an even, thin layer atop the wood base. Let it sit according to package directions.

, Apply an even layer, and then wait for it to dry.

, Lay and center a large piece of batting on the table. It will need to wrap around the base and foam to create the upholstered look.

, Center it on the table so that you will have more than enough batting on every side to wrap around the back of the base.

, Plug in the staple gun, as needed, and refill it with staples., Affix the batting to the base with staples within the first inch and a half of the edge of the base.

, Work from the center of each side out toward the corner Use a hammer to knock loose staples into the wood.

, Create square corners by folding one side of the batting in toward the other side of the corner. Then, pull the batting up on the second side and affix it with several staples to the base.

,, Make sure not to cut below the staple line.

, Place your material upside down on the table. Center it.

, Center it as well.

, Pull it taught before you staple it.

, Fold the corners in either by creating two darts on each side or by doing a square fold. Staple at least every inch, with more staples in the corners.

, Use fabric scissors to ensure a straight, even cut.

, Cut a piece of fabric that is one inch smaller than your wood base on all sides. Choose interfacing, cotton or synthetic fabric.,,"

Pull it across the front of the seat.

,
Loop it around the right rail and then the front rail so it is tight against the right front chair leg.

,
Take the strand to the back rail.,
Cross along the back rail and loop it around the left rail and then the back rail so it is tight against the back left leg.

,
Bring it to the front rail and continue the sequence, moving counterclockwise around the seat, until you reach the end of the piece of rush.,
Tie another piece of rush to the end with a square knot and trim off the excess.,
Insert corrugated cardboard as padding after weaving approximately 10 times around the perimeter of the seat.,
Remove the temporary tack, tie on another piece of rush and continue in the same counterclockwise fashion over the cardboard until you completely cover the side rails with rush.

,
Change the weaving pattern to a “figure 8” to fill in the rest of the front and back rails.,
Hide the end of the rush by tacking it to the bottom of the front or back rail, and remove all temporary tacks.

",How to Rush a Chair," Do not to mar the frame of the chair.


Remove any tacks with pliers.;
, The rush comes in a coil of 100 feet (30.48 meters) or more.

,,,,,, Loop it around the back rail and then around the right rail so it is tight against the back right leg.

,,


Knock the rushes tight against each other with a wooden block and hammer.
Install temporary tacks through the last rush on all sides to help prevent them from slipping.

, The knot should be positioned under the seat so it is not visible.

,


Place a temporary tack holding the end of the last piece of rush.
Cut pieces of cardboard into 4 triangles that are nearly as long as the side rails.
Cut off the top corner of each triangle.
Slip the side corners of each triangle into the woven rush near each leg.

,,


Place a temporary tack on the side rail and then thread the end of the rush up through the center opening of the seat. The temporary tack holds the woven part in place while you finish the seat.
Pass the rush over the front rail, up through the center opening, over the back rail and up through the opening again. Repeat this figure-8 pattern until the front and back rails are filled in.

Let the chair dry for 7 days before you sit in it.",How to Paint a Cane Chair," When you paint a wicker chair, select an area that is well ventilated to protect you from paint fumes and set the chair on a drop cloth to protect your floor from paint.;
, Before painting wicker chairs, you need to strip the old finish, otherwise the new paint won't stick.


Clean your cane chair with a mild detergent, water and a bristle brush.
Put on safety equipment, such as goggles, gloves and a face mask before you refinish cane furniture. Paint and stripper may contain chemicals that can cause skin rashes, and paint chips may get in your eyes or lungs, creating health problems.
Apply paint stripper to the cane chair with a brush if paint chips still remain after you have washed the chair. When you refinish cane furniture, be sure to follow the paint stripper manufacturer's instructions.
Let the stripper stay on the chair the correct amount of time so that it will liquefy the old paint. Remove the stripper with a wire brush.

, When you refinish cane furniture, you need to coarsen up the cane so that the paint will stick.

,,


Use a compressor sprayer, spray paint or a brush to paint on wood primer. When you paint a cane chair, the primer will ensure that the new paint adheres, and if you selected a much darker or lighter color, the primer will help with the hue transition.
Let the chair dry for 8 hours.
Turn the chair over and apply another coat of primer to the chair. When painting wicker chairs, you want to make sure to paint all the weaves. Upending the chair and adding an additional coat ensures you cover the entire surface.

, When you paint a cane chair, you want the final coat of primer to completely dry before adding the final coats of paint.

,


Use oil-base indoor/outdoor or latex paint on your wicker chair. Oil base paint sticks to cane, lasts a long time, provides good coverage, and flexes with the chair. Latex paint is made with water and plastic resins, and is easier to work with because it dries faster than oil base paint and you can clean brushes with water instead of paint thinner.
Follow the procedure for applying primer, and apply 2 coats of your finish paint.

, You want your cane chair to absorb all the paint and completely dry before you use it.

",How to Make a Milk Crate Ottoman," Make sure that there is a ledge on at least two opposite sides from each other. You’ll need these to rest your plywood or particle board on later, so don’t use a crate if its sides are totally smooth on the inside.The depth of the filing ledges from the rim may vary by design. Generally they’re about a quarter- to a half-inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) below the rim.
Measure the ledges' depth from the rim before buying other materials so you can pick up an equally thick length of plywood or particle board that will fit snugly inside the rim.;
, Choose any bottom corner of the crate for a starting point. Use your glue stick to apply a bead of glue along the plastic on one side along its bottom. Line up the end of your first strand of sisal rope with the edge of the corner and press the rope firmly into the glue.Expect milk crates to vary greatly in design. Some may have a recessed bottom, while others may be totally flat on each side. Some may offer lots of surface area to attach glue, while others have very little.
Before you start gluing, it may be advisable to do a test-wrap with the rope just to see how it looks. This way you can make any alterations necessary to please your tastes before committing yourself.

, Apply more beads of glue along the bottom of the side that you started with. However, only apply glue a few inches in advance of the rope. As you go, press the rope into the glue and hold it in place for a few moments before applying more beads of glue. Give each section of rope a chance to set into the glue before moving on. Gently pull the rope taut before pressing a section into the glue. This way your rope will wrap around the crate nice and tightly without any slack. At the same time, though, avoid pulling too hard, since the glue hasn’t had a chance to fully dry.

, Once you've finished gluing your rope around the first side, gently pull it tight around the next corner. Apply more glue at the bottom corner of the next side to the crate and press the rope into it. Then continue along the length of that side's bottom as you did with the first side. Repeat around the next two sides so the rope wraps the very bottom of the crate all the way around its sides., Once you have wrapped the bottom of all four sides, continue wrapping toward the crate’s top in the same fashion, adding one layer at a time. However, as you add each additional layer of rope, also apply beads of glue along the top of the preceding layer, in addition to the sides of the crate. Press the new layer of rope into both beads for an even more secure bond.This will take a while, and it may also may use up a lot of glue. For the most secure bond, you can apply glue along every available surface area, including the entire length of each preceding layer of rope. However, you can also simply add an inch-long bead (2.5 cm) every few inches instead in order to use fewer glue sticks.

, Use a measuring tape to determine the space between each pair of inside walls. Be sure to measure both the interior's width and length, even if the crate appears to be perfectly square, since this may only be a trick of the eye. Also make sure you make your measurements above the filing ledges, rather than measure the distance between their edges. Remember that the ottoman's top will be resting on these, so you don't want to make it so small that it will fall between the filing edges, Use your crate’s interior dimensions to pencil an outline on your plywood or particle board. Then cut the wood to size. Place your board inside the rim of your crate to make sure it fits. If it does, place the board on top of your cushion foam and trace another outline. Then use fabric scissors to cut your foam.Plywood and particle board will both suffice for this project. If you have extra plywood handy, great. If not, go with particle board to save money, since it’s cheaper and will be out of view once your project’s finished.

, Use more glue (or any other form of adhesive) to bond the bottom of your foam to the top of your board. Don’t worry about creating the most secure bond ever. This step is merely to reduce the chances of the two separating as you attach fabric after this (which would make that step more frustrating than it needs to be), so as long as the two aren’t sliding off each other, you’re fine., First, lay the fabric out facedown on your worktable. Place your cushion on top of it, with the bottom of the wood facing up. Adjust its position so at least six inches (15.24 cm) of fabric border the cushion on all sides. Then use your fabric scissors to cut out your piece of fabric.The extra fabric along each side of the cushion should be wide enough to pull over the cushion’s side, covering it completely, plus a couple inches of the wooden board’s bottom.
Before you start cutting the fabric, test this out by pulling its free end over the corresponding side of the cushion and its bottom. If it doesn’t cover enough of the bottom to staple it there, readjust the cushion’s position to add more fabric along each side, and then repeat.

, First, ask a partner to help hold the fabric still as you pull it over each side. If no one’s available, choose a side to start with and then place weights on the others to anchor them in place. Then pull the fabric as tightly as possible (without dragging it away from the opposite side of the cushion) and staple it to the bottom of the wooden board. Repeat along the next three sides. Then fold the loose corners of fabric over the bottom of the board and staple them there, too.If your staple gun doesn’t drive the staples all the way into the particle board, simply go over them with a hammer to drive them in.
Avoid using nails or screws, since the board is pretty thin and the foam will compress under weight (meaning that the sharp ends of nails and screws run the risk of poking your feet or bottom through the foam).

, This step isn’t strictly necessary. However, if you’d like to use the inside of your crate as storage space (or alternate between more than one cushion, each with a different fabric), then use a cut length of thick ribbon to create a handle. Simply hold the two free ends together and staple them both to the board, toward its edge, so it sticks out from underneath when the cushion is flipped upright.,"

Plan the bench location.,
Purchase your mudroom bench.,
Account for hinges, if necessary.,
Move mudroom items out of the way.,
Assemble the bench, if necessary.,
Improve bench comfort with accessories.,
Catch dirt from shoes with a rug or mat beneath the bench.,
Create separated storage in your bench with organizers.,
Finish your bench with paint or wood stain, if necessary.,
Clean the bench weekly.,
Refinish the bench when necessary.",How to Set Up a Mudroom Bench," Benches near the door to your mudroom will be convenient for quickly putting on or taking off your shoes.But if your mudroom is narrow, this can create a bottleneck, making it difficult for others to bypass anyone already sitting on the bench. Position your bench against the wall opposite the door to avoid entryway congestion.

Mudroom benches are generally positioned against walls to save space and prevent the bench from becoming a cumbersome obstacle.
Many mudrooms have wall hangers for jackets. Tall benches may make it impossible to hang long jackets from these hangers if it is positioned beneath them.Measure and record the dimensions of your mudroom and its door with a tape measure. Keep these with you when purchasing with your bench so you know your mudroom’s size limitations.;
, Mudroom benches can be found at many home centers and furniture stores. When choosing a bench, keep its height in mind. Taller benches will allow for better storage. Shoes and boots can be tucked away beneath benches to optimize your use of mudroom space.

For a truly unique bench, hire a carpenter to make one or look for one made by a woodworking artisan. Amish craftsmen frequently make unique pieces of functional furniture, like mudroom benches.
Some benches may need to be assembled. These are ideal for mudrooms with narrow doorways, as bench pieces are often more maneuverable than pre-assembled, whole benches.

, Many mudroom benches try to optimize space by including a storage area on the inside of the bench. This area is often accessed by opening the hinged top of the bench. If your bench is too close to the wall, when opened, it may gouge or scratch the wall.Purchase adhesive wall protectors from your local hardware store and attach these to the wall to protect it from damage.

, Umbrella stands, carpets, standing coat-racks, and similar items can clutter your mudroom, making it more difficult to set up your bench. Move these items off to the side or remove them from the mudroom so it is free of obstacles.

Some benches may be cumbersome and heavy. Carpets, especially, can be dangerous tripping hazards when moving these kinds of benches.

, Benches purchased from big box stores or furniture stores like Ikea may require assembly. Generally, furniture like this comes with simple tools (like Allen/hex wrenches), fasteners, and instructions. Follow the instructions to assemble the bench.

Mudrooms that are particularly small may not be large enough for you to comfortably put together your bench inside.
If your mudroom is too small to put your bench together inside, construct major parts, like the bench top and bottom, maneuver these into the mudroom, and fasten them together when inside.

, Add padding to the top and back of your bench. Padding for patio furniture usually works well and can be bought at most home centers and general retailers. Prevent padding from sliding by placing a no-slip mat under the padding.No-slip mats (or similar material) can be purchased at most home centers and general retailers. You may want to prioritize mats with weak adhesive backing for greater stability.

, Mudroom benches are used mainly for putting on and taking off shoes. Because of this, dirt and mud often collect around the front and underneath benches. Prevent dirt from spreading around your home by placing mats and carpet in these locations.

If you plan on storing shoes beneath your bench, you can place shoe trays here to similarly catch dirt and mud., Keep the items stored inside your bench organized with dividers, bins, and totes. Purchase totes and dividers from general retailers or craft stores. Keep in mind the space available inside the bench when buying organizers.

Totes and plastic organizers can sometimes look tacky. Substitute woven baskets or finished wooden crates for a classier option., Finish will protect the surface of benches and make cleaning them easier.Many purchased benches will already be finished. If you’ve purchased a used bench from a yard sale, you may need to sand the surface to remove loose paint before painting or staining.Paint and stain in a well-ventilated area to prevent the buildup of dangerous fumes. Wear rubber gloves when staining to prevent your hands from being discolored.
Prevent the accidental spread of paint or wood stain by laying a cover, like newspaper or a drop cloth, beneath the bench while working on it.

, Wipe down your bench once a week with lint-free cloth dampened with a mild soap, like dish soap, and water. Rinse soap from the cloth afterward and wipe remaining soap from the bench with the cloth. Prevent spotting by removing any leftover water on the surface with a clean, dry cloth.Depending on the finish, you may be able to use a wood polish or conditioner to improve its appearance. In most cases, wood polish and conditioner will not work well on painted surfaces.

, As time passes, your finish may lose its luster or begin to peel. In these situations, you’ll need to refinish the wood to protect it and restore its appearance. Lightly sand its surface to remove loose paint if necessary, then reapply paint or wood stain as you would normally."

Note the possible issues such a chair might have.,
Fix any structural damage before fixing the surface.,
Concentrate on fixing the finish of the chair.,
Remove the sanded dust using a brush and dustpan or even a vacuum cleaner nozzle for more thoroughness.,
Match the wood stain to the chair.,
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing the stain.,
Brush the stain onto the chair.,
Leave to dry.,
Smooth by sanding over your work.,
Seal using an appropriate wood varnish.,
Leave the sealant to set for 24–28 hours (or whatever the manufacturer has recommended).,
Add another one to two coats of varnish, following the same process and waiting times.,Leave the final varnish coat un-sanded.,
Replace any leather or fabric insert areas of the seat or back of the chair that are worn or frayed.",How to Restore an Antique Wood Swivel Chair," When examining a wood swivel chair at an auction or antique store, look for such problems as chipped wood, a poor luster, cracked finishing, uneven wear and broken parts. Consider whether the chair is solid enough to be worth salvaging and if parts or mimic parts can be made for the chair. Another thing to check for is insect damage; if the chair has holes in it, does this effect the look or even the stability of it? Once you're satisfied, make you purchase and proceed with restoring it!
, It is important to make the chair sturdy again if it isn't before you attempt to restore the chair's finish, or else you risk it falling apart on you as you work on it. If the swivel mechanism is broken, can you replace it with another one from spare parts (ask an antique store) or can you get a new one soldered for you by a manufacturer or specialist such as a carpenter or chair repairer? Indeed, if the swivel mechanism needs replacing, unless you are keen to work it out and possibly make errors, or you know what you're doing, it's recommended to get some professional help. You could always ask to learn from them at the same time! In addition:

Replace nuts, bolts, screws, etc. that are rusted or worn
Fix any of the chair's support rungs if needed
Fix any missing pieces

, Sand the wood using a 10 grit sandpaper or sandpaper sponge. Aim to smooth over any rough parts, as well as create a consistent surface all the way across the chair, down the legs, on the back support, etc. This step must not be skipped because it removes years of ingrained dirt, chips, etc., that will show up if you stain over them without removing them. On the plus side, sanding is a therapeutic activity, or you can always cheat and use and electric sander to speed up the process!, A damp wipe will pick up the last of the fine particles., When purchasing, try to match the stain color as closely to the original as possible. That will help to maintain its old style look and keeps its value higher., Stir well before use., Use a natural bristle brush and be generous with the stain layer, as the wood will soak up a lot of the stain. Wipe off any excess., Once dry, use a sanding sealer over the stain. When applying this with a natural bristle brush, follow the grain of the wood at all times, and try to keep your strokes as long and even as possible, without too much overlap., Use 280 grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge. Clean off the resulting sanding dust using either a damp cloth or a vacuum., Follow the manufacturer's suggested method of application, although it is usual to apply with a rag or foam brush., Sand once again using the same 280 grit., Being careful now will pay major dividends in the future, preventing the chair from cracking or warping later.,, These are best left until last, after the chair finish has been improved so that there is no chance of staining. It is a good idea to try to match the original texture and color as much as possible if there is an insert of any kind. If the seat or backing are all wood, then you're already done!"

Hang the chair.",How to Make a Hammock Chair," Canvas seats can be made to fit any size person, or project. For a small child, 2 yards (1.8 m) of the canvas will be appropriate, while adults will need 3-4 yards of fabric to form a proper seat. Most canvas should come at a standard width of 1.75 yards.If you want a deeper chair, fold the canvas long-ways, making your cuts along the longer edges of the fabric. If you want your chair wider, cut along the short side. In general, the short-side cut makes a better chair.;
, Fold the canvas in half, short-ways. Orient the folded edge to your left. Mark a point about 7 inches to the left of the top right corner and draw a light diagonal line with pencil, toward the bottom right corner. This is where you'll cut.


Again, make sure the folded edge is oriented to your left. You want to cut the unfolded side of the fabric.

, Go slowly, taking care to avoid creating a raggedy edge to work with. If you do, don't worry too much, because you can fold it over later while you're assembling and creating the edges. Open up the canvas and spread it out to work.


You should have a four-sided shape, with two angled edges of equal length, a long side and a short side. Orient the fabric so the shortest side is at the top.

, Fold each edge back half an inch, then fold it again and iron. Pin them in place, and then stitch the fold twice in two parallel lines to reinforce it. Hemming the top and bottom of the chair seat will help to prevent tearing after frequent use.


Hem the diagonal edges as well, but only once. After hemming the long and short sides, fold the diagonals that you cut earlier about a half inch, as you did the other edges. Pin, press, and sew the edge to reinforce it.

, Fold an inch and a half pocket back on each hemmed diagonal edge, then iron. Sew two reinforced lines along the hem, creating a pocket seam large enough to pull the rope through.


Reinforce your beginning and ending with back stitches. These pockets are going to be holding your weight, so they need to be secure.

, Get creative and use your fabric paint to express yourself through your hammock chair. To prevent a mess, consider placing your canvas on a large sheet of cardboard.


Consider painting both sides as you will see the back and bottom of the chair.
Allow for ample dry time before proceeding to next step.
You can also use printed fabric, but be sure it is upholstery weight or outdoor fabric to ensure its strength.

, Mark two holes at each end of the dowel, at 2” and 4”. Then drill through the holes using your 3/8"" bit. Sand the hole to remove any little burrs and clean up the drilling. If you like the natural wood tone, you can leave it or, you can stain the dowel if desired.

, Tie a large knot at one end of the 16’ rope, leaving about 3” of a tail beyond the knot. Using a lighter, you can also melt the end of the rope slightly to prevent fraying in the long-term.


Start threading the unknotted end through the dowel and canvas. Guide the down through the outer hole in the dowel and then up from the widest corner of one side of the canvas seat to the narrow corner at the top.
Measure approximately 3 feet from your first knot, and tie another knot. Thread the rope up through the inner hole of the dowel so that the knot you just tied rests against the bottom of the dowel (the opposite side as the first knot).

, Start by threading it down through the 4” (or inside) hole on the other side of the dowel. Measure 3 feet from the loose end and tie a loose knot. This knot will rest against the bottom of the dowel. Thread the loose end of the rope down though the other canvas pocket, starting at the narrow end and emerging from the wider end.

, Guide it up through the last hole in the dowel. Measure 3” from the loose end and tie a knot, leaving a 3” tail. This knot will rest on the outside of the dowel. When finished, the knots should be positioned on the dowel.


If the two lengths of rope hanging below the dowel are not even, adjust the knots as needed before pulling them tight.

, Find the center of the rope above the dowel and tie a knot with 8” to 10” of excess above it. Attach the spring link, and then your quick link to the excess rope above the knot. Screw the hanging hook into a ceiling beam or large tree branch that can support your weight, then hang the link from it.

, Visit the home improvement store to find plywood to create the bench seat and possibly a small shelf underneath. 1″x 2-1/4″ pieces may work well.

You’ll need enough plywood to make two long rectangle boxes inside the bench (sizes will vary from the back of the two chairs to the desired bench length). If you plan to add a shelf, you will also need pieces of wood to make the slats.
Purchase a flat piece of plywood that will become the actual bench. Measure the width and length to arrive at the right size.






Pick up several 3” screws (at least seven) that will be used to pull the bench together.
Don’t forget to purchase or find your electric drill to make the process go quickly.







, Go for something that is made for furniture or try a stain if all the wood is the same color.

Consider picking up nail hole fill. To make the job look professional, you’ll want to cover the screws and nails before you paint.

, Cover the plywood seat with the batting and then create the seat by covering and adhering to the bottom using a staple gun or Super Glue."

Unscrew these screws and lift your seat out of the frame. If your seat pops into the frame without screws, you can simply pop it out to remove it., Make a mark that designates the front and back of the seat. Knowing the seat's orientation will help you reupholster it later., Using a flathead screwdriver or needle nose pliers, remove the staples on the bottom of the seat that you are reupholstering. These staples are what typically attach your seat's upholstery to the seat of the chair., Once you remove all the staples from the bottom of the seat, you'll be able to pull off the old upholstery and examine the filling. If the padding looks cracked or damaged, you should consider replacing it., Lay the seat on top of a piece of cardboard. Use a ruler or measuring tape to leave an inch (2.54 cm) around all sides of the cardboard. Trace around the seat, leaving an inch of slack around all sides of the seat., Use sharp scissors to cut around the template that you just created. The slack you left will help you measure the appropriate amount of foam.

, Purchase 2-inch (5.08 cm) thick foam online or at an arts and crafts store. Lay the foam over your cardboard template and use a marker to trace around the outside of the foam., Use an X-Acto knife to cut the lines that you just created with the marker. Be careful when cutting the foam so that you don't cut yourself.

, Find the correct foam adhesive that will work with the type of foam that you purchased. These can be found online or at most arts and crafts stores. Use the can of adhesive to spray a healthy layer of glue over the surface of the seat.If you don't want to apply the foam to the chair permanently, you should skip the rest of the steps in this method and use the taut upholstery to hold the foam in place.
Read the directions on the back of the adhesive before using it.

, Line up the padding with the seat and press down on the surface of the foam with your hands., Wait 15 minutes to a half hour to allow the glue to dry fully. Once you've let the glue set, you can start to reupholster the fabric on your seat.

, Get the measurements on the padding of the chair with a rule or tape measure. Increase those measurements by 4-6 inches (10.16-15.24 cm) inches on all sides and use a marker to mark your fabric. Measuring for this slack will allow you to pull the fabric taut and staple it under the chair., Use the measurements that you just took to cut out a square of fabric that will fit over your seat.

, Center the chair seat on the fabric and then place the fabric on a flat surface and put the chair, upside down on top of the fabric. Pull the fabric on all sides, so it's taut.

, You can purchase a hand-held staple gun at hardware and arts and crafts stores. As you pull the fabric taut, staple all four corners of the fabric to the bottom lip of the seat using the staple gun., Continue to staple around the edges of the fabric until it's totally secured to the seat. In each corner, fold each corner of the fabric over each other so that the fabric looks flush on the surface of your chair's seat.

, Once you've replaced the old padding and old fabric upholstery, you've completed your project. Rescrew the screws that you removed earlier with a screwdriver. Set the chair back into the frame to finish your project.

,


Latex paints offer quick and easy cleanup, but take longer to dry than oil-base.
Oil-based paints are more resistant to chipping and scratching. Oil-based paints have a strong smell, sometimes lingering for days. When using oil-based paint, keep area well ventilated.
The type of brushes needed will be determined by the type of paint you choose.
Brushes made of polyester filaments can be used for any type of paint as they do not absorb water like natural or nylon bristles. Natural bristles work best with oil-based paints.

,, Primer is used for metal rather than wood chairs.

, Sanding with 100 grit sandpaper should always be done prior to painting. Sand until surface is smooth. Wipe the chair with a damp cloth to remove sanding residue.

, Stir with paint stick. Pour small amounts of paint into separate pan or container for easier portability while painting.

, Allow sufficient time to dry. Most chairs will require a second coat to cover any missed spots.


Apply each coat thinly for a more even finish and to prevent drips caused by too much paint. Use a third or fourth coat if necessary.

,, Use paint thinner in ventilated area.

Sit down gently.",How to Fix a Squeaky Desk Chair1," The first thing to do is turn the chair over, and look at all hardware. Get a screwdriver or wrench and tighten any loose ones. Even try to tighten the parts that don't appear loose. Over time, it is easy for screws and bolts to become loose, causing certain chair parts to rub together irregularly and create a squeaky noise.;
, Apply a lubricating oil on all of the nuts, screws and bolts to help loosen the joints. Simply spray oil directly on the the chair mechanisms, and pat them dry. You can also spray oil on a soft cotton cloth, and rub the oil onto your problem areas to have more control over where the oil goes. Moisture in the air and air conditioners cause rust. Regularly applying oil prevents rust from occurring and building up., If the chair still squeaks after adding lubricant and tightening all bolts and screws, take them all out, and lubricate them with a light machine oil before putting them back in.

, To help you locate the area of the chair that is squeaking, have someone sit in it, and swivel from side to side. By applying weight to the chair to make it squeak, it will allow you to more easily locate the source of the noise to more accurately apply oil. Each time you apply more oil, ask your friend to swivel the chair so you can see if you put oil in the right spot.

, A chair may only squeak when you lean back, which is usually caused by too much tension where the spring's ends rub on the housing ends. To fix this, apply oil to the seat tension spring located inside the turn-knob housing. Simply loosen the seat tension turn-knob and remove the turn-knob to spray oil inside the housing., Desk chairs are often on wheels that may move a lot, so it is common for the axles in the wheels to need some silicone spray over time. Turn the chair over and spray the wheels. Then, flip the chair back over, and roll the chair to spread the silicone around the entire wheel.

, Collapsing into a chair will eventually cause it to squeak. Chairs go through a lot of wear and tear, so to keep your chair silent, be cautious when you sit down as to not speed up loosening joints.

Close the hole.",How to Make a Chair2," You'll need 5 yards (4.6 m) of fabric (assuming the bolts are 45"" wide) for this project, preferably something strong but soft. You'll also need filling for the bean bag. You can buy filling at many furniture stores or you can make your own from cut up foam or mattress filling. Then you'll need a sewing machine, thread, scissors, and a measuring tape. Paper or cardboard to make a pattern also helps.

, Make a pattern on paper or cardboard. You're going to be making twelve rounded triangles with a height of 30"" and a base of 20"". On a large piece of paper or cardboard, first mark a straight line that is 20"" long. Then, find the halfway point and measure 30"" from that point. Check that your line is perfectly perpendicular using math or a protractor. Hand draw a soft curve from the 30"" point to one end of the 20"" line. Get it to the shape you want and then fold along the center line and cut it out, following the curve you created.

, You should be able to get two of these triangles onto each yard of your fabric with a little room to spare (again, you will need 12 triangles). If you can, leave a half inch seam allowance around all of the edges. Cut out the fabric when you're ready. Remember: measure twice, cut once.

, Sew two triangles together along the bottom 20"" side, with the right sides facing. Do this until you have six canoe-shaped panels. Then three of the panels together along the long sides so that a single piece of fabric is formed. Repeat this for the remaining three panels.

, Take these two pieces of fabric, pin them right sides together, and then sew all the way around, leaving a 6"" gap to turn and fill the beanbag chair.

, Turn the fabric by pushing it through the hole, so that it is no longer inside out. You can now fill the bag by pouring your desired filling into the hole.


Do not overstuff the bag....it needs to be comfy!

, Use a whip stitch to close the hole. Enjoy your new beanbag chair.

Join these two sides together at the L joint on end closer to the T joint using a 26"" pieces of pipe. Make a separate piece with a T joint at the center and two 12"" pieces. Then, join at the upper ends together with this piece.


All pieces should be dry fit before doing any trimming. Your end shape should be a rectangle. If your pieces aren't fitting together right, they can be trimmed down.
The long side T joints should be facing into the inside of the rectangle. The upper T joint will need to be adjusted but will likely be around a 45 degree angle from the line of the long side.

, Place a 2"" section of pipe into the long side T joints and cap with a mirrored T joint.

, Make the long sides the same as with the vertical section (12 and 18"" pipe sections capped with L joints). However, join the ends closest to the center T joint with an 18"" section and the other end with 8"" sections and a T joint. You should now have two rectangles, one inside the other, and joined at their lower third point.

, The seat is formed between the short portion of the horizontal section and the long portion of the vertical section. The chair rests on the long end of the horizontal section and the short end of the vertical section. Adjust the angle that the two pieces meet at until you like the angle of the back and seat. Measure the distance between the remaining T joints on the long sides needed to create the angle you want.

, Cut a piece of pipe to your desired length and insert it into the two T joints.

, A sling which reaches between the top part of the chair and the front edge of the seat creates the space for you to sit down. You can make this sling out of fabric or you can even make it out of something like Duct tape. All it is is a long section of fabric with tubes at either end that you fit onto the PVC pipe. You can sew these tubes into place or you can even cheat and use iron on velcro.

, Your PVC beach chair is now done. Don't forget that you can change any of the measurements to make the chair larger or smaller, or even use thinner PVC pipe.

Attach the hardware.",How to Build a Simple Treasure Chest," The one built in this project is 11 inches wide, 9 inches tall (excluding the top) and 16 inches long (28 x 23 x 41 cm).
, Here, we used 1 X 10 (19 mm × 235 mm) scrap maple lumber which had been stained and lacquered, then thrown in a construction site dumpster. For the size in the illustrations, an eight foot (2.4 m) long board and some odd scraps were used., Two saw horses and a sheet of plywood works fine, but a heavy workbench would be better., There are some rabbetsto cut for joining the corners, and a sharp blade will make this process much easier., Here, the end pieces are cut 8 3/8 inches (21.3 cm), to the short point, with each end cut on a 7 degree angle so the sides of the chest will be slanted. Mark each cut on one piece of lumber, then cut them carefully. Use the first piece as a pattern to cut the second, or measure and mark it exactly, if you prefer., Make sure one end of the board is square, then measure 16 inches (40.6 cm). Make your mark, then scribe a straight line across the board using a framing square. Cut these carefully, as well., You can use the end boards to scribe the cuts as shown in the photo, or measure 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) and square this line. Cut 2/3 of the thickness of the lumber deep. Here, we are using a nominal one by board, 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) thick, so we set the saw to cut 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.,, We used a carpenter's grade hot melt wood glue, but these joints may be nailed or screwed, or fastened with conventional wood glue. Make sure all edges are flush and true, and try to keep the corners as square as possible. A jig will help if you are having difficulty aligning and squaring the pieces., Using the dimensions of the chest shown, the bottom will be 14 1/2 inches (36.8 cm) by 7 inches (17.8 cm), but checking the actual assembled size will provide a better fit. Cut the bottom out of a piece of your lumber, the size you have measured, with the saw blade set on a 7 degree bevel on the long sides so it fits the tapered sides of your chest., If it is cut correctly, you may need to tap it into place, since the tapered edges will seat firmly into the bottom., Cut 3/8 inch deep around the top of the box, 3/8 inch from the outside edge. This will form a recess for the lid to set down on, creating a somewhat better seat for the lid to set in, If you are using wide lumber, as in the photos, you can rip it in half to reduce waste. Mark a radius from the edge to form the curved shape of the top of the chest. Here, we used the lid from a five gallon bucket, which provided an ideal curve with little effort., These two pieces should be as closely matched as possible to make fitting the finished lid easier., Here, a vise or clamp is very helpful, since the stock you are cutting is almost impossible to hold safely while you cut. When the two ends are cut and rabbeted, you can temporarily attach them to the chest to make fitting the lid slats more simple. Here, again, hot melt glue makes this quick and simple., Make sure they are at least as long as the length of the chest, but ripping longer boards and then cutting several to length from each rip will save time., If you have attached the lid ends to the top of the chest box, you can simply scribe them in place. Glue these, starting on each side and the center of the top, to keep the assembly square and true. Fit the edges as tightly as possible, but because of the radius of the lid, you can expect a noticeable gap unless you choose to bevel each piece individually. You can leave these strips overhanging each end slightly by cutting them 1/4 inch (.6 cm) long, then after attaching them, the ends can be sanded flush., Clean up the edges, light sand the surfaces, and bevel corners and other features that may produce splinters or leave a sharp edge., These will act as bands, and help secure the lid slats to the box, but for all practical purposes, they are ornamental. Test fit these strips and scribe the ends, then cut them to length. Make sure they are sufficiently thin and limber to bend the radius of your lid without splitting or cracking. Attach them with glue or tacks., If you want to stain or paint the chest, now is the time to do it, before the hardware (hinges, handles, and the hasp) is installed., Since this project was started with stained hardwood, and no matching stain was available, brown spray paint was used to blend the colors of the original stain, giving a pretty good finish., Here, antiqued cabinet hinges and pull handles were used to add to the rustic effect. The hardware can be attached with the Hot Melt glue so it can be test fitted, or you can simply attach it with the screws provided in the set you buy. Be sure to check the operation of hinges before completing installation, since if they are not correctly aligned, they will likely bind or cause the lid to fit crookedly."

Inspect the wooden chair for loose legs, screw, or nails.,
Position the chair you are working on upside down.,
Apply glue to loose joints.,
Expand the dowels with wood-swelling liquids.,
Replace the nails or wooden joint plugs.",How to Fix a Squeaky Desk Chair2," Check how loose the chair legs are, as well as the back of the chair, by pushing and pulling them back and forth to see how much movement they have. There should be virtually no movement., You can either flip the chair upside down on a table or on another chair so that you can more easily access the problem area. This will also prevent any unwanted pressure on the legs or back of the chair when you are working., There are many types of strong wood glue products you can purchase to stabilize loose leg joints. When you locate a loose joint, push wood glue into the joint and let it dry completely before flipping the chair back over. Wipe away any access glue that comes out of the joint with a wet rag.To create a thicker wood glue consistency, try adding wood filler to the glue. A thicker mixture can better help stabilize wobbly chair legs.

, For very loose legs that seem to need more than glue, remove the chair leg completely, and use a wood-swelling liquid. Sometimes, dowels can shrink, causing chair parts to become loose. When you apply a wood-swelling liquid to the dowel, it will allow the dowel to once again become secure in the chair., If the hardware in the chair seem to be loose or no good anymore, you can replace them with new ones. Even if you don't want to remove the existing hardware, you can add reinforcement with more nails or bracket hinges to make the chair sturdy. When putting in more screws, make sure they are long enough to secure the wood, but not long enough to come through the other side of the wood."

, This will remove old paint or varnish and makes the surface nicely smooth for the new paint., Tape to the edges to prevent the paint going onto it. While you won't see this cushion anymore, you'll avoid stiffening parts of the cushion where the paint sets if you do this (plus, it wastes paint to have it bleed into the cushion area)., Either paint with a brush or using spray paint.

Unhook the arm from the tool.,
Repeat the process for each arm.,
String the loop of the last arm to a hook in the ceiling.

",How to Create a Calder Mobile," See the ""Things You'll Need"" section, below.;
, For a first mobile, it is good to start with simple square wood pieces measured 2"" x 3"". Cut out 9 pieces.


For advanced mobiles, you can use all kinds of varied shapes—use your imagination!

, Clamp one piece at a time to the workbench and drill a 1"" deep hole into the edge. The drill bit should be the same size as the wire.

, With the needle nose pliers, cut off a 15"" strand of wire and straighten it.


Make a small U-shaped hook at the end.
To train yourself in making loops in the wire, and to use as a template for the following wires, make loops in the wire strand every 1"", so that you end up with 12 loops. We’ll call this piece the mobile tool.

, At the base there are two wood pieces balanced on a strand of wire. With the needle nose pliers, cut off another 15"" strand of wire and straighten it.


Mark the wire at 7.5"" and using the pliers, make a loop or eye.
Take two wood pieces and slide them onto the wire on opposite sides.
Hook the loop into the hook of your mobile tool and make it balance.
You can trim the balancing by shortening the wire if necessary.

, Cut off a 12"" strand, straighten it, make a U-shaped hook, and bend the hook sideways.


Use the mobile tool to find the arm's tipping point, and that’s where you’ll make the loop in the arm.
Slide a wood piece on the end of the mobile tool, while leaving the base piece hanging off its hook.
Then take the new arm wire and hook it into one of the loops of the tool. Find the loop that allows for best balancing.

, Hold it next to the tool to determine where you have to make the loop in this arm.


Make the loop, attach a wood piece to the arm and hook the arm into the base wire, then take the tool and hook it into the arm’s loop and check the balance.
You can adjust it by shortening the wire, bending it down a bit or even reshaping the arm and placing the loop differently.
Changing the weight of the wood piece is possible, too.


,


You can hook the arms all left-facing or mix the left- and right-facing arms.

If the ceiling above your porch has joists, exposed beams, or any other structural elements with cracks running between them, you may want to make the bench a length that will allow you to center the anchors for hanging the swing between the cracks.

Consider how deep the seat and how tall the back will be. Measure the seat and back of a similar chair that you feel comfortable in (e.g. a dining chair). The swing built over the course of these instructions is 20 in. (508 mm) deep in the seat and 18 in. (457 mm) tall in the backrest, which is comfortable for a fairly tall individual but may not be as comfortable for a person with shorter legs.;
, This article describes building with treated southern yellow pine, but cedar, fir, cypress, juniper, or even birch will work equally well as long as the components are thick and strong enough to support the weight they will carry.
, Here is the list broken down by type; see Things You’ll Need for additional dimensions and sizes.


Tools: Circular saw, jigsaw, hammer, tape measure, square, and drill with bits

Fasteners: Wood screws, eye bolts

Lumber: Fifteen 1x4 in. (25.4x102 mm) boards as long as the width of your swing; one 2x6 in (51x152 mm) board that is 8 feet (2.4 m). (2.44 m) long.

, A pair of metal sawhorses with a sheet of plywood work great as a makeshift table, but any flat surface that provides a workspace at a comfortable working height will do.
, (50x100 mm) boards the length you want the finished swing to be. The 2x4 used in this article is 5 feet (1.5 m). (152 cm) long. Cut these boards to length, being careful to make all cuts square (90 degrees).
, Next, attach a stop for keeping them from sliding while you rip them to width. If you have a table saw, you can use this for ripping the slats instead.
, The seat slats need to be 3/4 in. (19 mm) wide, while the back slats (which support less weight) only need to be 1/2 in. (12.7mm) wide. For a seat 20 inches (508 mm) deep, you will only need about seat 17 slats (to allow for gaps between slats); for a back 18 inches (457mm) tall, you will only need 15 back slats.

If your seat or back will be a different size than the one in this example and you aren’t sure how many slats you’ll need, make several slats fewer than the total measurement of the space in inches. Aim on the low side for now; you can always rip more later.

, (25.4 mm) from both ends, with a 3/16 in. (4.76 mm) drill bit. Later, when you attach the slats to the frame with wood screws, these pre-drilled holes will keep the slats from splitting.

You may also want to drill a hole in the dead center of each slat depending on whether or not you think your bench needs a center support. If you’re making a short bench and/or working with hardwood, a center support may not be necessary. If in doubt, however, include one. The bench in this tutorial has a center support.

, (51x152mm) back and bottom supports. If your bench only needs outer supports, cut two back- and two bottom supports; if it also needs a center support, cut three of each. The length of the back pieces should equal the desired height of the bench; the length of the bottom pieces should equal the desired depth of the seat., The bench in this example will have gentle curves cut into the bench supports to make the bench more comfortable, not to mention aesthetically pleasing. The amount of curvature depends on your preference, but the seat and back can actually be straight if you prefer.

Choose one back support piece, draw the curve freehand with a pencil, then go over it with a marker. Unless the back and bottom supports will be the same length, you will need to do this again with a bottom support piece.





Cut the marked back support piece with a jigsaw. Leave the narrow end a bit long for trimming to fit the joints together. Next, either trace it onto the other back supports or use it as a jig. Repeat with the bottom support pieces.






, This is so the back and seat boards join at the correct angle for the amount of slant (recline) you want your seat to have. You can start by cutting a 45-degree angle into one of the two pieces, then laying it on top of the opposite piece and twisting it until you get the amount of angle you want. When you’re satisfied, mark the angle onto the uncut piece by tracing along the edge of the top piece you just cut, then cut along the traced line. Trace the cut edge of the back support piece into all the other back supports and cut them to match, then do the same with the bottom supports.

The two angles in all likelihood won't be the same, but it shouldn't matter since they are on the bottom rear of the swing, out of sight.

, Drill pilot holes for the screws that will join each pair of supports together, then fasten them with 31/2 in. (89 mm), #12 gold-plated wood screws. This is a critical connection: since the screws are the only support for this joint, they will have a good bit of pressure in them.

Depending on the length of the joint, you might want to insert the two screws at opposing angles.

, Make sure you’ve spaced the supports evenly and oriented all the back supports in the same direction, then screw the central slat into place.

Unless you don’t mind cutting into the overhang to accommodate the armrests, don’t situate your slates so that they overhang both side supports. The armrests will later attach to the side supports, meaning the overhang will just get in the way.

, First, use a framing square to make sure the support pieces are square with the preliminary slat, then screw on the other slats.

Place the square along both the preliminary slat and one of the support pieces and measure whether or not they are square. Repeat with the other support pieces as necessary. If necessary, rack the supports (by shifting them sideways) to make a more perfect 90 degree angle.





Space additional slats across the seat, leaving a 1/4 to 3/8 in (6.35 - 9.5mm) space between them. (If necessary, rip more slats to get the spacing the way you like it.) You can tack these temporarily or go ahead and fasten them securely, but you may find it necessary to adjust them to get your spacing to work out uniformly. Attaching the top-most back slat and front-most seat slat first before filling in the others might make it easier to keep your frame square. Take care to use the thicker (3/4 in.) strips for the seat, and the 1/2 in. (13 mm) strips for the back.






, Generally, the armrest should be about 8in (20cm) high and 18-20in (~.5 m) long.

Make the armrest supports. Cut two wedge-shaped 2x4 in. (50x100 mm) boards about 13 inches (33 cm) long, tapered from 2 3/4 inches (70mm) on one end to 3/4 inch (19mm) on the other.
Make the actual armrests. Cut two more boards 22in (56cm) long, tapered on one end from 1 1/2 inches (3.8cm) to full width in 10 inches (25.4cm) for each armrest itself.
Attach the armrests. Locate the height you want the armrest on the back frame, then locate the position you want the support on the seat portion of the frame. Attach these with 3 in. (7.5 cm) #12 wood screws. Fasten through the top of the armrest down into the support board with two more wood screws.

, The eyebolt will attach your swing chain to the swing. Then, drill through the back frame for another eyebolt for the back chain. Screw in the eyebolts, place washers over the backs (to keep the nuts from drawing into the wood frame), and tighten the nuts over the ends with a wrench.
, Install eyebolts or eye-screws for the overhead connection, and measure the length you will need your chains to hang your swing. You may find you need to adjust the chains to get the swing tilted back the proper amount to be comfortable for you.

Select the material you want your hook to be in.,
Decide on the length of the crochet hook.,

Decide which way you want the hook portion to point in relation to the handle, if you are using material that is not cylindrical (a rectangular chopstick or a rough branch).,

Cut the material to the final length, or a bit longer.,

Put a rough point on the end that will become the hook.,

Carve a neck onto the hook.,

Sand the neck so that it is reasonably smooth and even.,

Do a little rough sanding on the end at this stage to round out the tip.,

Mark a ""smile"" where the initial cut for the hook will go.,


Make a 45 degree cut about halfway through the dowel, at the mark.,

Widen this cut and make it deeper by whittling with a knife.,

Work the sides of the ""smile"" higher.,

Shape the point and shorten it as required.,
Sand the hook thoroughly, especially the hook and the part of the neck that will come into contact with the yarn or thread.,

Use the hook.",How to Carve a Crochet Hook," You can use a wooden or plastic chopstick, or a hardwood dowel. You can even start with a reasonably straight piece of a branch, for as long as it is well-dried. You will have less carving to do if the material starts with approximately the size and shape you want the finished hook to be, particularly the diameter.
If you're using a chopstick, use a good, long one made of bamboo. The cheap, break-apart ones that you typically get with your Chinese takeout probably won't sand to a finish that is smooth enough.
Different materials will handle somewhat differently. For instance, wooden and plastic hooks will be different from the commercial metal hooks. Try to experiment to see which ones suit your needs best.
See the ""Things You'll Need"" section below for a list of the other items you'll need.;
, You may wish to compare it to a commercial hook that you like working with. If you're not sure, six inches (15cm) is a good length to start with. You can also base the length of your hook on the type of project you would like to use it on, such as on Tunisian crochet -- which requires a longer hook, or a much bigger project., Is there a flat side? Is one side wider than the other? If you are starting with a chopstick, you might also wish to consider any designs or printing that are already on the chopstick., Remember that you will be removing some material as you carve, and that you can shorten the hook later far more easily than you can lengthen it. If you prefer, you can leave this step until last, so that you will know exactly where the top of the hook ends up., One easy way to do this is to place the end of the chopstick or dowel into a pencil sharpener. Otherwise, simply use the knife to round the corners., It does not have to be perfectly cylindrical, but you may want to round out the square end of a chopstick. If you want a smaller hook, you may also want to straighten the taper on the end of a chopstick, or reduce the diameter of the hook end of a dowel while leaving the handle part thicker for strength.

Make the neck as smooth, even, and symmetrical as possible. Cut with long, smooth strokes following the grain of the wood, and rotate the material as you go.
If you are rounding out the end of a rectangular chopstick, take more off the short sides and little or nothing off the long sides.
Make the neck at least an inch and a half (about 3.5cm) long. The exact length doesn't matter.
If you did shape the end with a pencil sharpener, use the shape of the point as a guide to help get the neck round.

, This is not the final sanding, so you don't have to go overboard at this stage. Just get out big bumps and nicks left from carving the neck., It will help you to visualize where to put the cut for the hook., You can also visualize this cut, if you prefer. Put it a little further from the end than it will finally go. You will shape the point of the hook more later. You may wish to compare the shape and location to a commercial hook or a photo of one., This will create the beginning of the hook. The photo shows the saw blade on a pocket knife (multi-tool), but you can use any other saw, or you can start this cut by chipping at it with a knife., Try to preserve the undercut while you make it deeper. Leave a half to a third of the original width of the dowel at the narrowest spot., This is not strictly required, but it will give the thread or yarn a place to sit. Note that this may make the supporting part of the dowel even slimmer, so don't overdo it, especially on thinner hooks., If the point is too long, you will have trouble pulling it through loops. You may wish to revisit the pencil sharpener if you are using it. Otherwise, simply continue to whittle and sand until you have a round point. Turning the hook as you go will help to keep things even and round here, especially as you are sanding.

The shape and size of the point of your hook is a matter of personal preference. Try several different shapes or continue to adjust it until it feels right to you.

, As much as possible, sand with the grain of the wood. A flat, inexpensive emery board will help you get in under the hook. Remember that sanding can also be used for the final shaping., You will quickly discover any spots that need a bit more sanding. Give yourself plenty of time to adjust to wooden hooks if you have used metal hooks before. Also, give them plenty of time to break in. They will get smoother with use, and they will absorb skin oil that will make the hook slide more evenly against the yarn or thread."

Find a design you like for your chairs.,
Print the design and have it enlarged.,
Sketch the skull design on the chair.",How to Design a Skull Patio Chair1," You could go with a uniform, large eyes and nose shape on each chair or go for something more intricate.

Scan the Internet for a design you desire. You don’t necessarily need the large design to fit the chair right now. Instead find something that not only you like, but one you know you can cut out on the chair.



 


Look for designs that emphasize the skull shape and not color or fine lines. You will need a basic design that can be translated to your plastic chairs.





;
, Either you can copy it onto the chair from an enlarged pattern or you can use it as inspiration or a guide for your design.


Measure the chair area. Measure just the area that will hold the skull design on your chair.






Take a 81/2 x 11 printout to a local copy shop to have it enlarged. Make sure the design is not trademarked as you could have trouble having it enlarged at a commercial copy shop. Request light or transparent paper so that you can trace and/or transfer the design to the chair.

, Consider using a pencil or brightly colored chalk to draw your outline instead of a permanent magic marker.


Perform a rough sketch or trace the outline of your skull design and then stand back to make sure the outline resembles a skull. What may translate well on paper may not look the same on plastic. Before you make this change permanent you may want to look at it from all angles before cutting.

",How to Build a Lamp," The base for your lamp should be sturdy enough to stand on its own, even after you add lamp apparatus and a shade on top. If you have a hollow base that you need to stabilize, consider partially filling it with something like marbles or sand. Some ideas for lamp bases that you could use:


Wine bottles
Log or timber
Wooden pails or buckets
Toys or figurines
Hollowed-out books;
, These can be found at most hardware stores. Note that it's possible to purchase the pieces separately, but buying them together will ensure a better fit. If you do buy the cord separately, choose a #18 size cord.


If you don't want to buy a lamp kit, and instead want to purchase the items separately, you'll need:
Detachable harp
Cord set
Push-through socket and socket shell
Finial
Assorted hardware, like nuts, bolts and washers

, The rod is a hollow tube that will run the cord up through the bottom of your base to the lightbulb at the top. Depending on your base, you may have to drill or cut holes wide enough for the rod at the top and bottom of the lamp.


If necessary, you can trim the rod with a hacksaw or pipe cutters, but it's best (and easier) to choose a base that's fitted to your rod. Sawing your rod down to size is not ideal.

, Your lamp kit might come with a piece meant to stabilize the bottom of your base. If it doesn't, simply purchase rubber stoppers. Affix these at intervals around the base to prevent sliding and lift the base slightly off the table, allowing room for the cord.

, The cord should consist of two covered wires stuck together. Thread it through the rod from bottom to top, leaving 3 or 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) of cord about the base.


Before threading, tape the wire ends together so that they fit smoothly inside the rod.
When doing this, make sure that the bottom of the plug doesn't rub against the rod's sharp edge.

, Make sure your cords are threaded to where you want them first.

, Your lamp kit may or may not come with a flat, broad ""neck"" piece or a rubber stopper to add to the lamp rod.

, Screw the harp bottom onto the lamp rod, arms facing upward. This will be the base for the rest of the harp.

, Put the bowl-shaped socket cap on top of the harp bottom, open end up. Secure tightly.

, Pull the two covered wires at the top of the cord apart, separating about 4 inches (10 cm) down the cord. Using wire strippers or a knife, remove the insulation from the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the cords.

, Tie the wires into an underwriter's knot, which looks like a pretzel. Doing this will prevent the wires from falling through the rod to the base. To tie an underwriter's knot:


Bring the left wire down so that it's facing to the right, in front of the doubled wiring.
Bring the right wire down so that it's facing to the left, in back of the doubled wiring.
Put the right wire into the loop on the left side.
Pull the ends of both wires tight, fastening the knot.

, Usually, the neutral wire will be surrounded by ribbed insulation. If you're unsure, refer to the instructions that came with your lamp kit.


If the wires have two colors at all, the white is the neutral wire and the black is the hot wire., The bulb socket in the lamp kit should have two screws of different colors positioned at the base. Wrap the neutral wire clockwise around the silver (or white) screw, and the hot wire clockwise around the gold (or dark) screw. If you're unsure, check the manual that came with your lamp kit. Using a screwdriver, tighten the screws down over the wires.

, Line it up so that the slot coming up from the bottom of the socket shell aligns with the switch on the bulb socket. Tuck the cords inside so that they won't be visible, and push down the socket shell until it locks into place.

, Squeeze the sides of the harp as you slide them into the slots on the harp bottom.

, Once it's secure, twist down the locknut to secure it.

Secure the chair to the ground.,
Don’t forget about wearing protective gear such as eyewear.,
Consider leaving the pattern design on the chair and cut through it.,
Make sure the design won’t compromise how you sit in the chair.,
Choose the appropriate blade for the handsaw or jigsaw for cutting.,
Gently push cut out pieces through the chair.",How to Design a Skull Patio Chair2," Light plastic chairs will move around when you are cutting so securing the chair is vital to making this a success.

Weigh down the legs with bricks or rocks if your chairs have feet. You can also push the chair up against the wall to make sure it doesn’t tip over.






Weigh down the chair seat to keep the chair in place. If your chair doesn’t have feet you can also keep the chair in place by placing weight on the seat.







, Any time your work with power tools you should make safety a priority. This includes wearing work gloves and keeping children and pets clear of the area.

, One way you could approach this project is to create the same number of patterns as you have chairs and cut right through them instead of tracing or transferring.


Use heavy duty tape to adhere the pattern to the chair. The pressure from the handsaw could move the paper so it’s important you secure it.

, While the pattern or design may be ultra cool, you want to make sure the chair is still functional. Consider how you will sit down in the chair after the design has been cut to ensure either the chair won’t break or be unusable.

, Depending on the size of your design and chair you should size up what you will be cutting to match up the right blade.


Make sure your hand saw equipment is up to par. You don’t want to approach this project with a dull blade so make sure you are working with a sharp blade and a hand saw that works well.






Select a slow cutting speed. You may be excited about creating the design but a fast speed could make you more prone to errors.







, Make sure you’ve fully punctured the plastic and you won’t be tearing or twisting the plastic chair to remove the cut out pieces.


Sand the cut out area if you see rough spots. Be careful when using sandpaper as you don't want to scratch the chair.

Apply the first coat.,
Repeat.",How to Apply Polyurethane," Remove as much dirt and dust as possible from the area. Vacuum, mop, and/or wipe every surface clean. Reduce the number of particles that might end up sticking to your coats of polyurethane.Dust and other particles that dry in the polyurethane will result in an uneven surface.;
, Create a cross-breeze to get rid of the polyurethane’s fumes while you work. Open a window and install an exhaust fan facing outward. Then, if possible, open a window on the opposite side of the room.Never place a fan in your immediate work area, since this may lead to dust being blown onto your wood as you coat it.
Purchase a respirator with an organic cartridge if you are unable to improve the room’s ventilation and/or if you are sensitive to fumes.

, If the wood to be treated can be transported, lay out a protective covering for it to rest on while you work. Use a tarp, dropcloth, cardboard, or similar material. Whichever you use, make sure that it covers a few feet beyond the wood itself on all sides. Protect the surface underneath and make clean-up a cinch.Also make sure the surrounding area is clear of any objects that you want to keep clean, just in case you make a bigger mess than you mean to.

, For this, feel free to move your project outdoors for the time being. Work with better air circulation while making your clean-up that much easier., Start with a medium (100-grit) sandpaper if the wood feels especially rough. After that, resand it with fine (150-grit) sandpaper, and then again with extra-fine (220-grit) paper. Inspect the wood for any scratches in between each sanding. If necessary, use the extra-fine paper to smooth scratched areas., Vacuum the wood and surrounding area to remove all of the dust created by sanding. Use a soft-brush attachment when vacuuming the wood itself to avoid scratching the surface. Then dampen a lint-free cloth and wipe the wood down to remove any dust that the vacuum missed.Repeat with a second wipe-down using a dry microfiber cloth.If your polyurethane is oil-based, use mineral spirits to dampen your lint-free cloth.
For water-based polyurethane, dampen your cloth with water.
Some people use tack cloths for the dry wipe-down, but be aware that some tack cloths may include chemicals that will interfere with the polyurethane’s adhesion.

, Cover the most surface area at a time by using a brush.Reduce the number of coats needed, since brushes create thicker coats. Favor natural bristles for oil-based polys, and synthetic ones for water-based polys. When brushing:Dunk the bristles roughly an inch (2.5 cm) into the polyurethane to load the brush.
Brush with the grain in long, even strokes.
After each stroke, run the brush back over any drips that need to be smoothed out.
Overlap half of each previous stroke to reduce the chance of gaps and uneven coating.
After each coat, reinspect it for any drips that need repairing.

, Avoid the drips that may occur from brushing areas that aren’t perfectly flat. Expect this technique to create thinner coats, so double the amount of coats that you would otherwise apply with a brush.When wiping:Fold a clean cloth into a square, roughly palm-sized, to apply your coats.
Dip an edge into the polyurethane.
Wipe it onto the wood, following the grain.
With each wipe, overlap half of the previous wipe for even coating.

, Purchase an aerosol can of polyurethane to coat areas that are difficult to reach with a brush or cloth. Err on the side of caution and spray in very short bursts to avoid creating drips, since these will also be out of reach and difficult to repair. Be sure to cover surrounding areas with a protective surface before applying.Spray-on polyurethane creates very thin coats.
Practice on a test area first to improve your technique.

, After you open the can, use a stir stick to mix the polyurethane’s components evenly, which may have settled and separated over time. Always stir, rather than shake. Expect shaking to create bubbles in the liquid, which may be transferred intact to the wood, creating an uneven coat., Use a clean container to create a mixture of polyurethane and mineral spirits. Combine two parts polyurethane with one part mineral spirits in the new container. Brush or wipe a single coat of this mixture onto the wood. Wait for it to dry before proceeding.Pure polyurethane takes roughly 24 hours to dry, but it should take less than that when diluted with mineral spirits., From this point forward, always sand the wood before applying a new coat. Remove any runs, drips, bubbles, or visible brushstrokes that may have developed. Use extra-fine (220-grit) sandpaper to reduce the chance of scratching the surface.Once done, vacuum and wipe the wood again to remove all particles.

, After sealing the wood, use pure polyurethane.However, continue to pour small batches into a clean container, rather than dipping your brush or cloth directly into the original can. Avoid tainting your main supply with any dust or other particles that your brush or cloth might pick up.When brushing, go over the whole surface area with your brush again, without reloading it, once the first coat is complete. Smooth out any drips or runs.
After that, give the polyurethane 24 hours to air-dry.

, Once the first coat has dried, sand the wood again. Then add a second in the same manner. Wait another 24 hours to dry. If you used a brush, two coats is fine.For any areas where a cloth or spray was used, repeat twice for a total of four coats."

Here is a short list of special materials you will need:

Limbs to split to create the faux logs.
Lumber for building the frame and other components.;
, The one in the illustrations is 10 inches (25cm) wide, 12 inches (30cm) long, and 12 inches (30cm) high to its peak., Cedar or white pine are good materials for this step since they are easy to work with and will make fastening the veneer logs easier.
, Cut off the bark and a thin slab off the side of each limb. A table saw makes this easier, but if you clamp the limb or fasten it so it won't move, this step can be done with a circular saw as well., For the project in the photos, about 30 feet (9.1 meters) of bark slabs roughly 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thick were used.
, This is to ensure that the short length of the 45 degree angles are flush with the ends of the frame (box).
, You can use staples, screws, or brads to fasten the slabs. Ensure that the fasteners don't penetrate though the inside of the box or they will need to be trimmed flush or sanded off for safety.
, Match the mitered ends of the logs so they fit together closely. You will need to choose slabs that are about the same width to make them fit well., Then continue around the box until it the whole thing is wrapped with the ""logs""., Cut the angles so they fit together properly. You can calculate your roof pitch and use a rafter square to make accurate cuts if you like, or just fit them by trial and error until you have a pattern rafter, then use it to mark the number you need for your project.,, Fasten them, starting from the eave and allowing the upper to overlap the lower, working up the roofline.

Sand your wood.,
Clean your workspace.,
Gather your varnishing supplies.,
Stir the varnish carefully.,
Thin your varnish.",How to Apply Varnish1," This will remove any imperfections and blemishes before applying the varnish. Use 100 grit sandpaper for unfinished pieces, and work with the grain of the wood. Sand gently until the piece is smooth.








If your piece is stained, use 240 or 280 grit sandpaper.;
, Varnish is beautiful, durable finish, but it is prone to attracting dust, hair, and other impurities before it dries. Plan to varnish your piece in a place that is clean and will not be disturbed.








Try to apply the varnish in a different location than the one you sanded your piece in.
If you have to use the same location, vacuum (don’t sweep) thoroughly after sanding.
Wet mopping the floor before you begin can also help keep dust down.

, You’ll only need a few basic supplies to varnish wood. All of them are readily available at your local hardware store. Make sure to get:Varnish (read the label carefully to make sure it is true oil-based varnish, not polyurethane)
A paintbrush (natural bristle is preferable)
A stirring stick
A large, clear measuring cup with markings on the side
Paint thinner (turpentine or mineral spirits)
Rubber gloves and a respirator (optional)

, Avoid shaking the container of varnish. Open it carefully, and use your stick to stir the varnish thoroughly. Work slowly and gently -- you don’t want to introduce air bubbles into the varnish.







, Pour enough varnish for the first coat into your measuring cup. The exact amount will vary depending on how large your piece is, but generally it pays to start small - you can always add more. Then, add some paint thinner directly to the varnish and stir carefully.








Experts suggest using 20-25 percent thinner for the first coat of varnish, and 5-10 percent for subsequent coats.
For instance, if you pour three quarters of a cup of varnish for your first coat, add one quarter cup of thinner. For subsequent cups, you can pour 9 ounces of varnish and 1 ounce of thinner.

Select an appropriate brush for your project.,
Load the brush with shellac.,
Apply the shellac to the wood.,
Allow the shellac to dry before sanding the finish.,
Apply the second coat of shellac.,
Clean your brush.",How to Apply Shellac," Use a coarse-grit sandpaper to go over the entire piece. If there is an old finish applied to the wood, make sure to sand it away completely. After sanding, wipe the piece down with a clean cloth to remove any dust and dirt.;
, Avoid dipping your brush directly into the shellac can, as this can contaminate the product with wood dust and other particles. Instead, load your brush from a separate bucket.

, Shellac can either be applied with a natural-bristled brush (china bristle is ideal) or a synthetic-bristled brush. Note that it can be difficult to clean the shellac from a natural-bristled brush without damaging the bristles. Do not use a foam brush to apply shellac, as the shellac tends to dry into the brush too quickly and hardens it.

, Dip the brush into the bucket of shellac and press it gently against the side of the bucket to remove the excess.

, Shellac should be applied in long, smooth strokes, following the grain of the wood to ensure an even application. Shellac dries very quickly, so it is important to work quickly and efficiently.


If you miss a spot when applying the shellac, avoid going back to touch it up. Because shellac dries very quickly, the partially dried shellac that is already applied will not blend smoothly into the fresh application. The missed spot will become less noticeable as more coats are applied.

, Let the first coat dry completely, which can take as little as 30 minutes in a well-ventilated area. Once it is dry, sand the entire finish lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper to prepare it for the next coat of shellac.

, Apply the next coat just as you did the first, being careful to work along the grain. When the second coat is dry, you can sand the finish again and apply another coat, or simply leave the wood with 2 coats.

, Shellac can be cleaned from brushes with a mixture of ammonia and water. Mix equal parts ammonia and water, and then soak the brush bristles in the mixture. Rinse the brush and allow it to dry before storing.

",How to Apply Glaze to Wood Furniture," By definition, glazing is done after a piece of wood already has at least one layer of finish on it.If the furniture you want to glaze does not already have a finish, apply one and allow it to dry completely before beginning.


See our articles on staining and finishing wood for step-by-step instructions for processes that should take place before any glazing is performed.
If your furniture is finished with shellac, don't use glazes containing asphaltum, as they can sometimes be hard to remove.;
, As a very general rule, glazes are simply colored pigments suspended in a clear oil- or water-based medium. There is no single, ""definitive"" glaze — a huge variety of options are available. You can find commercial glaze at most hardware stores and paint shops (Sherwin-Williams, etc.) for reasonably cheap.However, it's not hard to fine-tune your glaze by mixing various commercial projects as well. For instance, to get a gorgeous dark chocolate-colored wood glaze, simply combine:Four parts clear mixing glaze
Two parts dark brown or mocha glaze
One part dark grey or asphaltum glaze




You can also combine clear mixing glaze (sometimes called ""glaze base"") with ordinary paints to make your own custom shades.
Finally, many oil-based paints can be used as glazes when mixed with a little thinner or penetrol., Use masking tape, newspaper, and other masking tools to expose only the part of the wood you would like to glaze. In general, glazes are quite easy to remove compared to paints, stains, and other finishes used for wood. However, you still want to avoid unnecessary cleanup work when possible, so good masking is still important (especially if you're working around non-wood substances that stain easily, like upholstery, etc.)


In addition, you'll want to lay a heavy drop cloth beneath your work area to protect against accidental drips and spills.

, Compared to other wood finishes, applying glaze is usually a low-stress affair. There isn't one ""right"" way to do it — for instance, an experienced woodworker may have her own unique techniques that use unconventional tools. However, for a standard glazing job, the following tools will be very helpful:One application brush (either foam or bristled is fine)
One blending brush (soft-bristled; clean and dry)
Pan or tray to hold the glaze
Paper towels or cotton rags
Steel wool (oil-based glazes)
Nylon abrasive pad (water-based glazes)

, Before you paint the glaze on the wood itself, it can be a wise idea to test it on a piece of wood that you have lying around, especially if it's similar to the wood you're using for your project. Glazes (like almost all pigments) can look a little different in liquid form than they do when painted onto a surface, so taking the time to test it can save you the headache of cleaning it off of your project later if it's not quite right.


In a pinch, you can always test the glaze on part of the project that's not easily-visible (like a small area on a rear corner.)

, When you're ready, dip your applicator brush in the glaze and spread it over the finished surface of the wood. Be sure to get plenty of glaze in any corners or cracks in the wood. You don't have to worry about applying to thickly (unless this causes it to drip or run) — you'll be removing most of it soon anyway.


Most glazes take a reasonably long time to start drying compared to other wood finishes — usually, you will have about 10 to 20 minutes, which is plenty of time to glaze and work reasonable-sized sections of wood. Still, you'll want to keep this rough time limit in mind. If the glaze dries before you can work with it, you'll need to use a little paint thinner to get it liquid again.

, Glaze is applied in a very thin, translucent layer — it's not meant to act like an opaque paint. To get this effect, use paper towels or rags to wipe off most of the glaze after you've applied a generous layer over the wood surface. As long as you get the majority of the glaze off, you don't have to be perfect — in the next step you'll work with the glaze remaining on the wood to get the effect you want.


Leave a little extra glaze around any corners, cracks, embellishments, or ""tight spaces"" on your wood. Most glazing styles deliberately keep these areas darker to highlight the features of the wood.
Be sure to place the dirty paper towels or rags someplace they won't drip or get your surroundings dirty. Having a plastic garbage bag handy is a good idea.

, Now's your chance to leave your own personal mark on the wood. Use your second brush (which should ideally be soft-bristled, clean, and dry) to push the remaining glaze around, distributing the areas of dark (more glaze) and light (less glaze) as you wish. Use the towels or rags to dry the blending brush when it gets too wet. There's no ""right"" way to do this and different woodworkers will often prefer using different techniques to get different final products. Below are a few suggestions that should leave you with a rich, distinguished-looking piece of wood:


Leave the glaze the thinnest at the center of flat surfaces. Leave slightly more around the edges. This gives a subtle ""cameo"" or ""sunburst"" effect.
Let the glaze accumulate thickest around sharp corners, edges, cracks, and embellishments. This highlights these features by bringing out their contrast.
Push the glaze away from the ""high points"" on emblems, embellishments, carvings, and so on to give them a warm ""shine.""

, Though it's certainly not required, you can custom-modify the texture of your wood with mild abrasives during the glazing process. Use steel wool for oil-based glazes and nylon abrasive pads for water-based glazes. Wipe gently with the abrasive to remove the glaze more gradually than you would with a paper towel or rag. This will also produce a slightly rough, ""grainy"" effect in the glaze which can enhance the character of the wood once it dries.


Whether or not to use this ""grain"" effect depends on the project you're working on and the impression you want to create with the finished product. For example, while a rough grain can look great on a rich wooden desk, you'll probably want to keep your glaze smooth if you're working over a white-painted chest of drawers.

, If you don't like the way your glazing job is turning out, don't worry, as it's fairly easy to ""undo"" your work. Wet a clean paper towel or rag with mineral spirits (for oil-based glazes) or water (for water-based glazes) and rub gently to remove the glaze. Dry off the fresh spot and start again at your leisure, being sure to use the same glaze mix so that your colors match.


As noted above, while individual glazes vary in their drying time, you'll usually have about 10-20 minutes before the glaze starts to dry.Try to remove the glaze before it dries — it's a lot harder to get off afterward.

, When you're finally happy with the way your glaze job looks, set your wood in a place where drips and spills are unlikely and allow it to dry. Give it a generous time window for drying — you want it to be completely dry before you start working on it again. Waiting overnight is long enough for most glazes.


If you notice small drips or mistakes after your glaze dries, it's usually possible to carefully scrape them off with a razor or craft knife.

, Glaze isn't meant to be the top coat on a piece of wood — it's too thin and vulnerable to wear and tear to offer much protection. Once you're sure that the glaze is 100% dry, seal the glaze with at least one coat of a stronger, more protective finish. Multiple sealant layers are generally recommended.


The vast majority of finishes should work well with nearly all glazes. However, you'll want to be extra-sure that you've given you glaze plenty of sealant if you intend to use a topcoat with a different base than your glaze (e.g., if you're using a water-based topcoat and you previously used an oil-based glaze.)

Brush varnish lightly onto your wood.,
Tip off while the varnish is still wet.,
Apply two thin coats of varnish, then sand and apply another.",How to Apply Varnish2," Dip just the tip of your brush into the varnish-thinner mixture, and gently apply it to your piece. Work in the direction of the wood grain, not back-and-forth. Start in one corner and do a one foot square. When that is finished, move your brush and start another square right next to it. Repeat until the entire surface is covered.








Keep dipping your brush into the varnish to keep it wet.
Wear rubber gloves and a respirator, if you want to protect yourself from fumes and spills.

, “Tipping off” smoothes out the surface of the varnish and helps prevent any bubbles and streaks. Hold the brush at a right angle to the work surface, and lightly brush just the tip of the brush over the whole varnished surface. Once again, work in the direction of the wood grain.







, Most projects will need several coats of varnish. Let each coat dry thoroughly. This will take at least 6 hours, and probably 24 or more. After the second coat has dried, sand the piece with 320-grit sandpaper. Wipe away the residue, then apply at least one more coat of varnish.








Varnish is dry when it does not feel tacky to the touch.
If your sandpaper becomes clogged with residue, it’s a sign the varnish has not sufficiently dried.
Light-wear projects, like trim, may only need one coat of varnish. Heavy-duty pieces like furniture may need around five..
Let the final coat cure for several weeks before using the item.

Seal the finish.",How to Apply a Ceruse Finish," Ceruse can be applied to any type of hardwood furniture, flooring, cabinet, shelving or even trim. Because it’s such a versatile finish, it makes a great way to spruce up old, humdrum wooden items and give them some contemporary flair. The key is to look for surfaces with distinct grain patterns that you can coax out with layers of color.Experiment with used or salvaged pieces before attempting to refinish more expensive items.
Working in a bright, well-ventilated area will allow you to see in better detail and disperse the fumes from stains, pigments and sealants.;
, Unless you’re starting with an unfinished piece of wood, you’ll first need to remove any paints and sealants that are already in place. Use mineral spirits or a chemical wood stripper to eat away at the existing finish. When the original wood has been uncovered, wipe it down with a mild soap solution.Adding moisture to the stripped wood will cause the grain to expand, helping it stand out after being buried beneath a sealed finish for so long.
Make sure the surface is completely dry before you move on.

, If you have access to an automated sander, it can be a big help for removing leftover bits of finish and smoothing out the wood. Run the sander lightly over the surface, buffing the grain to an even depth. You’ll now have a nice level base to start with.Use a soft-bristled brush or blower to clear away dust.
Sanding is also a great way to remove the finish from varnished wood so you won’t have to bother with messy, noxious chemical strippers., Run the brush along the length of the wooden surface, making sure to go with the grain. You’ll need to brush vigorously in order to properly open up the pores—don’t be afraid to really dig in. Work from one end to the other, applying the same amount of pressure all the way across.As you work, you should immediately be able to see the grain becoming more pronounced.
Brushing against the grain can ruin its appearance, and may make it harder for the pigment to set up inside., For a custom ceruse finish, any shade will do. You can make old, outdated furniture pop by reimagining it in vibrant teal or purple tones, or go with a darker shade like black, walnut or steel gray for a more subtle, sleek finish. The color you choose will be totally dependent on your vision for the completed piece.You can also use aniline dye in place of traditional wood stain, which will change the color of the outer surface without filling the grain.Blend together different stains to create a unique original color.

, Ball up the rag and grip the loose ends in one hand. Then, saturate the bunched end with stain and let the excess drip off into the container. That way, you'll get the perfect amount of coverage with every application.As their name implies, stains can get very messy. Pull on a pair (or a couple pairs) of disposable gloves before you begin applying the color., Starting at one edge of the piece, begin rubbing on the stain. Go back over the wet stain using smooth polishing motions to work it deep into the wood. Continue applying the stain until the entire piece is covered.Just like when you were brushing, following the wood’s natural grain pattern will make for the best results.Be careful not to apply the stain too heavily. There should be no wet spots or standing moisture on the wood.

, Avoid touching the surface of the wood while it’s still wet, as this can leave streaks or blotches. If possible, keep a fan running in your workspace to promote airflow around the drying stain. After the first few hours, you can test stain’s progress by dabbing it gently with a cloth.If you’ve stained a piece on multiple sides, setting it on a dropcloth to dry will keep the stain from rubbing off on other objects.It may be easiest to do your staining on one day and save the remaining steps for another.

, Brush a thin layer of pigment directly over the entire surface of the piece. This can be done with either a wide painter’s brush or a piece of cheesecloth. Be sure to mix the pigment thoroughly before you begin and use long, smooth strokes to ensure that it goes on evenly.In most cases, a basic white shade will stand out most clearly in the wood grain.
Alternatives to plain pigment you can try include interior latex paint and white liming wax. All of these materials will be applied in the same fashion., Using a handful of steel wool, lightly scour the wood while it’s still wet. This will lift most of the pigment from the outer surface while leaving the pigment in the grain untouched. The end result is a rich, complex finish that’s distinguished by the depth of color within the grain.Select a very fine steel wool (like #000 grade) to strip away more pigment without damaging the wood underneath.Wipe off excess pigment on the surface of the wood with a soft, damp cloth., Depending on the size of piece, it will most likely require 12-24 hours to completely cure. During this time, it’s best not to handle wood.Store the drying piece in dry, temperate conditions. Humidity may cause the wood to swell and interfere with the pigment’s ability to dry., Once the remaining paint is dry, go over the entire surface with a square of high-grit sandpaper. This will work out rough spots and inconsistencies to give the finished piece a more uniform appearance. It will also give you an opportunity to chip away at areas where the pigment is a little too thick.


Sanding will also help remove unattractive chalky residue from the lighter colored pigment from the outside of the wood.
Avoid applying too much pressure with the sandpaper, or you could accidentally scrape off some of the pigment.

, Brush on a clear coat to protect the wood and seal the exposed pores, then let it dry overnight. Once the sealant cures, the elegant finish will be resistant to moisture, dirt and minor bumps and scratches. Enjoy the revamped look of your dining table, bureau or kitchen cabinets!If you’re adding a ceruse finish to outdoor furniture, choose a durable varnish that’s formulated to safeguard against the elements."

Choose a barrel.,
Make a paper template for the dolly platform.,
Transfer the template to a piece of plywood.,
Cut the plywood with a jigsaw.,
Screw 4 casters onto the dolly close to the edge (about 1 inch or 2.5 cm seems right – if they are too close the center, the dolly will be less stable).,
Drill a few drainage holes in the plywood.,
Coat the dolly with a weatherproof coating to reduce water damage.,
Drill some drainage holes in the bottom of the barrel.,
Stand the barrel on the dolly.,
Create extra drainage by drilling additional holes into the dolly through the holes in the bottom of the barrel – by aligning them you will have a direct drainage channels that should minimize pooling of water on the dolly.,
Put stones over the drainage holes, then fill the barrel with soil, plant and water as desired.

",How to Build a Plant Dolly," Ideally, use an oak barrel that has a relatively flat bottom – sometimes they become warped during outdoor storage. They are probably fine but won’t sit perfectly flat on the dolly.;
, Turn the barrel upside down and cut a circle of paper to size. The aim is to produce a circle that fits well into the bottom of the barrel, inside the lip with a bit of clearance (about 1/2"" or 1.25cm). That way, the bottom of the barrel will be fully supported by the dolly. It also looks better – the rough plywood is largely concealed by the lip of the barrel. A typical barrel such as the one shown here has a diameter of about 2 ft (60cm) at the top, and a bit less (about 22"" or 56cm) at the bottom.

, Use a marker pen to trace the outline of the template onto the plywood – 3/4"" or 1.9cm ply works well. It need not be pretty, since it is barely visible once completed.

, Fit it onto the bottom of the barrel, and trim with the jigsaw if necessary. (You may need two people for this step: exercise caution when using power tools.)

, Use screws of length appropriate for the thickness of the plywood. They will go in better if you drill small pilot holes, using the caster as a template to mark the positions of the holes with a marker pen.



Choose rotating casters rather than those that are fixed. The ones illustrated here are rated for 125 lb, for a total limit of 500lb, which should be sufficient. (The oak planter shown here is a traditional half whiskey barrel, weighing about 40 lb and with capacity of 106 quarts; estimated weight when full of waterlogged soil is about 250 lb.)






You could probably get by with three casters, but it would be slightly less stable – a consideration if you expect to move the dolly often or if you have small children.







, Avoid placing them too close to the casters.

, A clear deck sealer should be sufficient. (The oak barrel planter has a limited lifespan so there is no need for perfection there). Allow to dry.

, Seven holes (one central and 6 surrounding) with a 3/8” drill bit seems about right.

, If it wobbles a lot or does not sit flat, you can shim it with a small piece of wood.

, Wait to do this until you are satisfied with the position of the barrel, and make sure you don’t hit the casters.

Wait until your painting is completely dry.,
Clean your workspace.,
Gather your varnishing supplies.,
Prepare your varnish for application.,
Apply the varnish to your painting.,
Add another layer, if desired.",How to Apply Varnish3," Attempting to apply varnish to a painting before it is totally dry will create a mess and possibly ruin your work. Oil paintings should cure for several months before they are ready, while acrylic paintings should be completely dry in 24 hours., Varnish attracts dust and other impurities, so minimize these by vacuuming your workspace beforehand. Avoid sweeping, as this will only stir up more dust.








Close doors and windows to keep additional dust out.

, A wide, flat, and soft brush is ideal for varnishing. To keep impurities out, dedicate a brush solely to varnishing, not painting. Clean it after each use. You will also need some artist-quality varnish (for acrylics or oils, depending on your paints), and a shallow tray to pour the varnish into., Open the container of varnish and stir it gently but thoroughly. Pour a small amount onto your shallow tray. Load your brush by running it through the varnish, then wiping it on the side of the tray.







, Keep your work flat so the varnish does not run. Run your brush in long, even strokes from the top to the bottom of your painting. Proceed from one side to the other. Apply only a thin coat.







, One coat is enough varnish for many paintings. If you would like thicker coverage, let the first dry for 24 hours before applying a second coat. For the second coat, run your brush horizontally rather than vertically, as you did for the first coat. This will provide optimal coverage.








If you missed spots in the first coat, don’t go back over it until it has dried thoroughly.
For a very thick coat, you can add a third coat of varnish after waiting for the second to dry.

Wear down your furniture with sandpaper.,
Simulate worm holes.,
Imitate wear and tear with dents, scrapes and dings.,
Apply a faux finish.",How to Age Wooden Furniture," For the most authentic antique wooden furniture look, sand down areas that would most likely be worn over time. For example, arm rests, chair seats, chair rungs, edges and surfaces near drawer pulls are usually the most worn furniture areas.;
, Antique wooden furniture often has woodworm holes, and this effect can be reproduced using household items.


Use a drill and a small drill bit, or an ice pick, to make irregular clusters of 4 to 5 holes.
Create rows of small holes by stabbing wood with a fork.
Hammer a cluster of long nails through the end of a block of wood that you can hold in your hand. All of the nails should come out at the same place on the backside of the block. Slam this block into wooden furniture to create a cluster of worm holes in 1 movement.

, This is called distressing, and may be done in a variety of ways:


Use a chisel and hammer to knock chips into the wood.
Pound into the wood with a hammer or mallet to create soft impressions.
Attach a variety of nuts, bolts and washers to a 2 foot (0.6 m) length of chain and slam the chain into the wood to make indentations.
To create a variety of irregular gashes when distressing wood furniture, try putting an assortment of heavy metal objects inside a pillowcase and flogging the furniture with the filled pillowcase. Be creative with what you use, as anything that makes an indentation will effectively age wooden furniture.
Score along the grain of the wood with a chisel to create natural-looking cracks and hewing.
Use a wire brush to create scratch marks on furniture bases that would normally come into contact with shoes. Additionally, chair backs and arms, as well as outer edges of tables, dressers and armoires, generally show signs of scraping into walls and/or other furniture.
Round sharp edges with a wood file or chisel. Being sure to go with the grain of the wood, use a file for aging furniture edges and prominent surfaces. Pay special attention to chair arm ends and chair and table feet.

, Use paint, paste wax, glaze and/or crackle medium to visually age wooden furniture.


Sand the protective finish off the wooden furniture you plan on faux finishing. Wipe the surface down with a damp rag to remove dirt, debris and sand dust.
Paint a base coat. Choose a color that you intend to show through the faux finish. Allow the paint to dry for 24 hours.
Spread a thin coat of paste wax over the base paint. Allow the wax to set for 1 hour before aging furniture any further.
Paint a faux finish glaze (which you may purchase at a home improvement store or mix yourself by combining 3 parts paint to 1 part water) over the wax. You may opt to leave this coat as-is, or to wipe off part of it with a rag to create a dingy look. Repeat this process as necessary, until you have reached your desired effect. Allow the glaze coat to dry for 24 hours.
Sand over areas that would naturally be time-worn, revealing the base coat underneath.
Finish your piece with either a sealant, or with a crackle medium. Crackle medium can be bought in any home improvement or craft store. Simply paint it on and, as it dries, it condenses into crackles, creating the look of sun-crackled paint.

Choose a wood that contains tannins.,
Look for wood that contains flaws.,
Choose wood that has not yet been finished.,
Strip and sand wood if it has been finished.,
Put your work table or sawhorse in the sun.,
Place your wood on your sawhorse.,
Mix a solution of 1 part baking soda to 1 part water.,
Stir it well, and then apply it with a paintbrush.,
Let it sit in the sun all day.,
Brush the surface of the wood with a wire brush.,
Rinse the wood with water and pat it dry.,
Apply a stain to help finish the wood.,
Use furniture wax to protect the finish.,
Add 1 to 2 coats of the furniture wax with a soft cloth and let it sit overnight before using.",How to Age Wood with Baking Soda," This includes cedar, pine, red oak, redwood and mahogany. Tannin is an acidic compound found in plants, including trees.


Woods that are harder and darker have more tannin. Soaking dark woods in water or weathering them will leach the tannins from the surface, lightening the surface of the wood.;
, Unless your project requires extremely uniform look, you can search for cast-off wood that is cheaper. The aging process will make beauty of the wood’s imperfections.


If you want to use wood that is pristine, you can beat it up with tools, such as a bag of screws or hammer. Hit it repeatedly or drag the sharp ends across the wood’s surface. , The baking soda aging method will work best on untreated wood or, at least, wood that has not yet been varnished.

, For wood that has been previously painted once, you may be able to sand off the top layer. For wood that has been painted more than once, you may want to try a chemical stripper.


Wear safety goggles, long-sleeved work clothes and gloves when you use a sander or chemical stripper.
Work in a ventilated area, such as an open shop or garage.
The care you take with the stripping or sanding the wood should depend upon the look you want to achieve. If you want your project to look older and more distressed, you can leave some paint on portions of the wood.

, Exposing the wood to direct sunlight during the aging process will speed up the leaching process.

, Try to expose the entire top surface of the wood, including the sides, if you want them exposed. You can always repeat the process on the other side of the wood.

, The amount you mix will depend upon the size of your project. You will want to liberally apply it to your wood.

, Make sure it is covered with a thick layer of baking soda and water.

, If possible, let it sit for 6 hours, so that it has a chance to leach the tannins from the wood.


If you do not have access to direct sunlight or 6 hours to spare, spray the surface of the wood with vinegar after you have applied the baking soda. Let it sit for 10 minutes.

, Tannins, extra finish and part of the wood may come off with the brush.

, Repeat the process the next day, if there is too much color in the wood.

, Apply it with a paintbrush. Then, keep a wet cloth nearby to remove excess stain. For an even lighter look, you can wet the wood lightly, apply the stain and wipe off a portion of the stain.

, This will give off a light sheen, but it will not be as shiny as varnish. A shiny finish may ruin the distressed look of the wood.

, If you are going to use the wood for a project, you should wait until the project is completed to apply the furniture wax.

Consider applying some antiquing glaze for an aged look.,
Remove excess glaze, if necessary.,
Apply three coats of a clear sealer, allowing each coat dry before applying the next one.,
Make sure that the sealer has fully cured before you replace the hardware on the cabinets.",How to Distress Cabinets1," If your cabinet is a standalone piece, try to move it outside. If the cabinet is attached to the wall, cover your floors and counters with a painter's cloth or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. Move anything that might get stained by paint to a safer place.


This method is suitable for painted, varnished, and unpainted cabinets. It will be easier on an unpainted cabinet, however.;
, Put them inside a box or a plastic, re-sealable bag so that they all stay together. Consider taping the screws to their corresponding hinges, knobs, and handles.

, It roughs up the surface and gives the stain and paint something to stick to. Your weathering will last a lot longer as a result.If you are working on a painted or varnished cabinet, keep sanding the until the raw wood starts to show. These areas will eventually get the stain, so the more you sand, the more weathered your cabinet will look.

, Get out your vacuum cleaner, and vacuum the floor. Wipe down the cabinets with a tack cloth. Follow up with a damp cloth. If your cabinets are in the kitchen, consider using an ammonia-based household cleaner or a degrease to get rid of any oil residue.


Make sure you get rid of all the sawdust. Any dust that remains will get into your stain and/or paint, and mar the surface.You'll get a messy finish instead of a weathered one.

, This includes glass paneling and the edges of the walls around your cabinets. Not only will you be keeping these areas safe and clean, but you'll also get nice, crisp lines later on.

, This is the color that will peek through your paint after you ""weather"" it:You may need two to three layers of stain. Be sure to let each layer dry before applying the next.


Consider going over the cabinet with a steel wire brush first. This will open up the wood grain and help the stain and/or paint to soak in better., It’s easiest to do this with a bristly paintbrush. This will protect the stain from the paint. The paint won't stick to these areas. When you are done painting, these areas will show through as ""Weathering.""Try to keep these areas random but keep in mind that most weathering will occur on corners and edges.

, It is better to apply many thin coats than one thick coat; it will give you the smoothest finish and lessens the appearance of brushstrokes. Most paints will dry to the touch and be ready for another coat in 30 minutes to 2 hours. Check the label on your can.

, Use 220 grit sandpaper this time. It will smooth down any brush strokes, and remove the excess wax or petroleum jelly. When you are done, vacuum your floor up and wipe the cabinet down with a tack cloth.


You can also use a steel wool pad to rub at the areas with the wax/petroleum jelly. This lets the stain show through.

, If you really want to give your cabinets that old look, you'll need some antiquing glaze. Get out a clean rag and dip it into the glaze. You don't need a lot—a small amount will go a long way. Next, rub the glaze onto the cabinet using a small, circular motion. Let the glaze dry for the time specified by the manufacturer's directions.


If you want a crackly look, use a crackle glaze instead. For large, wide cracks, apply a thick coat. For finer, more spidery cracks, apply a thinner coat.
Once the cabinet is covered in glaze, you can smooth out the circular marks with a clean rag. Wipe the glaze up and down or side-to-side to get a lined look.
If you’d like to darken the edges or small corners, apply the glaze using a small brush.

, With a rag wrapped around your finger, wipe away any glaze that’s inadvertently gotten in places you wish it weren’t. After this stage, allow your cabinets to dry before adding a topcoat.


It's best to wait 24 hours, or at the very least overnight. You don't want to the two coats meshing together and marring your artwork.
All the rags you've used should be washed together but separate from your other linens in your washing machine in case the glaze stains.

, If you can, try to find a sealer that is non-yellowing. A good sealer to use is a polycrylic sealer. Avoid using polyurethane, if you can, as those tend to yellow over time.How long the coats take to dry will depend on the sealer itself. Most sealers will dry within 2 to 3 hours, but you might want to refer to the label for more specific drying times.
Check the label to make sure yours is non-yellowing.
Some sealers need a curing period as well. This can take several hours to a few days. Do not get impatient or try to rush through. If you don't let your work cure properly, you'll get a sticky, tacky, gummy finish.

, Check the label on the can that your sealer came in. Some sealers need a few days' curing time. This means that until they fully cure, the sealer will be sticky. During this time, you will want to leave the cabinets open so that they don't ""glue shut. Once the sealer is fully dry and/or cured, you can replace the hinges, knobs, and handles.

Finish the wood.",How to Age Wood1," Placing steel wool in vinegar will, over time, dissolve the wool. This combines with the vinegar to create an aging stain.






;
, Fill a glass jar with vinegar, and place a fist-sized chunk of steel wool inside it. Let it settle for a minimum of one day, but up to five days for a darker solution.








, Sand it to remove any stain or coating which might prevent your aging solution from adhering properly.








, Boil black tea to brush onto the wood prior to using your steel wool solution. Tea contains tannic acid, which reacts with the vinegar stain and darkens it. The tea will not add any color by itself, it will only make the wood appear wet.








, Use a paintbrush to give a thorough coat to the wood. You should see an immediate change in color, which will dry after a few hours. Only one coat is necessary to give the “aged” look, but multiple coats can be applied to darken the wood.








, Allow time to dry, and then use a damp rag and cold water to remove any residue from the steel wool. This can be the finished product, but if desired, a wax coating can be applied to preserve the effect.

, The same technique that is used to whitewash furniture can be used to paint floors, walls and ceilings.


You may decide to use a very gradual whitewashing process, if you are painting permanent features in your home.

,


If you choose finished wood, you may need to use a chemical stripper to remove layers of paint. The preparation process will be longer.
If you find unfinished wood, you will need to lightly sand it until it is even.
If you choose unfinished wood, the paint may soak more deeply into the grain, making it harder to apply the whitewash.

, You do not want to strip the wood inside your house.


Choose an area that can open to the outside, like a garage. If you decide to use a chemical stripper, the wood should be placed near an open door.
Pick an area that you are not worried about damaging with dust and paint.

, If you don’t want to mix your own paint, then purchase this ready-to-use product.

, A whitewash is actually diluted white paint, designed to give minimal cover and color on the underlying wood.


Whitewashing an object should cost less than painting an object, because the paint is diluted with tap water or turpentine.
Choose an oil-based or water-based paint that is not too yellow. You will want to start with a crisp white, rather than a cream color.
Dilute water-based paints with water. Dilute oil-based paints with mineral spirits or turpentine.Grab a sturdy bucket or old paint can in which to mix the whitewash.

White distilled vinegar. Any brand will do.
Steel wool. Fine graded is ideal because it disintegrates best, but any grade will work.A container of some sort. This can be a bucket, a jar, a pot, a bowl, or whatever else you have on hand. If you dislike the smell of vinegar you may want to opt for a container you can close while the mixture sits, particularly if you want it to get quite dark, as this will involve letting it sit for a while.Rubber gloves. These are optional, but a good idea if you are concerned about cutting your fingers on the steel wool, or if you plan on making a particularly dark solution that might stain your fingers.
A strainer. This is also optional, as you can apply the stain straight from whatever container you made it in. This will come in handy if you want to transfer the liquid to another container to store and use again later.
A paintbrush.;
, Some woods will work better than others. You don’t want to go to the trouble of making a stain only to discover that it won’t stain.








Wood with bifurcated grains is best, particularly where the wood grain is layered in hard/soft layers, so the soft layers are affected by the process but the hard layers are not, causing the wood to look old.
Softwoods are easier to work with than hardwoods. Southern yellow pine, western cedar, and fir are excellent candidates for aging. Red oak, maple, or other slow-growing, tightly grained woods are not.Hardwoods with a distinct grain, such as hickory, white oak, elm, or ash, can also work well.This method is not appropriate for laminate flooring, as the vinegar will likely cause the glue holding the layers together to fall apart.

, Stains made with steel wool and vinegar range from a reddish, rusty brown, to a very dark, burnt brown. They also range in intensity from very subtle, to very intense. These factors are influenced by the ratio of steel wool to vinegar, and by how long you let the mixture sit. Before you begin, decide approximately color stain you want to create, and plan accordingly.









The color of the stain is determined by how long it sits. Stain soaked for just a couple days will have a dark, burnt tone. The longer it sits, the rustier in color it will become.The intensity of the stain is determined both by how many steel wool pads you use, and how long you let the mixture sit. 1-3 steel wool pads to a half-gallon of vinegar should work for most projects. If you want your stain to darken faster, try adding another steel wool pad. If it becomes too dark, simply dilute it with water.

, This step is not strictly required, but it will help the disintegration process and speed things up. You will want to wear plastic gloves to avoid cutting your fingers. Break apart the steel wool pads, and put the pieces in the container you are mixing your stain in.








, This is pretty straightforward. Just pour the vinegar over the steel wool. Give it a good mix, and put the cover on.







, You can create a very subtle stain in just 15 minutes or so, but you will probably want to wait longer. 2-4 days will make a stain suitable for most projects, but you can let the mixture steep for months at a time to create a more dramatic effect.







, This is an optional step and is more important if you plan on storing the stain for later use. When it reaches the color you want, you can pour the mixture through a colander and into a new, sealable container. You can also use it straight from whatever container it is in.







, Without knowing what your stain looks like when applied, you might not want to brush it onto your furniture just yet. Brush some onto a scrap piece of the same sort of wood, or a part of whatever you are staining that is not usually visible, and wait an hour. If you don’t like the color you end up with, make adjustments to your mixture; add more steel wool or wait longer if you want it to be darker, wait longer if you want it to be redder, or dilute it with water if you want it to be more subtle.







, Sanding your wood down before painting it can give it an even more dramatically weathered look. This step is optional, and your stain should look good with or without it. It’s just a matter of what effect you want to achieve. 







, There is no particular technique necessary for this. Brush in the direction of the grain, coating it evenly, and let it sit to allow the stain to penetrate the wood.Then just let it dry, and sit back and admire your work.








, You can choose whether or not to do this based on how you want the final product to look. For a polished sheen, wait for the wood to dry completely, brush on the wax, let it dry for an hour, and polish it with a towel. If you want a more natural, weather-beaten look, skip this step.

,  If space runs out, simply continue on the next plane, running the design over the entire house.  Pull a small shape from the images you've drawn on your house and repeat it around the eaves, door hole or front of the house.

, 


If, for example, you have pink blossoms appearing in many places over your birdhouse, pull some white paint into the center of the plate and add a touch of red.  Stir to make pink.  Mix enough to paint all the places that need to be pink.  If the paint is too thick to apply easily, use your brush to dilute it slightly with water. Rough the color in, painting all the pink shapes at one time while pink is on your palette.
Move to a clean spot on the palette and continue mixing colors and applying the new color to all shapes that need that color. The time for detail will come after the entire house gets its first coat of color(s).  Allow to dry.
You will soon find the mixing and painting process becoming second nature. 

, When the entire house has at least one layer and no primer is showing you can begin to work on refining your shapes.  Details will go fast with a small, pointed brush, but try to resist outline everything.  If an area needs re-working or a color needs correcting or changed, acrylic paint makes this easy.  Just allow the work to dry before painting over earlier layers.

,  Turn it over and sign your name on the bottom, and, if it is to become a gift, write few words.

Purchase all the gear you need.,
Mount the bed rail hangers.,
Attach the support rails.,
Create the support blocks.,
Attach the support blocks.,
Connect the rails.,
Add the support beams.,
Insert your plywood mattress surface.,
Finished.",How to Build a Wooden Bed Frame1," See the ""Things You'll Need"" list below for specific details. The goal is to build a frame that will fit a queen-size mattress (60"" wide x 80"" long). Beyond that, you'll need to visit your local home improvement warehouse to acquire three basic things:


Bed rail hangers
Wood
Wood screws;
, This hardware is essential in forming a rigid connection between all the bed rails in the frame. Secure the bed rail hangers to the end of the side-rail and head post. Double check that each placement is consistent. Repeat the process for all corners.


These hangers can sometimes be hard to find in hardware stores. If so, check online retailers.
Bed rail hangers are usually sold 4 sets to a package.
In the place of bed rail hangers, you can use 8 long lag bolts. When tightened, the lag bolts make the bed very solid. Lag bolts are also much easier to find than bed rail hangers.

, Screw the support rail to each side rail. Make sure to space the screws about 12"" (30.5 cm) apart. This provides maximum weight support.

, Cut a groove into the support block and support beam, as shown. This groove should be a centered 1.5""x 3.5"" slot, with the wider measurement following the wider part of the block.

, Attach each support block to the center of the head rail and foot rail with screws as shown in the image.

, Connect each rail to the post using the bedrail hangers.

, Insert the support beam between the two support blocks.

, Rest the plywood on the support rails and support beam. It should fit into the inner part of the bed frame. Once this is done, the mattress can be placed in the frame.

, Enjoy your new bed!

Protect your work area from sanding dust.,
Remove all metal hardware and store it in a box or a plastic re-sealable bag.,
Sand the edges and corners using a medium or 100 grit sandpaper.,
Go over the entire cabinet using a finer grit sanding sponge.,
Clean the cabinet and your work area to get rid of any dust.,
Consider applying some dark wax onto the weathered edges and into the corners.,
Finish off with furniture wax.,
Put your cabinet back together, if needed.",How to Distress Cabinets2," You won't be doing any painting, but you will be doing quite a lot of sanding. If possible, try to take your cabinets outside. If you can't, consider placing a painter's cloth down on the floor for easy cleanup.

, If the knobs or handles are made out of wood, consider leaving them on so that you can weather them too.

, Use a quick, flicking motion. Keep going until some of the raw wood starts to show though. Don't worry about getting it perfectly even. It's okay if some parts of the edges and corners still have paint on them.


If you left the handles or knots on, give them a give buff with the sandpaper too. Focus on the areas that will get the more wear, sure such the edges.

, This will help ""blend"" in the initial weathering you did on the edges. It will also buff the paint, making it look less new. It can also help give the cabinet a slight texture.

, If you don't do this, the dust will get into the wax in the next steps, which may result in a messy finish rather than a weathered one. Get out your vacuum cleaner, and vacuum the floor of your work area. Next, wipe down the entire cabinet using a tack cloth. Finish off by wiping it down with a damp cloth.

, This will help give your cabinet that distinctive weathered look.Apply the wax using a soft cloth or a foam sponge. Focus on the cracks and corners where dust and dirt are most likely to collect.


You will want to buy specifically designed weathering wax for furniture. You can find it in hardware stores as well as in some arts and crafts stores.

, This will not only re-seal the paint, but also help protect the raw edges you just uncovered through sanding. Start by applying a small amount of wax onto the tips of a large, short-bristled brush. Use small, circular motions to ""massage"" the wax into the cabinet. Work in small areas at a time, and pick up more wax with your brush as needed. Finish off by buffing the wax with the brush.It should not feel sticky when you are done.


A small amount of wax goes a long way.

, If you took off the hardware, wait until the wax has absorbed into the cabinet, then put the hinges, knobs, and handles back on.

Apply a coat of sun bleach stain to your wood.,
Add a layer of early American stain.,
Make a rustic stain.,
Apply the rustic stain.",How to Age Wood2," Allow time to set and then wipe off the excess. This will remove any previous color or stain from the wood, and enhance the natural grain and texture.








, This particular stain gives the appearance and color of wood that has been left for many years. If desired, this can be the final step.








, Combine your own unique combination of a color glaze, antiquing glaze, and mixing glaze. Be sure to use all three glazes from the same brand, so as to insure proper color mixing.








, Use a paintbrush to thoroughly coat the wood with the stain. There are multiple methods to do this:









Apply a single coat for a lighter look. This also can give the appearance of slightly newer wood.
Add multiple coats of stain to create a more worn look. This will also darken the wood, giving it a richer color.
Create “freckles” on your wood by flicking stain using a paintbrush or toothbrush. This will give irregular small spots of dark color on the wood. "

Gather your materials and supplies.,
Create the base frame.,
Add the base bracers.,
Create the platform frame.,
Add the platform bracers.,
Add the platform supports.,
Reinforce the corners and joints.,
Add the plywood surface.,
Paint the bed.,
Done!",How to Build a Wooden Bed Frame2," You'll need a circular saw, a number of basic L brackets, 3"" decking screws, some MDF or plywood, and then several cuts of lumber. For lumber, you'll need:


Two pieces of 85"" 2x4
Five pieces of 67"" 2x4
Eight pieces of 19 3/8 2x4
Two pieces of 75"" 2x12
Four pieces of 57"" 2x12

, Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 75"" 2x12s and two of the 57"" 2x12s into a 60""x75"" box.

, Slide in the remaining 57"" 2x12s, space the box into thirds, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place. Set aside the completed base.

, Using standard butt joints, use the decking screws to join together the 85"" 2x4s and two of the 67"" 2x4s into a 70""x85"" box.

, Slide in the remaining 67"" 2x4s, space the box into 4 sections, and then use the decking screws to screw the bracers into place.

, You will now add the 19 3/8"" 2x4s between the bracers, two to a section. Space them evenly but stagger them, so that the leftmost and second right most sections have the supports at the same level and the rightmost and second leftmost have the supports at the same level. Attach these with decking screws as well.

, Reinforce the inside corners of both the base and platform with L brackets. You can also add L brackets around some of the other interior joints as well for added strength.

, Trace and cut plywood to fit the surface of the platform. This will likely take two pieces of plywood to cover. Attach the plywood with decking screws to the inside bracers, such that the screws won't show on the exposed platform.

, Sand the wood and then paint or stain the bed to the desired color.

, Arrange the platform on top of the base in the final location. You can attach the platform to the base with a few strategically placed L brackets if you want to. Just top with your mattress of full or queen size mattress!

Get your materials.,
Create the end boxes.,
Add the center brace.,
Add in shelves if desired.,
Add a backing to the end shelves.,
Add feet to the end shelves.,
Paint all four bookcases to match.,
Attach the plywood to the end shelves.,
Adjust the Expedit shelves as necessary.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Build a Wooden Bed Frame3," You'll need two Ikea Expedit bookshelves (the 2x4 square size), several feet of velcro, a saw, decking screws, 24 basic L brackets with mounting screws, and lumber in the following cuts:


Four 38"" pieces of 2x10
Six 28"" pieces of 2x10
Four 16 & 3/4"" pieces of 1x10

, You'll be using the lumber to build two end shelves which share the weight of the bed with the Expedit shelves. The boxes are created by Connecting two 38"" sections of 2x10 lumber to two 28"" sections of 2x10 lumber into a 38""x31"" box. Secure the pieces together using decking screws, 3 for each connection. Secure each corner with an L bracket at the center.

, Another piece of 28"" 2x10 is then centered and attached in the same way to create two sections in each box. Secure the center brace with an L bracket on each side at both the top and bottom.

, If you want to have shelves, you can add these in easily with some 1x10 lumber cut to 16 & 3/4"". Adjust the shelf to the desired height and then secure the bottom with L brackets, two to a side.

, Trace the shelves onto plywood and cut out the backing with a jigsaw. Nail it into place by hand or using a pneumatic nail gun.

, You will probably want to add felt feet to the bottom of these shelves to keep them from scratching floors or moving around. These are easily bought from many different types of stores.

, With the shelves done, you will want to paint them and the Expedit shelves to be the same color. Use spray paint which is graded to go on laminate.

, Cut a piece of plywood to be 38""x75"". With both shelves facing outward and the Expedit shelves dry fit between them, nail the plywood into place by driving two nails through the plywood and into the top of the sides of the end shelves.


You can glue on a non-slip mat, like the ones which go under carpets, if you want to.

, Adjust the Expedit shelves so that they are flush with the sides of the end shelves.

, Ikea makes several useful inserts for Expedit shelves. You can add baskets, pull out drawers, or just basic doors, and all come in a variety of colors. Enjoy your new bed!


This bed should be used by a child only, as it cannot support extreme weights.

Paint your wood.,
Apply white school glue.,
Add a second coat of paint.,
Wait for the crackle effect to start taking place.",How to Age Wood3," Use any hue of your choice, but it must be an acrylic paint.








, Use a generous amount to completely coat the wood. You should apply enough glue so that it appears opaque. Allow it to partially dry, until tacky.








, Brush the paint over the still tacky glue, and allow time to dry.








, It may take several hours for it to appear, after the glue and paint completely dry.

Distress wood with nails in a sock.,
Hit the wood with a hammer or mallet.,
Rub the wood with sandpaper.,
Make ""wormholes"" with drywall screws hammered into a 2x4.",How to Age Wood4," Pour nails or screws into a sock, and hit the wood until it reaches your desired level of distress.








, Soft strikes with a hammer will create small divots in the wood, while a mallet will make wider impressions.








, This will remove areas of stain and give the wood a rough texture, as is likely to occur in a natural setting over time.








, If you want to give your wood the appearance of having been eaten by worms over many decades, you can try to give it wormholes yourself. Hammer or screw the drywall nails into the 2x4 completely so that their ends stick through the bottom of your makeshift hammer. Next, strike the piece of wood with your wormhole hammer repeatedly, creating small puncture marks.









To create a more interesting wormhole pattern, be sure to hammer your drywall screws into the 2x4 in an irregular pattern. Turn the wormhole hammer around and strike your wood at different angles to create a more natural looking effect.

Decide on how big the chest of drawers is going to be and how many drawers will it have.,
Assemble the bottom panel.,
Attach the metal slides for the drawers to the two side panels of the chest.,
Place the bottom panel on the floor, apply glue to the inside of the left and right strips.,
Add the second side and attach, as you did for the other side panel to finally give you a chest carcass with the four sides.,
Attach molding to the edge of the chest as shown with glue and nails.,
Prepare the four sides for each drawer, and attach them together with glue and a screw going in from one face into the edge of the plywood like a frame.,
Attach the drawer slides to the bottom of these drawers and then slide them in.",How to Build a Tall Drawer Chest," The chest shown here had to fit in a cavity in the wall that was 37” wide and 24” deep and went up all the way to the ceiling, so the chest of drawers was planned to be about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, 3 feet (0.9 m) wide and 2 feet (0.6 m) deep.


The chest box is made up of 5 panels of 3/4th inch plywood, two sides, a top and a bottom, and the front. The back will b of 1/4th inch MDF.
The dimensions of the 5 3/4th inch panels for the chest box were: Top panel = 22” x 34”; Bottom panel = 22” x 34”; Left panel = 22” x 46”; Right panel = 22” x 46”; Front panel = 20.5” x 44.5”.
A paper template with 1” = 1 foot (0.3 m) and then laid these on 4”x 8” to see how to cut these from 4 feet (1.2 m) x 8 feet (2.4 m) plywood panels. Based on the best fit, lines were drawn on a 3/4th inch plywood panel and the individual pieces were cut. See the set-up to cut these without a table saw.
The panels were stained with a gel based stain that simulated mahogany.;
, The bottom panel is assembled by screwing in metal 3/4th inch L-brackets to the left front, right front, left back, and right back as shown in the diagram. Screw holes for the L-brackets are not shown, but each leg of the L had two screw holes. The brackets were coated with glue (Gorilla glue) and then screwed into the edge of the plywood. These brackets add a bit of strength during the assembly process.


Two 3/4th inch by 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) strips of wood were cut to a length 1.5 in longer than the front of the panel (3/4 in x 1.5 in, sold as 1x2 strips). One strip was attached to the front edge of the bottom panel with a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) overhang on each side.

The other strip is similarly attached to the top panel.
Strips are cut of the same length as the sides of the panel (22 inches) and then glued and screwed into the side edges of the top and bottom panel to form a three sided tray.


Finally you will end up with a top and bottom panel for the chest that have three strips covering the front and side edges of the plywood sheets. The strips will project about 3/4th inch from the surface of the plywood. The back edge of the plywood does not have a strip.

, It is very important to measure accurately and to make sure that the left and right panels match exactly. In the image the two sides DO NOT MATCH. The drawer slides from one of the panel had to be unscrewed and reattached after making more accurate measurements. These slides were purchased from ebay at about $2/pair. The slides are 22 inches (55.9 cm) long and came with instructions on how to attach.


Now these sides will be attached to the bottom and the top panels. Take the bottom panel with it's 3 strips and metal brackets and drill three countersunk holes in the side strips. Do the same for the top panel.

, Place the left side panel on top of the bottom panel and attach the side panel to the bottom by using 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) drywall screws to screw through the strip directly into the side panel plywood. Screw the metal L-bracket into the edge of the side panel plywood. Similarly, attach the top panel of the chest to this side panel. The image shows the top panel attached to the side panel.

, Now cut and attach vertical 3/4th x 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) strips to the front with the inside edge of the strip being flush with the inside of the plywood. Attach strips to the outside of the plywood to form an L-shaped edge with the front strip. Now place the chest carcass face down on the floor. Place the back panel of the chest cut from 1/4th inch hardboard or MDF. This panel has to be cut with square edges as it will help pull the chest into an exact rectangle once it is attached to the back of the carcass. Place a bead of the gorilla glue onto the edge of the plywood of the chest carcass and carefully place the back onto the carcass. Attach the left side of the panel to the plywood with 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) screws. Then adjust the chest carcass till it is aligned with the other edge of the back panel. Attach the top end of the panel to the top of the chest carcass and finally the bottom end with screws. Let dry and then stand the chest up.

, Stain the molding. Apply another coat of stain and then three coats of polyurethane varnish. Apply a thin coat of stain between each polyurethane coat to give a richer color.


For the feet, four fence post crowns shaped as spheres were used. These were made out of redwood and were much cheaper than buying bun feet though they were hard to stain and varnish. These crowns had a screw embedded in them so they were directly screwed into the bottom of the drawer chest with a spot of glue.

, The width of the drawers is exactly 1 inch (2.5 cm) less than the inside width of the chest carcass to allow the drawer slides to fit. Stain and varnish these drawer sides (avoid varnishing the bottom of the drawer frames as these will be glued to the drawer bottoms) and let dry. Attach to drawer bottoms cut from 1/4th inch MDF with glue and screws that go into the bottom of the drawer frames. .

, Measure the drawer front panel size required directly from the installed drawers and then cut these from the front panel that you had prepared earlier. Stain and finish these front panels and then attach them to the drawers. I used screws front the front as it was easier to adjust, and then screwed from the inside of the drawer into the front panel. Finally attached drawer pull handles.

Choose the wood that you'll use for the base of the headboard.,
Create a faux headboard if you don't have the right kind of materials.,
Cut the wood or other headboard material into the dimensions that match your bed.,
Cut padding for the headboard.,
Cut the batting so that it's slightly bigger than the outline of your headboard.",How to Build a Headboard for a Bed1," Most headboards are constructed out of wood, so your first step is going to be finding a large-enough piece of wood that you can fashion into a headboard. Check your bed to see that the candidate is at least as wide as your bed; headboards that are flush with the width of the bed look best. Here are some ideas about wood that you can use:









Any piece of plywood. There's no need to break the bank if you're just going to cover it anyway.
An old or new door. If buying a new door, look for a hollow-core door, as they are cheaper and less heavy.
A piece of metal. Perhaps some corrugated tin roofing could be cut into an elegant pattern?
Some rehabbed shutters. Adds texture and, if the shutters are in the right condition, an homey vintage look.
Some chalkboard. Perfect for those who like to write and doodle, this gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""playing in bed."";
, Who said a headboard needed to be a plank of wood, filled with batting, and covered with fabric? A headboard can be so many things, even if they aren't true headboard. Use your imagination:









Paint out or make a decal for your headboard. This won't actually give you a headboard, but you can do a lot with just a little.
Use a piece of architectural salvage to hang above your bed. A piece of antique wood salvage can brighten up your room just like a headboard.
Cut out fabric in the shape of a headboard. Again, no real board to speak of, but the same great headboard effect.
Turn a mirror or big painting into a headboard. Mirrors are great for enlarging the feel of the room, while paintings show off your artistic sense. Either can make a suitable headboard.

, While some headboards can be larger than the width of the bed, most headboards line up exactly as wide as the bed is. Figure out how wide your bed is and mark those measurements onto the headboard material. Cut the material accordingly.









If you're buying plywood or a door from a retail store, you might be able to have the store cut the wood for you if you already know the dimensions. Large retail stores like Lowe's or Home Depot provide this service for free, as might smaller mom & pop stores.
Remember to be cautious with your cutting. You can always cut more off, but you can never add more on. If you're not sure how big you want your headboard to be in the beginning, cut off a little first, and then more if necessary.

, You ideally want your headboard to be soft and giving, not hard as a rock. In order to get this softness under your headboard, you're going to need a bit of padding. Drape your padding over the headboard and trace an outline around the edges of the headboard. Cut it so that it fits perfectly over the headboard.









Foam can be used but may be expensive. Since foam is petroleum-based, its price fluctuates along with the price of gas.
Use egg crate mattress topper for a cheap alternative to foam. Egg crate mattress topper should cost less than $20. Two egg crate mattress toppers laid in on one another make a smooth surface.
Polyester padding can also be used. For a little bit extra, polyester padding has springiness and give, making a great batting material.

, Since you're going to staple the batting onto the back of the headboard, you want it to be big enough to reach behind the headboard.

Decide how big the blanket box will be.
,
Decide on the material - you can use anything from plywood up to an oak or maple veneer.,
Plywood is inexpensive and relatively easy to work with; MDF is smooth and easy to cut, however, it can be easily dented; laminate, which is fiberboard covered with a layer of plastic impregnated paper and is very strong and durable, comes in many colors.,
If you have access to a table saw, you'll want to mitre cut the edges at a 45 degree angle to make a nice smooth seam.,
Cut the boards to the desired sizes.

,
Put a bead of wood glue on the joints.

,
Tack the boards together with small wood nails.,
Create the frame of the box.,
Fill the frame with boards.,
Allow the glue to set.,
Create the frame for the lid.,
Paint the box, apply primer then coat it with paint.,
Attach the lid to the blanket box with a hinge or hinges (depending on the size of the box).,
If desired, you can add lid closers and a catch to the outside.

,
Your blanket box is now ready to use.

",How to Build a Blanket Box,", If you want for a more environment friendly material you can go for recycled wood.

, You can also get lumber with an oak or maple veneer, which is a thin layer of more expensive wood over a less expensive substrate. It can be stained and finished like solid oak or maple, but is much more economical; solid oak or maple would be very expensive, hard to find, and more difficult to work with.

, If not, you can butt-joint the edges together, but you'll have to do a fair amount of sanding to achieve a smooth finish on the ends.

,,, Place clamps on the boards to hold them in place until the glue dries.

,


Using a nail set, punch the heads of the nails beneath the surface of the wood. Cover the holes with some wood filler and allow to dry. If you cut at a 45 degree angle, sand the edges smooth and apply a bead of latex caulking (if you're painting) or wood filler (if you're staining) along the seam.







,


Move your way up and all the sides of the box.






Make sure you adhere the wood with wood glue first then reinforce it with nails.







,


Sand off the wood filler and wipe down any dust.







,


Fill the frame with wood and set aside.







,


Allow to dry overnight.







, Holding the hinge to the top side of the box, mark all the screw holes with a pencil. Temporarily screw the hinge to the box and having someone else holding the lid up and on top of the hinge, mark the screw holes from the hinge on the lid.


Always ensure that the moving part of the hinge lies on the outside of the box.






Screw the hinge to the lid first, then bring it over and attach the hinge to the blanket box.
Always attach the hinge last, after all painting and finishing is completed.

Choose which logs you will use.,
Saw the logs to the lengths you need for bed.,
Remove the bark and shape the logs with drawknives.,
Form tenons in the rails and spindles.,
Carve out mortises with a drill and Forstner bits.",How to Build a Log Bed1,"

The best choice is a log from a fire-killed standing dead tree. A wildfire burns diseased trees to the ground, but leaves healthy trees dead but still standing. Therefore, your chances of getting good logs are best from these trees. Fire-killed wood also loses its bark, saving you time when you start building.



 


You can find fallen logs or logs that wash onto a beach or riverbank. You can also buy logs from a sawmill. However, you may find after you start working that these are rotten or have other problems that make them unsuitable.






Cut live trees down to get logs if it's legal to do so. You will have to wait about a year for the wood to dry enough to build with it. Stripping the bark will help it dry faster.





;
,

Saw 2 4-foot (1.2 m) posts and 2 3-foot (90 cm) posts to make the legs and the ends of the headboard and footboard. The posts should be cut from large, sturdy logs.






Saw 4 rails to separate the posts. Measure the mattress width and cut the rails to be 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) longer. When you cut the tenons to fit the rails into the posts, they will be the width of the mattress.






Cut spindles to place between the rails of the headboard and footboard. You need 36-inch (90 cm) spindles for the headboard and 24-inch (61 cm) spindles for the footboard. After cutting the tenons, they will measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter. The number of spindles you need depends on the size of the bed.






Prepare 4 bed rails to connect the headpost to the foot post on each side. Measure the mattress length and cut the bed rails so they're 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) longer.







, These are blades with 2 handles that you set against the wood and pull toward you. A curved drawknife removes bark and a straight drawknife shapes the log.

, You can do this with a drawknife, but it's easier to do with a tenon maker, which attaches to a drill and operates like a giant pencil sharpener.

, Frostner bits drill flat-bottomed holes large enough to hold tenons.

Mortises for the headboard should be cut at 9 inches (23 cm) and 44 inches (1.1 m) from the floor. For the footboard, the mortises are cut at 9 inches (23 cm) and 32 inches (80 cm).






Spindle mortises are cut so the spindles will be evenly spaced.






Mortises for the bottom bed rail are drilled at 5 inches (13 cm) above the floor in all 4 posts. The mortises for the top bed rail are drilled at 13 inches (33 cm) from the floor.

Measure the dressers to get an idea of how the mattress will fit on them.,
Replace the original flat brackets with new L-brackets to attach it to the top of the dresser.,
Center the rail on the front edge of the top of the dresser, just above the drawers.,
Add two shelf brackets to each end of each dresser.,
The bed will be very heavy once attached, so position your dressers approximately where you would like the bed to stay.,
You will need about five slats to support your box spring or platform.,
Flip the end boards over and mark a line where the overhang should be (4"" in this case) along the length of the board.,
Attach two corner brackets to each end board to hold the box spring or mattress in place head to foot.

,
With help, slide the finished bed into place.

,
You have a choice here: use a box spring or create a platform.",How to Build a Captain's Bed from Two Dressers," A standard queen mattress is 60"" wide and 80"" long. A full size is 54"" wide and 75"" long. The dressers used in this tutorial are 72"" long and 22"" wide. To make a queen sized bed, add 4"" to the head and foot ends for length and leave a 17"" gap between the dressers for width.


If there is a rail against the back as there is here it can be easily removed with a screwdriver. You can reuse it for the side rails of the bed.;
, Here you can see both the original and new ones.

, Mark and drill pilot holes and attach the rail to the top with screws. Remove the top drawers and check the construction of the dresser to find appropriate places to attach it. Select the length of screws you use carefully so the sharp ends won't protrude into your dresser.


You can see here, the rail is now above the drawers. It will keep the box spring or mattress from shifting side to side.

, Again, look inside the dressers to place your brackets where there is wood to attach them. The top of the bracket should be flush with the top of the dresser. Mark and drill pilot holes and attach the shelf brackets with screws.

, Leave enough room at each end to access the shelf brackets. Measure the width and adjust the dressers until they are approximately 1/4"" wider than your mattress size. Aim for a snug fit. Use a level to make sure they are parallel and even.

, Three in the middle can be 3-4"" wide and as long as your mattress is wide (60"" for a queen, 54"" for a full). The two end ones may need to be longer to add length. In this case, it was necessary to add 4"" on each end, so the boards are 7-8"" wide.

, Turn them over and line it up along the edge of both dressers. Attach the end boards to the shelf brackets with screws.

,,, Use a box spring if you already have the mattress set. It does create a very high bed, you might need a step to climb in and out. If you'd rather create a platform bed, cut two pieces of plywood to fit your bed, so that the joint between them falls directly onto one of your slats. Secure with screws and place the mattress on this platform. Otherwise, simply place the box spring into place and top with the mattress.

Collect dead wood of the appropriate height.,
Look for hickory or ash.,
Remove bark and notches.,
Seal with stain.,
Add survival features to your walking staff.",How to Make a Staff1," For a good walking stick, you want dead wood that's got some heft to it, but is still lightweight enough to carry comfortably. The ideal piece should come up to your chin, though you may want a longer or shorter walking stick depending on your preference. It should be relatively straight, and relatively uniform in thickness, at least an inch or two in diameter.


Green wood is too bendable to be effective as a walking or survival stick, so only collect dead wood to make for possible staffs. If you find a very desirable branch that you'd like to use, but it's too green, cut it and whittle it to debark it, but let it dry outdoors for several weeks before treating it and finishing.;
, Any wood that feels comfortable to you is appropriate, but many people prefer the lightness and strength of hickory and ash, as well as the availability. Keep an eye out for good branches while you're out on hikes, of the appropriate size, and a variety of wood that'll hold up to heavy use. Research good woods in your area that are commonly used for hiking sticks. Other woods that make good walking sticks include:


Vine maple
Ironwood
Salt cedar
Aspen

, Use a sharp pocket knife to whittle off the bark, taking extra care to smooth out any tiny branch notches or uneven places. Round up the ends of the stick by making tiny cuts to achieve a durable and clean finish to the end pieces.


After cleaning up your branch, let it sit for a few days to make sure it's thoroughly dried out. If an orangish skin starts to form on the inner flesh of the wood, that's water escaping. Scrape it off again and let it continue sitting for a while until it remains a whitish color after several days.

, If you want to give your staff a clean and durable finish, stain it with a good wood finish or wiping stain. Typically, you'll do a few coats, wiping on a thin layer evenly, then wiping it off and applying more layers. Do at least 3, and do more coats if you want to achieve a darker finish to your staff. Follow the instruction on the particular brand you purchase.


Alternatively, some choose to woodburn, or do pyrography designs on their walking staff before sealing it. Choose a distinctive design that you like, if you want to give your staff some character, and burn it on.

, Some hikers and survivalists like to wrap a length of par cord Paracord around the staff to use as a grip, and electrical tape a couple of fish-hooks or other implements under it. You might also include carabiners for other attachments, like water bottles, knives, and other survival gear. Consider fashioning a leather grip and binding it to the staff to make the hand-grip more comfortable.


On the lower third or so of your staff, notch a series of inch-measurements to use for tracking or to measure the depth of water as you hike."

Find a stout stick about the same height as you .,
Cut it off using some sort of saw or clippers.

,
Take the stick back to a dry, airy environment and skin it down using a knife of a sander.

,
Leave it to dry for about a day before skinning it again.,
Leave it in a warm, dry place for about a week.,
To finish it off, you could engrave your name or something into the wood this can be done using a knife or an engraving tool .",How to Make a Good Staff Quickly," It should be made from wood that isn't bendy or brittle.;
,,, A planer is good because it makes the wood smooth but a penknife could be used.

, To check if it's dry, hit it gently off another piece of wood. It should make a nice crackling sound.

, You can also stain or paint the staff. If possible, you could laminate it.

If you're making a tufted headboard, drill your holes first.,
Use a spray fixative to attach the padding to the back of the headboard.,
Pull the batting taut over the padding on the front of the headboard and staple it onto the back of the headboard.,
Iron any wrinkles out of your headboard fabric.,
Line up the pattern of the fabric with the headboard and begin stapling the fabric down to the back of the headboard.,
Feed your buttons through the holes for a tufted look.,
Attach the headboard to your wall.",How to Build a Headboard for a Bed2," Tufted headboards add marvelous texture and look, especially if the fabric you're using on the headboard is monochrome.









For now, drill 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) holes into the headboard, all the way through the material. Your buttons, which will give you the tufted look, will eventually fit into these holes.
You can use several different patterns when drilling your holes. Your tufts can be evenly spaced above and below one another, in a grid pattern, or they can be spaced out on a diagonal. Choose whichever pattern suits you the best.

, Make sure that the fixative you use actually works with the padding you've purchased. Fixative is both very sticky and quite toxic, so make sure you only spray it onto the padding and use a mask when spraying. (Opening any windows is a great idea; working in an open garage might be an even better one.)








, A manual or electric staple gun will work just fine here.








, Hit the fabric with a little bit of steam before you drape it over your headboard. Many people forget to do this, giving the fabric less of a professional look. Once you're done, lay your fabric face down on the floor and place your batted headboard on top of it, batting-side down.








, This is a crucial step, so don't be afraid to take your time here in order to get it right. A couple things for you to remember as you staple the fabric to the headboard:









Use clamps or vices to get the pattern of the fabric lined up with the center of the headboard. Staple one or two times, and then check to see if the pattern looks good by turning the headboard over.
Be sure to get the fabric as taut as possible. Staple well and staple often. Since no one will be able to see the staples on the back side of the headboard, you can go a little crazy here. (Well, don't go crazy, but more is definitely better than not enough!)
Take care around corners and rounded parts. Be sure to pull the fabric taut, especially over rounded parts and edges.

, On the back of the headboard, slide a long needle through the various holes for the buttons. On the other side of the headboard, locate the needle. Attach the buttons to sturdy, thick string, and attach the string to another needle. Using the first needle as a guide, feed the strung needle back into the hole in the headboard. Pull button taut to create tufts; staple the string to the back of the headboard several times, until it is secure.








, You're almost done now. There are several ways that you can attach a headboard to the wall. Here are a few of your options:









Slide the headboard between the bed and the wall and let the two prop the headboard up. So no construction required; simple and safe if your headboard extends all the way down to the floor.
Use a headboard hanger. These come in two long, flat pieces of metal, each with a protruding groove. Attach one piece to the wall, another piece to the back of the headboard. The two protruding grooves fit perfectly in one another, keeping the headboard safely propped up.
Use flush mount hangers. Less sturdy than headboard hangers, but much less expensive, these flush mount hangers have teeth that fit into their bases on the wall. Instead of a long, flat bar, these are small pieces of metal.

"
"
Attach a metal eye hook to each post at 12 inches (30 cm) above the floor.,
Connect cables diagonally between the bedposts using the eye hooks.,
Notch each of the top bed rails near the head and foot so the box spring will fit securely on them without slipping.

,
Stain the bed to protect the wood.

,
Top the bed with the box spring and mattress.

",How to Build a Log Bed2," Place the eye hooks so you can stretch a cable between the right headpost and left footpost and the left headpost and right footpost.

, Use turnbuckles in the centers to tighten the cables and hold the bed together. Adjust as necessary to make sure the bed is square.

Collect wood after a storm.,
Select a stick with significance.,
Smooth and clean the staff.,
Charge or bless the staff.,
Consider pyrographing important symbols into the wood.,
Adorn the top of the staff with a charged stone or crystal of significance to you.",How to Make a Staff2," Many wiccans and other neo-pagans believe that wood felled by a storm is imbued with supernatural powers. Whether or not that's true, it's also just a good way of collecting wood. Head out to the woods after a particularly windy storm to look for pieces of wood that speak to you.

, In magic, staffs are traditionally symbolic of male energy and are often linked to the wind and sun. Often, they're made of hickory or oak, significant for their strength and durability, but a magic staff can be made from any kind of wood that feels right in your hands. It's something you're going to be using for your own practice, so it's important to get something that feels right, and seems significant to you, for whatever reason.


When you find a prospective staff, sit with it. Hold it in your hands. Try to get a feel for its energy. When you hold the right one, you'll know it. Ideally, your staff will be 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m) in length.

, Use a knife and sandpaper to remove the bark and smooth the surface of the wood. Use long even cuts with a very sharp knife to keep the staff as clean and smooth-looking as possible. Be very careful while using the knife. Let your staff dry thoroughly and remove any orangish bark that builds up as it rests.

, Depending on your practice, you may have a particular ceremony appropriate for the purpose or charging an object or blessing it in preparation for magic. Light candles, cleanse the area, cast a circle, do whatever needs to be done to prepare for the ritual.


When meditating, consider the natural elements, the earth, sunlight, and water that went into the creation of the tree that yielded this staff that you'll use. Thank the tree and meditate on its gift., Pyrography is done by heating a metal object, usually a needle for even a soldering iron, and burning patterns into the raw wood. On a magic staff, this can be particularly useful as a way of imbuing it with symbolic powers.


Generally, you'll want to avoid artificial sealants and finishes on your magic staff. Some practitioners believe this can limit the power of your staff by restricting the natural properties of the wood. To be on the safe side, leave it unsealed.

, It may be advantageous to adorn the top of your staff with a similarly-charged or related crystal or other gem to make your staff more powerful. If you wish to do so, carve a small diver into the top of your staff and smooth it to the shape of the gem you hope to place atop it.


Don't glue or otherwise permanently bind it to the staff. Instead, lash it with leather thongs or bindings, to remove it for particular uses if necessary.

Decide where you will use your trebuchet.,
Consider what you want to launch with your trebuchet.,
Cut and sand the frame pieces and swing arm.,
Cut and sand the support braces.,
Obtain an axle.,
Attach the uprights to the long base pieces.,
Attach the braces to the assembled base pieces and uprights.,
Drill holes near the top of the uprights.,

Mount the swing arm.,
Paint and decorate the trebuchet.,
Make the sling.,
Mount the sling on the launching hook.,
Load the projectile into the sling.,
Prepare the counterweight.,
Attach the counterweight to the trebuchet.

,
Release the counterweight.",How to Build a Trebuchet," This will determine what size of trebuchet you’ll want to make and what materials make it out of.

If you plan to use your trebuchet indoors, you’ll want to make a small trebuchet. You can make a wooden trebuchet with a base about 12 inches (30 cm) and a swing arm of about 16 inches (40 cm) or a smaller and lighter model out of popsicle sticks.



 


If you plan to use your trebuchet outdoors, you’ll want to make a larger trebuchet. A backyard trebuchet could be made of wood or PVC pipe with a 24-inch (60 cm) base and a 32-inch (80 cm) swing arm. A trebuchet to demonstrate at a Renaissance faire could be several times larger than this, if you have sufficient space to launch its projectiles, but you’d have to design it to be taken apart for transport and reassembled on site unless you have a pickup or trailer to haul it around in.






The instructions in the section “Building Your Trebuchet” are written for building a trebuchet using pieces of wood. You can adapt them to whatever building material you choose to use.





;
, This will have an impact on what material you make your trebuchet from, how large and durable your sling must be, and how heavy a counterweight you should obtain.

An indoor trebuchet could launch grapes, paper wads, or Nerf balls, while an outdoor trebuchet could launch water balloons, tennis balls (perfect for Renfaire mixed doubles), golf balls (for Renfaire golf), clay balls, ball bearings, croquet balls, billiard balls, or even actual rocks. (Medieval trebuchets launched not only rocks, but also chunks of burning pitch and dead horse carcasses, a Middle Ages form of chemical warfare.)






Whatever you decide you want to launch with your trebuchet, your counterweight should be from 100 to 133 times the weight of your projectile.If you want to launch items of various weights, you can set up your trebuchet with a bucket or bag to hold and adjust the counterweight. (If you use a bucket, its weight forms part of the overall counterweight.)







, For an indoor trebuchet, you can use 1 x 6-inch (2.5 x 15 cm) planking. For an outdoor trebuchet, you can use 2 x 4-inch (5 x 10 cm) planking. You’ll need to cut 8 pieces:

Two long base pieces. For a small trebuchet, you may want to make them 1 foot (30 cm) long; for a larger trebuchet, they can be longer.






Two uprights. These should be about 5/6 the length of the base pieces or as long as the base pieces, but no longer. If you made the long base pieces 1 foot (30 cm) long, they would be 10 to 12 inches (24 to 30 cm) long.






Three cross pieces. These can be 1/2 the length of either the uprights or of the long base pieces. You want the trebuchet to be fairly narrow to ensure that it throws its projectiles in a straight line.






One swing arm, or beam.This piece should be 1 1/3 times the length of the base pieces; if the base pieces are 1 foot (30 cm) long, the swing arm should be 16 inches (40 cm) long., The simplest way to make these is from a piece of plywood at least 1/4 inch (6.25 mm) thick. It should be 1/2 the length of either the uprights or the long base pieces. Draw a line from one corner of the square to the other and cut along this line, making a pair of right triangles.If you prefer, you can design the support braces to look like isosceles triangles so that they will slope on both sides of the uprights when assembled.

, You’ll need either a metal bar or wooden dowel the same length as one of the cross pieces or slightly longer. The bar should be strong enough to stand up to the weight of the swing arm, the weights you plan to launch, and your counterweight.


A piece of rebar would make the strongest axle, but you can also use a screwdriver blade or the axle from a wheeled garbage can. For a small enough trebuchet, you can use the axle from a toy car. When you decide what to use as your axle, measure its diameter.

, Measure 1/4 of the distance from one end of one of the long base pieces, and mark it. Place an end of one of the uprights against this mark and glue it in place, then reinforce the connection with nails or screws. Repeat for the second base piece and upright, using the first as a guide., Lay one of the assembled pieces down and lay a brace over it, flush with the bottom of the base piece and back edge of the upright and sloping toward the long end of the base piece. Glue the brace in place and reinforce it with nails or screws.

Repeat this process for the other assembled piece and brace, but this time point the long end of the base and the brace’s hypotenuse in the other direction.






For a large trebuchet, you may instead want to cut lengths of planking to serve as braces instead of using plywood sheeting, and either cut the edges at an angle or use two pieces on each side to make a rectangular brace., When you assemble the base, you’ll thread an axle through these holes for the swing arm to turn on.


Mark the drill holes about 1/10 of the way down from the top. You’ll want to use a drill bit that’s the same diameter or only slightly larger than the diameter of the axle.

, You’ll want to have the primary hole 1/4 of the way from one end to the other, with secondary holes on either side of it. (This will allow you to adjust the fulcrum point of the swing arm.)

When drilling holes through the swing arm, use the bit the next diameter larger than that of the axle or possibly even 2 sizes larger. The swing arm should turn freely on the axle without wobbling.






Space the secondary holes out far enough that they won’t break out and form a larger hole would allow the swing arm to slip if threaded through it.

, These eye hooks are what you will attach the sling and counterweight to, respectively.

The eye hook for the sling will go on the end furthest from where you drilled the holes. It should be open to serve as a release pin,allowing one end of the sling to open and allow the swing arm to hurl the projectile forward. To keep the sling from opening too soon, drive a nail into the end, partially covering the release pin. #*Cut the head off the nail to keep the sling from catching.The eye hook for the counterweight should be closed, unless you plan to change the counterweight often. Even then, you may want to attach a carabiner or split ring to the counterweight eye hook.







, Connect the 3 cross pieces to the long base pieces using glue, nails, screws, or bolts, depending on the size of your trebuchet. One of the cross pieces should be at each end of the frame, with the third just ahead of the uprights.


For a tabletop trebuchet, you may want to attach a piece of posterboard or cardboard to the bottom of the frame to protect the surface the trebuchet rests on when firing it. , Place the arm between the uprights with the long end of the arm toward the short end of the frame and the nail over the hook pointing up. Thread the axle through the hole in one of the uprights, then through one of the holes in the swing arm, and finally through the hole in the other upright. The throwing side of the swing arm should rest on the short side of the trebuchet frame because the force generated when it moves will thrust the frame downward. If this thrust falls on the short side of the frame, it could pitch the trebuchet forward.






The nail should be pointing up to ensure that the sling will open without coming off the swing arm entirely.






If the axle extends past the frame, you may wish to affix cotter pins or caps to its ends to keep it from slipping out when you launch projectiles.







, If your trebuchet is made of wood, paint will help preserve it, particularly if you plan to keep it outdoors when not in use. You can decorate the support braces with a historic flag, your family crest, or the logo of your SCA or Amtgard chapter.

, Take a piece of heavy cloth (or burlap, for a very large trebuchet) and fold it in half. Gather the corners on the two sides together and tie them with string, cord, or rope, forming a pouch. Tie loops in the loose ends of the string so you can slip them over the hook on the launching side of the swing arm.


If you like, you can tie the string holding the sling to the trebuchet directly to the hook and tie the other end to a loop of thin wire to make it easier to slide off the hook when launching the projectile. You can also tie both string ends to wire loops to make it easier to put the sling on and remove it from the hook.

, Slip the end of one of the sling strings over the hook, unless you chose to tie it to the hook.

, Once you do, slip the other cord of the sling over the launching hook.

, You can use a single heavy item as the counterweight or a number of smaller items, contained in a bag or bucket.

,, The weight will pull the short end of the arm down and the long end up. The sudden acceleration will swing the projectile backward in the sling, causing one end of the sling to slip off the hook and propel the projectile forward.


If your trebuchet releases the projectile too soon, the projectile could fly upward or even backward. If it releases too late, the projectile will slam into the ground in front of the trebuchet. You can control the point at which the sling opens and the projectile releases by bending the release pin nail: bend it more if the projectile flies too high and bend it less if the projectile flies too low.If you have trouble with the trebuchet releasing the projectile at the right time, you can adjust the weight of the counterweight or remount the swing arm through a different hole.

, Red and black work best to give your wizard's staff a cool and metallic finish. It'll look like something other than what it is, which is the idea. For a cool effect, do a base wrap with black tape and then wrap red electrical tape winding down the staff, like a devious serpent or dripping blood.

, No staff would be complete without a gazing ball atop it. For a cool effect, look for small bouncy balls in the toys section at the store, or check out other kinds of lightweight balls that would look appropriate. Some are streaked with psychedelic colors that would be perfect for a staff.


If you want to change the color, get some spray paint and paint it carefully outside, making sure you're in a well-ventilated area and have adult supervision.
At the top of your staff, you might also want to hang scarves or other decorations to complete the kind of staff you want. Get creative and go crazy.

, To make sure you've got a good grip on your staff while you're on the battlefield, it's a good idea to fashion something to hold onto. If you've got an old football lying around, cut the seams apart and use one of the individual diamond-shaped sections to fashion a leather-like wrap-around grip that you can hold onto. Sew it together with twine for a perfect rustic-finish.


Alternatively, you could get another color of electrical tape and wrap around the area several times to get a hand-shaped place to hold.

",How to Make a Croquet Mallet," Find a solid and straight branch and cut a section out to the desired length with your chop saw. If using a handsaw see if you can use a guide to keep the cut flat and true. This will become your mallet head so make sure there are not too many knots in the wood or that it is excessively curved/bent. If you are using 4x4 knots and bends are not as large an issue. Our mallet head was approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) in length and ranged from 2.5–3 inches (6.3–7.6 cm) in diameter.;
, Place your mallet head in a vice, making sure it is level and that the bottom does not have any knots to catch the ground when you are swinging. Also make sure the top does not have a knot, as this will make drilling excessively hard! Take a drill bit matching the diameter of your broomstick (ours was ¾ inch). Using tape or a marker on the drill bit identify how deep you should drill into the mallet head so that the bit does not go all the way through. We drilled about ¾ down into the mallet head, which was about 2 inches (5 cm) deep on average. We put tape on the 2 inch (5.1 cm) mark on the drill bit so that we knew how far down the bit had gone.

,, Make sure your drilled hole is clean of shavings, and then line the edges of the hole with Adhesive. Take a straw or stick and spread it around inside.


You want to apply enough glue so that it oozes out the edges when you slide the broomstick in.







, Before the glue dries slide the broomstick into the glued hole. This may require some force to get it all the way in. You can also take a hammer and tap the top of the stick until it becomes apparent the stick has bottomed out.


Having someone help by twisting the stick will certainly make things easier. If there is play or no friction when inserting the shaft then you may have used a drill bit a size too large.







, Take a drill bit that is smaller than the threads of your screw but just as wide as the “body.” Pre-drilling a hole for the screw will prevent cracking in the shaft, but if you predrill too large a hole your screw will be rendered useless. Just like you did with the larger drill bit, mark how long your screw is with tape or a marker on the drill bit. This will prevent you from drilling through the other side of the mallet. Once again, it is useful to have someone help identify if your drill is straight up and down and not tilted while drilling. Drill the hole slightly above center in your mallet head.

, Take some glue and apply a generous amount to the end of your screw. Slowly screw the screw most of the way in your pre-drilled hole, but then back it out and let glue at the top of the hole cling to the threads of the screw. Screw it back in all the way either counter sinking the screw head (very slowly) or until the screw head is flush with the surface of the mallet. Use your finger to wipe away excess glue.,,"

Ash is a strong lightweight wood that provides both strength and flexibility.
Maple is a more dense, heavier wood that is great for power hitters.
Birch provides heavier weight like maple while still allowing for some flexibility like ash.

, You can also make your own blank by cutting a piece of wood to be 37 inches long by 3 inches by 3 inches. Find a lumber yard to get custom cuts of wood, or visit a home improvement store to see what they carry. You can also order blanks online ready to be turned into a bat.


If starting with a square piece of wood, use a chisel to remove the corners of your blank. Cut a small amount from the four long edges of the blank to create an octagonal shape. Removing the corners will cut down on the amount of wood you need to remove with the lathe and make it easier to craft your bat., Make a pencil mark every few inches to help you gauge the amount of wood you need to remove in sections.

, A typical baseball bat has a diameter between 2 ½” and 2 ⅝”. A smaller diameter bat will be lighter and easier to swing.


The handle of the bat should have a diameter of 1” and be about 10 inches long.

, Record the diameter of every 4” section of the bat. The markings will serve as a guide when turning the wood. These measurements represent 4 inch increments from the knob to the tip of the barrel.The knob should measure 2” diameter.
4” diameter is 1”
8” diameter is 1”
12” diameter is 1 ⅛”
16” diameter is 1 ¼”
20” diameter is 1 ¾”
24” diameter is 2 3/16”
28” diameter is 2 7/16”
32” diameter is 2 ½”

Check the bat for bumps.,
Sand the bat.",How to Make a Baseball Bat2," Secure the blank in place using a spur center or other similar mount., The tool rest is an adjustable platform that sits in front of your spinning wood to support your tools as you cut. Position the tool rest so that it is a few inches away from the widest point of your blank. The height should be set so that you are able to place your tool perpendicular to the spinning axis of your lathe.

, Once the wood begins to spin, you can begin the cutting process. Be sure to use caution when working with tools and a lathe.


Always keep your eyes on the wood you are cutting.
Do not use force with your tools, let the spinning action of the wood do the work.
Wear eye protection.

, The roughing gauge is a broad chisel that can remove large amounts of wood to create a round, symmetrical surface. Remove the edges of the wood slowly to turn the square piece of wood into a true cylinder. Make sure the wood becomes completely symmetrical.


Place the gouge against the tool rest and move it slowly into the spinning wood.
Hold the gouge with both hands and keep your eyes on your project at all times.
Slowly slide the gouge up and down the length of the wood to smooth the surface into a cylinder.
Remark the wood every four inches and note the diameter of each section on the wood.

, Use a parting tool to cut a groove in the wood. Remove a few millimeters at time to make sure you don’t take off too much and pass the depth for each section. Cut each groove to the desired measurement for each 4 inch section.Start at the barrel end of the bat.
Make diameter cuts for the first 12 inches of the barrel.
Stop frequently and use calipers to check the diameter of your groove.

, Remove the wood down to the diameter cut along each section of the bat. Slide the gouge along the uppermost section of the bat and remove the wood around the diameter cut. Watch the wood as you are removing it to ensure that you do not go deeper than the diameter cut.


Work from the widest point to the narrowest point.
Connect each section by removing wood down to the diameter cut along each section.

, Use the roughing gouge to narrow the wood on the handle end of the bat to 2 inches. Lay the gouge against the tool rest and slide the chisel along the handle of the bat.


Slowly slide the chisel up and down the handle to make it narrower.
Remove wood along the handle until the diameter of the entire handle section reaches 2 inches.
Stop the lathe periodically to use calipers and check your diameter.

, Mark the handle end of the bat again to create a guide for where to make diameter cuts.

, The skew chisel comes to a sharp narrow point and will allow you to cut a small groove to the desired diameter. Just like you did when crafting the barrel, cut a groove in the wood every four inches along the handle of the bat. Check the diameter of your grooves using calipers.


Cut the grooves to the desired diameter using the measurements listed above.

, Start on the barrel end of the bat and move toward the handle. Remove wood along each section to create a smooth surface from one end of the bat to the other.

, Mark the spot of your desired bat length. 32 inches is a standard length for a bat. The spot that you mark will be where the knob of the bat begins.Use a measuring tape to measure the bat from the wide end of the barrel of the bat.
Mark the length of the bat to show where the handle ends and the knob begins.

, To create the knob you will need to use a combination of tools and round either end of the knob. The knob is the bottom of the bat that helps ensure a proper grip when swinging.


Use the skew chisel to round off the top of the knob. Remove the wood from the top of the knob where it connects to the handle. The knob will be 2 inches at its widest point and go directly to the 1 inch diameter handle.
Use the parting tool to remove enough wood to insert the skew chisel to round off the end of the knob. In order to round off the knob remove wood from the bottom of the bat so you can fit the skew chisel around the bottom.
Create a rounded knob using the skew chisel to smooth the edges to a U shape.
Use the gouge to blend the handle into the rounded knob.

, Turn of the lathe and run your hands along the length of the bat. Feel for any irregularities or bumps on the surface of the bat.


Smooth off any bumps using the gouge.
Grasp the handle while the bat is still in the lathe to ensure that it is the right thickness.
Adjust the thickness of the handle if necessary.

, Ensure that the entire surface of the bat is smooth by using increasing grits of sandpaper.


While the bat is still mounted on the lathe, use a 60-80 grit sandpaper to rough sand the entire length of the bat.
Use increasing grits of sandpaper, 120, 180, 220, 400 to make the entire length of the bat as smooth as possible.

Apply varnish to the bat.,
Apply wax to the surface of the bat.,
Use a parting tool to make the tenons on either end of the bat smaller.,
Remove the bat from the lathe.,
Finish the ends of the bat.",How to Make a Baseball Bat3," Use a cloth dipped in the wood stain of your choice to apply a stain to the bat. Rub the stain on the bat while the lathe is running to ensure even application.


Apply two coats of stain to the bat.
Allow the bat to dry between coats.
You can also apply a lacquer finish to help preserve the stain and surface of the bat.

, Use a wax such as Min-Wax paste to finish the surface of the bat. Buff the wax on the bat while the lathe is running.

, The bit of wood that connects the bat to the remaining wood on the lathe is called a tenon. Make it as small as possible without breaking.


Place the parting tool perpendicular to the spinning bat.
Insert the tip of the parting tool into the spinning bat at the bottom of the knob and top of the barrel.
Reduce the diameter of the tenon to 1/4 of an inch in diameter.

, Once the bat is removed from the lathe you can use a hacksaw to remove the tenons from either end of the bat.

, Apply the finishing touches to the ends of the bat after removing the tenons.


Sand each end of the bat with increasing grits of sandpaper.
Apply varnish and wax to the ends of the bat

, Lay out the attached panels and mark a vertical line every 12"" along the entire 8' length of the plywood. From these 12"" vertical lines, measurements are made by marking points on these lines.


A long stick or batten is used to draw a line between these points giving the outlines of the canoe's panels. Make sure the lines drawn for the panels are all fair, smooth curves.
Only three panels are needed per side. The four half sheets of 8' plywood are used to make 12 boat panels, then these 12 panels are put together in matching pairs with butt blocks or scarf joints to make up the total 6 panels or 3 per side.
Finger joints, using a dovetail template and a router will also make good joints to join the panels. You have to allow for the 1"" overlap of each panel when making the finger joint, as this gives the boat an attractive finished look.
This system makes a simple but very nice boat and has a recognizable canoe look and shape with a gentle ""v"" bottom, rather than a flat bottom.

, Once the panels have been drawn out and checked for nice curving lines, it's time to cut them out using a saber saw.


Once you have cut the panels out, use a woodworkers rasp (file) to smooth up the edges as close to the lines on the panel as possible. A small block plane could be used instead.
Now you can put the panel pieces together as stated above with finger joints, scarves or butt blocks. More specific instructions on how to do each of these joints is easily available online.

, Now that the panels are done, it's time to drill some holes along the bottom edges, about 3/8"" from the top and bottom edges of each panel.


This job is easier and faster if you lay the two matching panels (the corresponding panels on either side) together and drill the holes.
This boat has only three panels per side, with each of the three being the same on either side of the canoe.

, Get some bailing, copper or any soft, easy-to-bend wire from the hardware store. Cut short pieces of wire about 3"" long, you will need quite a few of these, about half a pie pan full. However, you can always cut more if you need them.


Lay the two bottom panels on top of each other and wire the center/bottom edges together, but don't pull the wire too tight. Leave the wire loose, so you can open the bottom two panels up like a book. This will be the bottom of your canoe.
Now, starting in the center, wire (stitch) on the next panel, putting a few stitches on each side of the center line. Keep working from side to side doing a few on each side until you get to the ends.
When you get to the upper panels, line up the ends and stitch them together. Try to keep them as even as possible, with a nice canoe end curve. You should begin to see the canoe coming together at this point.

, With the panels stitched together, put a stick about 1"" square and 29"" long at the top center inside of the canoe. This will hold it to the right width and shape. Now, stand back and look it over.


Is it fair, with nice flowing lines and no twist? If not tighten or loosen the wire stitches as necessary, or even add a stitch if needed. Make sure it looks pleasing to the eye.
Check to see if there is any twist in the canoe, using winding sticks. Make sure the panel edges are all sitting on top of each other nice and tight and not overlapping at any point.
You can also do a trick called cutting a transition joint, which is a 1/4 or 3/8"" notch cut 24-36"" (depending on the width of the panel and length of the canoe) into the bottom front edge of the top panels. This gives you a nice smooth side. More detailed instructions on how to do a transition joint can be found in many books covering stitch and glue boat building or on the internet.
Finally, be sure that the panels are not pushed out from each other at any one point, you want nice, smooth-stitched seams.

, Mix up just enough epoxy to cover the joints between the panels. This is done by using a mixing cup (8oz.) and a stick. Then use a foam paint brush to apply the epoxy to the joints.


Try to cover each edge about an inch on either side of the joint, making sure that it soaks into the joint to get a good bond. Make it look like you're painting a strip down the joint. Remember that the joints of the panels and stems only get epoxied on the inside for now.
Repeat this process for each of the joints. Try not to let the epoxy run down the sides of the panels -- you only want it on the joint, no runs. If you have any runs, use another brush to wipe them up. This just makes life easier when it comes to sanding the inside of the boat. Remember to check the outside of the seams for runs as well.
Put two coats of epoxy on the joints and stems (stems are the ends of the boat), letting the epoxy dry before re-coating. Be sure the stems are pulled tightly together (using the stitches) before applying the epoxy. Don't use clamps to pull the stems ends together, stitches only!
Each coat of epoxy needs about 24 hours to dry, so try to have a little patience while dreaming of that smooth glassy lake!

, When the epoxy is dry, check to ensure that the joints are fully epoxied with no dry spots (areas without epoxy). If they are, you can start cutting and pulling out the wire stitches.


Do this with care, as the panels' joints are still fragile at this point. Try not to break the epoxy join, and don't leave any wire in the boat.
If you pull out a wire and the joint opens, put a stitch back in and epoxy that joint area again.

, Once all of the wire is out, mix up some epoxy and wood flour (very fine sawdust). You can find wood flour at any boat building supplier. This mixture is known as a fillet.


Mix the wood flour and epoxy to a smooth creamy mixture -- it shouldn't be runny. Apply this fillet to the joints that you put the epoxy on.
Make a nice smooth bead about 1-1/2-2"" wide over the center of each joint, then apply a smooth bead of fillet to the inside of the stem ends.
Make the stem end fillets about 3/4"" thick on the inside -- although this adds weight, it has the benefit of making the stem nice and strong.
However, you should be careful not to add too much epoxy, as it can become brittle.

, Now it's time to add a 3"" wide fiberglass tape (which is cloth-like, rather than sticky) to the freshly fillet-coated joints and stems.


Apply another coat of epoxy, smoothing it over the fiberglass until it turns clear. To make the joint as smooth as possible, add just enough epoxy to turn the fiberglass clear, then use a squeegee to remove any excess. Remember that applying too much epoxy is as bad as applying too little.
Be gentle while doing this, as you don't want to push the fresh fillet mix out of the joint when you push down on the fiberglass with the squeegee.
When you get to the stems, add a 3"" wide strip of fiberglass to the inside of the stems (over the fillet). Allow the stem end fiberglass to come down over the center strip of fiberglass tape, as this will make one complete, strong joint.
You will need to add a second coat of epoxy to these tapes after the first coat cures, again waiting 24 hours between each coat.

, Once the second coat of epoxy has dried, it's time to turn the boat over. Enlist the help of another person to turn the boat over -- remember to be very gentle, as the boat is still fragile at this point.


Now use a fine rasp (woodworkers file) to smooth over the edges of the bottom and lower panel joints, being careful not to splinter the thin plywood. Then use sandpaper (80 grit) to smooth up the joint edge, being careful not to sand too deep into the plywood.
Sand the entire outside of the boat, using a 120 grit sandpaper. Make sure to clean up any drips and runs from the epoxy that ran through the joints. Remember to sand with care - don't sand into the thin layers of the 1/8' plywood as this takes away from the canoe's outer skin and leaves hollow flat spots.
When the sanding is done wipe off the excess dust using a cheesecloth, then use compressed air and a clean cloth to remove the more stubborn dust. Sweep the floor, and wait until the dust has settled before proceeding.

, Once the dust has settled, you can apply a thin, even coat of epoxy to the smooth, bare wood on the outside of the canoe using a good foam brush. Again, 24 hours to wait for the epoxy to dry.


Lightly sand the epoxy-coated outside of the boat with 120 grit paper. This is only necessary to provide a tooth for the next coat of epoxy and fiberglass to hold to.
Now it's time to add fiberglass cloth to the outside of the boat. The fiberglass can weigh anywhere between 4 oz and 8oz, depending on the intended use of the canoe. The larger the fiberglass the heavier the canoe will be as the heavier fiberglass requires more epoxy.
Use the same technique of applying the fiberglass to the outside of the boat, then applying a layer of epoxy on top. If you have never done this before, it's a good idea to read as much as you can about it first. Being informed will help you do a really nice job on the boat.

, You will need to trim the epoxy and fiberglass cloth approximately two hours after applying, just before the epoxy starts to harden.


If you wait until the epoxy hardens, it will be very hard to trim the excess fiberglass cloth from the edges of the canoe.
To trim the fiberglass cloth, use a razor knife and trim off the cloth along the gunnel's edges. Be gentle while trimming -- try not to pull on the cloth as it is still wet and it will move and cause you problems.

, After the first coat of epoxy has been applied to the fiberglass cloth and is dry, add another coat to fill the weave of the cloth, giving you a nice smooth surface.


Be aware that it might take more than two coats to fill the weave of the cloth depending on the type and weight of the cloth.
With the fiberglass on and trimmed, give the outside a light sanding with 220 grit sandpaper, then clean off all dust. You can now clear coat or paint the boat.

, Carefully turn the boat right side up and place it in a cradle or in slings. This is a good time to build a set of saw horses to set and cradle the canoe in so it won't move while you work on the inside.

, Gunnels are the top rails of the canoe, which are placed on the inside and outside edges on both sides of the canoe.


Gunnels give a completed look to the canoe, while also serving to protect the sides of the canoe as rub rails.
Each gunnel should be about 1-1-1/4""x3/8-1/2"" square, with the top outside and inside edges rounded over. Use epoxy and brass or bronze screws to attach the gunnels at the front 24-30"" of the gunnels. You can use the epoxy and spring clamps to attach the gunnels to the canoe until the epoxy dries.
At the stem ends on top of the canoe you can fit small decks, on top of the rails or between them, if you take the time and effort to make a good fit. Flush decks look the best.

, Keep in mind that you will have to do one or the other, as epoxy alone will not last when exposed to the sun. When you've finished painting or varnishing the outside, it's time to turn the canoe over and do the inside, clear coat or paint.

, Sand the inside of the boat, removing any drips or runs. Try to not sand through the top plywood layer.


When all the sanding is done, it's time to coat the inside of the boat with. For best results, do this in two or three thin layers of epoxy, waiting 24 hours between coats.
When this is all done you can sand the last coat lightly with a 120 grit sandpaper and then a 220 grit to get a really smooth finish.
Wipe away any dust, then paint or varnish the inside.

, You can add seats before or after you epoxy coat the inside of the boat.


All seats should be about 1-1-1/2"" from the bottom of the canoe, not hanging from the gunnels.
On a light canoe (such as this one) with a low freeboard, it's best to keep the center of gravity as low in the boat as possible.

, Let the whole thing set for about a week -- this gives the layers of epoxy and finish time to dry completely.

Lay the pipe on the floor and place the board on top of it.,
Finished.

",How to Build a Balance Board," This will depend mostly on how tall you are. The board should be long enough so that you can have a wide, shoulder-width stance while riding it. It should also be wide enough so that your feet won't hang off the sides. Around 33"" by 14"" is good.;
, Also purchase some large diameter, (5"" to 7 is good), thick walled PVC or ABS pipe. It should be long enough to fit the width of your board, and strong enough that it does not flex easily, since you will be putting your weight on it.

,,, Use these for safety if you think you will hurt yourself, otherwise you don't need them. These will help the board not slip off the end of the pipe while riding.

, Put on a safety helmet, wrist guards, elbow and knee pads. Again, you only need these if you think you might get hurt. Step on the board carefully, (using a chair or someone's shoulder for support, at least the first few times), and test your balance!

,
Stand the chair up on your work surface, and tilt it so that it is at the correct height and amount of reclining angle you want, then scribe either the front, rear, or both legs to cut them to length.,
Cut strips of wood 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) wide, and 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick, about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long.,
Attach three of the slats, one at the point where the back intersects the seat, one at the front of the seat, and one at the top of the back, as shown in the photo.,
Square up your chair frame.,
Finish attaching the slats for the seat and back of your chair.,
Rip 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) thick strips of 1 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) wide lumber to attach to the back frame as a cross bracing to make the chair stable.,
Cut the armrests, again, as shown in the photo.,
Attach your armrests to the top of the front leg posts, and to the back frame.,
Finish the chair if you like, but for all practical purposes, you are ready to go fishing.

",How to Build a Fishing Chair," Keep it simple! A circular saw, drill with a screw-driving attachment, and an extension cord are all the power equipment used for the chair in these photos. Along with the tools, some 2 inch (5.1 cm) wood screws, scrap cedar 1X2s from a construction dumpster, a treated 2X4 8 foot long, and a tape and square were all that were used for this project.;
, For reference, the actual angles and cut lengths for this chair are listed under Things You'll Need. Note that these can be modified to fit the individual's preferences.

, The photo will illustrate this step better than it can be described, but basically, you have the seat support intersecting with the back frame at about a 53 degree angle. Next, a rear leg support intersects with the seat, about 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) from the back frame.

,, This will give you the angle of each cut, and because the seat and back angle are subject to personal preference, we won't go into great detail here.

, You may want to tack them with a wood screw to get an idea if the finished chair will sit at the right height and angle for you.

, Countersink them if you prefer, but keep in mind, these steps describe building a fishing chair, not a showroom piece of furniture.

,, If you make a mistake here, you can always unscrew the mis-cut piece and replace it, but cut long, it is easier to lower the chair seating height than to raise it.

, These are your seat slats, and you can cut longer slats for wider seats, or reduce the length for narrow fisher persons.

, Use one screw in each end so you can rack the assembly if it is out of square.

, If you prefer, you can eye-ball the assembly, but using a steel square will insure the finished chair doesn't wobble when it is set on a flat surface.

, Depending on how deep the seat is, and how high the back is, you will need a total of about 20 slats. These can be spaced half an inch or so apart so water will drain through them if left in the rain.

, Attach these strips as shown in the photo, after making sure the frame is square.

, Here, since there was no thinner lumber laying around, a 2X4 was split width-wise to yield two 1X4s, about 19 inches (48.3 cm) long.

, This attachment should be very secure, since it reinforces the back frame and stabilizes the chair assembly.

",How to Reupholster a Dining Chair Seat,";
, This is optional. Removing the existing fabric can be time-consuming, using a screwdriver and pliers to pull up each staple. Unless there is an odor or padding has escaped the cushion, it is not recommended that you remove the base layer of fabric on your seat. Recovering a bare seat pad is trickier and may require additional steps. If the batting or foam cushion is decaying, for example, you may need to replace it.

, If the seat is rounded or curved, measure the longest length and the widest width. Add three times the depth to the length and the width, and that is the size of fabric you will need for a single seat. For example, if the seat is 10"" x 12"" x 2"" (25cm x 30.5cm x 5cm) then you will need a piece of fabric that is 16"" x 18"" (40.5cm x 46cm).

, Look for upholstery fabric that will hold up to daily use. You can also use fabric from an old jacket, skirt, or tablecloth, as long as it's durable. If you use the chairs only occasionally, or if you like to recover to meet different needs year to year, a lighter, stretchy fabric can make your job easier.

, Place the seat on it, with the side you sit on against the wrong side of the fabric. Align the seat with the pattern on the fabric if necessary, especially if there are stripes.

, Usually, between two to three times the thickness of the seat will do. Save any leftover fabric for other projects (see Tips below).

, Make sure the fabric is smooth and tight, without bunches between your staples. See the Tips below for an alternative stapling technique.

, Pull firmly against the first row of staples to be sure you've gotten rid of any wrinkles or bunches. Again, start stapling at the center and spread outwards. When you encounter curves, fold the fabric, making sure all the bunching occurs under the seat and is not visible from the top. Secure the folds with staples. If you make a mistake, pull out the staples and start over.

,,


Point the corner towards the center of the seat (along the diagonal).
Fold one side down so that the folded edge runs along the diagonal.
Fold the other side down in the same manner so that you now have a pleat along the diagonal. Staple.

, Hammer down any staples that aren't flush.

, Set up some milk crates or other support structure outside and spray the seats according to package directions. Let them dry overnight in a protected but well-ventilated area. If you can put them in a porch or garage this will protect you from the vapors while also protecting your shiny new seats from dangerously well-fed birds.

Use a combination of all three tools to slowly remove the wood inside the rectangle until you have a rectangle shaped hole.
Use sandpaper to smooth the area around the hole after you have finished.
















, The groove will create a place for the string to rest horizontally across the rectangle hole.

Use a chisel or wood rasp to create a 1/8 inch groove near the front of the trigger hole.
Sand the groove after it is cut.








, This grove will be centered and extend from the rectangle hole to the end of the wood.

Find and mark the center of the end of the wood, farthest from the string groove.
Find and mark the center of the end of the rectangle hole, farthest from the string groove.
Draw a straight line between the two marks.
Use a drill, chisel, and hammer to carve a ¼ inch deep channel along the marked line.
Sand the groove until completely smooth.
















, Use a second piece of pine wood to make the grip.

Cut the wood to be around 8 inches long.
Use PVC glue or wood glue to attach it to the bottom of the stock, making sure it is centered. Leave the glue to dry for at least an hour.








, Use varnish, wood stain, or another wood sealer to ensure the wood will be protected from the elements.

Wait until the glue has dried completely before applying a sealer.








, Use a hacksaw to cut a 1” PVC pipe into a 36 inch length.Make sure to measure and mark the length before cutting to ensure accuracy.

, On each end of the PVC pipe, use a hacksaw to cut a small groove just large enough to fit a small wood screw.









, The pulleys are attached to either end of the PVC bow, and the string will feed through them.

Insert a small wood screw on both ends of the PVC pipe.
Attach the pulleys to the wood screws on either end of the pipe using wire ties.








, The nylon string needs to be threaded through both pulleys correctly for the crossbow to be able to fire.

Securely tie one end of the nylon string to the wood screw on the left side of the PVC pipe.
Bring the string across to the pulley on the right end of the PVC pipe, and loop it in and around the pulley.
Bring the sting back to the left side and loop the string in and around the pulley on the left.
Finally, bring the string back to the right and tie it securely to the right wood screw.
Do not pull the string tightly when you wrap around the pulleys or you will not be able to pull it back to fire the crossbow.








, It’s important to have the string threaded correctly. The string should run across the PVC pipe 3 times. Do a quick test to make sure you have threaded the string correctly.

Pull on the string coming out of the pulleys. The PVC pipe should flex like a bow.
If the pipe does not bend slightly like a bow would, pull the thread out and start again.








, The wood of the stock needs to have a groove carved in for the round PVC pipe to snugly fit.


Use a wood rasp or chisel to carve out a rounded groove wide enough to fit the pipe on the end of the wood stock.
The groove needs to be deep enough to fit the PVC pipe securely.
Carve slowly while repetitively checking how the pipe fits. This will ensure you end up with the perfect fit. The pipe shouldn’t have room to move around.

, The bow needs to be secured to the stock to ensure proper use. You need to have the strings in the correct place for the crossbow to be effective.

Use duct tape to secure the PVC pipe to the stock by wrapping it around the pipe and the end of the wood stock.
Only the firing string coming out of the pulleys should be on top of the wood. The other two strings should be on the bottom so they don’t interfere with the firing process.








, You need to test to make sure the strings are in the right place and the bow will fire correctly.

Draw back the firing string and place it in the string notch on the rectangle hole. It should be able to stay notched and ready by itself.
If the string will not stay notched, you need to make the groove deeper to hold the string.








, Use a thinner piece (around 1 inch thick) of pine wood to create the trigger system.









Draw a rough L-shape on the wood.
The small (horizontal) portion of the “L” shape should be slightly smaller than the box you carved in the stock.
Cut the L-shape out of the wood with a saw. This L-shaped piece of wood will be the trigger.
Sand it until it is smooth.

, Use a wood rasp or chisel to carve about a ⅛ inch channel across the short part of the L-shaped wood.









, The hole should be drilled down by the corner of the L, but centered in the wood.

The hole should be big enough to fit the nail you are using to attach it to the stock.








, You need to attach the trigger onto the stock so that it will pop the string out of the groove when pulled.

Put L-shaped trigger in the rectangle hole with the groove facing upwards and the L pointing forward. Make sure it has space to move without hitting the back of the hole.
Use a hammer to push a nail through the stock and hold the L-shaped trigger in place at the angle.








, Use sand paper to fine tune the trigger until the action is smooth.









, The handle is what you hold to steady the crossbow so you can pull the trigger.


Use pine wood to cut a 20 centimetre (8 inch) length to be used as the handle.
Sand it into the rough shape of a handle.

, The handle should be attached behind the trigger so you can easily fire the crossbow.

Use PVC or wood glue to attach the handle to the stock. Wait an hour for the glue to dry.
When the glue is dry, you can use a hammer to drive a few nails into the handle to firmly secure it on the stock if you would like.








, You use a crossbow by pressing the butt against your shoulder, so padding the butt of the crossbow will make it more comfortable.

Secure foam around the end of the stock that is placed on your shoulder with duct tape.








, You need to have bolts that fit the channel of your crossbow.You can either purchase bolts from a store or make your own out of dowels.
To make your own bolts, cut a dowel to fit the size of the channel on your crossbow, and create a notch on the end of the dowel to hold the string.

, Use a cardboard box or a piece of paper with circles to aim your crossbow at. Make sure your target is away from other people.









, Find a safe place to try out your crossbow. Your crossbow should shoot your bolts around 65 to 100 feet. Have fun!

Dust the surface lightly.,
Apply the cleaner to your rag.,
Swipe the wood in long, clean strokes.,
Wipe up any remaining cleanser.,
Allow the chair to dry.,
Condition with wood butter.,
Perform regular maintenance.",How to Clean a Wooden Chair," Wooden furniture is either raw, untouched wood, or wood coated with stain or varnish. Either of these can be very easily damaged by chemical cleaners or strong detergents. Avoid using any drying cleaner or one not specifically intended for wood to avoid doing damage to the raw wood or the furniture’s varnish.Even some cleaners claiming to be made for wood can be too harsh. Avoid anything using intense sudsing agents such as sulfates.
Although safer alternatives might not lather, you do not need a lather in order to thoroughly clean.;
, One of the easiest ways to clean wood is to use an oil-based cleaner. Water-based cleaners can be too strong, while oil-based cleaners simultaneously cleanse the wood while infusing it with a conditioning treatment. The most common oil is mineral, but you can also use a vegetable oil-based treatment.When searching for a cleaner, one with mineral spirits will contain a conditioning oil as well as a gentle stripping agent. This can be picked up at most home improvement stores.

, Try to avoid using all-purpose cleaners, as these are not formulated for delicate materials. Instead, use a cleaning solution created specifically for use on wood. This could be a store-bought cleaner, or you can make your own using an oil soap such as Dr. Bronner’s castille soap.Murphy’s Oil Soap is one formula intended for wood, and is typically mild enough to clean without doing damage.

, To avoid snagging on any loose strips of wood or leaving lint behind, use lint-free rags for cleaning, such as those made with microfiber. These allow you to clean the wood thoroughly, leaving a streak-free, lint-free finish.Cheesecloth can also be helpful in cleaning wood, as it is extremely porous, but picks up dust well and does not leave any fabric behind.

, Before using a cleaning








Failing to dust the furniture first could result in pressing dust further into the wood grain. Always complete a small dusting before you do any deep cleaning.

, Apply your cleaner to your rag--not directly to the wood. Applying cleaner to the wood can eat away some of the finish or leave a stain, while applying it to the rag first will ensure you apply the cleaner evenly.








This is true of all cleaners except vinegar and water. If using vinegar and water, you must submerge your rag in the mixture and wring it out until damp.

, To make sure the cleaner is applied well, swipe your rag over the wood in long strokes, keeping the weight of your hand consistent. Once you’ve gone over every portion of the wood, go back one more time, using a wiping motion.








The length of time will depend on the cleaner, but most cleaners require you to leave it on the wood for 10-20 minutes before moving on to the next step.
Try to work with the grain of the wood, instead of against it. This will help prevent splinters and applying an uneven coat.

, Glance over the surface of the wood to find any stray wood cleaner, and wipe it away to prevent streaking or damaging the wood or varnish. This will catch any remaining cleaner and will make sure the cleaner has covered every surface evenly. Once again, use a lint-free rag if possible to avoid leaving behind bits of fabric.








This step is particularly important if you are using an oil-based cleaner, as leftover oil can cause staining.

, Allow your chair to dry after wiping it down. This should only take between 10 and 20 minutes. To speed the drying time, you can place a fan overhead or beside the chair and turn it on high.If you are using a water-based cleaner, do not leave standing water on the wood to dry. Instead, wipe up any remaining water with a clean rag.

, To seal the wood, apply wood butter. This will not only prevent staining, but will make future cleaning endeavors far easier, as most dirt and grime will slide right off of the conditioned wood.








There are many commercial waxes and wood butters available on the market.
You can make your own wood butter with some vegetable oil (olive and coconut work well) and beeswax.

, To make sure your chair stays in excellent working order, reseal using your wood butter every couple of months. This will make sure the chair is protected from dust and moisture, and will keep the appearance of the wood smooth and supple.


Maintenance application does not have to be an all-over application. You can search for areas of the chair that have worn down or tarnished and apply your wood butter to those areas alone.

",How to Build a Twig Chair," You want to use straight, bendable green twigs that are 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) to 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter from soft wooded trees when designing branch chairs.


Snip a variety of sizes and lengths with pruning clippers so you'll have plenty of twigs to work with.
Place twigs in a bucket of water to keep them fresh.;
, Use twigs with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) diameter. To build a wicker chair, you need strong legs, and these branches will become the back and front legs of your twig chair.


Cut 2 pieces 12 inches (30.48 cm) long with a bow saw. When designing wicker chairs, the back legs can extend to the back frame.
Saw 2 pieces 4 inches (10.16 cm) long with a bow saw. These will become the front legs of your twig chair.

, To design a twig chair, you want a supportive frame, and these will provide that support.

, To build a wicker chair, you want twigs that are soft and pliable.

,


Bore 1 set of holes 1 inch (2.54 cm) down from the top of the branches about 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep with a drill.
Drill another set of holes 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the bottom of the twigs about 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep. To design a twig chair, you are aiming for balance, and these holes need to line up.

,,


Squeeze wood glue in the holes you drilled.
Fit the 4 inch (10.16 cm) whittled twigs into the holes. Imagine a ladder when building twig chairs, because that is what the back and front legs will look like.
Clamp the pieces together with a large rubber band and let it dry.

,


Drill 4 sets of holes approximately 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep in the back legs.
Bore the top set of holes anywhere you like, keeping in mind that when you build a wicker chair, the holes on the back legs must match.
Drill the other sets of holes so that they will line up with the front legs.

, It's safe to say to make your stool about a foot (30cm) high or even lower because it's meant for kids. Use a pencil to mark where you are going to cut the log.

, Simply saw back and forth until you have severed the measured piece of log.

, If the log is still long, make use of it by creating even more stools rather than leaving the leftovers behind.

,, Use it to smooth the surface of the stool. You can even paint the stool if you prefer.

, Trim three 2"" diameter dowels rods to the height you want for your stool. More than 20"" is not recommended for this particular design.

, Using a compass, draw a circle on the underside of your seat that is 9"" across and centered. Divide the perimeter of the circle into thirds. Then drill 1 3/4"" holes into the seat at an angle. The easiest way to do this is to place a 1"" block underneath half of the seat so that it sits at an angle and then drill straight down.


Adjust the height of the block to change the angle the legs will be at. Experimenting before making this stool is a good idea.

, Use a shaver, sandpaper, a router or other tool of your choice to trim the top 3"" of the dowel down to 1.5"" wide. Then, glue and insert them into the holes. Trim and sand down the pieces which stick above the surface of the seat until the top of the seat is flat and ready for sitting on.

, Use the duct tape to completely cover one end of your 2' tube. Make sure it is very secure and that there aren't any holes. Spray the tape and sides with cooking spray to keep the concrete from sticking.

, Mix and pour enough concrete to fill the tube to the halfway point. The dye, if you've decided to use some, should be mixed in when mixing the concrete.

, Tap and shake the tube side to side to release bubbles trapped in the concrete.

, Add the legs into the tube and set them at the angle that you want. You may be able to rest them on the edge of the bucket or you might have to tie a string around them to keep them at the angle and placement you want. The ends at the bottom of the tube should not, however, be at the edge. They should be at least 1-2"" inwards from the edge.

, Let the concrete set according to the manufacturer's instructions. This is usually at least 2 hrs for this thickness.

, Once the concrete has set, you can cut away the tube and remove any tape that might be left over.

, You'll probably want to angle or round out the ends of the legs. You can also make the seat itself wider by gluing on a larger garden stone as a seat. Painting and staining the legs is another great finishing touch.

,, Do this gently and repetitively until the tack becomes free of the wood.

, This will avoid accidentally treading on sharp objects.

, This is a specialized upholstery tool that removes staples from furniture; these can be purchased online or from specialty stores.

, Lever the regulator upwards, pushing on the edge of the wood.


If the timber is polished or the area is on view, place a slim piece of aluminum or other metal strip on the fabric and press into that instead of into the wood. This will avoid leaving marks from the pressure of the regulator.

, The other end will stay intact usually.

, Slightly twist as you pull firmly to remove the whole staple from the wood.

, Some people prefer the production line approach of lifting the staples with the regulator first, then going back and plucking out each lifted staple next, to save constant chopping and changing between two different actions.

, Once the fasteners have been removed, you can take the old fabric off and use the panels to prepare the new fabric.

, Don't be lazy here––the effort put in now will pay big dividends in accuracy later.


It helps to draw a basic sketch of the chair in relation to each fabric panel removed and to note a corresponding letter or number to each fabric piece, written on both the sketch and the fabric piece's backing.
Note special tucks, pleats, folds, etc. so that you can repeat these when making up the new upholstery fabric.

, This is helpful for adding the fabric panels back on in back-to-front order. Chair panels are usually labeled as follows:


IB = inside back
OB = outside back
IW = inside wing
OW = outside wing
IA = inside arm
OA = outside arm
S = seat
SC = seat cushion
FB = front border
SB = side border
AF = arm facing
SK = skirt

, As much as possible, try to keep the stuffing intact and not torn apart. It's original positioning has been settled by years of sitting, so it's already perfect for fitting the chair.


Lift off using both hands right up to your folded elbow pits.
Have a clean, flat place to put the stuffing onto while you continue working with the upholstery.

, In some cases, you'll need to cut stuffing that has been glued into place. Use a knife with a long blade to slide neatly under it, such as a serrated knife or a snap-blade knife. Slide along and cut as carefully as you can.

, You might find that the stuffing has been held in place by more staples or tacks, or by string. Remove staples or tacks as explained above and simply cut the string.

, Does it need repair or can it be left alone? If it can be left alone, you can get on with preparing the new fabric covering. If not, you'll need to make frame repairs to the chair.

, It can be tricky but it is possible to do many frame repairs yourself. The thing you cannot do is avoid making repairs––a chair left with weaknesses will soon break.


Take the chair to an upholsterer or a cabinet-maker if you're not keen to do self-repairs.

, If these need straightening or tightening and re-gluing, do so yourself. Simply pull the chair rails in different directions to test for wobbliness or weakness. If there is none, the joints have no issues. If they move or bend, they need mending.


Older furniture will have staples, screws or tongue-and-groove joints. Unless you know what you're doing, any broken tongue-and-groove joints may need the help of a professional.
Don't be too forceful when testing––dowel joints that were snug might come loose with too much pulling.

, If you need to reglue joints, the corner block will need to removed first. It is a triangular piece located in the inside corner of the chair seat frame and it might be glued, screwed or nailed in place. To remove:


Put the end point of a ripping chisel into the edge of the corner block where it meets one side of the chair frame.
Tape the end of the chisel with a wooden mallet.
As the chisel slips in further, lever the block away from the chair frame, pushing downwards. Be careful not to push too hard or the chisel can snap; if you feel any give, pull the chisel out and push by hand only.
Repeat for other corner blocks.

,


Lay the chair down on a workbench with the side needing repairing facing upward nearest you (not on the bench). Hold the chair firmly.
Tap next to the joint with a rubber mallet to try to ease it apart. If it is stubborn, don't force it.
Remove the parted joint. Clean and sand it to remove old glue.

, If you discover a dowel is broken, it will need to be fixed before restoring the joint in place.


Chisel the dowel flat enough to be drilled on. Then drill off the old dowel, taking care not to drill into the chair frame's wood.
Squeeze some wood glue into the old dowel hole, then insert the new dowel. Tap in lightly with a hammer. Wipe away any excess glue, then let dry completely.

, Fill in dowel holes with the wood glue. Gently but firmly push the joints back together again.

, Wipe away excess glue to prevent it from drying as obvious blobs on the chair frame.


Restore the corner blocks, again wiping away excess glue before it dries.

, In general, upholstery fabric needs to be strong, to withstand being sat on and moved about on. The following fabrics are recommended:


Cotton: Heavy duty cotton is suitable for infrequent domestic use.
Linen: This is a strong fabric that can stand light to medium domestic use. It's a lovely upholstery covering that looks classic and wears well.
Jacquard: This is cotton fabric mixed with synthetics such as nylon or polyester, to strengthen it. This fabric can handle medium to heavy domestic use and is also suitable for some commercial purposes.
Vinyl: Also known as synthetic leather, this covering is strong and waterproof. It can handle medium to heavy domestic use, as well as commercial use. Just be aware that it's not ideal for hot environments.
Tapestry: This is a traditional upholstery fabric and it is strong. It is also often expensive but you may be able to find some in bargain stores. This fabric can be used for medium to heavy domestic use, and some commercial uses, such as a waiting room chair in a beauty salon. It's ideal for antique furniture restoration.
Velvet: This strong and soft fabric is a long-lasting upholstery covering. It's nice to work with and suits medium to heavy domestic use. It's a bit of work to clean, so may not be ideal for commercial uses.
If you have leftover upholstery fabric or fabric that is strong enough to use for chair coverings, this might be all you need to use.







, This method requires that you took great care with the fabric panels and removed them without cutting into them, as you'll use the old panels for your pattern templates.

, Any parts sewn together need to be unpicked, as this will free the seam allowances already made by the prior maker.


Always add sufficient allowances for sewing and attaching of panels when making up the new measurements.

, Keep as straight as you possibly can.

, Simply lay each former panel direct onto the new fabric and using chalk or invisible fabric pen, draw around each panel in turn.

, Key things to bear in mind include:


Cut with the right side facing you––you need to be able to see the fabric grain at all times.
For symmetrical panels, cut halfway, then bend over to check that the panel is exactly the same on its opposite side. If yes, keep cutting. Or, make adjustments as needed.
Cut all pieces in the same direction, same thread line.
Mark all cut pieces with the panel names you've chosen, to prevent mix-ups. Write down the correct indicator for the exact panel piece, using the standard labels recommended above. Add the directional arrow as well, so you know which way it needs to go. Be careful about marking delicate fabrics that might show the markings through the other side.

, Make adjustments as needed.

, This section is deliberately scant due to the fact that you need individual instructions depending on the chair type and the amount and type of panels being sewn. In general, you'll need to sew seams in place, join front and back panels, arm panels, cushion panels, etc. You'll also need to stitch a skirt if the chair has one. You'll also need to add zippers and make any cuts needed to fit around parts of the chair. Some more precise examples are provided in the chair type sections noted below.


Use straight seams for sewing upholstery fabric.
For pleats, etc., you'll need advanced sewing skills. If not, ask for help from a more experienced sewer.
Strong fabric can easily break a domestic sewing machine; you may need access to an industrial one, or send the pieces along for someone else to stitch together for you.

,, Refer to the list you made earlier.

, Pull taut to ensure no wrinkles and follow the same positions where the tacks, etc. were placed previously.


A tack hammer is required for adding tacks. Masking tape can be placed over the head to soften its impact against the chair frame.

Buy a sturdy, narrow bookshelf.,
Turn it on its side.,
Add wheels or legs.,
Turn it right side up.,
Add cushions.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Build a Bench1," Since bookshelves aren’t normally meant to sit on, this one is probably better for kids than adults, but hacking an Ikea shelf actually makes a great place to get little ones ready for school.


Try the narrow Expedit shelf (one 5-shelf column), which is handy because the square shelves allow the accompanying storage baskets and bins to work in this orientation as well. This will give you a great place to sit your preschooler down to change shoes, hats, mittens, as well as store backpacks and other items.;
, Build the shelf as described in the product’s instructions and then turn it on its side. The side on the floor will eventually become the top or seat of the bench.

, Go to your local hardware store and pick out some legs for your bench. You can get wheels (like the kind you see on shopping carts) or wooden or metal furniture feet. Whatever you feel matches with your decoration and your needs. Attach the feet at the corners of the bench as described in the instructions for the product you buy.


At least four feet are necessary. Six are recommended.
Make sure the screw does not interfere with the other pieces holding the shelf together. Be strategic!

, Turn the shelf so that it sits on its new feet. You now have a bench!

, Either make a custom cushion or buy relatively flat, square cushions to go on top of the bench. Glue strips of velcro to the top of the bench and then attach the other side of the velcro to the underside of your pillows.


It is best to put the soft, fluffy side of the velcro on the pillows, as it will make them easier to wash.

, You can add finishing touches by painting the bench a different color, if you want to. You can also buy baskets or other storage items to go in the shelves.

Measure and mark the center line on the footboard.,
Cut the footboard.,
Create the attachment points on the footboard.,
Attach the footboards to the headboard.,
Attach the seat.,
Caulk all joints.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Build a Bench2," You will need a wooden headboard and footboard. If they are attached, detach them. This project works best if there is either a flat skirt on the footboard or two-part skirt with an even edge at the top.Once you have the frame and the boards are detached, sand the wood to remove old paint or varnish, if you want to.

, Measure a vertical center line on the footboard and mark it with a pencil or other marking tool.

, Use a jigsaw or circular saw to cut the footboard along the center line. The two pieces will become the sides of the bench, while the headboard will be the back of the bench.

, Along the edges you just cut, drill evenly space holes for dowels. Find dowels that are an appropriate size and then use the drill bit for that size to drill the holes. Measure the height from the floor to the holes that you cut, as well as the distance between the holes, and then make identical holes in the same location on the front of the headboard posts.


The number of holes you drill and where you drill them will depend on the shape and style of the bed.
If your bed is of a non-standard shape, you may have to alter how you attach the footboards to the headboard. It may be necessary to attach them at the sides, rather than at the front of the posts.

, Insert the dowels, applying wood glue in both holes, and attach the footboards to the headboard. It should now be starting to look like a bench!

, Lay the bench on its back and attach 1x6s (cut to the appropriate length) to the footboards using L brackets and wood screws. Attach these at whatever height works for you and that the footboards allow. Use however many boards are needed to create a wide enough seat.


Add a 1x3 board to the bottom of the front seat-board to make a skirt, if you want to.

, Caulk all the joints and gaps so that the connections are more sturdy. Upright the bench when necessary during this process.

, Paint the bench (with outdoor paint if you intend to put it outside), if you want to. You may also wish to add seat cushions or upholster the bench.

Mount your nestbox.",How to Make a Sparrow Nestbox," A basic nestbox can be built using a single plank of wood. Purchase a board that is one inch by six inches in thickness/width, and four feet long.


Any type of wood will work.However, hardwoods like oak and beech will last longer than softer woods like pine.Don't use wood that's less than 3/4 of an inch thick. It can warp and won't provide enough insulation to keep birds warm.;
, Using a pencil and a ruler, draw several lines on the wood to mark where you'll be cutting to create the sides and back of the nestbox. The cut lines should be as follows:For the roof, move eight inches down from the end of the plank and make a mark on each side of the board. Use a ruler to draw a horizontal line between them.
For the back, move 12 inches (30.5 cm) down from your first line, and draw another horizontal line across.
For the front of your nestbox, move down another seven inches down and draw another horizontal line.

, The walls of the nestbox need to be angled at the top so the roof will slant.For the first wall, move eight inches down the left side of your plank and make a mark. On the right side, make a mark seven inches down. Draw a line between the two. It should slant gently upward.
For the second wall, the lengths are reversed. Move seven inches down the left side of the plank from the slanted line and make a mark. Move eight inches down the right side of the plank and make a mark. When you draw a line between these two marks, it will be horizontal if you have done it correctly.
Finally, for the bottom, draw one more horizontal line five inches down from previous one. There should be about an inch left at the bottom, which you will discard.

, Use the lines you've drawn to cut the pieces for your nestbox with a saw.


Any saw will do, but a table saw or circular saw will give the cleanest cuts and do so the fastest.

, The front piece of your nestbox will need an entrance hole for the sparrows to use as an entrance. The easiest way to create this hole will be using a power drill with a large bit that creates circular holes.


A hole of 32mm (about 1 and 1/4 inches) is recommended for house sparrows., Inevitably, your nestbox will get some rainwater in it. So, it's a good idea to drill a couple of small holes in the bottom piece to allow water to drain out easily., Finally, before assembling the pieces, you'll want to drill some holes in the back you can use to hang the nestbox. Make one or two at the top of the back piece for mounting., Now it's time to start assembly. To begin, attach the bottom to the back using galvanized or stainless steel nails, to avoid rust. Attach the base to the back along one of the short (five-inch) edges of the bottom piece, leaving room on each side for the side pieces.Hammer the nails in through the backside of the back piece and into the base.
Attach the base so it is perpendicular with the back, about one to two inches up from the bottom of the back piece.
Brass screws may be used in the place of nails if you prefer., The bottom edge of each wall piece should be flush with the underside of the base. The long edge of each wall piece should be attached to the back piece.Hammer the nails into the base through the outside of each wall. Hammer nails into the walls through the backside of the back piece.

, The front piece should now be attached to the walls and base. The edges of of the front piece should be flush with the underside of the base and outside walls of the nestbox.To attach this piece, hammer nails through the front piece into the edges of the base and walls.

, To attach the top, you'll want to use a hinge (or hinges), with one side screwed into the top of the roof piece and one side screwed into the back. Lay the roof on to get a sense of where to place the hinge.Your hinge should be waterproof. You can use a waterproof brass hinge, if you can find one, or just use piece of inner tube in the place of a hinge.Attaching the roof with a hinge ensures that the roof piece will fit onto the back without having to cut the edge at an angle. It also allows you to clean out the nestbox in the autumn after any new chicks have left the nest., Bird lovers disagree about whether or not the joints in the nestbox should be sealed. If you choose to do so, you can seal the birdhouse using waterproof wood glue.Sealing your nestbox can stop drafts and make the birds more comfortable.However, leaving the joints unsealed allows moisture to drain more easily., Dry moss or other course vegetation provides the basic materials for sparrow nests.Putting some in the box will get your new guests started on furnishing their home!

, Once your box is finished, find a good place to hang it up. Ideally, you will want to place it at least 15 feet (4.6 m) above the ground.Placing the box close to the eaves of your home will make it attractive to sparrows.Make sure to place it away from tree branches or anything else that would make it easy for a cat or other predator to access the nest."

Wash the carton well.,
Paint the entire milk carton with primer.,
Using the paintbrush, paint in the design with different colors.,
Using scissors, cut out a door in the front of the milk carton face.,
Using the ice pick or hole punch, preferably the hole punch, create two holes in the top of the milk carton to hang it from.,
Cut out two pieces of twine or wire equal in length.,
Clean up.",How to Build a Milk Carton Birdhouse1," Milk left inside the carton can mix with birdseed and go moldy. Ensure that the container is properly dry before proceeding.;
, When it dries, draw a design of your choosing on the milk carton with the pencil. Make it creative but keep in mind you will be painting in the design next, so keeping it simple is not a bad thing.

, Alternatively, you can leave it white and only color in some parts of it; however, it might look a bit plain and might not attract the birds.

, In the middle of the milk carton, directly in the center, cut a hole for the birds to go in too. The bigger the hole you cut, the bigger the birds that will be attracted to the nest in the birdhouse; Just be careful not to cut the hole too big, as the milk carton only has room for birds as large as a robin and as small as a sparrow.

, Starting at the very top, in the tab of the milk carton where the pour spout is, go in a half of an inch from the outside corner and a half an inch from the top, then punch in a hole. Do the same to the other side.

, The length should be determined by however high or low you wish to hang the birdhouse. The twine or wire simply goes through the holes in the tab of the milk carton, one piece of wire or twine per hole, and up to the tree branch or to whatever you are hanging the birdhouse from.


Be sure to tie the knots or twist the wire securely and test it. You wouldn't want a bird to build a nest and it fall.

, Make sure you put dry grass or some fluff for the birds to have a comfortable seat when they move into your custom made birdhouse!

, Once the removal is done, and the bees have died off safely, take down the box, and either clean it with boiling water or some solvents. , It's a good idea to leave the insides exposed to the sun for a while.,, If possible, paint the inside of the box with an oil-based paint so the odour masks the bee scent., Before returning the box, ensure that you cut a second large hole in the back of the box so there is less chance that the bees can control the air flow inside the box. This will not affect birds or possums, but it will certainly make the box less appealing to bees., If you do want to put the box back, ensure that you have removed all trace of the previous infestation."

, Attach a 2x2 cut to 8' length to each side piece. This 2x2 should be attached 1 ½” from the top of the side pieces. Attach these with appropriately long wood screws, 2 for each bar, with the screws at least 1 ½” from the ends of the 2x2.

, Using two 8’ 1x4s, attach the sides of the bench to each other. The top edge of the 1x4 will be flush with the top of the side pieces. Drill dowel holes into both ends of the 2x2s and the matching location on the 1x4s. Use dowels to attach these and then use wood screws, passing from the outside of the bench sides and into the 1x4s, two screws for each end of the 1x4 boards.

, Drop in two 8’ 2x4s. There should be space to have a gap between them. Use long wood screws, going through the side boards and into the seat boards, 6 screws across each side.

, Paint or stain the bench, as needed.

Check to ensure the cage bars are closely spaced.,
Buy a cage made of safe materials.,
Pick a rectangular cage.,
Place the cage in a warm, active room.,
Choose an easy-to-clean area to put your cage.,
Pick out a few perches of different sizes.,
Make sure your bird has access to food and fresh water.,
Buy a cuttlebone and mineral block.,
Give your parakeet toys that provide physical and mental stimulation.,
Close escape routes and remove flying hazards.,
Buy a play set for out-of-cage use.,
Consider a flight cage as an alternative for active birds.",How to House a Parakeet," Parakeets are active birds, so they need a large cage in which they can move around. The minimum cage size for a single parakeet should be 18” w x 14” d x 22” h (46 x 46 x 56 cm). However, it is generally best to buy the largest cage you can reasonably have in your home and which has safe bars for your bird.If you have two parakeets, double the minimum cage size. The more birds you have, the more space you need.;
, The bars on your cage should be spaced close enough that your parakeet can’t get their head through them. Look for bars that are spaced half an inch (1.27 cm) apart or less for your parakeet’s safety.You should also look for a cage that has at least one side with horizontal bars so that your parakeet can climb up and down them.

, Parakeets like to chew their cages, so it is important you get one made of safe materials. Painted cages should be lead and zinc free, and the cage should not have any sharp edges. If possible, look for a cage that is 100% stainless steel, as these are durable and safe for parakeets. Otherwise, look for a heavy wire that your parakeet won’t be able to bend.Avoid cages with sliding doors, as parakeets can get stuck in these when trying to get out of their cage.

, Dome-style cages may be pretty, but parakeets like to rest in corners. Some cages, like the palace or home shape, have corners, but can still restrict your parakeet’s movement. Look for a square or rectangular cage for your parakeet’s comfort and security., When deciding where in your home your parakeet should live, remember two things: they like company and they cannot handle rapid temperature change. Keep your parakeet somewhere where people will be able to see and interact with it, such as the living room, but keep it away from windows and vents, since parakeets like bright rooms, but can easily overheat or get too cold.Avoid putting your parakeet in the kitchen, though, as the fumes and hot surfaces can be unsafe.Cages shouldn't be kept on the floor, either. Look for a secure, elevated place to put the cage, such as a table top, or consider getting a stand just for your parakeet's home.

, You're going to have to change out cage liners every day. Your parakeet is also going to get food, water, and maybe even droppings in the area around the cage. Look for an area that will be easy to clean, such as a tile floor, or buy a carpet liner to protect the floor below the cage.This is important for you and your parakeet, since droppings and wet areas can encourage bacteria that could make you and your bird sick.

, Your parakeet will need a few perches of different width and textures set up in its cage. This helps mimic the outdoors, and promotes foot and leg strength in your bird. Look for both wooden and rope perches for your parakeet.Do not rely on the just the perch that came with the cage. Depending upon the manufacturer, these can be poorly made and using only the dowel could cause sores on the feet.

, Your parakeet should have access to food and fresh water all the time. Look for bowls that can clip onto the sides of your bird’s cage. You may also consider a water bottle instead of or in addition to a water bowl, as these are cleaner and easy for your birds to use.Avoid putting bowls on the cage floor. This is an area where your parakeet feels vulnerable, which may discourage them from eating or drinking.
If you buy a dish with a hood and notice your parakeet is not eating, try removing the hood. Some birds feel uncomfortable sticking their heads in an enclosed space.
Make sure you have at least as many food bowls in the cage as you do birds.

, Cuttlebones and mineral blocks together help your bird in two ways. First, they provide them with much needed minerals and micronutrients. Second, they allow your bird to satisfy their chewing instinct and keep their beaks groomed., Toys help your parakeet exercise its mind and body, so it is important to get a variety of toys that will challenge your bird. Soft wood and rope toys allow your parakeet to chew, while foraging toys help your parakeet use its mind to work for food.Always keep safety in mind when buying toys. Parts with dyed leather, removable hooks, or other small, removable parts could be choking hazards.
Keep a few toys in your parakeet’s cage at a time and rotate them out every few weeks to keep your bird interested and mentally stimulated. Don’t put too many in at once, though. Your parakeet still needs room to stand, fly, and move around.

, Your parakeet needs space to get out of its cage every day for at least an hour. Create a safe fly space by closing all windows and doors, cutting off all flying hazards including fans and hot surfaces, and moving other pets to another room.Check the fly space for chewing hazards, as well. Houseplants and electrical cords could be unsafe if your parakeet starts chewing on them and should be covered or removed.
Birds sometimes mistake windows and mirrors for openings and fly into them on accident. Help keep your bird safe by closing blinds or pulling curtains and placing towels or sheets over mirrors.

, Most pet stores and bird specialty stores sell play sets with slides, swings, ladders, toys, and other obstacles for birds to use out-of-cage. Get a playset and set it up in a space that you will be able to monitor while your bird flies around and stretches its wings.It may be helpful to set the play set on top of your cage so that droppings fall directly to the paper liner below.

, Flight cages are large cages that allow your bird space to stretch their wings while still keeping them from flying freely around a room. These are good alternatives for birds that do not have clipped wings, that live in a home with too many hazards to properly control, or who are otherwise overly active outside the cage.Play sets can be added to flight cages to keep your bird entertained while flying.

Done.",How to Build a Simple Birdhouse2," For the sake of this tutorial, assume that the terracotta pot is about 160mm x 160mm in diameter. Change the measurements from top to bottom according to how much bigger or smaller your pot is.

, This diameter will serve as the measurement for your wooden circle.

, Use a jigsaw or similar cutting saw to cut out the circle shape.

, The circle size should be just enough to allow the bird to hop in and out of the hole. Cut the hole out.


If you wish to weatherproof the wood, use a non-toxic food-grade stain or sealant. Birds are sensitive to many chemicals.

, This should be placed about 2 inches/5cm up from the base of the circle. This serves as both a perch and as the pulling and pushing mechanism for removing and putting back the circle piece.

, Use the hole already in the base of the pot and drill into the post or wall. You'll need a screw or bolt large enough for the hole.

, Push the circle piece into place.

, The birdhouse is now ready for its new bird residents to move in. Keep the birdhouse clean; simply pull out the wooden circle, clean out the inside of the pot, then replace the circle by pushing it back in.

Toss out the old boot and use the good boot for a birdhouse. Or, if both old boots are in good shape, but you just don't want to wear them anymore, make two birdhouses.

, Give it a warm, soapy wash to remove dirt, dust, etc. Tie the shoelaces together neatly, in a nice bow.

, Stuff from the toe up to about two thirds the way of the sole. This will make a nice snug place for the bird to lay her eggs and the chicks to sit on.

, This should be strong and firmly attached. It is what you will use to attach the boot to the tree.

, Place it at the level you want the birdhouse to be. Do this carefully; you only want to make the slightest of marks in the tree.


The U-shaped nail should be strong and solid enough to hold the weight of the boot and its inhabitants.
If you'd rather not attach the boot birdhouse to the tree's trunk, attach it to a flat piece of wood, then attach the wood to a post, using nails.

, Slide the hook over the U-shaped nail on the tree. Check that it is sitting firmly.

,, To one of the side boards, attach roof flashing or other metal to prevent squirrels or woodpeckers from enlarging the hole you are about to drill. Drill a 1.5"" (3.8cm) hole in flashing and wood.

,,,


Do not attach the base to the backboard. Owls and woodpeckers leave a mess. You can clean the base by removing the screws.

, Attach a roof to the top with hinges. Roof should extend 1-2"" (2.5 - 5cm). Place box 9 feet (2.7 metres) or higher.

Check that the wood duck nesting box is ready to place outside.",How to Build a Wood Duck House," From one 11 1/4"" (28.5 cm) wide by 12 foot (3.65 meters) long board you can make one nest box. The plan shown here explains how to divide the wood (click on the image to enlarge). It is best to use a weather resistant wood, such as cedar.

, Pencil draw the different pieces onto the wood. Keep in mind the importance of measuring twice, cutting once.

,
NOTE: The back edge of the roof part should be cut with the saw adjusted to a 20 degree angle so that it fits flush with the back of the box.
NOTE: The front board in the layout is 1/2"" (12.7 mm) too long. Cut off that 1/2"" (12.7 mm) with the saw at a 20 degree angle (sloping away from the box) so the roof fits flush, and is therefore watertight.


After cutting the wood, you should end up with the following pieces: a back, two sides, a front, a floor, and a roof.

, Do not use screws yet; it is important to fit the parts together to check the design and angles, before drilling and fastening. If anything requires adjusting, now is the time to do so.

, It is easiest to drill the hole before assembling the box. A hole sized 3"" (7.6 cm) high by 4"" (10.2 cm) wide will admit ducks, but exclude raccoons. A hole of these dimensions can be created with a 3"" (7.6 cm) hole saw by ""staggering"" two holes, as shown in the image. Locate the center of the hole 19"" (48.3 cm) above the base of the front part.


The hole will be cleaner if drilled a little from both sides of the board.
Use a rotary rasp or other tool to smooth out the oval opening.

, The baby ducks will need a rough surface to grasp when attempting to leave the nest, and the momma duck will appreciate a rough surface on the front of the box when she lands. This can be accomplished by attaching screen or mesh, but suitable results may be obtained by setting the saw to make shallow Kerf cuts on both the interior and exterior of the front part.

, With the parts prepared, assembly can begin. Ring-shanked nails can be used, but exterior deck screws (2"") (5 cm) create a more durable design that can withstand the elements for several years. To avoid splitting the wood, it is advisable to pre-drill the holes first.

, It is handy to have two drills, one for the hole, and the other with a bit to drive the screws.

, Recess the bottom about 1/4"" (6.35 mm) from the box base in order to provide a drip edge and to avoid rot. Drill holes in the base or cut about 1/4"" (6.3 mm) off the corners for ventilation and drainage.

, One of the side parts should be cut to provide access for cleaning out old nesting material. Hinges can be used, but it is cheaper to simply use well placed nails (near the top of the opening board) as a pivot for the door.
NOTE: The board in this example was cut at a 20 degree angle to prevent rainwater leakage into the box (water doesn't like to run up-hill).

, Raccoons can work a simple latch.


A 1"" X 11 1/4"" (2.5 cm x 28.5 cm) strip can be used to hold the back of the lid in place and to further prevent rainwater leakage (see strip on lid in final image).

, When you're happy with it, place it in a suitable location to attract the local wood ducks. Ducks Unlimited advises that a wood duck nesting box is best placed on a wooden post or a metal pole designed with predator guards.Boxes placed on posts in water should be about 5 feet (1.52 meters) above the water's surface.
Boxes may be placed in woodlands areas up to one-half mile from water in trees or on a post at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) high, but preferably 20 feet (6.09 meters) high. To reduce the chances of predation, they should be 30 to 100 feet (9.14 meters to 30.48 meters) from the water's edge.
Keep in mind to place the box:Near suitable brood habitat;
Near shallow, fertile wetlands with thick cover; and
Where there is a plentiful supply of invertebrates for eating.


Don't forget to add a 4"" (10.16 cm) layer of wood shavings for the nesting material. Suitable shavings include ""chain saw"" wood chips (or cedar wood chip bedding such as found in pet stores).

Clean out dummy nests.,
Remove old nests.,
Plug the nestbox hole.,
Use larger nestboxes.,
Try nestboxes with smaller holes.",How to Deter House Wrens from Nestboxes1," House wrens create a number of nests, including dummy nests, in order to claim territory and ward off competitors. They also use dummy nests to cover the eggs and hatchlings of competitors, making it impossible for them to incubate their eggs or feed their young. Dummy nests consist of loose sticks, whereas an active nest has a lining of feathers and often eggs. Removing dummy nests makes it easier for other species to nest in a box. It is illegal to remove an active house wren nest. Make sure it is a dummy nest before removing.
Removing dummy nests requires constant monitoring because house wrens will return and repeatedly try to rebuild them. Use a birdcam to watch the nestbox.
Do not drop sticks from dummy nest on the ground near the nestbox. House wrens will reuse the sticks if left nearby.;
, House wrens often return to nestboxes with old nests, perhaps because they indicate a safe location from predators and competitors. If you want to make sure house wrens do not nest in a certain location, be sure to clean out any old nests at the end of the season.House wren nests are usually empty by fall.

, If a nestbox has a dummy nest inside, place a cap over the hole to discourage house wrens from returning. This can be done with a rubber drain stopper or a piece of cork. Plugging a nestbox for a few weeks may convince local house wrens to move on to new territory and open up space for new tenets. Although this may drive the house wrens away from one particular nestbox, it may also encourage them to move on to another one with birds actively nesting in it.

, House wrens love tiny nestboxes, particularly the tiny ornamental birdhouses that can be found in many backyards. Multiple small boxes placed close together have a tendency to create large populations of house wrens and drive out other species. On the other hand, bigger boxes placed over a large area tended to facilitate the growth of other bird species. It is believed that house wrens prefer the smaller floors of little nestboxes because they offer a better space for building their compact nests.

, Slot, Gilbertson and Gilwood boxes have openings that make it easier for house wrens to fill them with sticks and create dummy nests. They also tend to have a smaller size that house wrens are drawn to. Use nestboxes with openings that make it difficult for house wrens to create dummy nests.House wrens prefer a home with a diameter of roughly 1 1/8 inches. Making a hole smaller than this may prevent their entry.
Avoid gourd nestboxes, which also seem to attract house wrens.

"
"
Locate the box 200-300 feet away from woods or areas near rivers.,
Mount nestboxes high.,
Remove extra boxes from endangered habitats.,
Place extra boxes without predator guards in house wren habitat.",How to Deter House Wrens from Nestboxes2," House wrens prefer areas with lots of thickets, brambles, trees or shrubs. Placing nestboxes near house wren habitat, but not within it, will encourage their spread into the territory of other birds. Although the size of their territory is unknown, it is believed that house wrens may travel 100-230 feet from their nest site. Be sure to give yourself plenty of space between your nestbox and the nearby house wren habitat. House wrens prefer nesting in deciduous trees, so place your nestboxes near conifers.
Remove shrubbery near the nestbox. You can also place nestboxes facing away from shrubbery. House wrens prefer shrubs over trees.
If possible, place boxes out in the open.

, Although there is evidence that house wrens can nest between 10 and 30 feet, some birders claim that placing a nestbox above 12 feet will deter house wren nesting. This is believed to be because the height places the birds at a greater distance from shrubbery. This is common in urban settings where boxes along trails tend to be hung above 12 feet. , Taking down extra boxes will keep the number of house wren from exploding and minimize its impact on other populations. With fewer house wrens attacking their nests, other birds will be able to utilize the space.Keep in mind that house wren territory may extend beyond 300 feet and that boxes beyond your property may attract house wrens to your area.

, Placing extra boxes in house wren habitat will ensure that they do not steal them from other species. Removing the predator guard will also make it more difficult for house wren to safely nest and minimize the local population. Eventually, removing the predator guards may also drive house wren into other areas. This may be more of a short term solution.

Make or purchase a Wren Guard.,
Watch the nestbox.,
Put the guard up after the desired bird has laid an egg or two.,
Remove the guard after the hatchlings are about a week old.",How to Deter House Wrens from Nestboxes3," A Wren Guard is an L-shaped piece of wood that extends over the hole of a nestbox and obscures it from view. You can easily make a Wren Guard at home or purchase on from a retailer. It is believed to be effective because it makes it difficult for house wren to enter the box. The birds tend to perch on the roof before entering the nestbox, but this is difficult to do with the guard in place. The guard should be made of the same material as the nestbox so that it blends in, but you can also make one of cardboard and plastic in a pinch.
Typically you have to make your own guard since the dimensions will be slightly different for each bird you are looking to protect. The space between the nestbox hole and the guard will vary depending on the bird nesting inside. However, there are some retail models available.

, Using a Wren Guard requires quite a bit of observation on your part. You need to pay attention to when birds begin nesting in the box so that you know when to attach the guard. The song of a house wren indicates that they have moved into the area and that you need to be vigilant. Male house wren sometimes do not sing when entering a new area and remain unnoticed until they begin destroying nests.
Use a birdcam to keep a closer eye on your nestboxes.

, If you put the guard up too early, it is likely that the nesting birds will not return. If it is installed too late, a house wren may destroy the nest before you have a chance to stop it. The nesting birds need enough time to realize that they are in a safe space. Once they have laid a few eggs, they are invested in the space and much more likely to return. Check the nest daily or install a birdcam to monitor it.

, The guard will make it difficult for the adult birds to feed the nestlings and may interfere with their eventual fledging. It may become more of a threat to the hatchlings than a house wren. At this point the baby birds will be too big for the house wren to throw from the nest or cover with twigs.Chickadees and titmice nestlings need about two weeks before the guard can be removed.
For bluebirds, the guard can be removed 4-7 days after hatching.

",How to Build a Bluebird House," While many are available online, the design used in this article was created by the staff of the Missouri Department of Conservation and it is known to attract bluebirds.

, In this project, a piece of old cedar siding which measures 8' (2.4 meters) long by 11 1/2"" (29.2cm) wide, and 3/4"" (1.9cm) thick will make three bluebird houses. Additionally, 10 exterior grade 2"" (5cm) screws are needed. A single bluebird house can be created from one 1""x 6"" x 5' (2.5cm x 15cm x 30.5cm) board.

, For this project, you'll need a circular saw, 2 drills, a speed square, a pencil, and a brace-and-bit.

, This board was cut in to a 5 1/2"" (14cm) wide piece and a 4"" (10cm) wide piece.
The front and back parts are 5 1/2"" (14cm) by 9 7/8"" (25cm) and 16 1/2"" (42cm) respectively.
The side parts are 4"" (10cm) wide. The short side measures 9 3/4"" (24.7cm) and the long side measures 10 3/4"" (27cm).
The base section measures 4"" x 4"" (10cm x 10cm).
The top part is 6 1/2"" inches (16.5cm) long and 6 inches (15cm) wide (so there is a little overhang to block rain). This last measurement is a little different from the plan shown above.
The dimensions for the front and sides will leave a little gap for ventilation under the lid when the box is assembled.

,, You can use a spade bit, a hole saw, or an adjustable size hole bit. It is easier to do this before assembly.
For best results, drill the hole about three quarters of the way through, flip the board and finish the hole by drilling through the reverse side. Some of you may find this boring.
NOTE: Rough up the interior and the exterior of the front part so the chicks can easily leave the nest and so momma will have an easy time landing on the front of the box. This can be done with a knife, nail, or a chisel.

, Base may need additional trimming to get the proper fit in the assembled box.
The base is inserted about 1/4"" (6.35mm) above the bottom of the sides. It is recessed to provide a drip edge.

, Pre-drill the holes with a ""twist bit"" which also drills a countersink for the screw head. Use exterior grade screws. Four in the front, four in the back, and two to secure the base.

,, Insert a nail or screw which can be removed for cleaning the box after nesting.

Add the perch hole.,
Add the front panel to the rest of the birdhouse.,
Sand the edges and holes.,
Add the hanging points.,

Add finishing touches.",How to Build a Birdhouse1," You'll need two pieces of 1x6 lumber. One should be cut to 5 1/2"" in length, the other should be cut to 6 1/4"" in length. Connect them so that they overlap and the top ends end up being roughly equal height. Glue them together and allow them to dry.


Once it is dry, nail or drill through one and into the other to secure them firmly (use 2 nails/screws, equally spaced).





;
, Cut a back panel from a piece of plywood to be 7"" square. Glue along the back edge of the bottom pieces and them press the square into place. Once it dries, screw at four equally spaced positions, passing through the back piece and into the edge of the bottom pieces.


It may help to pre-drill the holes for the screws.

, Lie the birdhouse down on a stable work surface, which the back flat against the surface. Take two roof panels, cut from 1x6 boards. One will need to be cut to 9"" in length, the other will need to be 8 1/4"". Fit the pieces so that they overlap and sit flush with the sides and back panel. Glue and then screw them into place, using 4 equally spaced screws, as before. 

, Get 4 L brackets and install them at the centers of the four corners of the box you've formed (connecting the sides and roof pieces). Make sure the screws used to install the brackets are not too long; they should go only to the mid-point of the wood.

, Using a 1 3/8-"" hole saw, drill into the front piece, such that the top of the hole is 2 1/2"" down from the top point.

, Find a dowel rod, as close to 1/4"" as possible. This will be cut to size and used as a perch. Drill a hole using a bit appropriate for the size dowel you purchased about 1/2"" from the bottom of the entrance hole.


The dowel will need to be at least 3"" long.







, Glue the edges of the side pieces and roof pieces, then fit the front piece into place and add 8 screws to attach it, two evenly placed screws for each side and roof piece.

, Sand the edges and the entrance hole so that they’re smooth.

, Screw in two eye bolts at equal points at the very top of the birdhouse. It may help to pre-drill the holes.

, Cut your dowel rod to 3"" and add glue. Place it in the perch hole. Allow to dry.

, If you intend this house to be used by wild birds, paint it in muted colors, like brown or green, as wild birds prefer these colors. Add any other desired finishing touches and hang the house.


Enjoy!

Find an appropriately-sized gourd.,
Drill an entrance hole.,
Clean out the inside of the gourd.,
Drill a narrow hole through the neck of the gourd to hang it.,
Drill three to five small drainage holes in the bottom of the gourd.,
Add a perch if necessary.,
Sand the outside of the gourd if desired.,
Paint the gourd if desired.,
Seal the outside of the gourd.,
Thread a cord through the neck and hang the gourd.",How to Build a Birdhouse2," Be sure the gourd is already cured (i.e. dried and solid) before you begin. The type of cavity-nesting bird(s) you hope to attract will determine how large the gourd should be. Since gourds are irregularly shaped, use the measurements below, which are ideal, merely as guidelines for selecting a gourd.



Tree swallows prefer an interior space that measures 5x5 in (13x13 cm) wide and 7 in (18 cm) high.

Wrens prefer an interior space that measures 4x4 in (10x10 cm) wide and 7 in (18cm) high.

Chickadees and downy woodpeckers prefer an interior space that measures 4x4 in (10x10 cm) wide and 9 in (23 cm) high.

House finches prefer an interior space that measures 5x5 in (13x13 cm) wide and 8 in (20 cm) high.

, Choose the size of the drill bit based on how large a bird you’d like to accommodate. This is perhaps the most important part of the birdhouse; providing a too-large hole for the bird you’d like to attract will invite predators to attack and bully it. The height at which you drill the hole is also important, as different birds prefer different nest-cavity depths. Use the guidelines below to determine how large the hole should be and how high up from the bottom of the gourd to drill it.



Tree swallows prefer a hole that is 1 1/2 in (4 cm) wide and 5 in (13 cm) high.

House wrens prefer a hole that is 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 5 in (13 cm) high.

Carolina wrens prefer a hole that is 1 3/8 in (3.5 cm) wide and 5 in (13 cm) high.

Chickadees prefer a hole that is 1 1/8 in (2.85 cm) wide and 7 in (18 cm) high.

Downy woodpeckers prefer a hole that is 1 3/8 in (3.5 cm) wide and 7 in (18 cm) high.

House finches prefer a hole that is 1 1/2 in (4 cm) wide and 6 in (15 cm) high.

, Use a spoon to scrape out any loose seeds, fibers, and debris from the inside of the gourd. Don’t worry about making it perfect; cavity-nesting birds are used to excavating their own homes and won’t mind picking out whatever you miss.

, Using a small drill bit, drill completely through the neck near the top of the house so that you can string the gourd onto a string, leather strap, wire, etc. Don’t worry about the wind and rain that will enter the gourd through these holes; in fact, the ventilation will actually make the gourd healthier for its inhabitants.

, Use a 1/8-inch to 3/8-inch (3-mm to 10-mm) drill bit to make the holes.

, Simply find a dowel, twig, or piece of scrap wood that is long enough to accommodate one bird, drill hole underneath the entrance hole with an appropriately sized drill bit, and place the perch inside the hole. You may need to glue the perch into the hole for additional stability; if so, allow plenty of time to pass so that the harsh stink of the glue can dissipate before you hang the nest.


Don’t try to make the nest more accessible than it needs to be. While providing an extra-long perch might seem like a kindness, it actually makes the house more vulnerable to predators, including larger birds.
Clinging birds like chickadees and woodpeckers don’t need perches. This gives them the advantage of having extra-safe entrances. Check to see whether or not your bird can cling to the front of the house before deciding to add a perch.

, Use a fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out rough spots or blemishes. However, don’t expect the surface to look totally even; the naturally uneven texture is part of what gives the gourd house its rustic charm.

, Use an outdoor paint that can take a weatherproofing finish. You can paint the gourd colorfully if you wish; however, note that birds prefer natural, neutral tones.

, Applying a coat of polyurethane, varnish, or Eco-friendly wax to the outer skin to protect the gourd from the elements. If applying a harsh-smelling finish, allow the gourd to air out for a very long time before you hang it; just because you can’t smell it anymore doesn’t mean the birds won’t.

, The exact height and position of the gourd will depend on what bird you’d like to live there. Read the ideal conditions below for ideas.



Tree swallows prefer to be 5 to 15 feet (1.5 to 4.5 m) off the ground in an open area near water.

House wrens prefer to be 4 to 10 feet (1.25 to 3 m) off the ground in a field or thicket.

Carolina wrens prefer to be 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m) off the ground in a field or thicket.

Chickadees prefer to be 5 to 15 feet (1.5 to 4.5 m) off the ground in open woods.

Downy woodpeckers prefer to be 5 to 20 feet (1.5 to 6 m) off the ground in forest openings.

House finches prefer to be 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m) off the ground in backyards.

These should be bottles with straight bottom sections, rather than curved ones. Then, get at least 3' of thick wire, at least 2mm gauge. You will also want sharp scissors, a nail and hammer, and paint.

, Remove the labels and all glue.


Make sure you save the bottle cap for the larger bottle.

, Cut the 1 liter (0.3 US gal) bottle at roughly the halfway point between where the neck widens out and the bottom of the bottle. Keep the lower portion of the bottle.

, Cut the 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle at the widest part of the neck, where it evens out to form the tube of the bottle. Keep the upper/neck portion of the bottle. You can make the edges look fancy, if you like, by cutting a scallop or other pattern.

, Cut a 1.5-2"" hole in the side of the smaller bottle, roughly 1"" up from the top of the feet. Just be sure that it is not less than 1/2"" away from the top edge.

, The bigger bottle will become the roof and the smaller bottle will become the main section of the house. Fit the two together to see how they fit. If the top section overlaps the entry hole or the top looks generally way too big, you will need to trim the edges so that the larger bottle section is shorter and looks more natural as a roof for the house.

, Use the hammer and nail to add holes to the bottle pieces. These will be used to thread the wire through the bottles to hold them together and hang the house.

There will need to be two holes on opposite sides of the smaller bottle. These should be 1/2"" away from the top edge of the bottle and not on the same side as the entry hole.






Now put four holes in the bottle cap. These should not be too close together, nor too close to the edge of the cap.







, Paint the bottle pieces using acrylic, tempera, or any other paint you have on hand. This is a great time in the project to get kids involved. Make the bird's house beautiful! Let the house dry before continuing.


Make sure all of the holes remain open.

, Cut about 1.5' of the wire. Take the wire and thread it through the top of the bottle cap, through any one of the holes. Then thread the wire through the outside of the smaller bottle and then back up through the next hole. Repeat for the other side with a second length of wire.

, Making sure all of the wires ends are even, overlap their ends by about 2"". Then wrap these ends to join them, either with heavy duty tape, wire wrapping, or more wire. You can also bend and twist them to hold together. Now you are ready to hang your bird house!

The definition of Machiavellian or Machiavellianism is ""the employment of cunning and duplicity in statecraft or in general conduct"".,
The best place to start is The prince, Machiavelli's seminal work, and where the idea of Machiavellianism derives.

,
Do some research on both Machiavelli and the times.,
Some believe Machiavelli to be an evil advisor who would encourage the rulers to use torture and other methods to keep power.,
Others believe the prince is a clever piece of satire, as it is written in Italian not Latin.,
Machiavellianism was seen as a foreign virus infecting English politics, originating in Italy, and having already infected France.,
In psychology; Machiavellianism is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to deceive and manipulate others for personal gain.,
In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism.The test is called the Mach-IV test and consists of twenty questions, used to determine one's Machiavellian rating.Go here and have a look: http://personality-testing.info/tests/MACH-IV.php

,
Those scoring above 60 out of a 100 are high Mach's, who endorse statements like, you should only tell the truth if it is in your own interest.

,
Machiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the dark triad, along with narcissism and psychopathy, some go so far as to say it is a sub-clinical form of psychopathy.,
Read about modern Machiavellians and what they have written.,
Read about old Machiavellians like Pol Pot-Cambodian dictator, Stalin-Russian former General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Chairman Mao-First communist leader of China.

",How to Understand Machiavellianism," Remember this, a machiavellian should live by this as a quote for life.;
,, Understand the context which Machiavellianism rose is vital, hint Machiavelli lived during the reign of the Medici family in Florence and was exiled by them.

, Read Prince twice, once looking at it as if this is your advisor and you are king.

, Read the Prince a second time looking at the piece as satire, think to yourself which is more so, advice or satire.

, It was in this context that the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572 in Paris came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the Huguenots. Read up upon the Huguenots and France, how the french monarchy used machiavellian tactics when dealing with the Huguenots.

, Remember that it can also mean this, although it is very similar to the original.

,,, Read up upon the Psychology of Machiavellianism to try to understand what Mach's mind might have been like.

, Than Shwe-Burmese General, Wen Jiabao-Chinese premier, Lord Mandelson-British Politician and Lord.Note all three have power without being subject to the people.

You must believe that God will keep those promises as an act of faith rather than one of sight.As stated in John 3:17-18, ""For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved, by the condemning of his son. He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.""

Simply put, accepting Christ as your Savior and as the Son of God will lead you to salvation.


As stated in Matthew 16:27, ""For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.""

If you live by the will of God—in other words, walking in faith and by faith—you will receive the salvation promised to the believers and followers of Christ.

;
, Walking by sight limits your experience to things that can only be experienced by sight. Once you realize how limiting this is, the benefit of walking by faith can become much clearer.


Imagine what life would be like if you never planned to travel anywhere beyond the destinations you can see from your bedroom window. You wouldn't get very far, and you would be missing out on everything the world had to offer.
Likewise, if you never plan to travel anywhere beyond the tangible realm, you won't get very far and you'll miss out on everything that the spiritual realm has to offer.

, The world can be a frightening place, and sometimes, you may do things out of fear that contradict God's will. If you want to walk by faith, you need to release your fear to God and accept the path He leads you down.


This is easier said than done, of course. You may not be able to become completely fearless, but you can be courageous and learn to act according to God's will even when you are afraid of what lies ahead.

, It's easy to fixate on aspects of your earthly life—finances, possessions, and so one. These things disappear along with the mortal body, though, and have no lasting spiritual value.


A big house or a fancy car are things the world might value, but they won't matter in God's kingdom.
Earthly success is not inherently evil. You can live a comfortable life in a nice home with a good job and still walk by faith. The problem isn't in having these things; the problem is prioritizing these symbols of earthly success over matters of the Spirit.
Instead of focusing on the life before you, focus on unseen realities, like Jesus and Heaven. Center your life around these realities instead of the visible, temporary realities of your earthly life.
Store up treasures in Heaven by doing the will of God, as instructed in Matthew 6:19-20, rather than fussing over the treasures of earth.

, Living your life according to your faith in God will require you to follow God's law above and before the ways of mankind.


God's law can be learned and understood through the study of His Word.
Understand that there are times when the world will try to convince you that something forbidden by God's law is acceptable. Human inclination is follow the ways of the world, but to walk by faith, you need to follow the ways of God. You cannot control the actions of those around you, but as far as your own life is concerned, you must live according to what God has deemed is right and just.

, For those who walk by sight, the actions and beliefs of a person who walks by faith can seem foolish. You'll need to learn to walk on in spite of any criticism you receive from those around you.


God's ways are not humanity's ways. Your natural inclination will be to follow your own understanding and the current philosophy of human society, but doing so will not guide you down the path God wants you to follow. Proverbs 3:5-6 explains, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.""

, Every road has rough patches, and the one you're setting out on now is no exception. The trials you'll face are there to give your journey strength and meaning, though.The trials you face might be self-inflicted or may not be your fault at all.
You might stumble and give into the temptation to do what you know to be wrong, and dealing with the consequences of your actions can make things difficult for a while. Even so, God will not abandon you. He can even use the evils of your hardship for your good if you let Him.
On the other hand, a natural disaster or some other unforeseen, uncontrollable force might rip through your life. God can and will use that tragedy for the greater good, though, as long as you are open to it.

, There might be times when you feel the presence of God very vividly, but there will also be times when you feel a sense of distance between you and God. You need to keep walking by faith through these dark times without waiting for some epiphany or miracle to illuminate your path.Realize that God is always with you, even when you do not feel His presence or understand how He is working in your life through a particular tragedy or disaster. The feeling of being deserted is a matter of human perception and not a matter of truth.
God speaks to the spirit, but while you are still in bodily form, there will be times when the perceptions of the body drown out those of the spirit.
When you are desperate to feel the presence of God but are unable to do so, rely on the promises of Scripture and your past faith experiences to give you strength. Continue to pray and to do the things you know God would have you do.

, You do not need to be a famous evangelist to walk by faith and give glory to God. Simply do the best you can with the tasks and circumstances God has given you.


First Corinthians 10:31 explains, ""Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.""
If something as basic as eating and drinking can be done to the glory of God, more complex aspects of life can be done to the glory of God, as well.
If you're currently a student, study seriously and be the best student you can be. If you're working at an office, be a responsible, ethical, and hard working employee. Be the best son, daughter, mother, father, sister, or brother you can be to your family members, as well.

, To stay committed to a walk of faith, you need to keep talking to God through both the good times and the bad.


If you find yourself forgetting to pray, try scheduling a specific time each day for it—when you wake up in the morning, during your lunch hour, before bed, or any other time when you can get a few minutes of silence and solitude.
You might find yourself forgetting to give praise and thanks during good times even though you have no trouble turning to God for help during times of need. The reverse may also be true. If you have a weak point in your prayer life, focus on strengthening it.

, For the most part, you'll need to walk through life and make decisions based on what you already understand about who God is and what God wants for you. Keep your mind open, however, so that you will be able to interpret messages and signs from God when they do come along.


You might be given direction without even knowing it. When you lose your job, it could be God's way of directing you down a better path. When a relationship ends, it could be God's way of directing you to a healthier relationship or to a goal that could not have been completed if you remained with that individual.

, God will answer your prayers, but the answer may not come in the time frame you would expect it to. Similarly, God will open the right path for you, but that path will only be revealed when God decides that it is the best time for it.


This can be especially difficult when the demands of daily life press down on you. It can be hard, for example, to trust in God's schedule when you can't find a job and have bills to pay. No matter how tough things get, though, try to remind yourself that God is with you through it all and will lead you to where you need to be when you need to be there according to His plan.

, Be thankful for the blessings God has given you. Taking time to notice all the good things in your past and present can strengthen your faith and make it easier to keep walking when the path seems dim.


Giving thanks for the things that are obviously good may seem simple enough, but you also need to give thanks for the trials and roadblocks you face along the way. God wants only the best for you, so even the hardships you face are ultimately there for your benefit.

, Treat all of the good things in your life as the blessings they are. Keep in mind that this includes both obvious blessings and those you may often take for granted.


If you've been unemployed for a long time and the right job suddenly comes your way, it might be an obvious blessing. You should take care of it by working hard and doing your best.
A healthy, working body is a big blessing that many people often take for granted, though. Take care of your body by eating right and doing what you can, within reason, to stay healthy.

, As a disciple of Christ, you have been instructed to serve and spread the love of Christ to others. Doing so pleases God and can be spiritually enriching to you.


Donating money, food, clothing, and other material objects to the needy is one way to serve others.
Serving others also means donating your time to help those around you—loved ones, strangers, and even people you don't like.

, No one can walk this journey for you, but this road is one that can be much easier to follow when in the presence of good company.


Go to church and seek out friends and allies there. Try attending a Bible study or a faith-based group if you need something more than that.
Other believers can help you stay accountable and on the right path. Likewise, you can do the same for them.

"
Know how to recognize a cult.,
Notice the people's isolation from or closed attitudes towards non-members.,
Recognize habits and manners of controlling of new attendees in various ways.,
Watch for extreme repetition (brainwashing) in what seems to be the main thread of belief/the agenda of that groups leaders.,
Observe personality changes as in yourself or in other members.,
Notice how members act over time or directly after going to church.,
Check to see whether the church's messages are not consistent and rational.,
Compare the broad messages of your religion to the suspicious materials and messages of this group.,
Decide whether to leave.",How to Tell if a Church is a Cult," Try to understand the beliefs, attitudes, and actions of your church to compare to these questioned groups, and use discernment to see whether there are teachings that are really offbeat. Cult-like churches may express almost universality/inclusiveness, or conversely very narrow/exclusionary views.;
, Some churches will shun non-members, either in small or larger ways. When you are there, observe whether they are welcoming to you before you are converted, or if you have real questions. Do they only welcome you when you totally agree with their teachings -- but ostracize you if you don't? That is a definite sign of a cult, so keep an eye out for severe discrimination and isolation.


This ""church family"" may be ones only acceptable family. Your biological family would no longer be allowed to take a place in or occupy any part of your new-life, even for visits, special occasions or general pleasantries. A definite red flag. They might totally withdraw fellowship of people who do not fully accept their interpretations.
These churches may discourage outside interaction or have extremely large parts of sermons directed for members only. While some religions do state that small parts of the sermon are for members of the church's religion or denomination only, this does not make that church a cult; however, if, virtually, the entirety of the time spent at the church is for indoctrinated regulars, the church may be a cult.

, Members of cult churches will often be pressured and expected to say, do certain things, act, dress and style only as the group does. The leaders might state that you are not following/understanding, or something of that variety, until you do a certain thing, even if that thing is not stated in the holy book such as The Bible, as necessary for God's purposes, reward or salvation.


They would also forbid exploration of different religious systems almost entirely. They do not encourage you to independently educate yourself on beliefs. Some cult-like churches will focus on the vulnerable, more needy, less-intelligent, uninformed people who may be easier to persuade and control.

, Doctrinal ideas will be repeated, such as almost chanting certain phrases in sermons or lessons so as to manipulate a group mindset on the given points. These phrases may have been taken out of context from a religion's book, such as The Bible or slightly twisted to give a different meaning -- or simply taking off from and made up as if it's a new branch of the religion.


Some churches will inflate self-righteousness and self-assertiveness of members to give an ""I'm right"", judgmental feeling, causing members to only want to associate with those with the same religious beliefs.

, Some churches will manipulate members without the people realizing the drift, or pressure members to do something through bullying. This constant manipulation can cause a member's personality to significantly alter, which is a signal to show that the church is dangerous. For example, a person might have more of an inability to say no to others after being in this church a long time. Churches may reject questioning of their given messages, rather than calmly guiding them to their ""principles"".

, While it's normal for churches to suggest reading the religion's book and praying frequently, cult-like churches will have extreme standards. Members may be expected to pray for hours every day or read the religion's book for long periods of time as well, and putting down those who don't. Certain members will be ""raised"" above others quite significantly and have respect and rights more than other members. They may have to do certain things to save new members -- or else that the ceremony, prayer, etc. will be in vain (but realize that an anointing, a blessing to share with others or correctness of doctrine sought by anyone is fine, not a problem). Because of these pressures to be like the higher ranked ones and meet extreme standards, members tend to have a constant stress to get everything done. The group might also constantly demand very large amounts of money for a tithe -- while requesting a tithe is not cult-like, consistently demanding a very large one is cult-like -- especially to receive praise or to be promoted in status, above the other members for making donations and doing certain works.

, Are they one-sided, primarily to set an agenda, presenting facts very selectively (lying by omission or dividing and narrowing the message) to form a particular viewpoint or doctrine, or to use emotional propaganda? This is often by using loaded messages to produce a gut/visceral impact rather than a logical, balanced response to the broader scope of that faith. The church may be making constant outputs around the area to spread misinformation, frequently by advertising, or going door-to-door to push their specific slice of the broader faith.

, If the messages given in the church are very different/contradict what you have been previously taught, that's a red flag.

, If so, do it peacefully. Do not abuse the members of this belief or act unkindly toward them. If someone questions your decision, simply thank them and state that it was not to your tastes. Be reserved. Do not bother to present an argument which will open you up to being refuted, with possible harassment or abuse.

Seek out experiences, foods, and people who seem foreign to you when they come to town.,
Expand your media diet to include other cultures.,
Invite other cultures into your home.,
Learn a new language.,
Remember that even similar people have cultural differences worth learning about.",How to Understand and Admire Cultural Differences1," In almost every single instance, the only thing required to bridge cultural differences is an introduction. This isn't always easy, but the best thing to do is make an effort -- go to the international folk music festival, eat in a restaurant where English isn't the first language, and say hello to the new family down the street.


Local colleges and universities frequently bring in speakers, artists, and musicians from across the globe, and events are frequently free.;
, Even broadening your television palate can help admire cultural differences. Travel documentaries and news from foreign countries, even just the BBC, will give you a much broader worldview from home. Check out some music in another language from the library, read a book that has been translated, and pay attention to world news, not just American.


No one can understand or pay attention to everything. Follow your interests, looking into and enjoying the new cultures and ideas that spark your interest.

, You can accept travelers or sponsor exchange students. Some people open their homes with apps like Air BnB, while others might work through a church or charity to help provide for new immigrants and traveling groups. Even easier, you can simply invite people from other cultures over for dinner. The best way to understand and admire cultural differences is over food and friendship, so extend an olive branch.


Try a cultural potluck, where everyone must bring food representative of their culture.
Start a music exchange, giving each other the favorites from each culture and then comparing.
Get in touch with your local Rotary club to ask about opportunities to host people from other cultures.

, Language is much more than a simple one-to-one translation from English to something else -- it shows how people think, exposes nuances in cultures and people, and allows you to get much closer to understanding and acceptance of complex cultural ideas. There are many words that cannot be translated smoothly, instead gaining power in their native language and context. These words, such as the Senegalese word ""Tauranga,"" are often those that best illustrate the unique culture in which they were formed.

, You don't have to fly across the ocean to experience different cultures and ideas. Even families across the street have cultural histories and practices that date back through their roots. Communities in the same cities even have markedly different cultural backgrounds. Have you experienced the life of those in the ""worse"" parts of town? Do you know how the upper crust lives in the rich side of town? Don't limit yourself to only those cultures that seem very different -- the best way to expand your horizons is to start at home.

Read about the origin of Stoicism.,
Take to heart the teachings of Zeno that all suffering comes from certain destructive emotions, known as the stoic passions.

,
To achieve true happiness you must control your passions.,
All these are then sub-divided with different destructive emotions for each primary passion.

,
Read and understand Stoic writings based on the time period that they were written in.,
Control your emotions at all time through the right assent of external and internal impressions- this is the Stoic's famous principle.,
Lead a plain and simple life, disdain anything added by the way of decoration.

,
Have a few Laconic tendencies, like Laconic brevity in speech and eating sparingly.

,
Wear simple but comfortable clothes.

,
You should always be familiar with poverty, just in case you became poor.,
Like the Buddhist idea of the universe, believe everything is constantly changing and humans were unimportant; just tiny parts of nature, it is therefore necessary for you to accept fate without fuss.

,
Be happy in all circumstances.,
Prepare and be familiar with death for your life is short, however you must not be fearful, as fear is unbecoming to the stoic.

,Courage of the soul as well as humility and honesty is at the heart of the stoic philosophy, also compassion and solidarity between men

",How to Understand Stoicism," Stoicism is a philosophy from the Graeco-Roman period of classical history. Founded by Zeno of Citium, whose works have now been lost.;
,, The primary passions are distress, fear, lust and delight. These are described as follows by Zeno:

Distress is an irrational contraction, or a fresh opinion that something bad is present, at which people think it right to be depressed.






Fear is an irrational aversion, or avoidance of an expected danger






Lust is an irrational desire, or pursuit of an expected good.





Delight is an irrational swelling, or a fresh opinion that something good is present, at which people think it right to be elated.







,, Most Stoic works have been lost, to learn more about stoic thought read these:


Marcus Aurelius' Meditations' and ""Thoughts to Myself"",Seneca's 'Letters from a stoic' and his 'On the shortness of life'.






John Sellars' 'Stoicism' gives a good history of stoicism, that is easy to read, while comprehensive.






Bertrand Russell's 'A history of western philosophy' also discusses Stoicism, both of these will give you outside opinion of Stoicism.







, Stoic calm has come into the English language from stoicism. Stoic calm is a famously advocated principle by Stoics.

,,,, Stoicism doesn't mean you can't be rich, Seneca was a senator and Marcus Aurelius was an emperor, they merely advocated non-materialism.

,, Stoic's advocated the idea that no matter what happens to you, you are still happy; a stoic saying goes something like this; Full of belly and happy, hungry and happy, well rested and happy, tired and happy, etc.

Visit different houses of worship.,
Take a religious studies class.,
Read many different religious texts.,
Have discussions with different people of different religious faiths.",How to Understand People who Believe in God (for Atheists)1," As an atheist, it’s easy to completely isolate yourself from different religious schools of thought, but this is ultimately not helpful for your growth. Visit as many different religious services as you can and try to form relationships with as many different people as possible.Ask a Christian friend to take you to a Sunday service.
Ask a Jewish friend to invite you to their Shabbat dinner.
Visit a Confucianist temple; Confucianists do not believe in God, so this organized religion may feel more natural for you.
Find a Secular Humanist group near you; Secular Humanism focuses on ethics and reason and not dogma, so it may be more comfortable for you.;
, Prejudice stems from lack of education and if the only religious education you’re receiving is what you read in the news, chances are you will be even less open to understanding people who believe in God.Taking a class is guaranteed to expose you to people of different religious affiliations and beliefs, which can only make you more understanding.
Approach your class with an open mind and do not try to win any class arguments.

, If nothing else, religion and belief in God have shaped much of human history. Reading as many religious texts as possible will help educate you historically and will also help you identify ways in which your own views mirror those of people who believe in God.To better understand Christianity, read the Bible.
To better understand Judaism, read the Torah.
To better understand Islam, read the Qur’an.
To better understand Buddhism, read the Tripitaka.
To better understand Hinduism, read Bhagavad-Gita.
To better understand the Baha’i faith, read Al-Kitab Al-Aqdas.
To better understand Taoism, read the Tao-Te-Ching.
To get an overview of many different religions, read The World's Religions, by Huston Smith., You may have been brought up thinking that discussing religion is rude, but this is actually not the case. The best way to understand people who are different than you is to have open and honest discussions about why and how you disagree.When discussing religion, be aware that listening is just as important as talking.
Be respectful at all times. Just because you respect someone’s point of view does not mean you agree with it.

Get out and see new places, pushing your comfort zone as much as possible.,
Read as much about the local culture as you can before arriving.,
Commit yourself fully to the culture you're in, learning by doing.,
Understand that the first few days of ""culture shock"" will pass.,
Share parts of your own culture and life to encourage others to share theirs.",How to Understand and Admire Cultural Differences2," Go somewhere outside of your town, state or even your country and experience how other people live first hand, as this is the best way to learn about other cultures. That said, not all travel experiences lend themselves to cultural immersion, and some options are better than others:


Volunteer trips frequently stick you right in the middle of the ""action,"" allowing you to get to know locals.
Pre-planned trips can be very touristy, but many of them allow ""home-stays,"" where you get to live with a local family.
The longer you spend in a town, the more of their culture you can begin to appreciate., It is irresponsible, in many ways, to arrive in a new country or state without knowing how things usually run. It is also the best way to get immediately shocked upon landing, which can make it harder to accept the culture later on. Read online, check some books, and generally arrive well-informed. That said, be ready for some shocks or changes in the real world -- but at least having some knowledge beforehand will help with any culture shock. Check especially for:



Culturally Unacceptable Practices: In some cultures, men and women should never touch in public. In some places, a thumbs up gesture is considered rude. If you want to truly understand a culture, you can't accidentally offend it.

Necessary dress and clothing: While shorts are acceptable across America, they are frowned upon in some places. Women, in particular, should pay attention to cultural fashion norms, as they may be strict.

Common greetings and phrases: Even if you don't learn the language, simply greetings can do wonders and open doors to all sorts of cultural experiences., The best way to understand and admire cultural differences is to make yourself a part of them. Help cook meals, go to the local watering holes and join the people at the bar, and take public transport. The longer you give yourself in the culture, the more you will learn and grow. At the very least, make a few friends wherever possible. You'll be surprised how much most people want to meet and talk to foreigners.


Don't try to impose your own culture on others, or try to replicate your culture while abroad. This is the time to go with the flow, becoming a part of the culture instead of trying to stick out of it.

, Culture shock, or the sudden anxiety and worry about being in a completely new place and culture, affects even seasoned travelers. The good news? It is almost always temporary, and the best way to beat it is to push through it. It is natural to feel nervous in a new place, but keeping yourself moving, talking, and learning is the best way to show yourself that it is not so bad. Don't let the first few attempts at understanding deter you -- the difficulty will pass.

, One of the best things to bring while traveling is a set of photos from home, allowing you to bring people into your own life and culture from anywhere. No matter where you are, giving a little bit of yourself is the best way to learn a little bit about others. And learning is the key to understanding and, ultimately, acceptance."
"
Begin from a perspective of study or research, not as a foreigner or outsider.,
Try to understand the context of the differences, not just the differences themselves.,
Find the ""purpose,"" or main aim, of the cultural practices in question.,
Look for the underlying cultural similarities, finding the basic human behavior underneath it all.,
Know that you don't have to love all practices of a culture to accept people at large.",How to Understand and Admire Cultural Differences3," The best way to overcome cultural differences is an open, inquisitive mind. Let yourself wonder why something is happening instead of judging it-- more often than not your initial revulsion or lack of acceptance is the cause of ignorance, not some horrible or unthinkable cultural practice.


Try to look objectively instead of comparing what is happening to how you normally do things. Remember that, for someone unsure of your culture, your methods likely seem odd or weird, too.
Stop thinking about ""right and wrong,"" as there are very few ""right"" ways to do things, especially where unique cultural practices are concerned. Instead, think of the ""why."", There is a custom in many Nordic countries that embraces the cold and dead of winter with gleeful hope, instead of the ""normal"" practice of loving summer and sheltering up during winter. It's strange, but it makes sense in context -- these nations have long, cold, and dark winters, and they've adjusted their cultural mindset accordingly. Their differences are the result of the weather, not some cultural whim.


Remind yourself that culture is a response to the environment, politics, and resources, not something that appears out of thin air. Noting these triggers will help understand them., There are very few things that people just ""do"" without a reason. That reason may be something abstract, like spiritual worship or impressing the other sex, but that doesn't mean it is coming out of nowhere. Every cultural practice, including the more extreme or difficult ones, come from the desire to fix or accomplish something, and figuring out what that is will take you a long way towards understanding and admiring it.


Outside research, asking questions, and careful watching are necessary to get over the immediate shock of certain cultural differences, like walking into a Senegalese house in the fall and seeing a half-skinned goat. However, knowing the religious importance of Tabeski, a local holiday, makes the behavior a lot more understandable., The men of the Xhosa tribe of Africa paints themselves up and dances once a year, hoping to score a date from the women looking on. It's loud, bright, and crazy, but is it really that different from an American club scene, especially when make-up, high fashion, and attempts at dancing are concerned? We are more alike than most people realize, and the impetus for most of our cultural practices is very similar across cultures, even if the manifestation of that impulse is a bit different across the globe., People disagree, and if you've done your best to be open-minded, fill in the gaps in your knowledge, and communicate with others, it is okay if you still disagree or dislike a practice. Women still can't drive in Saudi Arabia, a political choice born out of cultural differences between the sexes. While you can understand where this decision came from (historical sexist practices, certain readings of religious texts, etc.), that doesn't mean you have to accept it. Don't feel like understanding and accepting is the same thing as condoning the behavior. Your job as a traveler is to be open minded, not to agree with everything."

, Often similar edicts are being passed today, and people may not react as they did in the past.

, This can show you how quickly science can change and the impact of scientific advancement on society.


Computers. Personal computers have given common people more resources for managing businesses, designing complicated plans, and storing information that was impossible to do with pen and paper just a few short decades ago.
The Internet. This one development has changed how we view, learn about, and interact with the world on a scale that couldn't be imagined before its acceptance.
Broadcast media. Satellite television makes viewing global events, as well as a vast spectrum of entertainment a daily reality for people almost everywhere.
Communications. Email has displaced verbal communications in many instances, but if you choose to communicate verbally, cell phones allow you to do so even when you are driving down the highway, or working at your job.
Medicine. Major breakthroughs in transplants, artificial organs, molecular biochemistry, surgery, and other realms or medicine are adding years to millions of lives.

, To understand the present, you should be aware of what is going on now. No one can see the whole picture, as in a global scale, simultaneously, but you can educate yourself by reading the news, watching it on television, and for more up to the minute information, using Internet resources.

, Rising oil prices, global warming, threats of pandemics, and terrorist activities threaten the status quo. Improvements in agriculture, medicine, weather forecasting, and industry offer hope for the future, and how we receive, or respond, to these conditions and events in the present will shape the future.

, This is the basis for ""living in the present"", or ""taking one day at a time"". To dwell on past mistakes, or live in fear of the future is a counterproductive use of time, and a certain way of letting uncontrollable circumstances steal your peace.

Take steps to conserve and decrease your contributions to global warming.
Share what you have surplus of, whether it is time, food, clothing, or money. Listening to someone who is hurting or alone can be more valuable in the present tense than giving them the shirt off your back.
Be willing to shoulder responsibility for causes, instead of waiting for the government or a citizen's committee to meet to resolve a problem.

, If you are dealing with pain or loss in the present, it may seem hopeless, but the future remains to be seen, so never give up.

Don’t try to change people.,
Think about the positive benefits of believing in God.,
Set your personal biases aside.,
Respect that there are many different viewpoints inside each religion.",How to Understand People who Believe in God (for Atheists)2," One of the big problems with organized religion is that oftentimes, believers feel compelled to convert non-believers. Atheists are not immune from this. When you meet a person who believes in God, don’t try to explain to them why they shouldn’t. Instead, listen to them when they talk and try to understand where they’re coming from.Remember that your choice to not believe in God is not being challenged by another person’s choice to believe in God.
Use humor to connect with one another and diffuse conversations when they get too confrontational.

, Attending church helps people with their mental health by providing them with a sense of community. While you may not personally believe, understanding that believing in God improves other people’s quality of life may help you understand their choices.Many religions preach forgiveness and forgiveness also correlates with increased mental health.
Believing in God may help your mental health when recovering from medical conditions like cancer and traumatic brain injuries.
Believing in God may also help you when receiving treatment for depression., Religious ideology definitely plays a role in creating conflict and war, but it's not the only perpetrator of violence. Poverty, social inequality and employment stagnation also play major roles.Don’t let your personal biases get in the way of you learning and connecting with people who have different beliefs than you do. Do not let your biases against religion affect the way you feel about religious people.Stop making sweeping generalizations when you talk about people who believe in God. Choose your words carefully and hold yourself accountable for what you say.
Treat people who believe in God with the same respect that you expect as someone who doesn’t.

, There are many different religions out there, and even people who practice the same religion share different beliefs. Be respectful of everyone’s point of view and do not tar different people with the same brush.Remind yourself that just because some people in a religion believe in something doesn’t mean that everyone in that religion believes in that thing.
Don’t use religious extremists as the basis for your arguments. When it comes to believing in God, they are the exception, not the rule.

Practice active listening.,
Make sure you’re both defining God the same way.,
Have a collaborative conversation, not a confrontation.",How to Understand People who Believe in God (for Atheists)3," When talking to someone who believes in God, don’t spend the entire conversation waiting to argue your point of view. Instead, be present for the conversation by listening actively and constructively.When someone tells you something, paraphrase what they just said to show you understand.
Ask questions to move the conversation forward, instead of letting it stall out.
Be empathetic and acknowledge the other person’s feelings.

, Sometimes, different people have different definitions of what God actually is. Before you engage in a conversation with someone who believes in God, make sure you’re both defining God in the same way.Ask the person you’re talking with to clarify what their God entails before getting into a theological discussion.
Check in at different points in the conversation to make sure you’re still on the same page. This will prevent you from arguing over one another.

, Regardless of how persuasive your argument is, the person you’re talking with is probably not going to leave the conversation an atheist. Treat your conversation like a religious exploration and you may both leave having learned something new.Ask questions that challenge your partner’s beliefs, but do so because you’re interested, not because you’re trying to trip them up.
If the other person makes a good point, tell them. Learning about God should not be a competition.

A lot of families now don't get to know each other too well because they're too busy. Plan some family time, like, a movie, or a family game, or even as little as eating dinner together.;
, Your children, your wife/husband are now yours but remember at the end of the day they are also humans. They also have an opinion or suggestion. Sometimes it can be bad or good. Never be angry with someone's opinion, they have their opinions, and no one's perfect.

, No one wants to be ignored just for some meeting or work. Give time to each and every one of them so you can understand every individual properly and this can prevent any misunderstandings in the future.

, Whether its your maid or stepchild, they also deserve love and affection from you as you deserve from your wife/husband or from your own child. Treat everyone like you would want to be treated, and getting along with your family should be easy

,, Scolding can be good for them but never overdo it.

Talk about the behavior.",How to Handle Older Relatives Who Have Lost Their Filter," You might be shocked or surprised to hear your relative saying something outrageous or crude. When your relative loses their filter, don’t react in shock, anger, or even ridicule. Gently let your relative know that their behavior is inappropriate and move on. There’s no need to bring up an incident once it has passed and you’ve dealt with it in the moment.For example, say, “It’s not appropriate to speak of people in that way. We do not talk like this.”
In some cases, it may even be appropriate to ignore the comment and not respond at all. However, this may not be a good strategy for someone who is suffering from a cognitive decline.;
, If the situation is uncomfortable, gently guide your relative somewhere else. Speak calmly and directly to your relative as you travel elsewhere. You may also notice certain situations that target their inappropriate behavior and divert their attention prior to them seeing something or someone.If you know your relative has a tendency to say inappropriate things during certain events or situations (like being in a large crowd or around young children), guide them away ahead of time to prevent the situation from unfolding.
For example, if your relative is saying something racist while at the grocery store, direct them to a different aisle or exit the store.

, If you’re feeling like the stress of dealing with your older relative is getting to be too great, take a quick break to de-escalate. Take a walk or go outside and get some fresh air. If you’re getting frustrated with your relative or need some time to cool off, remove yourself from the situation temporarily.Excuse yourself from the room and go somewhere else. You may wish to prepare a snack to help you get away and return later.

, Relatives have a way of saying things when others are nearby. It’s up to you how you handle the situation. You can apologize for their behavior (“I’m so sorry my aunt said that to you”), clue them in, (“Sometimes my grandmother says inappropriate things due to her dementia”), or laugh it off (“All those years of embarrassing my uncle as a kid have come back on me!”). However you choose to handle the situation, think about what your relative would want.


For example, if your relative has always valued privacy, they may not appreciate you saying things about their condition to strangers. However, if your relative has often valued humor and lighthearted joking, consider taking the statements in stride when out in public.

, If your relative is going on and on about something offensive or inappropriate, move their attention to something else. You may want to change the subject or have them look at something. Come to them with some photos or change the subject to a topic that interests them. Say something funny or introduce a joke.Say, “That’s enough, let’s look at photos of the grandchildren.”
You can also say, “Oh, I heard a funny joke yesterday. Would you like to hear it?”

, One way to redirect attention can be through touch. Especially if your relative is shouting, yelling, or screaming, they may be having difficulty expressing how they feel. They may be in pain or feel uncomfortable. Use a light touch to help calm them and help them feel safe.


You may want to offer a small treat to help them feel safe and to enjoy something. This can include toffee or some small candy that your loved one enjoys.You can even incorporate their sense of smell, such as by placing some essential oils in an oil infuser. Try using a calming scent like lavender or rose oil.
Colors and lighting can also be calming as well. Try using soft colors and dim lighting to create a calm atmosphere in the person’s room.

, Guide them to something they can do unassisted or that they feel independent doing, such as coloring or playing with the dog. The activity should be familiar and recognized by your relative, not a new or complicated activity.Say, “We’re going on a walk now, would you like to join?” You can also say, “Let’s put the dishes away.”
If in private, place a soft object in their hand that they can throw without hurting someone. Often, people will divert their focus onto the object and away from their words. Consider using a small stuffed animal or a soft ball.
If in public, talk about something your relative enjoys discussing. Say, “I’d like to bake a dessert when we get home. What should we bake?”

, Sometimes a secondary condition may be responsible for odd behaviors. Certain health or mental diagnoses can cause problems, or medications may interact with your relative’s behavior. See a physician to rule out any problems related to health that can influence their behavior.Let the physician know that your relative’s behavior has changed and how it has changed. Note how long the behaviors have existed and if they appear to be linked to any changes regarding their health.
Often, changes to personality and behavior can be an indication of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.Look for other indicators such as memory loss, decline in the ability to solve problems, confusion with time or locations, and changes in personality or mood., It is important to know what to look for to keep your elderly loved one safe. Some warning signs that they might need professional help include:


Changes in their body language. For example, the person may change their posture, their gestures, the physical distance between themselves and people they are talking with, their facial expressions, or tone of voice. Watch for any significant changes in the person’s body language.

Environmental factors. Consider whether they are different in one environment or around certain people. Does removing them from the environment help? Does incorporating soothing scents, sounds, or colors help?

Not getting basic needs met. Consider whether their basic needs are being met. Are they cold, hot, hungry, thirsty, or in pain?

Changes in communication/behavior after a medical diagnosis. If this person has dementia or Alzheimer’s, consider whether they were able to express certain things to you before, but they are not able to do so now. How did they behave before? What was their behavioral baseline before you noticed this change? Did anything help them or make matters worse?

, If your relative’s behavior becomes increasingly out of control, you may start to feel uncomfortable or unsafe. If words or behaviors become abusive or dangerous, seek outside help from a therapist or other behavioral specialist. You may need to consider ways to feel safer or talk about ways to calm your relative’s anger. A home health nurse can help, as elderly people tend to be harsher with family and not strangers.A therapist can work with you and your family to help find strategies to cope more effectively.

, Your relative’s words may embarrass you or really hurt you. It’s hard not to take things personally, but keep in mind it is likely not their intention to hurt you or embarrass you. Focus on positive things and less on the negatives. If you do become upset, excuse yourself and spend some time removed from the situation.Especially if the behavior is new and out of character for your relative, do your best to say to yourself, “These words are hurtful, but do not reflect how my relative feels about me.”

, If your relative’s words or behaviors make you upset or uncomfortable, consider talking to them about it.Let them know that their words are inappropriate or unkind. Say, “When you speak to me like that, it hurts my feelings. Please do not insult me or the work I do for you.”


If talking gets you nowhere, decrease the activities you do for them. This can send the message of “treat me nicely and with kindness and I will continue to graciously help you.”

Decide how frequently table time will take place, for how long, what day it will be on and where the meetings will be situated.,
Tell each family member about when and where table time will take place.,
Write 'table time' in on the calendar so that nobody forgets.,
Leave a space in a central area of the house where people can write things to discuss.,
At the allotted time take the whiteboard to the place where you are going to have table time.,
At the end of the agenda; ask your family if there is anything else they would like to discuss or add to anything you have discussed.",How to Have a Table Time for the Day," Make sure it is a time that every member of the family can make, and that it is convenient in general; there's no use trying to schedule meetings when your sister is in a rush to get to dance class or your mother is trying to write a shopping list.;
, Make sure it is alright with everyone - if not it's a good idea to try to reschedule, as it is important that everyone tries to be there.

, If you have separate space for each family member write it across everybody's schedule, so that they cannot schedule anything over it by accident.

, A whiteboard is a good idea for this as people can add and remove things as they wish. Stick it up on a wall and leave a pen nearby. This way everyone can add to the agenda and all take part in shaping the meeting.

, Wait for all the family members and then discussing the things that are on the agenda.


Make sure to listen to every family member who wants to share their opinion, and ask anyone who hasn't given theirs what they think. Don't force a family member into speaking, though; they may prefer to stay silent when some things are discussed, but encourage them all the same.
Try to come to a good conclusion about everything on the agenda. Make sure that there are no negative feelings left in the air, and offer solutions to any problem that may arise. Being able to resolve problems like this will encourage family members that table time is a great time to find solutions to things.

, If not table time is over and you may all go back to your previous activities, hopefully feeling a lot closer and positive about family life. Make sure that you let your family know when the next meeting will be and ensure that this is alright with them. Communication is key.

Stay calm.",How to Handle Conflict About Not Visiting Family on Your Vacation1," When deciding how to talk to your family or partner about the vacation, choose a location that is not noisy. For instance, do not talk to your family or partner when they are watching TV or talking on the phone. Talking during dinner, for instance, might be a good time to discuss visiting family on your vacation., Pay careful attention to their words. Nod, lean forward, and make eye contact to show you’re listening. Be active when listening. If you have questions or want clarification about something your partner or family says, don’t be afraid to ask.Rephrase what your partner or family member says occasionally so as to ensure you’re understanding their main argument in favor of visiting family on your vacation.
For instance, if you have a partner, they might say, “Our vacation will take us very close to where my family lives and it would be easy for us to visit them.” You might sum up their statement by asking, “Oh, so you think it would be pretty convenient for us to visit your family on vacation?”
Encourage your family to share with you exactly what their problem is with you not visiting them on your vacation.Say things like “I’m really interested in why it’s so important that I visit you, my family, during my vacation.”

, Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. In other words, imagine the situation from their perspective. If the conflict is between you and your partner, ask yourself how you’d feel if you wanted to see your family on vacation and they did not want to. If the conflict is between you and your family, ask yourself how you would feel if they did not want to visit you on their vacation.Try not to see the discussion as a contest. Just because you and your family (or you and your partner) have different ideas about how to spend your vacation doesn’t mean that either of you loves the other any less.If you have a partner, think about their reasons for not wanting to visit family during your vacation.Perhaps, for instance, they’d prefer to spend their vacation relaxing by the beach because their company had a tough quarter and they want to relax. Perhaps your partner does not enjoy spending time with your family. Maybe your partner thinks that you visit your family too often, and wants to make the vacation a time when the two of you can connect without the pressures of either your family or theirs.

, Take your partner’s concerns or your family’s concerns seriously and help them find an alternative. Express agreement with things your partner or family says that you agree with.For instance, if your partner says they want to see their parents, you might say, “I can tell you really want to see your parents. Let’s visit them together after the vacation.”
If a family member says, “I am very sick and getting older. I would like to see you during your vacation,” you might reply, “That’s true. I will visit you once my vacation is concluded.”

, For instance, don’t say to your family, “You don’t need to see me on my vacation.” If your partner suggests using vacation time to see their parents, don’t say, “You don’t need to see them.”, Are you uninterested in visiting family on vacation because they constantly criticize you? Is it because they are always yelling and fighting? Or is it simply because your vacation is relatively brief? Whatever the reason, identify it and explain it to your family.Be clear and concise when explaining your feelings. For instance, do not say to your family, “I have this feeling as though I might not want to visit you during vacation. I’m not sure. I can’t really explain it.” Instead, try saying, “I feel that I would be happier spending my vacation in China rather than visiting family.”
You might find that a story is the best way to explain why you feel that you’re uninterested in visiting family on vacation.For example, you might begin your explanation by saying, “Do you remember the last time I visited you on vacation? The baby threw up everywhere and I was struck by a car. It was terrible. I don’t want to relive that or risk a repeat episode.”

, Instead of blaming your family by saying “My vacation is always about you,” or blaming your partner by saying, “Our vacations are always about you. You’re too selfish,” explain your feelings in terms of your own experience. Use “I” language in the form of “I would rather not spend time with family on our vacation” or — if addressing your family — saying “I would prefer not to visit you on my vacation.”Do not make generalizations. Avoid using words like “always” and “never,” and phrases like “all the time” or “every time.”
For instance, avoid saying “You always get your way when go on vacation.”
Before speaking, think about how your words might sound to your partner.

, If your goal in the conversation is to convince your partner to visit your family on vacation, do not get derailed talking about the sorts of events or activities you wish to do during your vacation (unless, of course, this impinges directly on the argument you’re making in favor of bringing your family along.) If your goal is to convince your family that you have the right to spend your vacation as you wish, do not get derailed by conversations about how you are ungrateful because they raised you and paid your way through university.For instance, if you say, “I would prefer not to visit family on my vacation” and your family says “But I visited you when I was on vacation,” simply say, “Yes, and we had great fun. However, that was your choice. I choose to spend my vacation differently.”

, When trying to convince your family or partner to see your side of things, be specific. Don’t use vague statements like “Someday I would like to visit my family during our vacation.” Instead, say, “We’ve visited your family four times in the last four months. Don’t you think it’s only fair that we visit my family on this vacation?”, When in conversation with your partner or family, do not yell or use foul language. Always be respectful and mature when talking to your family or partner. Speak to them as you wish to be spoken to. Do not strike or lash out at your family or partner.Breathing exercises are useful for remaining calm. If you feel yourself getting stressed, close your eyes and breathe in for three seconds through your nose. Exhale for five seconds through your mouth. Repeat until you feel more relaxed.
If emotions are running high and you feel that you or your partner/family are getting too stressed, take a break. Say, for instance, “This seems to be getting us nowhere. Let’s talk more about this later.”"

Make tasks fun.,
Give choices.,
Create a routine.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Handle Small Kids1," Since small children are constantly making messes and dirtying their clothes, it's easy to feel like your house is always a wreck. If you want your child to help you keep things tidy, make chores or simple tasks into a game. Avoid just telling your child that he has to clean something up. You may need to help him or get him started. You can also make challenges or chores into races where you compete.For example, get a large bucket and help your child toss toys into it. You might encourage your child to find all of the blocks or balls to throw in. This will help him learn to sort and makes cleaning more interactive.
Make chores a competition between several kids. This will make it seem more like a game.;
, Kids like feeling as though they have some control or power over things. If you give your child an option, he'll feel as though he's in control of the situation and he'll be less likely to disobey or throw a tantrum. For example, you might tell your child he can select his pajamas to get ready for bed or he can pick out what story he'd like to listen to before bedtime.When giving small kids options, keep them simple or your child might become overwhelmed. Also, give your kid a chance to make the decision.
If you're caring for several kids, ask ""who wants to help me with this project?""

, Small children don't have a sense of time like adults do. But, they do have a sense of routine. Knowing what comes next and what to expect during the day can be comforting. You don't need to plan out detailed activities for every hour of the day. But, a loose routine will give your kid a sense of security which can improve his behavior and create good habits.For example, a loose bedtime routine might include getting pajamas on, brushing teeth, snuggling while reading stories, and bed.
When handling more than one child, it can help to coordinate their nap schedules so that they both get rest and you get a break.

, Don't wait for your child to do something naughty before talking about appropriate behavior. Instead, catch your child doing something good and praise him for it. Kids respond better to positive reinforcement than punishment. Just be sure to use specific praises or your child might start tuning it out.For example, if your child wipes up a spill, you could say, ""Good job cleaning up after your mess!""
Avoid chastising one child by pointing out how good another child is. This will just make one kid resent the other one.

Keep your relationship respectful and positive.",How to Get Your Cousin to Like You," Re-establishing contact with your cousin will put you on the right path to gaining her trust and getting her to like you.Keep your first messages simple so that you do not overwhelm her, nor she you.


There are different ways to reach out to your cousin, including a letter, an email, or a phone call. Social media is also an option: You could (re)friend her on Facebook or follow her on Instagram. Even this small gesture helps break the ice and pave the way for further communication.
Start with a simple message, such as, ""We used to be so close and I have missed you. It would be great to be in contact more frequently if you like."" This kind of message lets her know your feelings and puts the ball in her court regarding further contact.
Do not mention previous problems or any family issues. There is a time and a place to bring up these matters and generally both of you will know when you are ready to open up about them.Do not insult or berate her in any way. If you do not have anything nice to say, it may be best to wait until you can treat her positively and with respect.
If you do not have your cousin's contact information, ask family members or use an online search engine such as Google to find her email address or phone number.;
, There are two parts to being a good communicator: Speaking and listening. Talk with your cousin and listen to what she has to say. This will show her that you are serious about her and your relationship.Be consistent in your communications. Once you have reestablished contact with your cousin, be consistent in your communications. This does not mean you have to respond to messages or calls immediately, but having regular contact will build trust between you.
One of the most important components of gaining your cousin’s trust is by listening to her. Show her that her interests and problems are important to you.For example, if she is having trouble in school or with friends, talk to her about her feelings and help her find a solution to the problem.
Sharing secrets with one another will also help gain your cousin's trust. Just make sure not to tell anyone her secrets because this may lead to conflict., Make your cousin feel comfortable and relaxed when you are talking or spending time together. Being respectful of her and flexible in your own behavior will help gain her trust and get her to like you more.Your cousin may have different beliefs and values than you. Respect and appreciate those differences to show that you’re serious about your relationship.Being respectful includes not insulting your cousin or her family members. Taunting or tattling on her or telling her secrets to others is also a sign of disrespect., Once you’ve had a chance to establish consistent contact with your cousin, suggest meeting in person. Avoid doing this at a family gathering, however, which can be very stressful and exacerbate problems.


Keep your first meetings simple. Suggest coffee, lunch, a movie, or sporting event. You can meet for longer periods once you have had a chance to see each other in shorter spans.

, Listen to what your cousin says and draw on threads from conversations in your interactions with her. This shows that you pay attention to what she says and are genuinely interested in her and your relationship.One of the best ways to show interest in your cousin is to ask her questions. They can be as simple as “do you like to…” to asking her to explain something about her education or where she lives., A good way to build your friendship with your cousin and get her to truly like you is to find your commonalities. These will give you a starting point for your interactions.On the surface it might seem as though you and your cousin do not have much in common. But if you keep your contact consistent and ask her questions about herself, you are likely to find things that both of you have in common, from something as simple as personality traits to similar hobbies.For example, maybe you both like to play online games or enjoy Pinterest. You could set up a match against one another or follow her Pinterest boards.
You can use not having many commonalities to benefit both of you. This may give each of you a different way to look at the world or introduce you to new activities that you enjoy.For example, if your cousin loves hiking and you have never really been hiking, consider a hike together. You might enjoy it and even if you do not, it will still help her like you more because you’re open to new experiences., Talking to your cousin as often as your schedules permit will build your relationship significantly. By keeping your conversations positive and light, you will laugh often and strengthen your relationship even more.Social media has made it easier to stay in contact with cousins. You can find different ways to stay in touch with your cousin on websites such as Facebook and Twitter.
The prevalence of cell phones has made it easier to send text messages. You can send either traditional text messages or use free messaging services such as Viber and What’sApp.
Online video chatting, through applications like Skype or FaceTime, also make it easy to stay in touch in a much more personal way.
Remember to stay positive and respectful. Do not insult or willingly hurt her. If you do accidentally hurt her, apologize and move on.

, Spending and having a good time together at different activities helps not only build your relationship, but also trust.Making your cousin laugh or laughing at something funny she does will help get her to like you. Everyone loves a person who makes others feel happy.
Be flexible in what you do. You won’t necessarily like every activity your cousin suggests or likes, as she won’t necessarily have the same taste as you. But being flexible will help build your relationship. Your cousin should be as respectful of your choices, too.Make sure to spend time together outside of family gatherings. They can often be stressful and create unwanted drama in relationships., It’s natural for there to be periods when you won’t be in very close contact with your cousin or be able to get together. But even sending a simple message such as “hey there, hope you’re doing well” lets her know that she’s important to you.


Stay in touch with your cousin on websites such as Facebook and Twitter.
Call or text her. You can send either traditional text messages or use free messaging services such as Viber and What’sApp.
Online video chatting, via applications like Skype or FaceTime, also make it easy to stay in touch in a more personal way.

, Beyond staying in contact, it’s good to show your cousin that you care about her. There are many simple ways to do this from remembering her birthday to offering to help with a problem.Remembering important dates to your cousin will help maintain your relationship. Write down birthdays, anniversaries, and event important upcoming events so that you send your cousin wishes on these dates.
Offering to help your cousin, when she has a problem or otherwise, also shows that you still care about her. This can be as simple as babysitting when her regular sitter cancels, helping her with homework, or helping her shop for a special item of clothing., It’s normal to have ups and downs in any relationship, but by keeping your behavior towards your cousin respectful and largely positive, you’ll be able to maintain your relationship long term.You’ll occasionally have negative emotions or moments in any chat or interaction. Do your best to handle these situations in a calm and respectful manner and then move on.
Avoiding family drama will help you to keep the relationship with your cousin respectful and positive."
"
Avoid situations in which you will be worn down.,
Allow yourself to feel confident and empowered by your decision.,
Get in the habit of sticking to your decisions.,
Divide your vacation into steps.,
Don’t let your family control you.,
Use your imagination to think about something else.",How to Handle Conflict About Not Visiting Family on Your Vacation2," If you are talking to your family and they continue to bring up the fact that they’d very much like you to visit them during your next vacation, you might give in to their pressure. To keep this from happening, take a break from spending time with family members who do not respect your decision to not visit family on vacation.For instance, if you and your father are talking on the phone and he says, “It would be great if you’d visit me during your upcoming vacation,” reply simply, “Thank you, but I’ve decided to go elsewhere for my vacation.”
If he continues to pressure you, say, “It was nice seeing you, but I’ll be heading home now.”

, You may be tempted to feel guilty or like you've done something wrong by not spending your vacation visiting family, but try to focus on the fact that you made the decision that was best for you, even though it was hard. Remind yourself that you are not responsible for the reactions of others — if you family chooses to take offense to your decision, that is a shame, but it's not your fault.

Family or not, no one should be making you feel guilty for the choices you make — especially a trivial one such as where you want to spend your hard-earned vacation time.

, Willpower is like a muscle. If you exercise it frequently, your ability to stick to your decisions and remain strong in the face of difficulty will increase. If you’re easily swayed by the desires and commands of others, you will have a hard time being resolute in your choice to not visit your family on vacation.To get in the habit of saying “No” and sticking to it, make more difficult decisions and follow through on them.
For instance, if you are dieting, you might decide, “I am not going to have dessert because it will not help me meet my dieting goals.” Follow through on this decision and deny yourself dessert.

, You’ll have better luck sticking to your decision to not visit your family on vacation if you move toward that goal one step at a time. For instance, you can imagine your vacation as a process consisting of steps like making hotel reservations, booking a flight, deciding what sights to see, packing your bag, heading to the airport, and boarding your flight.As you accomplish each step along the way, you’ll begin to see that your decision to not visit family on vacation is much closer to becoming a reality.

, Once you’ve decided not to visit your family, stick to your decision. If, for instance, your parents call you frequently to try and change your mind — or if your in-laws call trying to pressure your partner to change their mind — be strong. Say simply, “No, we’ve decided that we will not have enough time during our vacation to visit.”If they are calling to the point of extreme, let the call go to voicemail. Then you can choose a time to call them back when you feel confident and ready to talk.
Remember that you don't have to tell your extended family that you are even taking a vacation. You don not need to feel obligated to tell them about your decisions.
Don’t let yourself feel guilty for doing what you want. Remember, it’s your life.

, If the conflict about not visiting your family vacation is hanging heavy on your shoulders, you might find it hard to think about anything else. But if you open your imagination, you’ll find that you can use it to strengthen your will and stick to your decision.Try imagining that your family supports your decision not to visit them during your vacation. These thoughts will help you relax and make it easier to remain resolute in the face of the conflict.
You might find other ways to distract yourself from the conflict, too. For instance, you might curl up on the couch with a good book or view a film at your local movie theatre.

"
"
Solve the conflict together.,
Invite the family along.,
Recognize that you won’t always be able to please your family.,
Avoid making your partner the enemy.,
Forgive your family.,
Consider how you grew as a result of the conflict.,
Recognize that your family is imperfect.",How to Handle Conflict About Not Visiting Family on Your Vacation3," Once you understand why your family so values your visit — or why your partner so values the two of you visiting their family — you can either reiterate your own reasons for not wanting to visit family on your vacation or decide to agree that visiting family is a good use of your vacation time. Ideally, you’ll be able to solve the conflict by compromising with your family or partner. For instance, instead of visiting family for four days on your vacation, you only visit them for two.If you compromise and they still complain and continuously try to make you feel guilty — for instance, that two days wasn't nearly enough time — kindly and gently express to them that a short visit is better than no visit. You might say something like, ""Yeah, the two days did go by pretty fast. I'm just glad our schedule allowed us to visit — for a while it didn't seem like we would be able to see you at all.""
You may need to have a couple conversations with all interested parties about the decision to visit or not visit family during your vacation. If the other party is very upset and even obsessing over the situation, tell them you will continue the conversation later and give them some space to calm down. This will also afford you the opportunity to gather yourself and recommit yourself to your decision.

, Instead of visiting family on your vacation — either yours or partner’s — invite them to tag along. If you have a partner, check with them to see if such a situation would be amenable. For instance, if your family is going to Cape May but your partner wants to visit their family during vacation, ask them if they’d like to invite their family to Cape May., Your family might say they’re disappointed or upset that you won’t be visiting. If this occurs, remember that you cannot always make everyone happy. Your family will get over it, given enough time.If you know that you won’t be spending your vacation with your family, don’t suggest that you will think about it or that there is a possibility that you will.
Remember, your family will still love you even if you don’t visit them during your vacation.

, If you have a significant other, make a decision with them before talking to your family. Then, let your parents or other relevant family members know your decision. If your parents, for instance, ask if it was your partner’s decision to go on vacation without visiting them, simply say, “We made the decision together.” This will avoid giving your parents a reason to dislike your partner., Forgiveness means letting go of pain or frustration. When your family caused a conflict about how you went on vacation without visiting them, you might be quite irritated. But holding onto your pain and frustration about the conflict will prevent you from ever actually getting over it.Decide if you want to tell your family member that you’ve forgiven them. If the conflict over your decision not to visit your family on vacation caused a significant rift between you, you might want to call them or talk to them directly to let them know that you forgive them. You might say, for instance, “I forgive you for your part in the conflict that ensued over the fact that I did not visit you on vacation.”If you believe you also had a role in causing the conflict about not visiting family on vacation, you might add, “I hope that you can forgive me, too.”

, When you were in conflict with your family over the fact that you didn’t visit them on vacation, you probably learned something that could help you avoid conflict or understand yourself better. For instance, perhaps this was the first time you ever did something your family disapproved of. This might make you realize that you are a strong person.Whatever your case may be, reflect on what you learned about yourself and your family through the conflict.

, Whether you were in a conflict with your partner, parents, or another family member, remind yourself that they are only human. You could do this by saying to yourself, “They are only human, and therefore flawed, as am I.” "

Control your reactions.,
Put yourself in your child's position.,
Calm the child.,
Get help.",How to Handle Small Kids2," Your small child depends on your for emotional and physical well-being. If you hit, yell, or use foul language when talking to your child, you'll terrify your child and could cause long-lasting damage.While you still might get angry, tell yourself not to punish or deal with your small child until you're calm. Always avoid hitting or threatening your child.


If you find yourself yelling at your child, try whispering instead. Some teachers say that whispering actually makes the children more likely to listen and pay attention to what you're saying.Small kids look to each other to determine how they feel. So, if you yell at your toddler, your baby might actually start crying.

, Try to relate to what your child is going to. This is useful whether you're frustrated, bored, or trying to have fun with your small kid. Ask yourself what your child must be seeing, thinking, or feeling. Remember that many situations that seem normal to you might be new, frightening, or overwhelming to your small child.


Hunger, thirst, and sleep are also big factors in your child's temperament. If you notice your child suddenly becoming whiny, consider if he may need a snack or a nap.Remember to watch how each child is doing. If you notice one kid become quiet or upset, pull him aside and ask him how he's feeling.

, If your small kid gets worked up easily and is prone to temper tantrums, try to relax him. Ask him to sit near you and read a story. Or, play some calming music. Put on some of your kid's favorite music to help improve his mood.Sometimes, just sitting near your child and connecting with him will make him feel better and can make him more likely to listen to you.

, If you still feel like you don't react or deal with your child the way you'd like, or you find yourself still losing your temper, you might want to talk to a doctor or therapist. Sometimes, talking about your frustrations and expectations with a trained therapist can help you learn to handle childcare situations better.If your child is in school, you might want to discuss your situation with your kid's teacher or the school counselor.
If you're struggling to handle more than one kid, consider putting one of them in a preschool or playschool for a few days a week. This can give you some one-on-one time with another child, or at least give you a little break.

"
"
Show love.,
Spend time with your kids.,
Listen.,
Expose them to new experiences.",How to Handle Small Kids3," Your child will learn to treat himself as you treat him, so showing love is important. This doesn't mean that you should let your child do whatever he wants. Set boundaries and enforce them so that that your small kid knows what to expect. Show your love however you can. Some people give hugs, others provide a good home, and some give their attention.Don't expect to be the perfect parent or caregiver. There will be times where you're frustrated with your children. Accept the frustration and know that things will get easier.

, You don't have to carve out a large chunk of your day to dedicate to your small children. You can actually make small moments count and show your kids that you're interested them. You might sit together and read stories, play silly games, or just work on making snacks together. The point is to encourage your children to do things alongside and with you.If you cook with your child, be sure to do it at his level. Work on a low table or bring a high-chair over to a counter so he can help you prepare food.
Small kids love when adults act goofy. Surprise your small child by making faces or dancing.

, Take the time to listen to whatever it is your kids want to tell you or talk about. Stop what you're doing and really engage with them. Try getting down on their level, make eye contact, put away your cell phone, and hear what they're saying. Your kids will feel valued and communication between you can improve.If your child has a hard time talking or describing things, you can always ask open-ended questions to get him talking.

, New experiences and playing are how small children learn about their world. As a parent or caregiver, you should give your small kids things to explore. For a very young child, you might give toys that develop his senses (like balls, rattles, or soft animals). For somewhat older small children, take them to a museum, a nature park, or zoo.Kids like activities where they can create something, run around, or explore something new.

Leave instructions with trusted neighbors about what to do, and how to contact you in the case of an emergency.,
Check your outside/yard space as well.,
Keep your travel documents in a travel wallet.",How to Get Ready to Leave the House," If you typically worry that you're leaving important things behind, from keys to documents, then pack such items well ahead of time. This might be the night before, or it could mean getting up extra early; go with the time that suits you best.


Have a decent carry bag for all of your items. Make use of pockets, divisions, etc. The inside of the bag can act as a reminder of what needs to go where, helping you to remember when something is missing.;
, Have permanent lists typed up on your computer or digital device. Place these lists in their own folder, for ease of retrieval. Check the relevant list each time you leave the house, to ensure that you've taken what you need. It is important to vary the lists by day, task or action. For example:


Have a list for your routine work or studies
Have a list for sports and hobby activities
Keep a list for your pets, such as what you need to grab when taking the dog to the beach or local hiking trail, etc.
Have a special list for weekends away, vacations, and other travel (see below for more on vacation lists)
Have a list for special visits, such as going to see a loved one in hospital or a caring facility, attending a party, going to a work function, etc.

, If you tend to forget things such as keys, your phone, your wallet, etc., make a special area for them near the front area, keeping them in one place so that they're easy to access. Always return the items to this place so that you never have to worry about where they are before leaving the house.

, This allows you to do a final check of how you're dressed and groomed. If you spot anything that doesn't look right, you can make a note of it and return to remedy it quickly. Have all family members get used to doing this as a matter of course.

, Ensure that everyone knows they have the responsibility to ensure that they take what they need. This takes the pressure off any person who feels responsible for everyone else's belongings and needs as well.


Remind all family members that when they forget something, it's a learning experience rather than an excuse to have someone else chase it up for them (with exceptions for vital items and genuine mistakes, of course).

, Depending on what your house has, and on the particular requirements for the home, here are some of the questions you might need to ask yourself each time you leave the house:


Is the stove/oven off?
Are the pets fed for the day and put away where they are meant to be?
Are all the windows closed/locked/semi-open, etc.?
Are all of the external doors locked?
Are the electrical items, that must be off, turned off?
Are notes for the kids, heat-up meals or other necessities being placed where they should be?

, Using a checklist is recommended if you're forgetful or fretful. Check off each action as you perform it; this will help to direct your actions to doing the things you know need to be done, freeing you up to get on with leaving the house without worrying.

, Unless someone is at home, always remember to lock the door as you leave. If you don't lock the door when no one else is home, you are potentially leaving it open to intruders.


It can be helpful to have a bag stand next to the front door, on the outside, to allow you to put down whatever you're carrying and lock the door without weights hanging off your arms.

, These are very important, especially if you suffer from travel anxiety, tend to rush at the last minute or get easily distracted by other people's needs when packing, etc.


Have a list of things that have to be packed. Ask other family members to make their own; if they tend to forget things, do a read-over of their list early on and make any suggestions that are missing.
Have a list of last-minute to-dos, with a check-off column.
Have a list of things that need to be checked around the house, again with a check-off column. See the previous section for the sorts of things to look for and check.

, This gives you plenty of time to focus on the things that matter, such as checking travel documents, tidying up the house, ensuring that the house is locked up securely, etc.

, This will provide you with peace of mind, and helps you to get out of the house on time. Check to make sure that windows and doors are locked, valuables are out of sight and away, faucets are turned off, unneeded electrical items are turned off, etc.


Make sure that the safe has been closed properly.
Make sure that all of your appliances are either switched off or working properly.

, Give someone you trust a key to your place, and ask them to go in and check things are okay if something happens, such as the power going off or seeing something that's amiss.

, Check the security of your perimeter fencing, gates, etc. and put away garden tools and other items. All of this will help to secure your house and get out of the house smoothly.

, This will ensure that everything is in one place, and that you can find all the things that you need with ease. Be sure to pack this before you leave.

Check with your judicatory or a religious authority for specifics.Each denomination has its own guidelines governing the way that oil is blessed for anointing purposes, as well as the way that anointing oil is used.,
Obtain olive oil.,
Place a small amount of oil in a vial.,
Pray a blessing over the oil.,
Store the oil at room temperature.,
Understand the true power behind anointing oil.,
Anoint yourself.,
Anoint others.,
Use anointing oil in your home.,
Note a few traditional uses.Anointing oil has roots that date back to biblical times.",How to Anoint Oil,"


The most common restriction regards who may bless or anoint the oil. In some denominations, only a priest or similar clergyman can bless the oil. Some denominations even limit which clergymen are authorized to consecrate oil.
It is also important to note that some denominations also have guidelines and laws concerning how the oil should be consecrated and how it can be used afterward.
Other possible rules may include those governing how the oil is obtained and the oil you are allowed to use.;
, You can use plain or scented olive oil, but it should be olive oil either way since it has greater traditional and biblical significance than other types of oil.


Unless you are told otherwise by a religious authority, it is not necessary to buy special oil for anointing.
Extra-virgin cold-pressed olive oil is the purest variety available, so many people prefer to use that when shopping for an anointing oil. You can find this oil in the vast majority of grocery stores.If desired, you can buy scented olive oil from a religious or secular store. Oil that has been perfumed with frankincense and myrrh is both popular and spiritually significant.

, Find a small vial, bottle, or other container with a tight lid that does not leak. Pour a little olive oil into this container. The sample in this container will become the anointing oil.


You can buy a special oil stock at a religious bookstore or online, or you could use any small bottle.
The most common vial is a short metal container with a screw-on lid, with a sponge placed inside to help hold the oil in.
Less expensive plastic oil stocks are also available.
Even a ""travel size"" plastic shampoo bottle could be used.

, As long as your denomination does not prohibit it, you can usually pray a blessing over the oil on your own and without the help of a religious authority figure. The prayer should be firm and one made in full faith.


The prayer you use must ask God to bless and cleanse the oil, so that it can be used for the sake of God's glory.
For instance, the prayer might be something like, ""God, I pray that you anoint this oil in Your heavenly name. I pray that You cleanse it of any defilement in it or upon it, and that You make it holy for the work of Your glory. May this be done in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen."", The best way to keep the oil fresh is to store it sealed and at room temperature. Refrigeration is not recommended.


If you refrigerate the oil, it will start to look cloudy. This is not harmful, though, and the oil can still be used even if it has gotten cloudy.

, There is nothing mystical or magical about the oil itself, even though anointing oil can be a powerful tool of the faith. As with all other spiritual tools, the real power comes from God.


Anointing oil is a symbol of your faith in God and of God's ability to cleanse and make things holy.
Without faith, anointing oil will not have any positive effect. You can use oil to help strengthen and demonstrate your faith, but you cannot use it to replace faith.

, Among other things, you can use the oil to anoint yourself when you pray, when you are troubled, or when you are sick.


While there are different ways to anoint yourself, the most common is to wet your right thumb with a little of the oil and make a Sign of the Cross on your forehead; draw a cross on your forehead while saying, “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”
After anointing yourself, you can continue with your prayers as you usually would, regardless of whether it is a prayer for healing, repentance, thanksgiving, or anything else.
Alternatively, if you are injured or ill, you could cross yourself with the anointing oil over the damaged area of your body while praying for healing.

, Just as you can use the anointing oil on yourself, you can also use it to aid others who are troubled or ill. Pray over the other person as you anoint them with the oil.


When anointing someone else, wet your right thumb with a little of the anointing oil and use it to draw a cross in the middle of the other person's forehead.
As you draw the cross, state the person's name and state, ""I anoint you with oil in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.""
Follow this with any prayers that are appropriate to the specific circumstances. This includes prayers for physical healing, spiritual healing, consecration, and general blessing.

, Anointing oil is commonly used when blessing a new home or a home that has faced some form of spiritual threat.


Remove anything from the home that may have any evil roots.
Walk around your home anointing the frame of every door in every room. As you anoint each frame, pray that God fills your house with the Holy Spirit, and that everything that happens in the house will be done in according to God's will.
The idea behind anointing your home is that you are turning it into ""holy ground"" for God.

, While some of the more traditional uses are rarely applied nowadays, it is still worth noting what some of those uses were.


Anointing the body with perfumed oil was once used to refresh the body. If done to someone else, the act was considered one of hospitality.
The Ancient Israelites once rubbed consecrated oil on the leather of their shields to prepare for war.
Some anointing oils were used for medicinal purposes, while others were used to prepare bodies for funerals and burials.
Some oils were also used to purify the body or consecrate an individual for a specific purpose or calling within God's plan.

Find another believer to date.,
Find a believer who's putting faith into action.,
Search for someone who believes in preserving sex for marriage alone.,
Search for someone who has avoided or resolved past traumas or abuse:


Search for someone who has avoided or healed and/or completed counseling successfully from any past sexual trauma, such as sexual abuse or pornography addiction.,
Search for someone who ideally had at least one warm attachment with a caregiver growing up.,
Search for someone who communicates effectively.,
Search for someone who owns their brokenness.,
Search for someone who has a history of long-term friendships.,
Search for someone with whom you have a lot in common.",How to Find Your Christian Soulmate," Out of loneliness, it can be tempting to overlook the fact that your new romance is a non-believer. However, keep in mind God's word on this issue, ""Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness"" (2 Corinthians 6:14, NIV)?;
, Don't just search for someone who claims to be a Christian, search for someone who shows it. Some examples to look for include someone who regularly spends time with God, who attends church regularly and serves the local body of Christ with their gifts.

, In our sex saturated culture, this is getting tougher and tougher to find, but it is a clear mandate in Scripture to strive towards. ""It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;"" (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5, NIV).

, Unresolved sexual difficulties can create significant problems in love and marriage.
Search for someone who strives towards sexual purity by the media consumption they choose for viewing and listening, not seeking tantalizing or anger based entertainment.
Search for someone who has received healing and/or completed counseling successfully for any past substance abuse and currently has not been addicted to any substances for several years. Similar to past sexual trauma, unhealed substance abuse problems can create significant problems in marriage.
Search for someone who has received healing and/or completed counseling successfully for any past relational trauma, either from partners or parents. Unhealed relational wounds is bound to show in their dynamic with you and create much strain.

, Our early attachments are very powerful and we tend to replicate those attachments with our partner in adulthood. Therefore, the more loving the attachment growing up, the more loving their attachment usually is in marriage.

, Search for someone who has that skill including being patient with others, both about day to day thoughts and feelings and during conflict. Effective communication skills are an essential component of successful relationships so finding someone with those abilities is important. Be careful of someone who seems moody or private--as one, possibly, may be covering some problems.

, Find a partner who is able to own their shortcomings without defensiveness. We all have weaknesses and some people admit them and some people don't. Finding someone who admits their weaknesses and sees their part in the problem leads to closer relationships and reconciliation during conflict.

, Having these types of friends will not only tell you about the type of person you are dating but also demonstrate an ability to maintain relationships long-term.

, Realize you must fill many hours together, and need to enjoy similar times and means of fun and of seriousness, such as shared responsibilities, house/yard work, hobbies, music, movies, reading and contemplation. Usually, the more couples have in common for the ""off hours"", the longer they stick together.

"
"
If this is your first time at a particular church, or any church for that matter, recognize that you are a guest and new to this.,
Many Christian services are divided into two main components.,
Get to church 5-10 minutes early and sit quietly in the pew looking over the bulletin, if possible.,
Note any special instructions about standing or kneeling.,
Note that most of the standing and kneeling comes as a response to something in the service.,
Note that if communion/Eucharist is being served, carefully read the bulletin or ask someone close by how exactly it works in this church.,
Following customary behavior takes practice.,
Try to relax.",How to Follow Customary Behavior in Church," It is normal to not do everything right the first or the second time in a new church.;
, The first part of the service has to do with ""the word,"" in other words the Bible. The second part of the service has to do with ""the table,"" and usually involves Eucharist (communion). Identifying these two major divisions in a service can be very helpful if you feel completely lost. In churches who do not celebrate communion, it is just ""the word"" part that you will experience most Sundays.

, Make special note of which books are used by this church (the Bible, a hymn book or two, any extra books, bulletin inserts). Look around and find all of the extra books or materials used during the service so that you can quickly grab them later. You can even mark the first couple hymns in the hymnal for easy flipping later.

, Sometimes these are hard to catch as they are written in italics or boldface without clear directions. Identify how this church marks what the congregation is supposed to do. If the only variation in movement is standing or sitting, some churches will only have an asterisk or other symbol beside those items in the service during which the congregation stands. It might be good to ask another person sitting close if it is not clear when you are supposed to stand, kneel or walk around the church.

, It might be a response to a reading or a prayer. Typically, the order is for someone at the front to do something and then for the congregation to respond to what has been done.

, Should you choose to go up during communion, ask if they encourage a new person to do that and exactly how it would be done. Some churches only allow baptized persons or members to receive communion. If this is the case, you can hang back in the pew or you can walk up with everyone and indicate that you would like a blessing. You can usually do this by crossing your arms in front of your chest.

, Attending a couple of times at the same church will make you feel like a pro. Unfortunately, every church is different so trial and error is typically the way to know how to behave in a particular church.

, Know that you will feel self-conscious and that while this is unintended, it is normal. Try to enjoy the service as much as you are able to until you get used to everything going on. Wait a beat before you make any moves and Try to follow others when you can.

Be assertive and proactive.,
Believe in a goal.,
Put deadlines on your goals.,
Expect great lucky ideas to occur to you, but do not worry, if you're not inspired right now.,
Raise your expectations.,
Work smarter, not harder.,
Seek new experiences.,
Be positive.,
Persist.",How to Make Your Own Luck," If you don't walk your path, no one else can or will do it for you — why should they? You can and must innovate, create and do your stuff your way. ""Chance"" is involved in random-luck, but improving your luck is never about relying upon pure random-chance.



Venture: this luck requires positive, proactive effort, and nurturing your ideas. No venture, no gain! No input, no processing, no output! No ""get-up-and-go"" and not moving ideas up and outward to make or boost events to develop and happen, then no luck.

Avoid useless, purposeless risks. You can't control chance events, but you can take action to improve your situation. Believe that things happen because of how you approach life.;
, Write it down, and make this your luck ""blueprint."" Use the proverbial back of a napkin or scrap of paper (even with the usual coffee stains) — whatever is available right now. When preparing your blueprint, consider the following:


Title your blueprint 'Make Luck for ______' (one of your areas of interest). If it is messy, that's fine as it'll take shape in time. These ideas can seem like ordinary things, or things that will be time-consuming and difficult but that apply to your future ""luck"" needs in that area.
List ideas for your chosen goal, and write down every big thing you can think of on that topic. Don't spend too much time on your plan right now — you can take the time to polish it later.
Copy your blueprint over to something more substantial later if you're using scrap paper.

, Deadlines make daily progress more likely. Aim to make progress in little goals or short-term goals, be they hourly, daily or weekly ones. Make your own action plan, and follow through on it. Polish your plans as you go and try to remain open to new opportunities.


Think of prerequisites. This means the required order of your goals, such as doing 101A before 102B, if it matters. This may require placing a number of your goals in a logical sequence.
Write descriptions of the categories of your goals. Categories can work better than writing thousands of short term goals that don't seem to be linked. Consider adding smaller steps within each goal so you can see the linear process more clearly.

, Work through your doubts, and muse and meditate about goal-related matters.


Be ready for new ideas. As soon as inspiration hits, find a way to write it down. If you don't record it, later you'll probably wonder, ""What was that great idea...?"" If you do not focus on a reasonably dynamic idea to develop and to actualize, then that kills this luck (but if you have and believe in your ideas, you can then make positive changes at many levels).

, No matter where you are (or where you'd rather be), you can move beyond simply existing. Pump up your goals any way that you can.


Realize that lucky people focus on 'getting it done, and go beyond simply making do.
Don't wait without good reason — recognize that perpetual procrastination until something better just comes along amounts to making excuses.

, Use connections with other people to help accomplish your goals. Go beyond making an effort and shift into innovating and trying new ways to get things done.


Partner up. Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs had a technical expert as a startup-partner. Partnering with someone who is able in areas where you are not relieves you of your own limitations and makes more room for your strengths to shine.
Don't ever presume you need to create your luck alone — others can be great support as you seek your luck. (Just be sure to reciprocate in kind — this isn't a one-way sense of support.)
Be ready when opportunity arrives.This is the real secret behind making the most of ""luck"" — people spend a lot of time preparing themselves rather than simply sitting about hoping, and it can take a lot of time initially.

, When you know what will improve your life or the lives of others around you, you create your own direction and strive forward. With this sense of direction in place, you can now seek and find what you're looking for, pursuing your blueprint goals, able to focus on what is in your plan, path or way.


Build up your experience. For example, gain the experience or expertise yourself through study and observation. Or, speed things up by finding a mentor who can help guide you along the path you've chosen — someone with real-world experience.
Observe how others work without imposing on them. Creative people need some latitude and time to get ideas together and to get going. Be a good listener, rely on using good humor, and make time for relaxation together. Arguing with people who have as strong a vision or set of goals as you is inevitable, so make room for agreement too and never be unreasonable in insisting on your own way. Flex but be sure to push for your worthy innovations and improvements.
Be a self-made ""genius"". For example, to play several musical instruments, realize that you must practice every day, for years, and never stop, for thousands of hours. The same may be true for academic talents: devote yourself fully and recognize that true improvement takes time.
Learn to do public speaking; even if you don't stand before a crowd, it can help you to become persuasive and get in shape in all areas that matter.

, Believe in yourself. Don't say, ""I never had talent"". People who think like that usually are wishful, but didn't really try enough things, or keep at them for long enough.


Happiness and joy are choices. Choose joy. Happiness can come by choosing to be inspired and investing and using your time wisely. Have fun by doing your work. Put on more genuine smiles, and avoid the fake or pasted-on grin.
Learn to love ""hateful"" things: Love your work — practice, study, keep records of your business/or notes on your learning.

, Remember: some popular singers make it with a poor voice, some celebrities make it without being the most beautiful, the most talented or the most connected. It's because they are persistent and they believe in what they're doing, through and through. Ultimately, the key to seizing luck is to finish what you start or to work it into a new way to try again.

Some say that it's easier to reach the necessary state of relaxation and heightened awareness around dawn. Yet it is possible to astral travel at any time so there are no hard and fast rules. It is a personal preference or simply astral traveling when we feel empowered to do it.;
, Astral projection requires a state of deep relaxation, so it should be performed in a part of your home where you're completely comfortable. Lie on your bed or sofa and relax your mind and body.


It's easier to perform astral projection alone than it is with someone else in the room. If you usually sleep with a partner, choose a room other than the bedroom to practice astral projection. A good time to do it is when no one else is in and make sure no one is going to walk into the room when you're in astral flight.
Draw the shades or curtains and rid the room of distracting noises. Any type of interruption could disrupt the state of relaxation you need to achieve.

, Position yourself on your back in your chosen room. Close your eyes and try to clear your mind of distracting thoughts. Concentrate on your body and how it feels. The goal is to achieve a state of complete mind and body relaxation.


Flex your muscles and then loosen them. Start with your toes and work your way up your body, gradually making your way to your head. Make sure every muscle is completely relaxed when you are through.
Breathe deeply and exhale completely. Don't hold tension in your chest and shoulders, just relax.
Focus your mind on your breathing. Don't get carried away with thoughts of outside worries, and don't get preoccupied yet with the idea of your soul projecting from your body. Just let yourself sink into relaxation.
It can be helpful to use a quartz crystal to raise and speed up your vibrations as preparation. Gently hold the crystal on your third eye slightly above the centre of your eyebrows with closed eyes and breathing deeply. Feel the vibrations and your head clearing; you can envision golden, white, purple or any colour light if you like. During the meditation and astral travelling you can hold the crystal in your hand or place it on your chest or abdomen. The crystal will empower and protect you because of it's high vibrations; negative energies have lower vibrations.

, This hypnotic state is normally known as the hypnagogic state. Let your body and mind approach sleep, but don't completely lose consciousness. Being at the edge of wakefulness and sleep, a hypnotic state, is necessary for astral projection to occur. Reach this state using the following method:


Keeping your eyes closed, let your mind wander to a part of your body, such as your hand, foot or a single toe.






Focus on the body part until you can visualize it perfectly, even with your eyes closed. Continue focusing until all other thoughts fall away.






Use your mind to flex your body part, but do not physically move it. Visualize your toes curling and uncurling, or your fingers clenching and unclenching, until it seems as though they are physically moving.






Broaden your focus to the rest of your body. Move your legs, your arms, and your head using only your mind. Keep your focus steady until you're able to move your whole body in your mind alone.

, Many report feeling vibrations, which come in waves at different frequencies, as the soul prepares to leave the body. Don't be afraid of the vibrations, since the presence of fear might cause you to leave your meditative state; instead, succumb to the vibrations as your soul prepares to leave your body.

, Imagine in your mind the room in which you are lying. Move your body in your mind to stand up. Look around yourself. Get up off the bed and walk across the room, then turn around and look at your body on the bed.


Your OBE is successful if you feel as though you are gazing upon your body from across the room, and that your conscious self is now separate from your body.
It takes a lot of practice to get to this point for some people, though for others it comes as naturally as breathing. Either way it is possible for everyone if it is desired and practised enough! If you have trouble completely lifting your soul from your body, try lifting just a hand or a leg at first. Keep practising until you're able to move across the room.

, Your soul always remains connected to your body with an invisible force, sometimes referred to as a ""silver cord."" Let the force guide your soul back to your body. Re-enter your body. Move your fingers and toes - physically, not just in your mind - and let yourself regain full consciousness.

, Once you have mastered the act of projecting your soul from your body in the same room, you will want to confirm that you were indeed in two separate planes.


Next time you practice the astral projection, don't turn around to look at your body. Instead, leave the room and walk into another room in the house.
Examine an object in the other room, something that you had never noticed before in the physical sense. Make a mental note of its color, shape and size, paying attention to as many details as possible.






Return to your body. Physically go into the room you previously projected yourself into. Walk to the article you examined during the astral travel. Can you confirm the details you noted when you explored the object with your mind?

, During subsequent astral projection sessions, go to locations that are less and less familiar to you. Each time, note details that you had never noticed before. After each session, physically verify the details. After a few trips, you will be experienced enough to travel to locations that are completely unfamiliar with the confidence that you have actually performed astral projection.

, Some say that astral projection is dangerous, especially when one gets enough practice to explore unfamiliar places but it need not be. Those people simply don't understand it or fear it because they don't use enough protection,.as long as you ask for protection in your own way it'll be a good experience. Before you astral project it is nice to imagine yourself bathed in a glowing, white light. Imagine it as a cloud around you or inside you; this will protect you from other thought forms or negative energy forms.


There is so much to get into, but know that no harm will come to you unless you think it will. The thrill of having an OBE keeps some people out of their bodies for long periods of time, which is said to weaken the silver cord but the silver cord cannot be weakened. It is pure energy and energy can't be eliminated or removed, only moved from one place to another, or one form or another so don't worry about astral travelling; it is natural, powerful and healing.
The silver cord can never be broken, but it is said that your soul can be delayed from re-entering your body if you spend too much energy outside of it. Yet your soul and body are so intrinsically entwined that the soul will naturally come back when it's right to.
Some say that demons can inhabit the body while the soul is being projected. If you fear this may happen, protect your body by blessing the room with a prayer before you perform projection. It is only here say anyway and seeing as you'll have already asked for light protection nothing bad will occur.
Your soul can also interact with other astral projections. Try it with a friend who has practiced as much as you have. Some say astral sex is mind blowing. However, remember to always return to your body.
It is possible to heal others during astral travel; this is a form of distance healing that is very powerful. Envision the sick person, perhaps lying in their bed. It doesn't matter if they're not physically in their bed while you're doing it because time and distance becomes void when you're in the astral plane. Always ask for protection, healing power and guidance from whoever you pray to and envision light; you can ask during astral projection as and when you wish. See light in your hands as white and strong as you can, and if you feel ready put one hand on their forehead and another on their abdomen and pour the light into them. Your intentions must be pure and you should be feeling nothing but love for them. Sometimes people will report back to you that something amazing has happened to them, even though you didn't tell them you were the source of it! Enjoy your astral journeys!

Redirect the topic subtly to be polite.,
Bridge to a safe topic before religion is brought up.,
Find someone to be a buffer.,
Respond with total silence.",How to Avoid Uncomfortable Conversations About Religion1," This is the most polite way to avoid the conversation about religion. If someone brings it up, follow up with something unrelated without being too obvious.Try to raise questions that lead the other person to talk about different things you appear interested in.For example, imagine Cousin Marty says something like “Kids these days just aren't going to church. It's all that rock and roll they're listening to. Right?”
You could follow up with “Speaking of kids, I've been meaning to ask: how’s your daughter doing at college?”;
, If you know that you'll be talking to people who like to bring up religion, take charge and steer the conversation elsewhere. By being preemptive, you can stop the awkward conversation before it even begins.Be prepared with a few neutral conversation starters, like ""So what did you all think of the last Game of Thrones episode?"" or ""Anyone have travel plans for the summer?""
Whenever you're around the person who likes to talk about religion, just lead with one of these neutral topics.

, Bringing someone new into the conversation can lead to a natural shift in topic. If someone won't drop the topic of religion, having a buffer also means you won't be stuck alone in an awkward situation.You can make the shift suddenly, like “Hey, isn't that Pam over there? Let's catch up with her! Hey Pam! Over here!”
Try to have a friend or ally be your buffer. They'll probably pick up on what's going on and try to help out.

, Sometimes not saying anything at all is the best way to get a point across. If someone brings up religion in an uncomfortable way, look at them and say nothing. It takes a little nerve, but hold the silence for a few seconds and then shift to a neutral topic. This should signal clearly that it's not an appropriate time to discuss religion."

Keep communication open.,
Listen before you jump to conclusions.,
Respect your partner's wishes.,
Stop trying to prove yourself right.,
Find a comfortable solution to daily life.,
Be considerate.,
Keep the discussions between you.,
Handle the community.,
Set aside a quiet afternoon together.,
Prepare a writing activity with two notebooks.,
Rank your needs by importance.,

Voice your feedback.,
Think about what you've learned.",How to Make an Atheist and Theist Relationship Work," If your difference in perspective causes friction between you, don't let it bubble away silently. As with any tension in a relationship, it's unlikely to disappear if you don't address it openly. Once in a while, something you say will upset your partner, or vice versa. Talk to each other so you both understand why it was upsetting, and what the intent was behind the words.


Communication doesn't mean a shouting match — in fact, that can be a sign that something has gone unsaid for too long. Pick the right time to have these conversations, when you're both relaxed.;
, Most people have preconceived notions about what people of certain faiths (or no faith) are like. Don't assume your understanding of your partner's perspective is true. When discussing this sensitive topic, let your partner explain their point fully before you leap to respond.

, Respect is the most important factor in the success of your relationship. Neither of you should pressure the other to convert or to leave the faith. Discuss the topic only if your partner is interested in listening.


If this is a dealbreaker on some level, be honest. For example, if you can't see yourself marrying someone who doesn't share your faith, a serious romantic partner deserves to know that.

, You can win an argument, but you can't win a relationship. In the end what matters is that you are willing to love someone in spite of your differences. You do not have to agree with your partner's beliefs, but you do need enough of an open mind to recognize the value of a different perspective, instead of dismissing it. If you think of the other person as stupid or silly for disagreeing with you, the relationship is not healthy.

, When it comes down to specific religious practices, such as attending services or setting up a place of worship in the house, respect the other person's decision and find a compromise (if need be) through respectful conversation.


Student couples may find it easiest to keep clear boundaries around the religious practices, for example spending a weekly holy day apart from each other.
If you live together, the religious person should be allowed to worship at home. That said, religious practices should not take up all the living space or cause major inconvenience in the atheist's life.

, Don't just avoid inconvenience. Actively work to accommodate your partner and demonstrate that you respect his (or her) lifestyle. If your partner has religious dietary restrictions, invite him to restaurants with plenty of valid options. If your atheist partner will be attending a religious holiday at your mom's house, prep your family with a few ""do's and don'ts"" about what to say.

, Religion is a charged topic in many families and communities. It's generally best to keep serious conversations about faith between the two of you, rather than airing your issues to a wider social group.


Of course, this does not apply to professional counseling.

, Most deeply religious people have a circle of friends who are also deeply religious. These friends should not determine the path of your relationship, but you can't ignore their existence. If these friends act intolerant or offensive, the two of you should discuss how to change their behavior, or else how to minimize the amount of time the atheist has to spend in contact with that group.


A smaller proportion of atheists are part of atheism-centered communities, but this can certainly happen in the other direction as well.

, This exercise is designed to allow two people to share their needs and perspectives with each other. You'll need a few hours together in a tranquil setting. Switch off the cell phones and make sure you won't be disturbed.


You don't have to be a theist and atheist to try this exercise. This can help any two people bridge the gap of understanding between them, whether that gap is based on philosophical differences or other factors.
This is a serious exercise, and can be seriously liberating if you both approach it willingly. That said, it can help to approach it with a sense of fun and anticipation. You may learn quite a bit about each other and about the potential of your relationship.

, Speaking gently to your partner, suggest that you embark on a writing activity together. Writing silently in separate notebooks, each of you will jot down notes about your personal needs. To begin, each of you writes down these six headers, each at the top of a fresh page:


Certainty
Variety
Love and connection
Significance
Growth
Contribution

, Assign each need a different rank, from 1 (most important) to 6 (least important). Write these numbers on your paper without telling your partner.


If you like, you can wait until after the next step, once you've given the subject some thought.

, Working separately and quietly, write down what each need means to you; in what way it is important to you; and how your partner does or could fulfill this need. Here's a bit more detail to guide your writing:



Certainty is about security, stability, and predictability in your life.

Variety covers new experiences and adventures, whether in other countries or daily life.

Love and connection: What do you need to hear your partner say to you, in order to feel loved by them? What do you need to see them do? How can your partner show their love for you, in a way that would satisfy this need?

Significance refers to your perception of yourself as significant to others. For example, you may want to feel valued for your skills, your appearance, your background, your ability, your history, or your character traits.

Growth could mean improving a particular skill, learning new skills, or advancing your education or career.

Contribution is about your positive impact on the lives of others, whether that means your family, your community, or the world.

, Once you've each spent a fair amount of time writing on each need, take a short break. Go for a walk, have a cup of coffee or simply get up and stretch.

, Read what they have written to gain a deeper insight into what fulfills them on all levels. Take your time to absorb this in your own head before you move on to the next step.

, Tell your partner what you thought of the exercise, and describe your reactions to your partner's notes. Set a timer for ten minutes. When the time is up or you've run out of things to say, set the timer again and let your partner speak. Alternate back and forth as many times as you would like.


Only one person speaks in each ten minute interval. Do not interrupt each other.

, Hopefully, you've developed a greater understanding of your needs as a couple. To what extent are these needs reliant on a shared spiritual or religious background? You may find that the two of you cannot satisfy — or are not prepared to satisfy — the majority of each other's needs. In this case, you may need to discuss possible paths forward to change this or find fulfillment elsewhere. On the other hand, you may find your partner is keen to understand and meet your needs better, even if you do not share the same language of faith.

Make up an excuse to leave.,
Try the hard pivot technique.,
Let stray remarks go rather than starting an argument.",How to Avoid Uncomfortable Conversations About Religion2," A little white lie is just fine if you're trying to get out of an awkward conversation about religion. Tell the person you've had fun talking to them, but you've actually got to go now.Make up an excuse where the person can't reasonably follow you.
For instance, if you say you're going to refill your drink, they might try to follow you.
Instead, say you've got to go call home and check on things.

, If someone makes an awkward or offensive remark about religion, you don't have to respond in any way at all. Simply turn and walk away. This might be considered rude, but it's reasonable if it's really not the place or time to talk religion., If someone makes a religious comment, even one that annoys you, no one says you have to respond. This is especially true if it seems like an awkward time to pick up the topic. If there’s not a question directed specifically at you, just let the comment go. Leave as soon as you can."

Declare a debate-free zone.,
Suggest talking about religion some other time.,
Agree to disagree.",How to Avoid Uncomfortable Conversations About Religion3," If you can't escape the conversation, and the person won't let the topic go, be upfront about not wanting to talk. Politely but firmly remind them that religion is a personal and sensitive topic, and it may not be appropriate to discuss it in all situations. Suggest that for the sake of others around you, it's best not to debate religion right now., If the person is not being combative but wants to talk about religion, tell them another time and place would be better. If you are genuinely interested in talking to them about religion, you can actually set up another time to talk. If you just want them off your back, keep it non-specific.Something like “Why don't we talk about this at the next company picnic?” should do the trick.

, With reasonable people, this old standby actually works. If someone brings up religion in an awkward situation, tell them you likely don't agree on spiritual matters and should probably talk about something else."

Draw up a simple sketch map in Paint or another image editor.,
Go to MapQuest.,
Repeat for Google Maps.,
At the top of the map page, tell the visitors that if they have a fast connection, they may prefer MapQuest or Google Maps.,
Right after the links to MapQuest and Google Maps, put in the sketch map.,
If your church serves a wide area, you need two sketch maps, one showing the whole area, one the street details from the freeway exit(s) to your front door.

Add a picture of your church from the street, so people know what to look for.

",How to Design the Map Page for a Simple Church Web Site," Use single black lines for the main streets, double black lines for freeways. Use a blue rectangle for your church building. Use red for distinctive landmarks if your church is close to something everyone knows; a mall, high school or library. Leave out side streets; visitors don't need to know the names of all the courts, circles and lanes in the subdivision behind your church. They just need to know how you find you once they get off the freeway. Use the text option to label the streets. Save it as a gif file. It should be less than 20 KB, a boon for people with dial-up connections. Unless your church is close to a park (green), you’ll have a three-color map. You can’t get much simpler than that.;
, Enter your church address. Click on ""Link to this page"". MapQuest will generate HTML for a link. Copy it into a temporary text file.

, Some people like one, some like the other.

, Copy the links from the temporary files.

, All three – the introduction, the links and the map – should appear “above the fold�? on the page. That is, before the visitor has to do any scrolling.

,, Some people don’t like to read maps. Some may want to download the instructions into a magic box that will read them back, aloud, as they drive. Use both compass and hand directions. (“Turn north (left). Drive three miles . . .�?). Have one paragraph for each general compass point, unless your church is on the ocean and doesn’t have a visitors dock. (“From the South: . . . From the East: . . . etc.)

, If someone in a wheelchair decides to visit, can he/she get inside? Will she/he be able to use the bathroom? If a visitor is on your map page, he/she is considering a visit. People who use wheelchairs have enough problems without driving all the way to a church and finding out they have to be carried up the stairs because you haven’t built a ramp yet. Most churches are accessible. If yours isn’t, say so at the top. If it is, reassure people after the directions.

Learn both sides of the coin, both atheist and Christian beliefs, in addition to other religions and belief systems. Morals and values run parallel through many belief systems, allowing for common grounds for discussion in all religions.


There are many resources online that can help you learn about religious systems, including podcasts, and audio and visual classes.;
, Argument and persuasion cannot be effectively built out of thin air. You must understand where your friend is coming from in order to build a bridge between your two belief systems.


The Bible is regarded as one of the most influential sources on literature in western culture. It is a great read for narrative merit alone., Although it is not possible to prepare for every argument you should know some of the more common talking points in Christian apologetics.


These include arguments like the fine-tuned Universe, which argues that our Universe supports life so well and works in such a precise way that it must have been intelligently designed. This argument directly challenges our science-based understanding of the origins of the Universe.
Another argument, Pascal’s Wager, is the suggestion that one should live their life under the assumption that God does exist, given that the stakes are skewed. If God does not exist, your life simply ends. However, if God does exist, how you behaved in life determines whether you will be rewarded eternally in Heaven, or punished eternally in Hell. This argument, though steeped in logic, raises questions of honesty, morality, and the extent of God's powers., Learn why people believe stories backed by anecdotal evidence. Understanding something about belief as it pertains to psychology will better prepare you for counter-arguments and why you may feel the way you do about your own beliefs.


Urban myths such as Bloody Mary for example have no proof or scientific basis and are believed to be untrue. However, the myth is still passed around because the idea that such events could exist is alluring and fun.
Urban myths and other legends often stem from real life events or people that actually existed, but the truth behind them has become exaggerated or twisted over time. Bloody Mary for example may stem from Mary Worth, a woman hanged for witchcraft, or Queen Mary I of England, who was known for her ruthlessness. , Some arguments stem from misinterpretations and misinformation about physics or biology. Understanding the core of these subjects will allow you to challenge unscientific arguments and assumptions.


Evolution is the most widely known areas of contention between some Christians and atheists. Studying natural selection and how creatures survive and die off is a good place to start your studies.

, Let them engage the conversation first. This sidesteps any feelings that you may be attacking their belief system with an agenda. Remain calm, firm, and reasonable. A common stereotype of atheists is that they are angry and hostile.


Explain why you are an atheist and what that means to you. The goal of conversation is to wipe away preconceived notions about one another’s beliefs.
For example, you could say: “I believe that people have the ability to identify and choose right from wrong by experiencing life on their own.”
You might also say: “People are wildly complex and interesting – I believe they can make mistakes, but also learn from them, without needing to be policed.”

, Why do they hold a particular belief? Sometimes pointing out a single fallacy every now and then is sufficient. Ask them to explain something about their religion you don't understand to help you to think about deeper meaning.


You might ask your friend: “How can God allow some in the world to starve and others to eat?”
You might also ask: “I’m interested in what Christians think of the fact that the Bible was written by several individuals. Is it difficult to trust in so many differing accounts?”
Suggest your friend start questioning everyday occurrences. Questioning authenticates truth and can become a habit that help change thinking., Show that atheism has not impacted your life in a negative way. If they bring up their belief that God had a hand in an event in their life, it is okay to point out other factors that helped them, such as their own actions or a professional's skills.


For example, getting accepted into college might feel like a divine gift, but it was an individual’s hard work that paved the way. You might tell them: “Congratulations! All of that studying really paid off.”

, Both sides of any debate will often create incorrect argumentation and rely on rhetoric without even noticing.


Common informal fallacies in debate include circular reasoning, which begins and ends an argument with the same idea. For example, “The Bible makes no false claims; whatever the Bible says is true; thus, the Bible contains only truth.” The second and third portions of the argument are the same concept, and thus, not an argument of merit., Spend a day with an eclectic group of friends that come from all walks of life. Exposure to others’ views and philosophies helps all of us expand our thinking.


Avoid activities that might make your friends of particular faiths uncomfortable, such as wild parties or violent movies.
Board games, shopping or hiking are excellent activities that everyone can enjoy.

, Use personal experience to offer authenticity. If your friend shares some wisdom from the Bible, quote similar wisdom from another belief system or a wise historical individual.


For example, if your friend is falling behind at school: ""I feel you - I had a hard time dealing with all that homework too. Have you looked into study groups? I joined one with my classmates and we ended up finishing the homework in half the time.'
In times of your friend's lack of confidence, you might offer: ""When I feel down, I always think to this great Buddhist quote: 'You can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and you will not find that person anywhere.'""

, Don't let differences and debate cause the end of a friendship. Know when to drop the conversation.


Don’t raise your voice. A raised voice often indicates or leads to anger, which can throw the discussion off track. If your friend begins to raise their voice, ease off of the conversation.
Avoid physicality. A discussion that turns physical is no longer a discussion. If you or your friend start getting pushy, end the conversation and put some space between the two of you for the time being.
Talking about your feelings behind your thoughts helps create a more peaceful and constructive atmosphere. Show your friend that you are coming from a place of caring, rather than just looking to win an argumentKeep the argument on track. If the conversation turns to other issues, such as personal attacks or insults, it’s time to drop the conversation.
If your friend becomes angry or hurt, back away from the conversation and apologize. Even if you feel you are in the right, hurting another’s feelings was not the intent of the conversation and you don’t want to risk your friendship.

, Listen and understand their point of view. If their faith brings them peace and fulfillment, accept that fact. Don’t damage or take away another’s sense of peace. "

Be prepared.,
Assess the belief and knowledge of your opponent before diving in.,
What made them choose to believe what they believe?,
Get your facts straight.,
Ask relevant questions, as well as answer any the atheist might have.,
Be honest.,
Know often atheists will not be the ones to bring up the subject of religion to argue about it.,
Try to keep an open mind.,
Remember the golden rule.,
If the above steps don't help, consider dropping the discussion/argument altogether.",How to Survive an Argument With an Atheist," The best way to survive an argument with another person who disagrees with you is to be ready to handle any barrage of questions that may be thrown at you. Be ready to state relevant facts, and back these statements up to the best of your ability with further relevant information.;
, Are they atheist or agnostic, hard or soft?

, Remember that many atheists were raised to be religious. They have knowledge of religion and have chosen to reject it. They may view your explanations as condescending.

, A factual and logical approach is often used by someone who is trying to persuade you to accept their point of view. Do not fight fire with fire, in doing so you are pleasing the opposing person because they enjoy the argument in the process of it happening. Listen to what they have to say eventually they will run out of ideas, and you may use a caring approach towards the other person.

, A tactic an atheist might use is to start asking you questions that will generate a response that he wants, he will then use this response, in connection to future questions he will ask, to prove an illogical point. For example: Is God good? Yes. Who made everything? God. So God made Satan? Yes. If God is good, then why did he make something evil? If you are asked a question, answer it, but then immediately ask your own as soon as possible. Some questions include, ""Why do you feel the extensive need for proof?""

, Try to avoid saying anything that's pretentious (such as suggesting that their atheism is a result of feeling that religion had failed them in someway in their past), as this is unlikely to go down well with the other person. Admit that you don't claim to have ""evidence"" or ""proof"" that God exists, but that your belief is based on faith - if this is the case. The other person is then far more likely to show you respect.

, Atheists discussing religion is usually in response to a theists trying to preach to them, criticize them, or pass judgment on them. You respect their beliefs, and respect the rights of others, and they will treat you with respect.

, If the atheist sparks a sense of logic or a questioning of faith in you, don't resist this new found sense of the world and try to learn a bit more about it.

, If the other person is receptive to your beliefs, then great! But remember that they are most likely going to be annoyed. Consider their situation: how would you feel if someone came up to you and tried to convert you to Greek polytheism? You'd be annoyed by the nonsense of the person's arguments, and that's exactly how atheists feel.

, Sometimes it's just not possible to reach a mutually agreeable point of view with someone else - no matter how hard you try. If you find that this is the case, you are likely to find that changing the subject altogether is the best course of action - as that way it'll help prevent further conflict and negative feelings on both sides.

Dance is a form of worship in many cultures. Take a dance class, or just put on music that makes you feel spiritual and try moving to it.
Any form of creation that makes you feel centered and peaceful can help, including traditional domestic activities such as baking.

, Find a church, temple, mosque, or other religious center that shares some of your beliefs. If you already belong to a congregation, renew your engagement with it. Volunteer your time, join a committee for a cause you believe in, and connect with other members of the congregation.Consider attending religious services at congregations other than your own. Get to know other spiritual traditions.

, If your spiritual practice involves prayer, focus on improving the quality of your prayers. Pray at least daily. When you pray, do not let your mind wander. Focus on the words you are saying. If you notice your mind wandering, remind yourself what your intentions are and resume with a renewed sense of purpose.Pray with others. See if your congregation has a prayer group. If not, consider praying with another congregation.
If your family prays together at meals or at other moments, ask to lead the prayers one night.
No matter your denomination, prayer profoundly shapes your mind and your sense of oneness with the world.

, Get to know the core beliefs of your faith tradition. Read directly from the source, and seek to understand the central messages of your spiritual ancestors. Consider creating or joining a reading group to share your journey.If you are Christian, for instance, you may join a Bible study group through your church.
If you are interested in spirituality across religious faiths, consider reading texts from many faiths.

, Focusing on others will help you develop yourself. Find a cause you care about and donate your spare time to it. Look at local organizations that could use volunteers, start a fundraiser, or begin your own volunteer group. There are many ways to help others. You can:Volunteer at a homeless shelter
Teach free ESL classes to immigrants
Get involved in your local union and help other workers in your field

, Take note of the good things others do for you. Be grateful, and express your gratitude to yourself and to those who help you.Thank people sincerely when they do something for you. Explain how their actions have benefited you.
Keep a gratitude journal in which you write one or two things you are grateful for every day.
Take note as well of the good feeling you get from doing good for others. Feel grateful to them for letting you participate in their lives.

, Empathy may seem like an inherent quality, but it's actually a practice you can develop. To develop your empathy, pay close attention to others. Listen to them, and do your best to understand how they feel. You can do this for people in your immediate vicinity and people you read about in the paper.Listen hard when you are in conversation. Don't just nod and answer—contemplate what is being said to you, and take it seriously.
Get to know people. Make friendly conversation with strangers you are seated next to, provided they seem interested in talking. Try to understand what goes on in their heads, what makes them happy, and what troubles them.
Challenge your assumptions about others. If you harbor ill feelings towards any group or individual, make an effort to get to know them as people.

Consider the most certain principles of your life, the principles that you never violate.,
Understand that this life is the only one we have.,
Consider the real-world causes and inspirations of amoral behavior.,
Continue reevaluating and adjusting your morals to be both up-to-date and consistent.,
Illustrate your moral code in actions, not just in thoughts.",How to Determine Moral Principles Without Religion1," What are these principles and why are they important? For most people, aggressive violence falls into this category, as does stealing and lying. But this self-examination of morals is perhaps the most important step to determine moral principles without religion. It is okay, even expected, not to have full answers for every question, but you should ask them:Is it ever right to commit a crime? Is it right to follow all laws or only those you agree with?
Is total honesty a good thing, or is it unattainable?
What is your line between helping your group or community and looking out for yourself?
Who or what are you loyal to? Do you ascribe to similar moral principles?;
, Morality should not say how we live in this life in order to obtain a better position in the possible afterlife. Instead, morality should maximize utility in this life, because there are very real issues and ideas on Earth that need your thoughtful care. One can concoct a moral code with many different goals and aims, but it remains that this life is the only one we have. This principle should never be far from your mind.


Your actions have consequences in the real world, for your life and the lives of others. Don't ignore these effects in an effort to plan for the afterlife-- make the most of your present situation.

, Religions (generally) believe that evil or bad actions are the failure of the individual. It is someone's fault, as they strayed from the moral tenants of religion out of selfishness, anger, or some internal evil or flaw. But most evil acts are the result not of consciously evil people, but rather the circumstances surrounding them. For example:


Rape and male violence can, in some circumstances, propagate the human race, as ""evil"" men like Genghis Khan created hundreds of offspring in their evolutionary (and sub-conscience) desire to spread his DNA. These violent tendencies still run in modern-day humans, as it was a highly ""successful"" genetic mutation to rape and pillage in ancient times.
Frequently, evil is done in an effort to survive, even if that effort is fundamentally misguided. While Hitler's actions are unquestionably immoral, what about the rest of the Germans that went along with it? The entire country was in horrible poverty and depression, and a charismatic leader convinced them he could return them to safety and wealth -- the choice wasn't considered moral, it was practical., This is a continuing task and one's moral principles must be updated as society progresses and new ideas and situations are discovered. One of the big mistakes in religious morality is that people assume that everything has been right for 2,000 or more years and that no changes need to be made to fit modern times. But this often betrays the underlying moral tenants of treating others fairly and avoiding violence, as modern-day sects of Islam can attest. Keep your mind more open than this and secular moral principles will soon become much clearer.


Everyone should spend time re-thinking their moral code to fit new problems and issues. Look no further than Pope Francis, who quickly set about reexamining and modifying centuries-old Catholic dogma about homosexuality, women, the environment, and capitalism., Think about your morals and follow them, whatever they may be. It doesn't make sense to have a set of moral principles which one does not abide by. Remember that other people have different ideas of morals, and accept that you can do no more than to follow your own code. Ultimately, your morality is going to be determined by your actions and words, not by your thoughts.

Consult with a doctor before attempting a weight loss fast.,
Gather knowledge about the specific fast.,
Speak to others who have undergone the fast.,
Monitor your health during a weight loss fast.",How to Know What to Expect During a Fast2," Extremely low-calorie fasts across days and weeks can lead to nausea, dizziness, headaches and fatigue. Ensure that the fast you are undertaking will not compromise your health.

, Juice fasts, water fasts and other fasts that require meal skipping vary one from another. Water fasts may require that you only drink water for several days. A juice fast may call for juicing specific fruits and vegetables. Study the requirements of the fast.

, Conduct online research to learn whether others have successfully lost weight on the particular fast. Be cautious about promoters of a fast who give positive reviews to sell a fasting product.

,


Observe your body to gauge whether you are losing muscle. Low-calorie diets devoid of protein can lead to muscle loss.
Tune in to your energy level. Extreme physical symptoms, such as fainting, fatigue and dehydration are reasons to stop a weight loss fast.
Examine your emotional state. Fasting extensively can lead to irritability and mood swings.

Speak to spiritual leaders.,
Read scriptures related to fasting.,
Prepare mentally and physically.,
Consult with members of the religious tradition.,
Notify others that you are fasting.",How to Know What to Expect During a Fast3," Ask them to explain the purpose and specifics of the prescribed fast. Spiritual fasts usually focus on acknowledgment of and gratitude to a higher power. The specifics of a religious fast differ by religion, and speaking to a spiritual leader can assist the learning process.

, Increase your knowledge of spiritual fasting by reading books and articles on the topic.

,


Cut back gradually on food and drinks. Spiritual fasts requiring daylong abstention from food and drinks will disrupt your habitual routines, such as drinking coffee in the morning and eating large portions at mealtimes. To ease into the fast, begin cutting back slowly on daily coffee and eat smaller meal portions in the days leading up to the fast.
Practice meditation and prayer. Extensive thirst and hunger can cause irritability. Use meditation and prayer to ease the frustrations caused by the inability to eat or drink as desired.

, Ask others who have undergone the spiritual fast what to expect and how they sustain their commitment to the process.

, Some spiritual fasts require refraining from work and school for the duration of the fast. Notify your employer or school if you will be absent.

Consider modern ethical quandaries and dilemmas to deepen your moral principles.,
Consider the Socratic philosophy of self-knowledge, where intelligence itself creates morals.,
Think through the biological motivations for generosity and altruism.,
Consider ""consequentialism,"" or the moral idea that ""the ends justify the means."",
Examine the overlap of ideas between cultures to find common moral ground.,
Dive deeper into the moral writings of philosophers and religious thinkers.",How to Determine Moral Principles Without Religion2," Physicians know that there is little that they can do to prevent the subject's death due to terminal (life-ending) illnesses. In such instances, is it okay to help a patient kill themselves peacefully, or should they be kept alive as long as possible? Meat production and consumption causes suffering to animals and the environment -- is it morally wrong to eat animals when you know that vegetarianism may be better for the planet? If you do, is it ethical to let your pets eat meat, or is it immoral to force carnivores to skip meat? If there is a war in a foreign country and civilians are being murdered, is it more moral to risk US troops to save them or to let each nation decide its own fate without intervention from outsiders? There are no right answers here -- only difficult questions that need to be asked.


Having an answer to a moral quandary, like those above, requires thought and detail. To truly determine moral principles, you'll need to do some research.
Keeping your arguments based on facts and reason often helps avoid the traps imposed by religious moral thinking., Socrates, and many of his fellow Greeks, believed that ignorance or lack of information creates evil and bad behavior.They argue that most people want to do the right thing, but never fully think out the repercussions of their actions. Most people do the ""right"" thing because it makes them happy, but you only know the right thing through honest review of the facts:


What are the long-term consequences of my choice?
Who else will my choice affect? Will it positively or negatively affect my relationships?
What is being lost in this decision? What is being gained?, Throughout most of human evolution, people lived in small bands where the members were closely related and likely to remain in contact with each other throughout their lives. Being altruistic to other members of the band strengthened the community, allowing its members to produce more successful offspring. The closeness of the community also put other members in a position to reciprocate, which directly aids and reinforces the moral codes. Colloquially, one might call this a win-win situation -- where helping others instead of competing with them allows everyone to be better off. From meerkats to schools of fish, and of course humans, morality doesn't come from a god, it comes from the evolutionary benefits of supporting each other.


Treating people with decency, honesty, and kindness is almost always repaid by favors from others and a safe, productive community to live in

, This seems much more heartless than it seems, as the ""ends"" is much more complicated than choosing the most selfish moral principle. Developed over many years and under many names, such as utilitarianism, this philosophy decrees that whatever produces the best results is the most moral principle to take. Of course, it is up to you to decide what ""best results are,"" and there are only so many ways to determine this. Still thinking about the future results of your actions is a great way to develop useful, concrete guides for a moral life.


What counts as a ""good consequence?"" Make sure you consider how your decisions will affect others -- as your relationships ultimately affect you as well.
The outwardly ""right"" act, according to religion, is somewhat irrelevant. For example, stealing is ""wrong"" in most religions. But is stealing from the rich to feed your starving children really ""immoral"" if you consider the actual consequences?

, Independent cultural overlap generally suggests that a moral principle is valid. For example, the Golden Rule (""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"") is not uniquely Christian and is, indeed, echoed throughout ethical philosophy across the globe. People everywhere agree that you should treat others with respect, indicating that this is a solidly human moral principle.


The ideas outlined in The United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights are generally considered a worldwide, though incomplete, framework for basic decency and morality.

, While the reader may consider many parts of religious (and philosophical) texts amoral and lack a belief in any deity, that does not discount the positive ideas of those writers. The writers of such texts were definitely human, and their ideas can be valid outside of the context of religion. Some famous ethical and moral tracts to start with include:



Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzche

The Moral Landscape,' Sam Harris

Ethics, Benedict de Spinoza
The writings of St. Augustine, Christian theologist

Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle

A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft"
"
Understand that the human intellect is the greatest tool that we yet know and that your rationale is important.,
Note that morality does not come from religion, but from communities who interpret religion.,
Remember that true moral goodness occurs because you want to help, not because you have to.,
Consider many of the clearly immoral positions of religions throughout history.,
Understand that highly religious communities often have higher rates of violence and crime.,
Note that atheists tend to be less prejudiced, hateful, and against limited rights for minorities.,
Remember to still accept the good of religious thinking and morality.",How to Determine Moral Principles Without Religion3," Understand that the presence or absence of a higher power has no effect on your moral code, unless he or she were to provide a code that is superior to one that you can deduce on your own. In this case, a moral and logical atheist would accept such a code without question. However, despite its godly origin, such an atheist would still recognize the value in questioning this divine moral code in order to potentially obtain even greater moral right. If such as divine code is perfect, then questioning it only serves to support its greatness and make it stronger. As such, one should never fear questioning a moral code.

, If a modern human were to stone to death an adolescent for not honoring his/her father and mother, we would certainly think him/her immoral. Yet, these are the prescribed punishments for such acts, according to Abrahamic texts found in the Old Testament. Since modern humans do not follow their religious texts to the letter, they must have some method for determining which prescriptions to follow and which to discard, which is ultimately where our morals come from. Ask yourself -- is this action ""good"" because God tells us to do it, or is it simply a good thing to do. If the action is only good because God says so, then morality is nothing more than a checklist, and there are likely few Christians who believe that murder is moral just because someone talked back to their father.

, When something is a requirement, it's not actually moral anymore. Morality is about choice -- deciding to the right thing amongst many options. But if you're only doing the right thing because a religious leader or text told you to, or because you're scared of the consequences of hell, you're not actually being moral. You're being a sheep.


Never forget that the mass murders of the Spanish Inquisition and Crusades were considered ""moral"" because they were apparently backed up by the Bible. But anyone stepping back to think for themselves would have realized very quickly that senseless violence is never a good moral principle.

, Of course, many of the adherents of these religions would argue that they are the most moral of all -- but something is a bit off when multiple religions with conflicting ideas all claim moral superiority. Recognize that, if morality was purely derived from religion, a lot of the following events would likely not take place:


Christianity-sanctioned slavery and treatment of blacks as ""sub-human"" in America.
Radical Islamic terrorist attacks, civilian beheading, and suppression of women's rights.
Burmese Buddhists using human sacrifice to gain political power and control., The myth that ""God is the glue that holds society together"" is a complete myth. In fact, most countries and states with high religious belief and participation are actually the most dangerous areas to live in. Meanwhile, highly secular areas are strongly correlated with lower homicide, rape, and poverty levels.


Of course, this is a statistical trend, and there are exceptions. However, even US states match these trends, with secular states being safer than most highly religious ones., Time and time again, it has been shown that atheists tend to be more tolerant than their strongly religious brethren. The reasons are multifold -- lack of religion erases antiquated rules and morals, and there is no inter-religious hatred and rivalry that can spur so many atrocities (like the Crusades). Either way, people who create their own moral codes, instead of waiting for someone to give them one, tend to treat others much more kindly., For all of its faults, organized religion is a major part of human society, and theologians of all faiths have pushed ethical and moral philosophy incredibly far, even if there are some mistakes. The biggest mistake is usually buying into religious morality wholesale, without considering the faults. Thinking for yourself, considering each principle on its own and not part of an antiquated belief system, can help you stay spiritual and religious without feeling like your moral code is already prescribed.


Morality will often be a mixture of ideas from many different cultures and religions, and closing your mind entirely to theological thought is just as limiting as only considering one religion."

Pray passionately.,
Pray positively.,
Pray with praise.Get creative!,
Pray persistently.,
Pray precisely.,
Pray with Patience.",How to Pray to God for a Miracle," As you pray, allow yourself to be moved by God’s power and grace. Pray with an open and receptive heart. Don’t subdue your emotions—let them out! When you feel moved to tears, allow yourself to cry. When you feel the need to shout, yell! When the spirit calls you to sing, belt out a psalm! Allow your emotions to wash over you.Express how you feel to God and don’t hold back. Pray for your miracle with blind, passionate faith.Pray takes many forms. You may feel more connected to God when you’re singing or reading and studying the Bible. Allow your times of worship to become prayers to God.Find what works for you! Everyone is at a different point in their spiritual journey. There is more than 1 way to connect to God.;
, Place your faith in God and trust that God will answer your prayers. Remain positive throughout your prayer. Avoid negative phrases including “I know this is a long shot…” and negative thoughts. When you don’t trust in God’s capabilities, you are praying with a doubtful heart. Confess your fears and doubts to God. Allow your passionate faith and blind trust in God remove the burden of doubt from your heart. Remain focused on what God is capable of accomplishing. Be comforted by the knowledge that God is a loving, all-powerful being.When a doubt or fear arises, don’t wallow in it. Let it go! Do not allow yourself to worry over whether or not your desire will come true. Simply trust that you've done everything you can to make it happen. Turn to God in prayer and ask that God alleviate you from the doubt or fear., Find a meaningful way to personally thank God. Praise God in prayer, thought, and deed. Thank God with a prayerful song, a thought of thanksgiving, or with a kind act. Praise God for His guidance and wisdom. Thank God for calming your fears, for alleviating your self-doubt, and for giving you hope. Praise God for his faithfulness and commitment to you. Sing his praises when your life is at its highest of highs and its lowest of lows. Be grateful to God in all that you do.Thank God for what He has done in the lives of others.

, Come to God in prayer until something happens! Pray constantly. Ask God for guidance and healing around the clock, not just when it is convenient for you to do so. Pray on your commute, for five minutes at your desk, and at recess or lunch. Asking persistently for a miracle demonstrates your commitment. When you pray, be persistent about listening to God too. Listen for God’s guidance. Actively seek His advice.Devote an entire morning, day, or week to persistent prayer. Free yourself from distractions. Go to a park, sit by a lake, sit in a sanctuary, or retire to your bedroom. Make sure to listen to God’s will and directions too!, Don’t be afraid to state what you want in clear and simple language. Ask God for the miracle. It is acceptable to be direct and to the point. Precise prayer requires focus and dedication. To avoid a wandering mind, avoid filling your prayers with irrelevant statements or flowery language—this won’t earn you any extra points!Repeat simple and direct phrases as part of your prayer.
To help you focus, repeat the Catholic “Miracle Prayer.” The prayer goes as follows: “Lord Jesus, I come before Thee, just as I am, I am sorry for my sins, I repent of my sins, please forgive me. In Thy Name, I forgive all others for what they have done against me. I renounce Satan, the evil spirits and all their works. I give Thee my entire self, Lord Jesus, I accept Thee as my Lord God and Savior. Heal me, change me, strengthen me in body, soul, and spirit. Come Lord Jesus, cover me with Thy Precious Blood, and fill me with Thy Holy Spirit , I love Thee Lord Jesus, I praise Thee Lord Jesus, I thank Thee Jesus, I shall follow Thee every day of my life. Amen. Mary, My Mother, Queen of Peace, all the Angels and Saints, please help me. Amen.”, Waiting for a miracle to happen is frustrating. You may feel helpless, hopeless, and lost. You may want to wrangle control of your life from God. Take a deep, calming breath. Don’t lose faith in God. Your prayers are not being ignored. God works on His own timeline and in his own way. While you wait for your prayers to be answered, remain patient and lean on God and others for support."

Understand the key reasons that affect faith in God.,
Fight strong urges to rebel.,
Deny yourself.,
Relieve your anger.,
Understand God's ways.,
Take a break from worry.,
Serve humanity.,
Resist judgmental thinking.,
Seek one reason to love and believe.",How to Keep Believing in God," Life throws a number of challenges and desires as you move on and progress to newer stages in life and society. You can feel very desirous to have something, and it may lead you to ask God for whatever you want at the moment. But, immediate wants need not be fulfilled no matter how strongly you pray or ask for them. Be flexible to accept the answers, realizing a denied prayer request possibly means, ""No."", but there is another possibility.


Sometimes, God delays the response to a prayer, if it's not denied. You only learn about that with time passing. Was the answer, ""Wait and keep believing.""? Can you expect any favor from God, if you don't keep believing (and if you don't make your best effort to solve the problems yourself).
Paradoxically, it can also be easy to lose faith if you become too comfortable in life and feel you have no need for God anymore. Comfort can be a stumbling block; it can cause you to become proud and lose dependence on God. Don't let that happen to you. Remember that comfort is a gift from God. That which the Lord gives, he also takes away. Never become complacent and sluggish. Look around you at all the lost souls you can help. Share your faith and do justice to others.;
, Being faithful is a constant fight/battles, a spiritual war. Your devotion might be tested rigorously. Fight strong urges to divert from your religious ways. You can expect a desire, for example: to turn into an atheist, agnostic, or to accuse religion of turning a blind eye to all the atrocities in the society, etc. Turn to your religious teachings and seek references of when a faithful servant of God was tempted to turn away from faith, but overcame the temptation.


Understand that being tempted is common, especially when you are being more and more true to God. The evils in the world try their gimmicks when they see a true follower. You can be tried and tempted anytime.

, Whenever you have temptations to divert from God, deny yourself. If you hold any unfulfilled desires or prayers against God, you can feel let down and your faith can weaken. Maintain self-control and wait patiently for the temptation to die out. Whatsoever is good for you and all that makes you happy will be yours. Remember that God loves you and will give you the very best. However, when and how it will come to you is a mystery in the present, which will be unfolded in the future. Expect to unfold blessings.

, Believers often get angry with God and sometimes temporarily or permanently turn away from faith. When troubles drag you too deep into pain, do what will keep your mind at peace.


Speak with a pastor, priest or minister about what is discouraging you from turning to religious faith. You can also speak with someone who you know is wise to guide you well when you seem to be drifting from religion.

, Understand that God's ways are beyond any man's grasp. No one can fully predict what God will do next in your life and in others'. Do not fall pray to the mysteries of God's doings and where it takes you. Just pray and seek divine help with understanding what you are failing to understand.


Your lack of understanding does not mean that God is doing something wrong or something less. Try to meditate deeper, pray and fast so you can see beyond what is visible to the eyes. Faith is not believing when you have definite proof, but faith is believing even when you have no tangible evidence to do so, but still trusting and holding on to your knowledge.

, If you start feeling that you can't make sense of what is happening, and you feel too confused to stick to religion, wait and suspend your hard decision until your faith is stronger, and you are feeling the call to faith. So long as you are not speaking ill of religious faith and are not doing evil in the society, then you are not being anti-religion. You are very free to take time to seek to understand, and get back to professing your faith when you are ready for it. Terror, poverty, deaths, pain and witnessing inhumane activities can make you wonder whether there is a loving God or if God intends to act against such things. You will find all your answers in faith, if you allow patience to work in you. Realize that good and evil are choices. People and their leaders can choose to do right or not, or else there could be no freedom of choice. Also, natural processes can often seem like an act of God, but are the weather and earthquakes just nature at work?


Take a break so your thoughts get time to untangle and everything starts to make sense again, or you learn something beyond your own capacity.

, The best ways to keep doing what you can do and not be too worried about the doings of God is by helping those who need assistance. There is always someone who can use your help. Divert your mind from frustration, and be constructive in life so your devotion doesn't dwindle.


Remember, an idle mind is the devil's workshop. Don't fall prey to the devil's doings.
If you have already turned away from God and are feeling sorry, forgive yourself, seek forgiveness from God and get back to normal. God is far more forgiving than man and is more than happy to meet you as a lost believer on your way back!

, And, do not think more highly of yourself than you should. And, do not set yourself up to unjustly judge (not even yourself) which is God's exclusive job. There is only one righteous judge, but He is not any human-being.


Who are we to judge the eternal, almighty, creator God? One cannot judge God.
Follow the ""Golden Rule"", 'Do to others as you would like to have them do to you'.

, One who loves God, even if s/he has 100 ideas of why not to believe, only needs one reason to love and believe.

State Pascal's Wager.,
Consider that if B & ~G (you believe in God and he does not exist), you actually do lose something.,
Consider the possibility that God exists, but you have chosen the incorrect God.,
Consider the possibility that God exists, but God is the Flying Spaghetti Monster.,
Consider the possibility that God truly is all-loving and that our wagerer has led a good life.,
Finally, consider the case of a similar God to that described by event L, except that this God despises those that accept Pascal's Wager, considering it demeaning to him.,
Realize that one can add infinitely many possible categories of God.",How to Discount Pascal's Wager," If God exists (G) and you believe in him (B), then the reward is heaven (+Infinity). If God exist (G) and you don't believe in him (~B), then the reward is eternal damnation (-Infinity). If God does not exist (~G) and you don't believe in him (~B), then you gain nothing (+0). If God does not exist( ~G) and you do believe in him (B), then you lose nothing. In order to evaluate Pascal's Wager, we calculate the marginal outcome for each case over which you have control (B or ~B) by summing over all the cases where you do not have control (G or ~G). Notice that, if Pascal's Wager is correct, the reward for believing in God is infinitely good and the reward for not believing in him is infinitely bad.
, For example, you might consider your time praying or in church wasted or your faith might require dietary restrictions, such that you might never be able to eat pork, beef, or shellfish. Consider a more severe example, Jehovah's Witnesses' faith requires that they not receive blood transfusions. If B & ~G and you require a life-saving blood transfusion, then, by not accepting such a transfusion, you have made a large sacrifice indeed. These sacrifices, however, are small relative to the infinite magnitudes associated with G, so we can denote them with an arbitrary constant, say, 1. Notice that this does not change our outcome., Let us denote this as event W. Understandably, this God would be upset that you have been worshipping the wrong God. However, he still disapproves of non-believers. This is the first example of the false dilemma. That is, Pascal has not considered all possible cases beyond his control. This alone is enough to discount Pascal's Wager, but we will continue in order to show that we assign any arbitrary value for the outcome., The Flying Spaghetti Monster hates believers because he has left no evidence of his existence and considers them foolish for believing in things without evidence. We will denote this as event FSM. Now, our analysis has completely failed because, no matter what we believe, the expected results are infinitely bad., In this case, the reward is the same for the wagerer in either B or ~B. We denote this as case L. In this case, it is better to be a non-believer than a believer., In this case, which we denote H, it is infinitely better to be a non-believer than a believer., The choices here are arbitrary, and Pascal's Wager can be used to suggest any outcome desired. It is, therefore, not an acceptable method for determining whether one should believe in God in the absence of evidence. See the warnings section for information about how our analysis is incorrect.

Get some space.,
Spot the connection between thoughts and actions.,
Start a journaling practice.,
Discard beliefs that no longer serve you.",How to Develop Your Own Beliefs1," It can take time to become aware of the beliefs that drive your life. You can more effectively do this by backing off from others for a time. If you want to develop your own beliefs, you will need some distance from others so that you can more adequately tune into your own mind.


Take a weekend getaway to a quiet place where you can think. Or, if you can’t afford a vacation right now, simply isolate yourself at home or in your room for a day or so.;
, The development of beliefs doesn’t happen consciously. Therefore, if you wish to form your own, you will need to bring consciousness to those that already guide your life. You can audit your current belief system by training yourself to pay close attention to the relationship between your thoughts and actions. Use the ABC model.A stands for the activating event. Example: Your professor scolds you for submitting an assignment late.
B stands for the belief. Example: You think, “I can’t do anything right.”
C stands for the consequence (or subsequent actions). Example: You don’t try as hard to get things turned in on time.

, Tuning into your thoughts and their underlying beliefs is like a muscle—the more you use it, the more it grows. Journaling is a great way to recognize your thought patterns. Begin a free writing practice each day in which you simply write down whatever is on your mind. Once you have dumped out all those thoughts, review what you wrote.Train yourself to find the thoughts and core beliefs that drive your behaviors.

, Previously, when you had no awareness of your thoughts, many negative beliefs went unchallenged. Take the time to challenge your interpretation of various belief systems. Ask yourself whether your core beliefs are helpful and rational. Discard the beliefs that do not positively influence your life.For instance, you believe, “I can’t do anything right.” Such a belief certainly does not serve your life. You can search for other possible explanations behind it, like “I need to work harder” or “I need to develop better time-management skills.”
By challenging and reframing beliefs like this, you can ensure that your current belief system is positive and growth-oriented.

Think of it in simple terms and feel the emotion that comes with it.  Now, take a deep breath and speak in your mind or out loud the obvious truth: ""It is what it is and I am where I am."" Realize that that is okay.  Because you are where you are; nothing can change the past and there is nowhere to go from here but forward. You are where you are and that has to be okay."" Take another breath and tell yourself: ""I am okay."" You may not completely believe it yet and for the moment that is okay too.;
, Look around. Consider your situation. Think  of the big picture and try not to focus on details. You will come to think of something that bothers you. Focus on that specific thing for a moment let it be what it is for now. It is what it is. Now, look for something positive. It can be the slightest detail that, when it comes right down to it, is not so bad. Think about that and only that. 


It could be something silly like: ""That arsehole... He's actually really skilled at what he does. No, really. He does know what he is doing.  He is an asset here at work. He's not all bad really."" Keep pondering the one positive aspect and try to appreciate that one thing. Focus on the good and realize that there is something positive about all things when you break it down in pieces. 
Think: ""This piece of crap washing machine has been around for a long long time it's quite amazing how many loads of laundry it has cleaned for me. Not bad at all come to think of it."" 
Try this little trick on everything around you; Government, ""Oh hell, all politicians aren't corrupted. There's actually lots of good people doing great work. I can appreciate that."", Illness: ""Actually, I feel like crap but you know, It's nice to get a rest from work and my toes don't hurt at all.  Not one little bit, and this tea tastes wonderful. Oh, and the weather is clearing up. Nice.""
Find what feels good, and don't pay any attention to what doesn't. It may not feel easy yet but the more you do it, the easier it gets.

, We are all different, unique human beings. We have opinions and beliefs.  Accepting that variety of thought is the next step.  You have opinions and beliefs. Now give everyone else the right to have opinions and beliefs. Accept that what others think of you has nothing to do with you. You are who you are and nothing they do or feel can change you.  If you find yourself in a situation where some person is rubbing you the wrong way you have two choices. You can choose to let it bother you. Or, you can decide not to let it bother you.


Think of it as an opportunity and actively look for that tiny positive thing. Remember that there is something positive in all encounters. Whether you stick around or walk away; keep in your thoughts: ""They have no idea of who I really am. It's okay if they don't care for me and truth is that if what they think bothers me it is because I kind of have that opinion of myself."" Most importantly though; remember that they are not you and that they have their own life, opinions, beliefs, and issues that have nothing at all to do with you. Nothing, nada, not a thing. Work on you, not them.

, Know that if you care about yourself and believe you have worth, nothing anyone says or does will bother you. Know that you are an awesome human being. Know that you are you  and there is no one like you. A beautiful creature always deserving of happiness and joy. Whether you believe in forces within or without your physical body, do know that your attitude, mood, enthusiasm, negativity, and in fact all of your emotions, affect the world around you. When you look at something in anger, you see ugly. When you look at something and appreciate it, you see beauty.  What you give is what you get and when we talk of giving, it is talking of happiness, fun, appreciation, not money or services.

, You might have noticed that if you are upset, nothing goes right. If you are sad, nothing inspires you. If you complain, the complaining never stops and the problem gets bigger and bigger for every new thought. If you talk to someone with a bad attitude, you start to behave just as bad. When you argue and push for your argument, the opponent pushes back even harder. It never stops. If you start thinking crap about anything, more crappy thoughts come to you and you get crappier every minute. It's a spiral that can't be stopped. But it doesn't have to be that way.


Back off from any argument; because feeling good is more important than being right. Look away from the ugly and focus to find something interesting, beautiful, fascinating, or silly somewhere near; because feeling good is more important than thinking that someone should fix this broken world. Move your attention from things you can't control anyway, because feeling good is more important than analyzing why you don't feel good. It leads nowhere. Your happiness benefits everyone around you. Everything looks brighter. Everything is more fun. Everything offer inspiration and insight if watched through slightly rose tinted glasses. It's okay to feel good. It's not selfish to be happy. Everyone benefits and the universe appreciates you.

, If you watch any channel for any length of time it is obvious that the world is in a bad way. Humans are doomed to sickness and misery. Nature is crying for your sympathy. Children are... War is.... politics, the economy, prisons, racism.... It is not that way. You know it's not that way. There is more positivity around this beautiful planet than there is misery. There is more joy than desperation. There are more good people than dictators. It's simply not true that the world is falling apart, and what is more important than that: even if it were, you are not responsible. There is nothing you can do to save this planet from all those imaginary threats that they want to frighten us with on the hourly news.


Tell yourself this: ""Okay, if I decide to feel miserable and scared  and guilty for the rest of my life, then maybe someone in a poor country can live happily for a while."" Say what? Is that not the most morbid and stupid plan ever? How can it possibly benefit anyone when you are frightened and overwhelmed by hyped up news stories? Who? anyone?  Turn it off. Decide not to watch or listen to the news for thirty days. See what happens.  By making that choice you are actually making the choice of caring for how you feel. You want to feel good. You want to be excited, loving, fun. You want to feel confident, enthusiastic, inspired, optimistic. If you can be that and still watch the news, you are a rare human being and you are way beyond this how-to.

, Meditation is not as difficult as people tend to imagine. What we suggest here is not  about lotus positions and fasting or solitude retreats in search for enlightenment. Forget all that. Now, if that is your thing, then do that. But that is not what we are talking about here. The goal is to calm the monkey brain for the purpose of clarity and simple well being. You can sit back in a comfortable chair, sit cross-legged if that works for you. There are meditation stools that are really comfortable even sitting on them for long periods of time. Lying down is an option too but if you find you fall asleep easily, you might want to choose something else.


It really is simple: Find your comfortable position, preferably where it's the perfect temperature, not a lot of distractions, no people bugging you. Now, breathe. Focus on your breathing. Follow it, listen to it, feel how it feels in your body, and count them if you want. A noise such as white noise, or calming music, a dripping faucet, cars in the distance can calm you down. Focus on those sounds and observe them not as bad noise but as something to focus your mind on. Breathe comfortably and allow the breathing to slow. Don't try to force it into some pattern that doesn't feel natural. It's supposed to be comfortable and relaxing.
An easy trick if the mind feels really too overwhelmed is to focus on the breathing and as you breathe in; count to three, breathe out and count to four. Counting as you breathe, not in between breaths. With just a little bit of time you will notice that the mind calms down a bit, slows down its frenzy, and more pleasant thoughts may come to you. never try to force thoughts away. You are a thinking being and trying to abolish thought with force is unnatural. Calm and well being will come naturally. If not this time, then the next time. The more you do it, the easier it gets, and the better you feel the better you will feel. Do it for the joy and not because someone said you should.

, We all want. We all need. We all imagine things. We have all daydreamed. Keep doing that but do it on purpose. Think of something you want. Now, just when you get the impulse to say: ""That's not realistic, i cant have that."" Back up a second. Stop that thought. Return to the thing you want. Consider it; it's shape, it's texture, it's name, it's actual realization. So what if your monkey brain is trying to keep you from dreaming? So what?  Imagine it, visualize it, and most importantly; feel the emotion of it. How would it feel if it was yours? How would it make you feel to have it in this moment. Go all out there and name the emotions. Maybe ease? Maybe freedom? Maybe love or relief or power? Say the words to yourself and take pleasure in them. A daydream feels good so simply let yourself feel good.

, You are more than your body. You have a mind, a consciousness, a history, a personality. Whether, again, you believe in powers beyond that physical body or not makes no difference. There is a true self that will guide you if you let it. Listen to your emotions. Listen to your body and appreciate all that is you. Your inner being, some would call it soul or source or perhaps even god, is your guide.


People do commonly refer to instinct or maybe gut feeling. The path to a different and happy reality is to listen to that guide. You can feel it when your inner you has an opinion differing from your monkey brain. Truth is, when you feel bad it's because you are not listening. You don't pay attention to the guide that shows you the way every moment. Whether you call it spirit or subconscious makes no difference. It knows what you want and when you decide to ignore what your true self is telling you; you choose to not care about how you feel. 
The very moment you make the decision to feel better, let yourself know about it. Be happy that you from now on will care about you. Speak it clearly in your mind or out loud: ""I want to feel good."", ""I want clarity and ease."", ""I can feel better, go farther, do more, and enjoy life no matter what might happen.""  That is your mantra but it must be true. Your wish must be sincere, your thoughts clear and decisive. Feel the joy in your body telling you that it's okay to want to feel good. It is how it should be. It is what you deserve. And what you want you will have.

, Be easy. Don't take it so seriously. Enlightenment doesn't require a life of suffering as many would have you think. Happiness doesn't require selflessness and sacrifice as some would want you to believe.  Enlightened means knowing yourself as part of the universe and truly experience heaven on earth as it's supposed to be. There is no condemnation, no judgement, and no ""wrong"" path.

,  We all have beliefs. They may be a faith in one god or another. It may be a belief that Wy-Fi signals are dangerous. It may be a fear that a spouse always betrays you. You may believe that all senators are greedy, that the neighbour looks at you funny when you get your mail, that GMOs are poisonous.  All those beliefs control your life. But we challenge you to consider whether your beliefs serve you or not. Maybe they do; then leave them be and enforce them when you feel that it's right. If you're not so sure, look at them and decide for yourself if it's something that makes you fearful or anxious, judgmental or critical to others.  Look at them and let your true self have a say in it. Does it make you feel joy to gossip about someone that you believe is a bad person? Really?  Then what is that uneasy feeling in your stomach after you spewed negativity all over the place? 


Try to stop judging others for thirty days. Think before you say anything negative about anyone. Find positive things to say. Find the beauty, find the joy, be someone that uplifts instead of brings down. We are all different, we all have values, we have beliefs. Let everyone be who they are even when you don't agree. Find that positive, find the joy, find the wonder in everything around you.  All of this can be applied to all things, all people, animals, governments, and every aspect of you.   Have fun because life is supposed to be fun. Be happy, receive happy, see happy. Now, the world is a different place and your reality is from this point exactly how you make it.

Travel to new places.,
Meet people with different points-of-view.,
Try new things.,
Explore your spirituality.",How to Develop Your Own Beliefs2," One of the most powerful ways to expand your worldview and develop your own beliefs is by seeing new places. Oftentimes, your pre-existing belief system is built around your own narrow experience. When you see the world beyond your own community, your experience broadens, and so do your beliefs.Plan to explore as much as you can. Depending on your budget, this might include visiting new states, countries, or continents. However, you don’t have to travel far to get a new perspective. Consider taking a foreign culture course at your local college or visiting a museum in your area.

, When you engage with people who are different than you, you can learn more about their belief system. In turn, you may better inform yourself on what beliefs suit you best. Strike up a conversation with someone whose background is different than your own.They could have an alternative political perspective, be from a different culture, or have been raised with a unique lifestyle.
If you are too nervous to chat with others, you might start out reading books about people who lead different lifestyles.

, Exploring new activities and ways of being can push you out of your comfort zone. As a result, you may develop new beliefs about yourself and the world around you.


Challenge yourself to learn a new skill like salsa dancing. Learn another language. Eat in a foreign restaurant. Include different colors or prints in your wardrobe than usual., Many people’s belief systems are grounded in moral decisions of right and wrong. You can empower your own belief system by experimenting with different spiritual practices or religious beliefs.Visit a different church or place of worship. Start a meditation practice. Or, spend more time in nature.
This might be challenging if the ideas are drastically different from what you were raised to believe. Take your exploration slowly by finding small ways to explore (e.g. reading a book versus attending a worship service) until you feel more comfortable.

Label your core values.,
Share your beliefs with others.,
Anticipate others' reactions to your beliefs.,
Ensure that your actions align with your beliefs.,
Anticipate a change in beliefs as you learn and grow.",How to Develop Your Own Beliefs3," After you have reviewed your pre-existing beliefs and explored alternatives, it can help to try to define your personal values. An important part of developing a belief system is figuring out what you stand for, and your values are basically the causes you consider important.


You can pinpoint your personal values by reflecting on times when you felt the happiest, most proud or satisfied. What was happening during these times? Try to label the factors that contributed to these feelings.In addition to reflection exercises, you can also complete a values inventory like the Personal Values Assessment., A big part of establishing your own belief system is making your ideas known to others. Each time you share your beliefs with someone else, you affirm them. Also, you can make your position clear with others who try to influence your beliefs.For instance, if your belief system has changed from that of family or friends, you might inform them. Say something like, “Well, actually my views on that have changed…” Then, briefly share your new position.
When you share your beliefs with others, avoid doing so defensively. Simply speak with polite confidence.

, If your new belief system is drastically different than that of your family members or friends, your disclosure may be met unfavorably. Prepare yourself for negative reactions, but don't allow their disapproval to make you doubt your decisions. Remember that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, even if those closest to you don't agree.A good way to respond is with open-mindedness and honesty. You might say, ""I know this may come as a shock to you. But I'm happy to answer any questions you have.""
Give them, and yourself, time to come to terms with a change in beliefs. Over time, your loved ones may come to support your beliefs, or at least not actively oppose them.

, Once you have confirmed your new belief system, regularly audit your everyday actions to be sure they are in line with your beliefs. You are happiest when your daily actions and choices support your core values and beliefs. Plus, when you live by your beliefs, you are able to be your most authentic self., Even after you have developed your own belief system, expect it to morph over time. As you travel, learn new things, meet new people, and have new life experiences, your perspective on various beliefs will likely change. This is completely normal, and okay."
"
Set the environment.,
Quiet your soul.,
Pray.,
Be unconventional.,
Listen.",How to Pray Without Distractions," Establish a routine time and place. You can have a prayer mat in a quiet place with no interruptions. Have environmental cues: light a candle, play reverent music (e.g. a CD of Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos).;
, We all have a lot on our minds every second of the day. Write out your cares, worries, daily to-do-list, then trust it under God's care and control. Ask God to help you let go to trust Him and connect with Him.

, There's no special formula. Praying is about communicating with the God of the universe and the one who loves you more than you'll ever know. Pray aloud or write down prayers in a prayer journal, leaving room to come back and fill in how God answered your prayer requests.


If you want structure: Jesus, gave this example to pray, ""Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."" (I encourage you to not just repeat these words found in Matthew 6:9-13 of the Bible, but to also use the format to base your personal prayers, i.e. to start by glorifying God for who He is to you, to submit to God, then to ask for your requests and God's daily provision, etc.)
You can also use books such as 31 Days of Prayer by Ruth Myers, Warren Myers, or 31 Days of Praise by Ruth Myers. These are great because they walk you through simple daily prayers that are powerful and personal.

, God is personal and can connect in unique ways with each person He created. Some people connect most with God by talking aloud while showering. Some people talk aloud with God while driving alone, acting like He is sitting in the passenger seat of their car like a listening friend. God is our most faithful listener.

, Communication goes both ways, and God speaks. He can speak through a still, small, reassuring voice of peace and love as you pray, but He also wants you to read all that he wrote in the Bible. The Psalms are excellent to read as you pray!

Can't find a time-out from your hectic schedule? You don't need a perfectly serene meditation room to pray effectively, though it helps some of us to be centered and calm. But you can pray anywhere, anytime, in any kind of environment. A quick prayer in the middle of a hectic work shift? Make it happen. A shout of praise after you score a touchdown? Good call. Driving down the highway during rush-hour? Just as long as you drive safely.;
, In some religions, it's common to prostrate yourself and touch your head to the ground during prayer. In others, sitting in the lotus position is essential to meditation and prayer. In others, raising your hand and rejoicing loudly is sometimes common. But there's no one way to pray except the way in which you feel the most comfortable communicating with your god.


If it helps to speak out loud, go ahead and do it. If you'd rather keep your prayers to yourself, that's perfectly fine too. It helps some practitioners to bow their heads and close their eyes during prayer, but it's also perfectly fine to leave your eyes open.
Speak normally. Prayer doesn't need to involve a lot of ""thou"" ""thee"" or ""thines."" The all-knowing, all-feeling being that you worship is smart enough to understand your language, whatever that language is.

, Prayer is a practice, a way of life. If you want to start praying effectively, try to set some time aside each day to pray. Even a few minutes each day can make a difference. Some common times for prayer include:


Before meals
Before sleep
After waking
During idle time
During stressful moments

, Learning more about prayer from a respected elder or experienced member of your religion can be quite helpful in learning the style and the substance that goes into prayer. Pray together and learn more. Learn the traditional prayers used in your religion, as well as ways to incorporate more informal prayers into your daily routine. Make time for prayer with others.

, A common aspect of many prayer traditions involves confronting your personal transgressions, guilt, and sins to your higher power as a means of atonement. In other words, if you're feeling guilty about something, prayer is an excellent opportunity to get it off your chest.


You don't need to make excuses for your actions or try to explain yourself. Just confront the things that you've done that you're feeling guilty about. What would you like to change about yourself? What would you like to change about your life?
Ask for forgiveness. Giving up some of yourself to a higher power can be a big challenge, and an emotional experience for many people. It can be humbling to ask for forgiveness, or to admit that you need help, but it's also one of the most important parts of prayer.

, Another important part of prayer for many believers is to give thanks. Think about the things you have and how fortunate you are to be alive in the world. Even if you're struggling, or feeling down, focusing on the things you're thankful for can be a good way of bringing yourself back up.


If it helps, come up with a list and keep it by your bedside, or on your table to reference when you pray. List the things you're thankful for.

, Many people pray to their god for protection, guidance, and wisdom. Many people need help. If you feel that you're struggling in the world and want to lean on your god, do it in prayer.


Try to stay focused on your feelings and your emotions, not on the specific details. You're not praying to ask god to strike down your boss, who works you too hard. You're praying for protection, for strength, and for guidance. Your asking for help.

, Prayer isn't a request line. Praying to ask for a bigger paycheck, a new car, or some rollerblades isn't the purpose of prayer, and might even be considered insulting or blasphemous in some cultures. The purpose of prayer is not to receive material goods. The purpose of prayer is to develop a personal relationship with your god.

, Many religions have a detailed series of specific prayers to use for specific occasions. A Catholic may recite the ""Hail Mary"" several times a day, for example.



Learn the traditions of your religion when you pray during formal worship services. Again, there's no one way, but it helps the flow of the service if you understand basically when it's time to participate in a call and response, when it's time to kneel, and other ritualized prayer activities.

, Generally, prayer is a way of centering yourself and focusing your attention on communicating with the higher power you believe in. Some religions have very ritualized methods of prayer, while others are more informal. Regardless of your religion, however, the most important aspect of prayer is developing the correct attitude.


Be humbled. Again, prayer isn't like writing to an advice column, or making withdrawals from a bank. Remember who you're talking to, and who you're opening yourself up to. Be respectful and speak with humility.
Don't try to feel god doing anything while you pray, and don't try to have an ""experience."" The loudest in the room is not the strongest, and by no means is the quietest the most wise. If you feel emotional, that's fine, but you don't need to be taken in by dramatic displays of ""devotion.""

, Seldom will the clouds part and a booming voice will drop a new iPad into your life. That's not how prayer works. Try to stay aware of subtle changes in your life and opportunities that present themselves. If you ask for guidance with a new job, don't expect that a mysterious letter will show up under your door five minutes later with explicit instructions. Watch out for new acquaintances, opportunities to shine in the way you shine best, and stay strong. Have the faith that you'll see the right path in prayer.


Even if you're a devout believer, you're still the one with the free will to choose your own path. You're the one who's in charge of your own life, and it'll be your job to make the right decision. If you asked for a job, go look for one. If you asked for your children to behave better, teach them to do so.
Prayer is an effective tool for many people, but it's also not an excuse for avoiding making plans. You still have to live your life. Not writing a will when you're sick because ""God will provide"" is being irresponsible. Not finding work to feed your family because you're ""praying for food"" is a misunderstanding of prayer.

, Praying together can be a powerful experience. Whether you go to church to pray or want to hold informal prayer groups in your own home or elsewhere, getting together to worship your god is an essential part of the experience of belief. You can accomplish a lot together.


It's also common to make ""prayer requests"" in some churches, when some people are going through rough patches. If a loved one is sick, you might reach out to others to pray together. Find others through your church or in your area who pray regularly.

, Make prayer a part of your life. Stay in touch with the higher power in whom you believe and return to prayer daily. Whenever and however you choose to pray, if you want to pray effectively it needs to be a regular part of your life.


If you haven't prayed for a while, don't be afraid to start again. It's like riding a bike–you may feel a little shaky at first, but you've still got it in there. Try again.

Do good deeds to counterbalance the sin.",How to Deal With Sin," Many religions have definitions of sin, and there are general societal norms for morality also that might vary from culture to culture. In order to deal with sin, it must first be identified, and then acknowledged.There are right and wrong reasons for everything, and any coping method you use will be more effective if you are sincere about wanting to address the sin. For example, you'll find the process harder if you're only sorry you were caught. Ideally, your reason would be along the lines of bettering yourself or pleasing God, if you are religious.Sin is not a concept to take lightly if you want to live free from condemnation and at peace with yourself and others. Some sins can really hurt others and yourself. Be ever wary of these, and don't minimize the damage that's been caused. Sin is often a selfish act; if you find yourself doing something that hurts someone else but satisfies a want of yours, that’s probably a sin (same if someone else is doing it).
If you are religious, seek out a religious text, like the Bible, or religious authorities, and truly understand their definitions of sin. While most people believe that sin is the 'bad stuff' people do, sin is much more than that in many religions. Sin is any deviation from the perfection (wholeness/completeness) of God. So while sins can be actions, thoughts and attitudes can be sinful, as well. The root of sin is the human desire to put oneself ahead of others.;
, Sin doesn't exist in a vacuum. People sin – especially if it’s habitual sin – because of underlying problems or issues, in many cases.


Sin, especially habitual sin, is often the symptom of a much greater issue in a person's life. Examine your life. What sins have you been committing? What are the causes of these sins? Really dig deep, and ask yourself the hard questions.
If the sin came from someone else, help that person examine his or her life and the underlying reasons that might have led him or her to sin. This can be much more effective than responding to sin with blame and anger., Understand that everyone can fall. Secondly, we have to acknowledge that we don't have what it takes to defeat sin entirely. This principle is key; it will lead us to a humble life, overflowing with gratitude.


Don't ever dismiss yourself, or another person, as doomed to Hell. Only God chooses that, and, as much as we think we understand what can get you there, it is not our place.
One of the best ways to get over a sin is not to think too much about what you did, but what you did not do. If you already know how to correct your particular sin, then simply do so. It will be hard, but do not give up; giving up hope is by far the worst possible sin. Try to make up for the sin as inconspicuously as possible.

, Some sins, such as addictions, take other people to overcome and understand them. Find someone you trust to assist you, and be cautious of mentioning your struggle around judgmental people.


Overcoming sin isn't a shameful thing, and you certainly don't need unnecessary negative input if it can be avoided. Find balance. On one hand, you don't want to ignore your sins, as they can and will drag you down, but on the other hand, you need to not be too hard on yourself. If you're doing your best, you're on the right path.
Talk to God if you are religious. God isn't unapproachable, although He does want to be treated with respect. Spend time every day for personal prayer and scripture study. To study the scriptures, you can either read it from front to back, or you can use the Topical Guide to look up key words or phrases. So long as you're sincerely paying attention to what you're reading, there really isn't a wrong way to do it.
If you cannot stop yourself from committing a certain sin or a past sin seems to be taking over your life, don't be too proud to seek help if you are not religious. Psychiatrists are not looking to expose you in any way and may be able to help you conquer your struggles.

, Tell the sinner gently if you think what he or she did was wrong, but there is usually no need to repeat yourself. Avoid overt judging words.


Show the sinner what to do if they ask. If you come on too heavy, or mention Hell to them, it could damage the relationship.
If someone was injured or hurt as a result of the sin, help that person. If the sinner doesn't yet feel the need to repent, avoid situations that might cause you or your family to get hurt by the other person.

, You can subtly educate the sinner about how to repent, without driving them away.

Do this in a kind and helpful manner, without using overt judging words or castigating the sinner. Instead, explain what religious texts say about sin.
Couch your comments in empathy. Let the sinner know how you see the sin harming them and others around them. Focus on the good you see in them and on the potential the sinner can realize.

, This may take time, especially if they hurt you, but you're not helping anyone by holding a grudge. Be open to restitution. Letting go of anger heals you, first and foremost.Forgiveness doesn't mean that what they did was okay; forgiveness is often for your own peace of mind. Don't judge. Don't be in any way cruel to the sinner because of his or her decisions. The sinner is still a human being.Do not press matters as that will make it worse. Patience and respect are the best cures for another's sin. Wait for signs of improvement (or lack thereof), and respect that the other person would have just as hard a time as you would, if not harder. When the time comes and the person has made the first change, congratulate the person (calmly, no parties) for working towards the better.

, Firstly, you need to acknowledge that indeed, you have sinned, whether against yourself, others or God. The very fact you are asking the question means you recognize that something is amiss in your life. This is most encouraging.


One of the most difficult things good people have to face is the fact that we all sin. Good people do not easily see that they in fact commit sin. Identify what the sin is. Ask for forgiveness.
This means admitting you did something wrong, to the people you hurt, if applicable, and then confess it to God, if you are religious. Life is hard. We've all had times when we've done things we know we shouldn't have.

, If completely stopping the sin is not possible overnight, resolve to do and be better. God wants us to grow and be better, but He understands that perfection is a process.

Once you have done this and know in your heart you are forgiven, you may make restitution where appropriate. It is advisable to remain on your knees before God until you feel forgiven, if that's your religious belief.
No trite “I am sorry” is going to be okay. It needs to be a complete turning from what you did, leaving it behind through a 180-degree turn going in the opposite direction., If it's getting drunk, don't go to places where you can buy alcohol. If it's sleeping around or adultery, then don't be alone with the person who tempts you.


If it's greed, find a way to figure out what is triggering those greedy episodes, and then set your mind to avoid those situations. Lying? Take a breath before answering. Weigh it out in your mind before you tell that next lie. Ask yourself, is that sin more important than your soul?
It's good to get an accountability partner to help. This could be someone who has been involved in your religion longer than you. If you are Catholic, this may mean Confession. Talk to someone. While it may be hard to trust people these days, if you know someone who will take your secret to the grave (lucky you) then tell him or her! You may be surprised with the advice the person has to offer. If you don't have anyone to talk to about this, you're definitely not alone. Try writing about it.

, Asking God to help you control your impulses (i.e. drinking or gambling) is the first step if you are religious.


However, it is you who ultimately chooses whether to fight against the sin or let it slide. God can lend a hand yes, but mostly He lets you have the choice. And it's not a quick-fix all of the time, as it will take work.If someone else is sinning, then pray for them. Ask God to help open their eyes as well, but also yours. Nobody should be bashed for their beliefs/values/ideas, so secretly praying and continuing to love that person unconditionally whether a friend, family member or spouse, can go a long way.

, If you’ve sinned, and you feel really badly about it, try to do some positive things for other people.


This will help focus your energy on good behaviors instead of the sin, and it could reduce your risk of re-offending. Fill your mind and life with good things.
Don’t brag or boast about these good works. Do them quietly, and with humility.

Think about why you can't stand them.,
Ask yourself, ""Why do I want to pray for this person?"",
Start to pray.,
Strike up a friendship (or at least try).,
Take responsibility.",How to Pray for Someone You Can't Stand," Did they hurt you or someone you know (physically or mentally)? If so, you may just have to forgive and forget. Or are they just an annoying person? If that's the case, you don't have to be around them while you pray for them. You can do that in the privacy of your own home.;
, Since no one is perfect, something is bothering them. Figure out what that is (this may require some actual talking to them). Who knows, you might even discover why they're so mean, or do an annoying habit.

, When it comes time to pray for them, be very focused. Don't think about what they do that annoys you, think about everything they're going through. Ask God to make everything better in their lives, and to make your relationship stronger.

, They'll probably appreciate the gesture, and you'll feel a ton better. If they're rude, don't retaliate, just let it go.

, Remember that your actions are your responsibility, don't give an eye for an eye until it's an absolute necessity.

Identify the problem or conflict that has been brought to your attention.,
Take full responsibility for this problem or conflict being in your reality.,
Ask that errors in our thoughts, words, actions and deeds be cleaned.,
Trust that changes have occurred on a Divine level and that any corrections made within are corrected for all those involved.",How to Practice Ho'oponopono," Remove any preconceptions about the subject that automatically pop into your head. For example, if the problem has to do with someone else, release the automatic thought that it is the other individual’s problem and has nothing to do with you.;
, Assume that everything in your world is a product of past thoughts and deeds, and the memories attached to those deeds bring the resulting problem. ‘If we can accept that we are the sum total of our past thoughts, emotions, words, deeds and actions and that our present lives and choices are colored or shaded by this memory bank of the past, then we begin to see how a process of correcting or setting aright can change our lives, our families and our society.’—Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona

, This is accomplished through a simple mantra, or prayer to Divinity/God/Love. Use the four-part prayer to ask for forgiveness.


I love you.
I am sorry.
Please forgive me.
Thank you.

, This involves the acknowledgement that we are all a part of a greater “whole”, that is, we are all connected on a higher level and there is no need to analyze, figure out, solve, manage, cope with, or control problems. All that is needed is to go directly to the Creator and ask that the error/thought/memory be corrected and cleaned. Only Divinity can do this. Divinity/Creator/Love knows us and what memory is replaying. This is merely an exercise in letting go; there is no need to invite conflict with one’s religious beliefs or non-beliefs.

Focus on the positives.,
Be grateful for the little things.,
Keep a balanced outlook.,
Be patient.",How to Practice Gratitude1," Practicing gratitude will require you to focus on the things in your life that you are thankful for. You'll need to pay attention and look for all the good things in your day and in your life. Seeing all the positive aspects in your life will help you realize just how much you have to be grateful for.Periodically ask yourself something like “What am I grateful for right now?” or “What am I thankful for today?”
Be on the lookout for small compliments you might receive or little gestures of kindness from others.
Focus on the positives, no matter how small they might seem. This could be a bunch of pretty flowers that you spot on the way to work, or a beautiful sunset in the sky on your walk home. Take a moment to appreciate the positives in your life, even if they seem insignificant.;
, Not every good thing in life will be obvious or a big deal, which can cause you to miss a lot of good things in life. Throughout the day, try to think of all the little things that you were thankful for. Chances are, you'll be able to find a lot of small events that will add up to one excellent day. Try to be aware of all the good in your life, big or small, to help you practice feeling grateful.For example, a sunny day with warm weather might be something you're thankful for.
Even if it's a rainy day, you might be grateful for the chance to stay at home and clean or enjoy something indoors.
Things like having a clean pair of clothes to wear or a comfortable bed to sleep in might be little things you're grateful for.

, Although you are working to focus on the good things in your life and being thankful for them, you won't want to ignore challenges or negative aspects. Disregarding difficult things and focusing only on the good in your life can cause you to become unbalanced and may even cause trouble in your life. You can still acknowledge a challenge without it bringing you down or preventing you from practicing gratitude.Ignoring a serious issue may actually be detrimental. Try being grateful that you were made aware of an issue or that you have the ability to meet a challenge.
You could try thinking about how grateful you are for the support of your friends or family during a tough time.

, It's okay to feel negatively about tough situations. Remember that life won't always be smooth sailing. If you are having difficulty finding things to be grateful for, don't worry. Take a few moments to relax and find a couple of things that you feel thankful for to help you get back on track. You might even find that a tough time or challenge is something to thankful for itself.If you find yourself being resentful or overly negative, don't let it bother you. Readjust your outlook, try to find at least one thing you are thankful for and resume your practice.
It can be difficult to settle into this new way of thinking. Be patient with yourself and don't be too critical if you find yourself being more negative than you'd like.

You can also look back at any time to remember all the good things you were thankful for.

The more you practice gratitude, the easier it will become.

, Picking a time to focus on the things you are thankful for can help you make your practice a habit.

Write “thank you” notes.,
Communicate directly.,
Offer prayers.,
Adopt new habits.,
Appreciate yourself.",How to Practice Gratitude3," A simple way for you to show your gratitude to others is to write a thank-you note. You don't need to send these notes if you don't want to, writing them can be enough to shift your focus onto the things you are thankful for. Try jotting down a few thank-you notes throughout the day to help remind you about all the reasons you're glad someone is in your life.Feel free to write your notes however you want.
Express yourself freely and explore what you love about a person or how much they mean to you.
You don't need to write notes about other people. You can try writing yourself thank-you notes as well.

, A great way to share your gratitude with others is to let them know how thankful you are for their presence in your life. Try contacting someone you are grateful for directly and letting them know just how much they mean to you. Letting someone know how special they are can help both of you feel great and share your gratitude.You can try calling someone on the phone, writing a letter or meeting face-to-face.
Try talking about something good they've done for you and discuss how it has impacted your life. You may say, ""I really appreciate you being there for me during that difficult time. It helped me stay strong and feel supported. Thank you.""

, If you follow a particular faith or religious belief, offering simple prayers of thanks can be a great way to practice gratitude. Praying and offering your thanks can be a good way for you to express how much the good things in your life mean and can help you keep a positive and grateful outlook on life.You can pray silently if it makes you feel more comfortable.
You can offer prayers of thanks before a meal.

, You might want to try showing your gratitude in a different way if an old method has become routine. Expressing your gratitude in the same way can get old and lose its impact. To help keep things fresh and interesting, try new ways of showing your gratitude from time to time.You can change the way in which you express your gratitude. You might journal the things you're thankful for and then try talking about them with a friend. Or you may channel your gratitude into doing good acts for others, such as community work, or spend time with a friend who needs support.
You can try changing the area of your life that you focus on. For example, you can be grateful for the people in your life one week and then focus on the material things in your life the following week.

, Although you may have a lot to be thankful for in your life, you won't want to forget yourself. Taking some time to appreciate yourself can be a great way to practice gratitude and boost your sense of well-being and self-esteem. Try to think about all the things you are thankful for about yourself to help you practice gratitude.Spend a few minutes with your hand over your heart and thank yourself for your hard work and all the things you've done that day.
Try thinking about all the challenges you've met and overcome.
Take a few moments to look in the mirror and say some nice things to yourself.

Remember that our subconscious responds to the ideas represented in subjects and verbs.,
Be constructive.,
Accept that life brings challenge.,
Think of your past, and some of the times that were painful and difficult.,
Give yourself some uninterrupted time to spend on this visualization.",How to Look for the Positive," That means when you think ""I'm not going to sit around all day today."",your mind focuses on ""I sit"". Instead, set goals and motivate yourself with positive statements such as ""I will go for a walk."" or ""I can do my homework after dinner."";
, Faced with a difficult situation or person, it is natural for all of us to feel frustrated. The challenge here is to put effort into looking for something positive, even when you don't feel like it.


If your boss has berated you in front of colleagues, you will feel embarrassed and angry. And justly so. But you are the one who will come out ahead when you find something positive in the situation. Even the thought that he or she is the one who behaved inappropriately, and that everyone is aware of it, can help you to deal with the range of emotions you're experiencing. Rather than think about changing jobs, especially in this job market, look for clues that will benefit you.

While delivered poorly, was the information accurate?
Have you been taking your responsibilities lightly?
Is there a reason why someone might misinterpret your actions?


If none of that applies, and you are on top of your game, sometimes it helps to label the other person with a naughty title, and decide that they just aren't capable of good manners right now, and go on with your day.

, Sometimes life deals hard blows - job loss, financial strain, the death of a loved one. Even minor difficulties, such as a fender bender, your teenager's poor grades, or a burnt roast, can engender feelings of anger, depression, or a misplaced sense of deserving ""bad luck"". Remember that, while life is what we make it, and our attitude contributes greatly to what comes to us, life also just happens. Some of the best people have had to deal with extreme difficulties. So, what makes them the best people? They've learned to shine in spite of those hard times. Or maybe they shine because of them.

, All of the events of your past have contributed to who you are now. Look for the strengths you have gained through your experiences. Look for the people who have come into your life, even if for a short time, and what a blessing they are. Look for the wisdom you've gained in learning how to get through the tough spots.

, Whatever your situation is, imagine it going as badly as you are able. Take it to the ridiculous, terrifying, ludicrous extreme. Let yourself experience that low, and imagine how you would deal with it. Now begin to construct your reaction. What you are doing is becoming pro-active. You are creating a situation of growth and learning. Your mind will utilize your abilities and strength, and you will have hope.

Study the cornea and lens system in the animal kingdom and see whether you individually find that as you breathe, that exclusive way to getting oxygen would imply intelligent design as the oxygen goes throughout the body yet, red blood cells do not and ""must not"" deliver oxygen to one particular area of body tissues via the blood (the corneal lens system).,
Search online what you yourself can learn and think about all other cells and tissues of your body being otherwise served by hemoglobin, a biomolecule that can temporarily bind to oxygen (the blood's color is due to the red color of hemoglobin in the ""red blood cell.""),
Ask biologists whether you would need to get an artificial corneal implant if blood capillaries (small blood vessels) and red blood cells could and did flow through them and the corneal tissues which are made up of 5 layers (similar to totally transparent skin) which is unparalleled in the body, how could had be by chance?

,
Use formal logic A implies B of how obviously you would lose vision if the fluid in the hollow lens which is full of clear fluid became infused with capillaries, but that is a different issue.,
Ask eye doctors, biologists and bio-chemist whether the visible light wavelengths can or can not penetrate the relatively gigantic red blood cells:


How did light ever penetrate past capillaries that would intervene within the path of the transmission of light to the retina in the back of the eye.,
Ask yourself and others what you/they think about this:


""Why does blood not go to the cornea."",
Research personally and you will find that the cornea does and must get its oxygen ""directly"" and not using the heart, lungs and blood that is exclusive and unfathomable necessity that blind luck solved?

,
Consider whether this was a coincidence?--or was that an ingenious part of the plan to enabled the cornea to get its oxygen supply directly from the air.,
Check the corneal structure and function:


The Cornea is composed of 5 cell layers: Epithelium, Bowman's Layer, Stroma, Descemet's Membrane, and Endothelium.,
Think about this--if the cornea did not exist at all or did not have 100% functionality, then the the rest of the lens area eye (iris, etc.),
Think about this: the rest of the eye couldn't wait for the cornea to clear up so it needed to be designed to be right to make the eye even possible.

,
Analyze why the worthless eye evolved for the eons (billions of years) that it would evidently have taken for the cornea to become clear (transparent)--as it never would have had any value at all otherwise because it would be unsighted if blood had supplied the oxygen!

,
See if you agree that the cornea had to be created in a very narrow manner.,
Consider and explain this:


""How could unknowing; unthinking; unsighted evolution figure out that blood could not be used to feed the eye its oxygen?,
Deduce whether it is by mere chance that the cornea is the only living, tissue in the entire body to be totally separately supplied with oxygen?",How to Imply Intelligent Design in the Origin of the Cornea ( Creationism),"


Avoid believing that evolution could work through the problems that intelligent design can solve including the corneal transparency as you study Darwinian theories of forming life inorganically without guidance at the origins--plan--or intelligent design.;
, Wikipedia:Red_blood_cells

,, You would not be able to see.

,
Why or how would there even be a retina as blood would have been or if it ""ever"" was the source of oxygen for the cornea (if it evolved for billions or millions of years).

,
""Is it due to its function and is it a design feature that is not the expected way to get oxygen?""
""Why can the cornea never have oxygen delivered by the bloodstream to the cornea.""

,, The cornea has its own private breathing ability:

,
The cornea protects the rest of the eye from foreign material and germs, but it also acts as the eye's outermost transparent lens, focusing the entry of light into the eye.
The ""correct"" shape of the cornea contributes part of the eye's total focusing power!!

, of the eye would lack protection and lose much of its focusing ability!

,,, It is extremely specialized:


""Because transparency is of prime importance the cornea does not have blood vessels; it receives nutrients via diffusion from the tear fluid at the outside and the aqueous humor at the inside and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibers that innervate it.""Wikipedia:Cornea


,
And then, how did that mindless system decide how to not send blood to the cornea?
Was that a stroke of genius by an uncoordinated, non-managed system called Darwin's Theory? (You think so or not?)

, Not through the lungs!

Consider a church you may be currently attending.,
See that God has many Names.,
Let go of the framework.,
Recognize that God is not looking for people to zap.",How to Lose Your Religion," If it is a Christian church, read that, and understand the mis-perceptions you may have been laboring under. You can lose your religion right where you are, or explore the many churches that have sprung up in answer to organized religion.
The Protestant movement was defined in just this way, and all we are really discussing is a continuation of this spirit, which could conceivably even be found in a Catholic church, or a Jewish synagogue.
Meaningful rituals have their place for many, and must be considered religion, but we are really talking about the essence of the place; is it an incubator, where you go to reconnect, branch off, and fruit from? Or a once weekly chore that is endured for a couple hours, no life in it for you? Is this a result of your attitude, or theirs? Or neither one; just a question of fit?
See also that both descriptions can apply to individuals in the same congregation, and that losing your religion is a personal journey, one which can be more jarring than 'finding' it, surely, but one in which the payoff makes it worth the effort.God is not a religious Being.


Really assess where you are going to connect with like-minded people spiritually. If you aren't in any group, you are denying yourself. If your current congregation is not a sanctuary for you, decide whether you may be a better fit somewhere else.It doesn't have to be a church, but it could be.
These are going to be people that spiritually feed you; but a pointed conversation to this effect may not necessarily ever even occur. It will also serve you to understand that you can be spiritually fed by someone, and not necessarily agree with every single word they say.
See that Christ has many Names, and ""...wherever two or three are gathered in my Name"" has a spiritual meaning that a literal interpretation can deny.;
, One of the biggest problems with religion is that it seeks to define God, and then defend that image. Religions arise to divide, and divide again, due to their differences; seek where you agree. The Bible is chock~full of anti-religion at offense to just such walls.Practically speaking , this step will manifest for you when you are able to see God outside your particular religion, in people that probably would not agree with or understand your literal conception of Him.
Resulting in condemnation, possibly, from the upper echelons of your 'church' when you mention it (kudos for that, by the way), but oh well.

, This is often how losing one's religion has been described, at least coming from the Baptist religion. Catholics tend to report continued identification with meaningful rituals, and less chance of actually changing congregations, suggesting a different experience.
A very small sampling of Jews who have lost their religion have indicated that this is possibly toughest for them, for the obvious reason that their religion is so bound up in their heritage; however, or because of this, they seem to be some of the most committed, spiritually.
""Luther says, drawing on ancient tradition, that there are three articles of faith: 1)Creation; 2)Redemption; 3)Sanctification. Yet if we skip over creation--which Protestant and Catholic theology has been doing for four centuries--then is not redemption distorted? And sanctification as well?""Matthew Fox, Original Blessing

, It's common for an organized religion to keep its members in thrall with dire procedural warnings or proclamations about being the only ""right"" way. Christians commonly misinterpret ""the only way is through Christ"" to mean ""our version of Christ.""
Proclaiming ""Jesus is my Savior"" to everyone you meet will not get you into Heaven. See that ""No one comes to the Father, except through Me,"" should be interpreted spiritually.


Understand that God uses imperfect people to accomplish His will, and that as long as you are earnestly seeking Him, your discernment will serve you just fine. You do not still need some earthly mediator (as in B.C.) between you and God; practices and decisions about spiritual affairs that may make you uncomfortable (for instance) may be opportunities for you to enter the light, letting the chips fall where they may.
Trust that God delights in your unique way of producing fruit.

When you relax and turn inward, you can encounter the loving compassion of your Soul. Tip: Find a teacher whose voice is comfortable and soothing., Your emotions connect you to your Soul. Let yourself journal and express the repressed emotions that have been bottled up inside you. What lies beneath your repressed feelings is your creativity, passions, intuition and imagination. It is like finding buried treasure. The price you have to pay is your willingness to feel, accept, own and express those uncomfortable emotions of anger, hurt, disappointment and fear. When you do, you'll create a more harmonious space for your Soul to dwell., ""How can I serve?"" ""Who could I call to lift their spirits?"" When you give out of service and unconditional love you feed and heal your Soul. Being kind, loving and supportive of others is its own reward."

Worship wherever you may be.,
Meet at a place of worship.,
Practice habits of prayer and meditation.",How to Honor God2," You can dedicate a part or all of a room of your house as a place of prayer and worship. For example, you are not compelled to go to worship with others. Instead, you might often worship at home, alone or with others. Your worship might include candles, incense, and images or statues of spiritual importance to your faith, if any.


Depending on which faith you are part of, you can substitute items of your faith at this place. Additionally, if you do not have a religion you can choose items of significance or meaning to you to place in your shrine.
Worshiping at home can be a good practice for maintaining a healthy prayer life. You can use your worship space simply for daily prayer or meditation.;
, Invite others to share, and commune with the people in the traditions of your faith. Worshiping with others can enhance your feeling of awe. Awe is a sense of our smallness in the face of a great purpose, being or presence. People who experience more awe in creation may be more likely to help others and engage in working for the good of the group. Many places of worship have beautiful, awe inspiring art and teachings. They often contain and teach symbols of the faith, which represent a prominent doctrine. And, fellowship with the people at the meeting place.

, Prayer and meditation can help you to regulate your negative emotions. Prayer can act like an invisible social support to help reinforce a positive self image. If you practice prayer, pray anywhere, at all times, or find a quiet place and time to talk to God about your concerns and the things in your life you are grateful for.
Consider keeping a prayer journal. When you journal, it allows you to sort through the emotional pain in your life and orient yourself to the things that matter to you. Studies show that patients with life threatening diseases benefited physically and emotionally from regularly keeping journals about their stressful experiences. Practice prayer, meditation, and spiritual mindfulness regularly. These require that you still yourself and concentrate the mind to cease random thoughts and channel a connection with a larger presence. "
"
Do small but helpful things for others voluntarily, not for attention or notice.,
Volunteer with an organization or a group that helps people.,
Do not over commit!,
Ask someone to do volunteer work with you.",How to Honor God3," You can honor God by performing good actions for others more casually in your everyday life. Additionally, helping others can help increase your overall appreciation, enjoyment, enlightenment and quality of life. Change up the small, nice things you do for others to keep it new for you. How can you put others needs even-with yours, and avoid pressing for minor desires and grievances to live a more humble life, outwardly and inwardly, for honoring others and God?Yield to a car to let them merge in traffic, and merge gradually, not haltingly
Make food/a meal for a hungry person, not just for a friend or family member
Smile, not proudly, as nicely holding the door open for someone
Be a productive and thoughtful co-worker, not boastful
Provide a needy person some clothing or other necessity

, Take time to make sure you find a good volunteer match for you. Look into volunteer work that lines up with your interests. You might try local places of worship or charity, or use the Yellow Pages under ""Volunteer Center"" or ""Volunteer Clearinghouse"", or you can look online at Volunteermatch.org or 1-800-volunteer.org to find opportunities in areas near you. Consider the following types of volunteering:Tutoring or volunteering at a school.
Translating for immigrants, if you speak another language
Coaching a team, if you play a sport
Cleaning up and working at a local park or wildlife refuge
Working at a local hospital, old folks home, or clinic
Calling people for fundraisers from home

, Over committing to helping others is stressful and will hurt your ability to serve others well. You want to be able to do good things for others with a good attitude. Take some time to consider whether you have the time before committing to do something.


If you have already committed, consider finishing out a portion of the work and then stepping up for another effort. Communicate openly about what is going on with you. People understand that others are busy and will respect you if you communicate with them honestly.
Do not be afraid to go back to volunteering for the same organization once you have time to commit again. Pick back up with volunteering, if you had to take a break.

, Doing things with others often helps provide the motivation you will need to follow through with the work you want to do. In addition, it can help you bond as a friend in the work experience you will have and the new people that you might meet.


Consider doing volunteer work with your family, spouse or significant other. This kind of work could help give your relationships healthy perspective and can help create a sense of purpose outside of yourselves.

Accept your opportunities and your limitations.,
Forgive and give grace beyond what people deserve, that you want them or God to give to you.,
Think about yourself less often.,
Show that your are grateful.,
Encourage others to share and do your part to avoid self-centering but to be open to growth and sharing empowerment, not by unnecessary coercion, demands or controlling others.,
Avoid acting entitled such as expecting to be rewarded, thanked or complimented for good activities.,
Practice service, helping the weak, and don't seek or care about impressiveness or unrealistic, ""upward mobility"" or deceitful riches for what would profit a person, if he gains the World but losses his soul?,
Assume that you do not have all of the answers.,
Let peace and good things happen that you may not understand or are out of your control.,
Expect, and appreciate other's knowledge in the faith differing, greater or lesser, from your experience, achievement, expertise or study.",How to Honor God4," Be proactive about who you can be and are. The less you have to prove yourself to others, the more you can honor God. When you experience conflict with others, own your responsibilities. Knowing your faults and accepting them will also allow you to learn from your mistakes and grow. This kind of behavior helps build strong social bonds For example, if your friend is angry at you for being late, do not become defensive. Tell them, ""I apologize, I want to become more mindful of my time.""
Seeing and owning your problems can make them seem less fearful and more possible to overcome. This positive attitude can help you make positive changes in your habits.

, Accept and do not dwell on your or another's mistake, but concentrate on specific things you can do to give God's saving grace and be improving lives in concrete ways, as much as you have opportunity.

, Armor yourself with kindness, rightness, humility, grace and peace, not tricking or cheating but loving others advancement and their good marks. Worrying about oneself less, makes one better able to be more connected with others. Putting off the self for the others benefit and not demanding perfection from yourself, either, honors God's through serving his creation. , Gratitude creates a sense that you have benefited from other people and from things they do and say. When you become more aware of your own dependence on the people. Thank people and accept their importance and share all the hope, peace and other resources that you have, the more you will be able to realize that it is not all about you.


Keep a gratitude journal; this practice can improve your psychological well being. Write down at least three things that you are thankful for. And do your gratitude writing on the daily. , When you are free from being center of attention, you can work to empower others, denying yourself some prerogatives/perks. Strengthening others creates a stronger community better able to work toward a common good. You can become a powerful leader when you know how to effectively build up others sense of achievement.


Some of the most impactful people who have lived have been spiritual leaders, for example Buddha, Gandhi, Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King and Muhammad.

, Acting entitled means that one indicates he or she should get certain things for doing well. Feeling as if deserving of things but not getting them, one will end up being resentful or bitter. It is difficult to have a good attitude and love others while bitter, because of being stuck thinking about things one doesn't have.


If you don't feel like you are owed things, then you can work more freely for others without expecting things in return.

, Do not worry about your failures but make them temporary and continue your achievements immediately. Instead of grooming and sharing irritations, aim at working well and worrying less about yourself. So, concentrate more on the bigger-picture and assisting one another, through service -- and worship God by service to the common or poor people. , Often people who are humble are more tolerant of others. Humble people do not need to be aggressive or defensive about their beliefs. Being patient and listening to other beliefs and ideas, even when you experience hardships can honor God by peace and kindness. This will allow you to grow stronger and learn more about God and yourself.

,


Get out of the way of the work of God by working for voluntary community including through individual efforts and in groups such as at places of worship.

,


Honor God by rewarding good faith and goodwill by graciousness and sincere condolences in grief and congratulations in good times.
Honor God by giving credit to other people, by accepting who and what they are and can offer, enjoying time spent with others in fellowship.

Figure out how you want your life to look.,
Compare your ideal vision to your present life circumstances.,
Consider whether you have realistic or unrealistic expectations for your life.,
Set some goals for yourself.",How to Have Hope1," People often struggle to hope for a better tomorrow because they don’t know what it might look like. Before you can have hope it might be necessary to first figure out what type of life you imagine as the most desirable. Take some time to consider your ideal life and what it would include.Ask yourself: “If I could wake up tomorrow and have any life, what would it be like?” Think about as many details as possible. What would your house look like? What would your friends be like? What kind of activities would you participate in?
You may find it helpful to write out your vision for your life so that you can review it and revisit it from time to time.;
, After you figure out what kind of life you would like to have in an ideal world, compare that life to your present life circumstances. Doing so can help you to determine what areas of your life are already in line with your vision, or if you are headed in the right direction.


For example, if you envision yourself 40 pounds thinner, consider what you are doing right now to get you to that goal. Are you eating healthy foods? Controlling your portions? Exercising regularly? What do you need to move closer to your vision?
As you reflect on your life, consider your current circumstances. Have any of the aspects of your ideal vision already been manifested in your life?

, In order to have hope, it is important to make sure that the vision you have for yourself is realistic. If your vision is not realistic, it may cause you to feel hopeless. Consider your vision for your life and try to determine if your vision is realistic. If not, you may need to make some adjustments so that your vision is something that you can achieve.


For example, imagine your vision is to be a millionaire, but you don’t know what type of job you would want to get you there. In this case, you should consider starting with goals that are more relevant to your current life conditions.

, Having goals to work towards is one of the best ways to have hope. After you have developed a vision for your life, take time to set some goals. Write your goals out and work hard to achieve them. To improve your chances of reaching your goals, make sure that the goals you set are SMART goals. This acronym stands for the following features:Specific—the goal is targeted rather than broad and/or vague
Measurable—the goal can be quantified (measured with numbers)
Action Oriented—the goal is something that you can actively work towards and control
Realistic-the goal is something you can actually achieve with the resources available to you
Time Bound—the goal has a beginning and ending or a deadline that you will hold yourself to

Realize that God is God and you are not in charge of the universe, God is.,
Do not be judgmental of others.,
Remember that prayer is about making requests, not telling God what to do.,
Remember to stay humble when you pray.,
Know that sometimes God does not want to give us what we want.,
See the truth that God does not necessarily want you to be rich.,
Realize that God is capable of healing anything or anyone he wants, but he is not always willing to.,
Remember that God works all things together for good.",How to Have Christian Faith Without Being Presumptuous,"


You know Jesus said we all have power to be witnesses. And, the Holy Spirit will also revive you: ""But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you."" (Romans 8:11).
You cannot declare things into existence like God can. You can ask whatever things you desire in Jesus name, and do not doubt. Then God will always answer your prayers: ""Yes, no or wait."";
, Try not to think negative thoughts about them. Understand that the job of judgment belongs to God and Him alone. While you may think that He must be angry at someone for whatever reason (abortion, atheism, being gay, etc.) understand that that is between Him and them. Your job is to love others.

,


Don't be presumptuous and think that God will give you whatever you want. In praying and asking God for things, don't assume that He will absolutely do whatever you are asking for.
The Bible says that God will meet all of our needs, not all of our wants. There were dozens of people that Jesus did not heal. When the Pharisees asked Jesus for a sign, he usually did not give them one.

,


A great verse is ""What is man that you are mindful of him?""
Also, James 4:14 says, ""What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."" Amen. We are nothing but dust, essentially. We are like ants compared to the magnificence of God, the creator of the world. To think of ourselves as on the same level as God, or even close, would be very prideful. ""His ways are as far above ours, as the heavens are above the earth.""

, A big reason for this is because God might realize that the thing we want might become an idol for us.


God doesn't want us to be distracted from focusing on Him, so there are certain things he might never give us. Testing oneself is fine, but testing God is doubt and distrust.

,


There is a popular idea out now that God wants you to be wealthy, but that concept cannot be found in the Bible. But ""He shall give you all things according to his riches in Glory"". But, not if we ask amiss to consume it to ourselves. Share, give, loan what you can, and agree on terms, but do not demand or insist that the debtor makes the repayment. The debtor knows to repay you. So if he does not, then he is doing that to God.
Yet, Jesus taught that we should be willing to give all that we have away to the poor. Jesus said that ""You cannot love both God and money.""
Money often conflicts with our devotion to God. Therefore, often times God will not give us a lot more money than we need.

,


For whatever reason, God allows many people to live with pain.
In the Bible, Paul says that God allowed Satan to give him a thorn in his flesh to humble him.
Sometimes God will let us suffer physically to humble us and draw us close to him. Suffering often produces a greater character in someone. Therefore, God allows us to suffer to make us better people.

,


Just because you might want some discomfort to go away now, that does not mean that it is in your best interest that it does. God might use a test you are going through now to become your testimony later on and bring others to Christ.  God sees the big picture, whereas we only see what is happening now. 
Trust that God knows what he is doing.

Relax your mind.,
Be sure about what you want and when you do decide please don't doubt yourself.,
Ask the Universe for it.,
Write your wish down.,
Feel it.,
Show gratitude.,
Trust the Universe.",How to Use the Law of Attraction," Meditate for 5 to 10 minutes. Doing this will increase brain power and have your mind at that relaxed state. This step is optional but recommended.;
, Remember that you're sending a request to the Universe which is created by thoughts and therefore responds to thoughts. Know exactly what it is that you want. If you're not clear/sure, the Universe will get an unclear frequency and will send you unwanted results. So be sure it is something you have strong enthusiasm for.

, Make your request. Send a picture of what you want to the Universe. The Universe will answer. See this thing as already yours. See How to Visualize. The more detailed your vision, the better. If you're wanting that Nintendo Wii, see yourself sitting down playing a game on it. See yourself feeling the controller, playing your favorite game(s), touching the console. If there's that person you have a crush on, see yourself walking with them, touching or caressing the person, or even kissing the person. You get the idea.

, Start with ""I am so happy and grateful now that..."" and finish the sentence (or paragraph) telling the Universe what it is that you want. Write it in the present tense as if you have it right now. Avoid negation terms (see Warnings for more on this). Every day until your wish comes true, close your eyes and imagine your desire as if it's happening right now and see your imagination turning more clearer.

, Feel the way you will now after receiving your wish. You must act, speak, and think as if you are receiving it now. This is actually the most important, powerful step in using the Law of Attraction because this is where it starts working, and sometimes if you do this you don't feel like you need it anymore because you feel like you already have it! Therefore, the universe will manifest this thought and feeling, and you will receive it.

, Write down all the things the Universe has given you. Be thankful for what you already have and be thankful for all the things the Universe has given you. The Universe has done a lot of things for us. Paying the Universe back with some gratitude will motivate the Universe to do even more things and will draw more things into your life. If you were once bullied and that person stopped, that's one thing to be thankful for. If the person you're crushing on likes you back, or doesn't but they didn't send their lover out to hurt you, that's another thing to thank the Universe for. You should also thank the Universe for this process too. Showing gratitude will turbo boost the Universe to manifest your request faster.

, Imagine an alternate dimension that is almost exactly like the real world but whatever you truly desire comes true in an instant. See yourself in that dimension, where whatever you ask the Universe for comes to you in an instant. Don't look for what you asked for; this is where people tend to mess up. If you have to keep an eye out for an event that manifests your wish, it's only telling the Universe you don't have it, and you will attract not having it. Be patient. Don't get upset if these things don't happen immediately. Don't stress the ""how"" of things. Let the Universe do it for you. When you take the Universe's job of worrying about the ""how"", this says you lack faith and that you're telling the Universe what to do when the Universe has far greater knowledge and power than human mankind.

Keep track of your thoughts and feelings in a journal.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Have Hope2," Some people may lack hope because they feel like they are not good at anything. If you have been feeling this type of hopelessness, try making a list of all of your strengths and accomplishments. Read through the list and congratulate yourself for these positive traits. Giving yourself a little pat on the back now and then will help you to develop your hope for the future., As much as possible, surround yourself with supportive and capable people. Strive to surround yourself with those people who help you to feel good and encourage you to be your best. Having a supportive network of friends will help you to further your interests and goals. It’s much easier to find hope within a strong community as opposed to completely on your own.Look at the activities and attitudes of people around you. See if any of them can serve as role models for what you would like to accomplish for yourself. Also, consider how the people around you act and make you feel.

, Doing things that you enjoy can also help you to develop your sense of hope. By engaging in activities that make you happy every day, you will have a greater sense of purpose. If you are not sure about what activities bring you the most joy, try out some new things to figure it out. Take a class at your local community college, try a new sport, learn a new skill, or take up a new hobby.

, Getting involved in a cause in your community can be a great way to cultivate hope towards the future. This can be in either your local community or even an online community, but either way the essential point of departure here is building relationships with others over common goals or projects. Involving yourself with other people who share your interests can help you to overcome alienation, which can cause a feeling of hopelessness.Get involved in local politics or join an online forum discussion on some world affair you might be passionate about. The more you do this the easier it will be.
Consider volunteer work. Some studies have shown that volunteering has a wide range of benefits for your mental and physical health., Always staying within your comfort zone may cause you to feel hopeless and depressed. However, putting yourself in situations that make you uncomfortable may help you to move past hopelessness and other negative emotions.Getting out of your comfort zone is essential to changing your thought patterns and learning to approach the world with more hope.Search for activities in your life that put you within that window between feeling only slightly uncomfortable and being entirely overwhelmed by your anxiety altogether. These will usually be the best times for you to grow and develop your sense of hope. For example, you could try going out with coworkers after work if you typically go straight home.

, Journaling can help you to understand why you have been feeling hopeless and it is also a great way to relieve stress.To get started with journaling, choose a comfortable place and plan to devote about 20 minutes per day to writing. Start by writing about how you are feeling, what you are thinking, or whatever you want. You can also use your journal to record your progress toward your goals.


Try keeping a gratitude diary. Every night, think of three things you are grateful for and write them down. Doing this every day will help you to develop a more hopeful outlook and it can also help you to sleep better and enjoy better health., Exercise, eat healthy food, get plenty of rest, and relax. Doing these things will help you to develop a sense of hope. By taking good care of yourself, you are sending your mind signals that you deserve to be happy and treated well. Make sure that you are devoting enough time to meeting your basic needs for exercise, food, sleep, and relaxation.Exercise regularly. Try to get 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day.
Eat a balanced diet of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
Get 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

Identify symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,
Address your anxiety about the future.,
Notice when lack of hope becomes all-pervading hopelessness.,
Consider visiting a mental health professional.",How to Have Hope3," People with PTSD often experience hopelessness, among other symptoms. Consider whether you might be suffering from PTSD and talk to a mental health professional if you suspect that you are. Some of the common types of PTSD and their corresponding symptoms include:Hyperarousal: irritability, agitation, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating, feelings of panic, always ready to attack or respond
Re-experiencing: nightmares, intrusive memories, and flashbacks, experiencing physical symptoms of a traumatic event, extra-sensitive to reminders of trauma
Numbing: feeling disconnected or robotic, losing interest in people and activities, feeling hopeless, isolated, and/or depressed, avoiding thinking about people associated with trauma

, Research has shown that having unrealistic expectations for yourself—in a sense, having “false hope”—can produce anxiety.This anxiety can make it difficult to see the opportunities that are available to you. Unchecked anxiety can hinder your progress and make you feel less hopeful. In order to create realistic hope, as opposed to “false hope,” you need to learn to deal with your anxiety.


Try practicing systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization eases people into distressing situations so that they can feel more comfortable with them. Start by learning basic relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Then, perform such techniques in situations that make you uncomfortable.For example, if you start to feel anxious when thinking about plans for tomorrow, concentrate on your breath and regulate it as you imagine possibilities for yourself.
As you become less anxious about situations that make you a little bit uncomfortable, challenge yourself to practice relaxation techniques in situations that make you feel more anxious. Keep progressing until you have tackled the situation that produces the most anxiety for you.

, Almost everyone experiences anxiety in certain situations or feels sad during short periods of their life. These can be helpful reactions to certain unhealthy things in life. But when these feelings start to become attached to everything in your surroundings, it could be an indication of something more serious, such as an anxiety disorder or depression.


Try to address the patterns of thinking that have been keeping you down by talking to someone about how you have been feeling. Consider seeing a therapist or mental health counselor, or even a mental health support group.
When your anxiety or depression is associated with something or someone in your life, it might be necessary to make an extreme change, such as moving to a new location or simply away from the person who has been bothering you. Get feedback from other people in your community who you trust before making any decisions that might drastically change your life.

, If you happen to experience a high degree of anxiety, or just can’t seem to break out of an unhealthy habit or thought pattern, seeing a professional therapist could help get you moving in the right direction. They can offer you helpful psychological tools and/or techniques, which might help you to overcome your unique obstacles. This can be especially helpful if you keep feeling frustrated with your life after multiple failed attempts to change it.

Think about what it means to have hope.,
Realize that you need to work on your attitude every day.,
Learn to challenge your negative thoughts rather than ignore them.,
Recognize that you need to be resilient in challenging situations.",How to Have Hope4," Hope is an attitude that you work to achieve every day. It is not a permanent state of mind. One definition of hope used by some psychologists is “a positive motivational state that is based on an interactively derived sense of successful (a) agency (goal-directed energy) and (b) pathways (planning to meet goals).” Hope is the result of doing things that bring us pleasure and help us reach our goals., Don’t expect yourself to become more hopeful all of a sudden, as if there’s a switch you can simply turn on or off. Becoming hopeful requires you to work on your attitude every day. Take this process one day at a time and focus your attention on the aspects of your life that you actually have control over.For example, if you lack hope regarding your ability to find a job. Don’t dwell on what you cannot control, such as who calls you for an interview. Start thinking about what you can control, such as how many jobs you apply to. Take small steps to build your hope up every day by working on the things you can control.

, To have hope, it is important to work on your ability to deal with negative thoughts and stop letting them get the better of you. By learning to engage with difficult emotions when they arise, as opposed to ignoring them, you can begin to understand why you are having those feelings. Understanding your feelings will help you to deal with them in a constructive manner, rather than allow them to overtake you.For example, if you notice that you get discouraged about your weight loss progress sometimes, think about what is causing you to feel that way. Are you comparing yourself to other people? Are you not losing weight as fast as you hoped you would? Try to identify the source of your discouragement become more aware of the reason for these thoughts.

, In order to cultivate a sense of hope, you need to learn how to function in situations that cause you distress and derail your sense of motivation. Research has found that learning to be more comfortable in threatening situations can actually reduce the risk for physical health problems and improve overall psychological functioning.A strong social support system and feeling confident in your abilities are also necessary to develop a sense of resilience.

Work that Subject over in your mind until you have a new thought that raises your vibration. Your feelings are a built-in barometer for how you are vibrating.;
, If you have a pattern of thinking the same way about a particular subject matter—money, health, relationships—you will find that you have ingrained beliefs that are coming up whenever that subject matter comes to mind. Those beliefs can be empowering or they can be dis-empowering ones. Taking a look at your existing circumstances gives you a glimpse as to your overall vibration because whatever you are living - is a reflection of that. That is a good place to start in re-thinking your beliefs.

, Counting on others to behave a certain way in order for you to be happy is a trap. Just like you cannot jump through all the various hoops required in order to make the people close to you happy—the same thing applies to you being able to accommodate all those demands. Take charge of your life and understand that you can be happy no matter what others are doing. It just takes a different perspective. Happier people attract more circumstances to be happy about.

, Stop fretting over all the perceived mistakes you have made. The other people involved in those situations are most likely not even still thinking about what happened. And if they are, it is because they have not been willing to give up that incident in favor of being happy now. Whatever happened, happened. Get over it. Today is a new day with lots of opportunities to do things differently based on what you learned about your preferences.

, If you can feel absolute love for everything and everyone around you, you will be in complete and utter harmony with the Universe. Every good thing will come to you!

, One of the things that people seem to really want the most is money. Money is fantastic, and there is plenty of it. All you have to do is believe that you have all the money you want/need. Write tremendous, million-dollar checks or use Monopoly money to pretend you have all of this money. When you can feel good and secure about money, that's when the magic of wealth begins. Oh, and always feel grateful for any amount of money. Gratitude attracts support.

Meditate with an orgonite pyramid in your hand, direct your attention toward it-feel and sense the energy emanating from it.,
Communicate your intention to the orgonite object.,
Place orgonite around your community and any other places you think need healing.,
Orgonite can communicate across time and space and is not restricted by our conventional notions of space-time dimensions.,
Bury orgonite near cell phone towers and other large sources of EMF radiation.,
Carry a piece of orgonite around you during the day.,
Place an orgonite pendant or necklace (or even gems and jewels) around your dog’s leash.,
Cleanse any crystals with the orgonite, just as you would harness the energy of the Sun or water to cleanse your crystals.,
Place a piece of orgonite (or any quartz crystal) in your toilet tank.,
Take a bath with orgonite and other crystals placed in the water.,
Tape or glue a piece to the wind catcher on a wind chime and feel the orgonite go into resonance and harmony with the natural sounds of Mother Earth and spread that energy as far as the ear can hear.,
Place a piece of orgonite underneath your pillow.,
Place a piece of orgonite in your fridge.,
If you live near the train tracks, throw a piece somewhere close by.,
Place a couple of small pieces on the blades of your ceiling fan.,
Tape a piece to your shower head.",How to Use Orgonite/Orgone," The important thing is not to try to see it (do not make an effort), but just feel as if it is already there (because it is).


You can direct it toward any place, person, or time. Send it to different parts of your body for healing. You can directly feel the energy, either by seeing or feeling it depending on which sensory modality dominates.
Some individuals can do both. The energy emanated from orgonite is unlimited so do not worry about running out of it. Use as much as you want, it gets replaced instantly.;
, Every “thing” has consciousness, from the smallest atom (and even smaller to subatomic particles) to animals, planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies and beyond (From a Cosmic Intelligence perspective, we can see ourselves as subatomic particles.


The structure of solar systems, with one central Sun and planets orbiting resembles the make-up of individual atoms with protons and neutrons at the center and electrons rotating them in orbitals.
A different solar system can be thought of as analogous to different types of atoms, with different numbers of electrons and neutrons-think about it. As above so below. )
Talk to it out loud or in your mind as if you are talking to an old friend you have not seen for a while or whichever way makes you most comfortable.
Ask for healing, love, and light, for yourself and all life that surrounds you. The orgonite will appreciate being acknowledged and will emanate even more love toward you and you toward it.
Breathe in this healing energy of love. See and feel it coming in through your nose and healing all parts of your body, mind, soul, and emotions.

, Bury orgonite under trees. Their roots can absorb this energy and harness it for the greater good of all. Trees are conscious living organisms and will share this abundant and unlimited supply of energy with all forms of life that they can.


Place orgonite in any nearby rivers and streams. The water will easily pick up the POE from the orgonite and transmute any DOE that it may be carrying. In this way, know that you are healing Mother Earth immensely and for a very long time as these devices release an infinity and unlimited supply of energy.
As conscious beings, trees and wildlife are much more readily able to harness the energy from orgonite because they have an innate understanding of this type of energy.

, Just by looking at any pictures of orgonite, you will be able to gain a sense of their power and vibrations. Essentially, the healing effects of orgonite can, and are, transmitted just by looking at pictures of them. Try looking at and focusing on different picture of orgonite and you will gain a sense of how each piece sends out its own characteristic healing vibrations. You CAN be healed just by looking at pictures of them. Of course, we can't stare at a computer screen all day, so having one around us physically will help. The effects, however, are just the same.

, Any DOE that may be released is transmuted and, just like giant versions of your Wi-Fi routers at home, the cell phone towers are now broadcasting frequencies of LOVE to your entire neighborhood and beyond

, It will constantly be transmuting any DOE you may come across and emanate a positive LOVE field of POE.


Place some pieces at your work desk or office. The benefits of the orgonite will be transmitted to all within its vicinity.
Know that you are helping to make your workplace a friendlier and happier place.

, This way, they are being protected and helped at all times too


Place one in your pet’s bed (dogs, birds, etc.) and around where they sleep. Animals understand orgonite and its effects intuitively.
Always remember to communicate your intention to the orgonite, you only have to do it once. If you forget, do not worry. They know what to do.

, With orgonite, the cleansing takes place immediately and instantaneously.

, This way, you are generating a positive flow of orgone energy with every flush of the toilet.


Think of your toilet and all water flow in your own home as your own personal stream of consciousness, both literally and figuratively.
That extra kick of positive energy given by the orgonite will be spread all over the world, as all streams of water, and consciousness, are interconnected.

, Use some Dead Sea or Himalayan salt crystals as well as bentonite clay for a relaxing, soothing, detoxing, and energizing effect. Add some essential oils for an especially special experience.

,


Use a modified orgonite wind chime indoors, simply place it in front a fan and you can have that beautiful and healing melody night and day.

, Your sleep will be restful and energizing.

, It will make your food last longer and taste better by charging it with POE.

, Orgone energy is the precursor to electrical, heat, and other types of energy.


The electricity running through the tracks are analogous to manmade streams of water (in this case, water = electricity). The POE will be carried along the network of the tracks to all connecting tracks.
Think of the effect this can have in large connection systems such as the subways in NYC. Additionally, any trains running over the vicinity of the orgonite will absorb a lot of the POE and distribute it to the passengers, making for happier city inhabitants.

, The spinning will create an orgone vortex spinning to the Sky and Earth and is a very powerful healing method.

, This way, every time that you take a shower, you will be bathing in orgone energized water.

Try to be the first to set foot on the scene of a crop formation or ""circle"", as they were referred to early on (some of these strange formations date back to the Nineteenth Century but the current craze didn't become household terminology until about the '70s or so).,
Know about what crop circles are.,
Learn to distinguish between three broad classes of crop formations, they are: Melik Circles; Pictograms, and, Fractals or other very intricate and ornate Geometric Constructs.,
Even before visiting the site on foot, or as shortly thereafter as humanly possible, get to high ground if any is to be found so that you can look down upon the entire design and get one or more good photographs or footage of same.,
Bring the right equipment.,
Take a Geiger counter out there or one of those old but tried and true radiation intensity meters such as the Victoreen Instrument CDV 715 Model 1-B like they had stored in the old bomb shelters back during the Cold War days---you can still get one on e-bay for a song.,
Learn to distinguish between radioactivity and microwave radiation: radioactivity consists of rays of particles or extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation (in the high X-ray region) from disintegrating atoms---this means alpha particles (helium nuclei); beta particles (high speed electrons) and gamma rays (electromagnetic emissions of the same or higher frequency or shorter wavelength than X-rays)...of the three, gamma is most deadly and the one to avoid.,
For those so inclined and the truly dedicated, you might also take along a portable radio frequency spectrum analyzer---the purpose of this is to detect lingering microwave energy and to measure its intensity at various points within the crop formation.",How to Visit a Crop Circle," In order to be first on the scene, however, you will almost have to be on Ground Zero just as it is being formed; in most instances you will have heard about it second or third-hand or from local media who will most likely not give an honest or accurate account. Any event, upon learning of the formation, try to waste zero time in personally getting out there as the more people that go parading through the formation---everything from religious whack jobs to curious oglers and lookie-lou types who don't have a clue, the less chance that you will have to explore and examine the evidence in its most pristine form----such as soil samples, wheat stalks (very important), residual microwave energy. anomalous magnetic fields, etc. In so many words: get out there...now;
, If you are truly sincere about and dedicated to investigating crop formations, there are a number of books out there that you can study and you should definitely engage in an extensive review not only of plane and analytic geometry but acquaint yourself as much as humanly possible with the subject of fractals---for those not familiar, a fractal is a most times complex or complex appearing geometric construct composed of relatively simple geometric figures such as a square, circle, triangle, etc. reiterated over and over (ad infinitum) on an exponentially decreasing physical scale....a prime example is here set forth: imagine an equilateral triangle---now imagine another such inscribed in the first with its vertices located precisely at the mid points of the sides of the original triangle...now imagine a third equilateral triangle likewise inscribed in the second one you just created...then a fourth...a fifth...you have just created a fractal. A variation upon this is the famous ""Sierpinski triangle"". Fractals...some of which are stunningly beautiful - are becoming very routine in these formations.

,


Melik Circles are perfectly formed circles in the field that bear very definite and precise but not necessarily immediately identifiable geometric relationships to each other...there are many ways that this can be done but by way of illustration, imagine two concentric circles such that a hexagon that is perfectly tangent (circumscribes) the smaller of the two circles is itself perfectly circumscribed by the larger circle but the hexagon itself is left out of the pattern...or you might see three circles all lying outside each other that are perfectly tangent to a line which itself is not visible.
Pictograms are perhaps akin to hieroglyphics in that they could depict a constellation or could be a symbol for the moon or a fish or whatever....usually very simple and possess none of the sheer artistry and stunning majesty that the far more intricate designs that came later and persist to this day now exhibit.
Fractals and other extremely intricate and spell-binding beautiful and symmetric geometric constructs. These are highly mathematical and to fully appreciate them takes very careful and time consuming measurements of their dimensions.

, If you live in predominantly flat area such as back in the Midwest, then rent a plane or chopper and fly directly over it taking as many quality stills or video strips as possible.

, Absolute minimum equipment to take into a formation should you venture into one, is a camera or camcorder...and a compass. The camera will record the site for all posterity before the public gets out there and makes it look like a herd of elephants came foraging through the field looking for food. The compass is valuable in orienting the layout of the pattern with respect to true or magnetic North and, perhaps more importantly, gives an instant indication of any local magnetic anomalies such as vertices or whorls in which case the rosette wheel of the compass may just begin spinning like a top. Don't forget that compass

, Now to the best of my knowledge and belief, I do not recall either reading nor hearing of any cases of higher than normal radioactivity being sensed in a crop formation----but it is better safe than sorry...and those versed in saucer lore know of numerous cases of UFO sightings that resulted in the observer suffering or sometimes dying of symptoms precisely like those of radiation overexposure. This is mentioned because the correlation factor between the sudden appearance of a crop formation and the sightings of UFOs in the immediate area (generally in the form of shiny and metallic appearing spheres sometimes just a few inches in diameter, is an issue.

, If your Geiger or rad intensity level meter shows higher than normal emission in the crop formation area...get out of there and warn others. Microwaves, on the other hand, are radio frequency waves generally from UHF on up to SHF, in the range of a few gigahertz up to the tens of GHz and are generally associated with radar and extremely high frequency satellite communications---not to be confused with radioactivity. Intense microwave radiation is not to be taken lightly, however. It can, at the right frequencies, and even at low field intensities, prove harmful or even fatal. Again, however, I have heard of no documented cases of any crop formation casualties from microwave absorption although I have heard that some people who ventured into a crop formation have been rendered physically ill for whatever reason. Just a word to the wise.

, Why is this important? It is because it has been well documented that wheat stalks in particular, taken from samples, have shown evidence of microwave absorption and at intensities that were carefully plotted showing, in at least one case, that the source of microwave radiation was fifteen feet above the exact center of the crop circle.

Buy or make a pendulum.,
Get into a proper position.,
Ask it to show you a Yes.,
Repeat the same thing for no.

,
Begin to ask it simple questions that you know the answer to.,
You are now ready to use your pendulum for divination.",How to Use a Pendulum for Divination," You might want to buy commercial pendulums, but it is very easy to make a pendulum. You can make a pendulum out of a paperclip, a ring, or a washer. The string or chain should be about 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm), depending on the person.;
, You may stand, but it is easier to sit. Unfold your arms and legs, and rest your elbow on the table. Sit up straight, and get into a calm state. You may meditate if you like.

, Once you are into a proper position, ask it ""Show me a Yes, please."" Wait patiently. It might take a few seconds, or five minutes. It will begin to swing in a direction, whether it be in a circle or from side to side. This is your yes.

,, This includes questions like ""Is my name..."" or ""Am I am Female?"" If your name is that, then the pendulum will swing in a yes direction. Same if you were a female.

, Ask it simple questions at first. As you become more advanced, you can begin to ask it personal questions. Some questions that you might consider asking are: Should I work at this job, Is it time to move, Will it rain tomorrow, etc.

Encourage them to have dreams for their life and help them to believe in those dreams.",How to Have Biblical Faith in Your Child," Always believe the best for your child, never making excuses. Excuses go nowhere.


This goes for any relationship in life; we should always believe the best about people; so expect God's best.
Have hope that your child will make daily progress. That is success.
Always be positive in regards to your child: ""You can and will learn to achieve whatever is in your path: Walk in it."";
, Know that you create your own self-fulfilling prophesies about yourself, your family and your kid. You'll find answers after you start looking and expecting them: Amazingly, we know it works that way, but we forget to plan.


Let each child plan, to set ones own attainable goals -- and you reinforce this plan with your child -- then they'll try mightily to build upon the child's own plans, and become what they plan, over time.
Hold up a standard, a landmark to attain. He or she wants to be bonded to you, believe in you, that you know about ""everything"" and you're right. Think clearly.

The Bible says ""life and death are in the power of the tongue."" You can either bring death into your and your family's life -- or joy, Life, peace and hope.
The way to speak Life into your child is to seek to encourage each one. To encourage means to give people courage.
Tell your son or daughter, ""You can do anything you set your mind to do."" Tell each child, ""You are a quick learner, and have special qualities."" Name some and be sure to notice when they show their talents. Tell them ""You are talented."" Tell them, ""You can develop your talent by practicing a little every day, if you love improving your talent.""
Believe and affirm that they can be all they were meant to be, and they will be. Tell them to try to work for what they want, and to not accept the routine or mundane things of unbelief.

,


Show patience. Remember while they are small, that they are not capable of nearly as much as you are.
If you are too harsh with them, they will fear and then learn to hate you. Maybe they won't when they are little, but watch out for the teenage years. You reap what you sow, so if you sow criticism and anger, you will reap criticism and anger.

, Let them have choices and then expect them to change their minds from time to time. Encourage them to develop continuity, perseverance.


Show interest in what they are doing, in their hobbies, in their friends.
Listen. You may be able to keep them out of a lot of bad behaviors and trouble, if you would listen and then listen some more. Communication needs to go both ways. Listen to them about their lives more often.
They won't care what you know, until they know that you care. So show that you care, and then they will be more open to your giving them advice.

Often times parents who throw their kids in childcare -- later in life, get thrown in an old folks home by those kids.
However you want them to treat you when you are old, treat them that way now when they are young.

,


Don't let people gossip to you about them. But listen to them first. You might learn of a problem area that needs attention. Then always stick up for your child.
Their teachers may have critical things to say about them. Listen and ignore them. The doctor might. Ignore it. Whatever things are good and true -- think on those things.

Don't listen to anyone that might say they have ADD or ADHD. Those labels really mean that a child is not encouraged enough to learn. You as the parent need to find ways to engage them in interesting reading and learning. It is your job as the parent to mold them into a model and respectable citizen of society. Don't medicate them to fix a problem that you could fix by being there for them more.

,


Cheer them on. Encourage them in every extracurricular activity that they do.

,


Don't ignore them. If they mess up in any area of life, tell them they will do better next time. That is called positive affirmation, and includes saying ""I don't only t-h-i-n-k you can learn to do/be that someday, I expect you to, if that is what you want to do."" -- and ""You'll have to decide to study, and then work for what you want!""
Focus more on the positives, build on what they did right in a game or on an essay, etc., rather than pointing out only the things they need to improve.

Try crossing your legs with your legs pressed against each other, interweaving your fingers in a pleading sort of way, and keep your eyes open. A lot of people want to close their eyes, but keeping them open allows you to focus on one point, like a laser.;
, Breathing deeply causes your brain to focus on what your goal is, leading to a better execution. You may feel a squeezing sensation near your solar plexus, but that's what you're aiming for.

, Setting goals is one of the two most important steps to the whole process.

, If you keep your eyes open too long, they'll dry out and you'll lose focus. Same thing with breathing. If you breathe too little or too much, you'll lose focus or pass out. Or both.

Envision the person you have in mind.,
Make a voodoo doll with a picture.,
Make a voodoo doll with personal objects.,
Clear your voodoo doll.",How to Use a Voodoo Doll1," When making a voodoo doll, picture the person you you would like the magic to affect and how you would like it to affect them. Because voodoo largely depends upon the connection between you and the voodoo spirits, it's important that the doll you are holding symbolizes the person who will gain good or evil in their life.;
, One of the ways to create a replica of a person through a voodoo doll is by printing out a full size picture of the person and sewing it together with fabric.Once you have found a picture or printed one out, cut around the body frame of the person in the picture and then use fabric for the back. As you begin sewing the fabric and picture together, fill the doll with stuffing.

, Maybe you don't have a picture of the person you want to represent or you'd rather make a voodoo doll from something associated with that person. A lock of hair or piece of clothing will serve this purpose. Find some yarn, string, or fabric and sew or piece together a simple doll. Then, sew the object you have to represent the person to the doll you have created.

, Before you plan to use your voodoo doll you will need to clear it of all previous energy, thus neutralizing it and giving you a clean slate to perform actions on it. To do this, place your hand over the object and direct your energy through it, focusing on making it new and pure. You can also wash your doll in salt water, cover it with purifying incense such as sage or sandalwood, allow natural light such as sunlight or moonlight to cleanse it, or bury it in the Earth and allow the universe and Mother Nature to transform the energy.


There will likely be previous energy attached to any object you use in making your voodoo doll, so always remember to clear that object so that the energies don't become confused and muddled.
To make the clearing process easier, use objects and supplies that have had little contact with others, unless you are specifically using that object to represent someone.

You can use aura in other ways as well.",How to Use Aura for a Specific Purpose2," You've figured out what the heck you're doing. Now, you need to set a goal.

, If you're trying to make someone change emotions, think ""Make (name) feel (emotion)."" over and over. If you're trying to heal someone (a more advanced technique), think ""Heal (name)."" repeatedly.

Concentrate on your desires.,
Use different colored pins.,
Petition the spiritual beings of Voodoo.",How to Use a Voodoo Doll2," One purpose of a voodoo doll is to provide meditation and focus. While holding your voodoo doll, focus on the desired effect you hope it will bring. You can buy voodoo dolls online that symbolize aspects of life like fertility, marriage, luck, prosperity, etc. or that represent one of the spirits.


This process may require patience and clearing your mind of distractive thoughts. That is why it's also referred to as meditation because it's the practice of calming your soul in order to be more spiritually in tune with your desires.
You can bring about good not only to yourself, but to others. If you'd like to bring others good fortune, use the same process but have a doll that represents them instead and focus on the desires you wish for them.

, There are traditionally seven colored pins you can use to indicate areas of your life you want to focus on. This technique goes hand in hand with the focusing technique, but focusing and meditating comes first, and then using the pins follows. After you have decided what aspect of life you'd like to change, prick the corresponding colored pen into your voodoo doll. The head represents things that have to do with knowledge, the heart is used for emotions, and the stomach is used for gut feelings or intuition. So, if you desire power in your life or a friend's life, then use the red pin to prick the head. If you desire love, use the blue pin to prick the heart. These are the different colors and what they symbolize:Yellow: success
Green: money
White: healing
Red: power
Purple: spirituality
Blue: love
Black: repelling negative energies

, Loa, the twins, and the dead are all spiritual beings of Voodoo that interact to bring you different things. In order to summon the spirits, a voodoo doll of the spirit must be created or obtained, you must focus on the desires you hope the spirit will bring you and light a candle in the appropriate color of the spirit, and then a sacrifice must be offered to the spirit. It may be helpful to create an alter for your doll so that you can light a candle to the spirits and offer your sacrifice there.


Loa interact with people of the Earth and they are the spirits of the major forces of the universe--good, evil, reproduction, health, and all aspects of daily life.There are so many different types of loa and so they can not all be listed, but with adequate research you should be able to find the loa you wish to appeal to.The twins are a mysterious set of forces of contradictions: happy and sad, good and evil, ect. When honored, they may help you have the better side of life.
The dead are the souls of one's own family members who have died, but family has not yet ""reclaimed"" them. If the family dead are ignored they can be dangerous, but if honored and cared for they can be helpful. "
"
Use colored pins for harm.,
Appeal to a spirit to act on your behalf.,
Revert to classic torture techniques.",How to Use a Voodoo Doll3," While the colored pins can be used on a voodoo doll of yourself or someone else for good, some can also be used for evil. For example, if you wish to exert power over an individual, use the red pin, focus on the power you want the individual to submit to, and prick the voodoo doll of the individual in the head.

, Using the voodoo doll that represents the spirit you wish to call upon, create an alter for your doll, focus on the person you wish to harm or cause misfortune to, and petition the spirit to act on your behalf. In the same way as you would petition a spirit for yourself, light a candle that corresponds to the spirit and possibly offer a sacrifice.

, If you wish to invoke harm upon someone through a voodoo doll representing them, you can use regular pins or needles, rope, wire, water, or any sort of torture device you wish. Then, following the focusing technique, concentrate on the person you wish to harm and the actions you are carrying out.


Make sure you clear the doll of all previous energies. If the doll is in any way associated with someone else, they may experience the harm as well and you wouldn't want that!
Most experienced practitioners of Voodoo suggest only to use your doll for good, because as the saying goes ""what goes around comes around.""

Look up the next date of a meteor shower.,
Get out of the city.,
Choose an observation spot.",How to Wish on a Star1," Shooting stars are not, in fact, stars at all. They are meteors, which are made up of pieces of interplanetary rocks or debris. When they break into earth’s surface, they light up the night sky. Find a calendar of the next meteor shower and drive out to a dark, secluded place.Though it’s possible to see a shooting star on any given night, you’re likely to see more during a meteor shower. Check out http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide for listings of this year’s meteor showers.;
, In order to wish on a star, you have to be able to see the stars. Because of light pollution, it’s nearly impossible to see stars in cities or even large towns or suburbs at night.Take a ride out to one of your favorite scenic spots, such as a mountain, field, or lake outside of the city. It’ll be easier to see the stars out in nature.

, Once you’ve gotten out into nature, choose an area that seems dark and comfortable and set up camp. Lie on your back or sit so that the stars and night sky are filling your field of vision.Pack as if you’re going on a picnic. Bring a camping chair, layers of clothes, water, and plenty of snacks.

Think of all the things that you want to wish for.,
Write down your wish on paper.,
Write or say your wish as if it has already happened.,
Don’t wish to change another person.",How to Wish on a Star2," You probably won’t see a lot of shooting stars in one night, so you have to be discerning in what you wish for. Think of things that you’ve always wanted: a million dollars, a house, a jumbo sized vanilla shake. It could be anything! Let your imagination run wild.

, If you’re having trouble deciding between wishes, write down a list of all of them and then choose a few through a process of elimination.


Some believe that writing down your wishes on a post-it note helps it come true. Creative visualization helps you to better understand your wishes and goals., This is a manifestation technique that some think helps wishes to gain potency. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, they are more likely to come true.Instead of saying: “I wish I had a better job,” try phrasing it this way: “I am hardworking and intelligent and capable of getting a better job.” This language is positive, affirmative, and helps give your wish more weight.

, It’s impossible to control or change someone else. Imagine if someone else made a wish and asked for you to fall in love with them, or for you to be more beautiful or successful. These are elements that only you can control.You can wish for things on other people’s behalf. For example, you can say, “I wish that Todd gets his second interview this next week.”
It’s not useful to say something like: “I wish Todd had a nicer smile and also didn’t like watching football so much.”

Look for a shooting star.,
Close your eyes while wishing.,
Don’t tell anyone your wish.,
Look for a bright star if you can’t find a shooting star.,
Believe in your wish.",How to Wish on a Star3," Once you’re situated in a good place for stargazing with your wish on your mind, you’ve got to keep an eye out for a shooting star. Lay or sit comfortably and keep your eyes on the sky and think about your wish.


Don’t stare at the sky for too long. Take a few breaks every half hour to let your eyes readjust to the dark., If you get lucky enough to see a shooting star, close your eyes before wishing. Then say, “Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight: I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.” This old rhyme is rumored to make your wish come true., If you tell someone your wish it’s less likely to come true. If you’re stargazing with a friend, say the wish in your head so that they won’t hear it. If you’re alone, you can say it aloud, but make sure that nobody else is around., If you get unlucky and can’t find a shooting star, look for the brightest star you can find and wish on that instead. While bright stars aren’t as legendary as shooting stars in granting wishes, it’s worth a shot.

, Wishes only come true if you believe in them! After you make your wish, keep thinking about it when you get home. The more positive energy you put into your wish, the more likely it is to come true.

Examine your fears.Some of your childhood fears may indicate a predisposition for psychic ability.,
Look at your play habits.,
Understand your interests.",How to Tell if You Are a Medium1," You might have medium abilities if:


You feared the dark. Often, children with psychic tendencies have a persisting fear of the dark that stems from an unconscious awareness of the supernatural.
You also exhibited a persistent unwillingness to sleep in a room alone and may also have had vivid nightmares.;
, If you don’t remember how you used to play as a child, ask your parents or guardians. You might have had some supernatural experiences disguised as play. Some of these experiences include:


You had an imaginary friend. Often, adults label the spirits or supernatural being children interact with as “imaginary friends.”

, If you were extremely interested in religion or understanding meaning as a child, this could be an indication you had a psychic connection. If you showed tendencies toward psychic abilities early:


You asked guardians to take you to religious services or to tell you about different religious beliefs in detail.
You engaged in play with objects like a Ouija board or tarot cards.
You read children’s books centering around the spiritual or supernatural.

Decide what area of the paranormal fascinates you most.,
Read as many books as possible on the paranormal.,
Use the internet.,
Check out workshops and classes.,
Ask around.,
Don't believe everything you read and see.,
Know the classic ghost stories.,
Go on ghost tours.,
Have fun!,
Spread your knowledge.,
Grow your passion.",How to Study Paranormal Phenomena," The term ""paranormal"" covers a wide range of topics, from ghosts and spirits to mediums and ESP. It would be difficult to become an ""expert"" in all of these fields, so pick one (or two!) that get you really excited and pursue the topic (just like a scientist might specialize in botany).;
, In a world dominated more and more by the internet, we sometimes forget the benefits of those good old paper books! So don't be afraid to open a book (it won't bite!). The library can be a very useful place to find books that you might read just once or to see if you are interested in a particular topic.

, The internet can be a very useful tool in learning about any topic, especially the paranormal. There are hundreds of paranormal-related websites where you can interact with fellow paranormal enthusiasts and share your ideas and opinions. You can also use the internet to find local clubs or other groups that share your interests.

, Many paranormal/metaphysics-related stores, groups, and societies offer classes and workshops for a minimal fee. These can also be excellent places to get hands-on experience on your topic and information from people who have spent years researching an aspect of the paranormal.

, With the rise of paranormal-related television, the subject has gained more acceptance in the general public. Nearly everyone has a good ghost story or strange encounter to tell. Don't be afraid to ask people you know (friends, family, co-workers, etc.) about your topic. You'll never know who else might share your interests if you keep them to yourself.

, Unfortunately, there any many people who attempt to fake evidence and spread accounts of false paranormal encounters across the community. Be wary of everything you read online and in books and never accept any photo of a ghost outright. Always maintain a healthy level of skepticism. Remember: if a claim seems too outrageous to be true, there's a good chance it is.

, The women in white, the gray ladies, and the screaming ghosts: perhaps you've heard of them. Be wary of locations that claim to have the ""classic"" signs of paranormal activity, as they may just be stories or attempts to promote someone's business.

, While you are unlikely actually to encounter a ghost on a ghost tour, this is a great way to learn more about the history of a location in a fun and entertaining way.

, Don't become stressed, upset, or overly emotional. The point is to expand your knowledge and have a little adventure along the way.

, Show your expertise by posting articles and messages online or even submit articles to printed publications. There is always someone new to the paranormal world, and maybe you can give them a head start!

, You never know where your interests will lead you, so go along for the ride! Maybe you'll find a way to become a columnist specializing in paranormal events in your town or a paranormal author. The field is always looking for new blood and ideas, and maybe you have something special to bring to the table.

Think about what you see around people.,
Understand how you feel around others.,
Remember your deceased loved ones.,
Listen around you.",How to Tell if You Are a Medium2," If you are a medium, you might see auras or symbols surrounding people.These images might just be fuzzy fields of color or physical symbols or scenes, like a lake or river. They are probably normal to your internal world, so pay close attention to how you perceive others.
This is a large part of clairvoyance.These images might just be within your mind’s idea, rather than outside of you physically.
Also, notice if you tend to see things out of the corner of your eye that others don’t perceive.

, Do you know if someone walks into a room without seeing that person? Sensing others’ energy or moods can be an indication that you’re a medium.


You have deep intuition about people’s moods.
If you hold an object owned by a person, you can sense deep emotions and experiences connected with that person through the object.

, Your personal experiences surrounding death might reveal that you have a psychic gift.


After someone you love dies, if you are a medium, you might experience odd occurrences. These could be as simple as unexplained slammed doors or strange sensations and feelings other than grief.

, Clairaudience, the ability to hear the voices of spirits, is a large part of being a medium.

You might not know that you can hear voices, as these are usually not audible outside yourself. They are internal voices.
You might have a series of nagging thoughts or ideas that come to you from seemingly nowhere.

Take time to meditate each day.This can help you hone and understand your abilities as a medium.,
Cultivate your vision.Your vision relates to your ability to see the past, present, and future.,
Ask your friends what you say to them.,
Listen to your intuition.,
Build up your spiritual knowledge base.Spend time reading books about subjects like psychometry, numerology, scrying, tarot reading, and healing.,
Spend time with other mediums.",How to Tell if You Are a Medium3," Try to meditate for around thirty minutes each day.


Choose a quiet spot to be a dedicated area for your meditation. Light a candle to focus on while you meditate.
After your meditation, write down the strongest impressions, feelings, or images that came to you during that time.
Look back on those notes at a later to date to see if a pattern emerges and to see if you can interpret a meaning from them. These may be messages from the spirit world.
The more you meditate, the more you will be able to sharpen your focus.

, Even if you are highly intuitive, you’ll need to work to cultivate your vision to see truly.


Keep a journal. While meditation helps cultivate your understanding of the present, writing down your thoughts and days in a journal can help to stretch your memory, and in time, will help you see whether you can see past lives other than your own.
Purify your thoughts. You can’t be a receptive vessel as a medium if your mind is clouded with negativity. Work to counter your negative recurring thoughts and focus on the positives.

, You will want to know if your friends have any insight into how you act when you’re unaware. This will give you an idea of your abilities and how you come across to others.


Often, mediums may give out deep advice that they don’t remember giving as soon as it’s left them.
Write down what your friends tell you, so you can look back on it and connect it to other visions or feelings.

, Doubt is one of the many inhibiting factors people face as they are trying to understand whether they are a medium and learn how to enhance their ability.


Allow yourself to explore the possibility of your ability.
Listen to your gut feelings.

,


This knowledge will help you to better connect to your own interpretive abilities and understand the symbols that you may already see.

, Look online for reviews of reputable psychics and mediums in your area. Go see one and ask them to read you.


While you are there, ask them how they knew they were a medium.
Get a feel for their process, and look around to see what kinds of talismans they keep in their office.

Explore the universalist faith.",How to Use Faith," Lead on to what you love, reveling in what you do, loving what you feel or hope to know. Get exquisite and elegant or complex thoughts in your mind, then challenge others in your quest, living positively, in what you hope may work (encouraging oneself). Do better comparably, overcoming fear with greater-things than you can hope, according to the moment.


Sky dive because of faith in a key human being, that special one who packed your parachute.
Drive at highway speeds having implicit faith (some expectancy): drivers obey rules, maintain skill and alertness, and that everyone stay on their side of the line to remain alive.
Eat confidently in faith at a restaurant believing in (relying on) the cook to not kill you, with faith that he or she keeps food pure, fresh and safe.
Be rewarded at least as a first-rate achiever (or as ""the one"") by greater levels of this.
Champion a cause, clap your hands, keep ""rhythm"" -- accept rules, respect a jury decision.
Agree to compete or cooperate, have peace or strive and struggle together to have a home, school, team, amiable or hateful work place, follow a leader,...;
, Champions may succeed by a firm belief and faith, in a greater possibility, through his or her belief and actions toward visualizing and following a goal, believing in and doing more in certain areas than most others do. Receive ""champion caliber"" insights, accepting your free gift of a greater vision of more, still, being possible, for some cause, or motive. This goes beyond merely discrete limits on actualizing hopes. It is in an area of verifiable events, but it is beyond limits of concepts seen in day by day routine. It's a feeling deep inside that gives people a sense of something greater than the mechanical logic. Let this blessing of happy fortune take root, as a seed and allow the roots of this gift to motivate you.


If you're a non-believer (religiously), put your faith in your opportunity: that with cooperation, goodwill, and charity one can transcend hate and oppression in the world. Or, cultivate a faith in the arts, that literature, music, and creative expression can elevate you to a higher, better state of mind. Put your faith in the ability of empirical study, sciences or philosophy to answer meaningful questions you have about the existence of life, and of all things. Where do we come from? What does it mean to be alive? Look for these answers, having faith that you will find them.
If you're a deeply spiritual or religious person, put your faith in a higher power and devote your life to worshiping/serving the god or God in whom you trust. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word. How will you know the truth? Use your faith in divine providence and the word to explain the world, and the Spirit to guide and comfort you. Find a community of like-minded believers who share your passion for the life, the truth, the hope, the way and love.

, Whatever your belief system and your faith, it's important to believe in and develop that faith as a life-long mission of learning. Commit to building your faith into a knowledge based belief system. Don't be an uninformed believer, as ""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free"" speaks of the inestimable value of knowledge!


If you have religious faith, commit to studying the core texts of your belief system. Being a Christmas-and-Easter Christian and tuning in occasionally to talk radio isn't enough to live a faithful life. Go to the religious text (such as The Bible or Koran) and learn the source of your religion.
If you have faith in science, or other non-religious belief systems, practice healthy questioning (skepticism) and remain open-minded to alternative possibilities. Science based minds can be just as closed as other minds, if you're not receptive to the rights of other persons' to live by beliefs that you might call ungrounded.

, Believe in your ability to achieve what you want or need, to transcend your present condition and become the best possible version of yourself. Be as self-reliant as possible, as a capable person, supporting yourself in this world of can't. Use your faith to make connections, giving you the best chance for success and faith in something. Set goals. Make and, if necessary, remake yourself by reaching your goals.


Having faith in some higher power doesn't exempt or excuse you from the concerns of the here and now. You aren't a leaf floating in the breezes of your belief, saying that ""god will provide"" when you're unemployed, and unconcerned with finding a job. Use your faith to support yourself, but never to excuse yourself from responsibility.
Having faith in advancement of people and in finding essential good of humanity means you must contribute. You can't give back by watching a sad documentary and ""feeling bad"" about the situation in third world countries. Do something about it here and now.

, If you can't build trust within your family, then who can you trust? Surround yourself with people that you can trust, people that you can lean on in times of need -- and be the one that others lean on. A community of faithful believers is important, but a household of people who can rely upon each other is absolutely essential to creating and sharing ""togetherness"".


If you feel like a black sheep in your family, or come from an non-supportive household, seek to rectify it -- or failing that, gain faithful community elsewhere. Consider spending more time at church, practicing and sharing your belief with others, or find a secular community to share in a common mission.

, No person of faith is without doubt.When Einstein first observed quantum entanglement–the observation that some particles were so deeply entwined that they would behave in identical patterns, regardless of how far apart they were separated–he called it ""spooky action at a distance,"" and it shook his faith in God, in science, and in the way he understood the world.But the power of the paradox ended up strengthening his belief in both. What we can observe might be frightening to us, but we are confronted by our world, and our perceptions of reality, all the same whether we want them or not.

, Faith is much easier to use in a group of believers who can help you hone your belief into a powerful fail-safe system. As steel sharpens steel, one person sharpens another. Find a local ""faith-based"" organization in your area, whether it be a church, a club, or some kind of other social group. Meet people with whom you can practice your faith.


If you have trouble finding a community of interest in your area, consider reaching out to people on the Internet in your area of faithfulness. Faith-based blogs, message boards, YouTube groups, and other purposeful, online communities are extremely common and just as effective at forming a fellowship. You should never have to feel alone.

, If you've got children of your own, deciding how you'll raise them with faith can be a challenging proposition. Will you raise them in the way you were raised? Will you raise them with the same beliefs as you hold, or will you let them forge their own metal in various shapes? Creating an environment in which faith can grow is an important part of any household of faith. How you choose to do it will be entirely up to you, and your own belief system, but it's critical to make faith (not a faithless shadow of reality) a part of your reality and your family's life together.


If you're religious, you might take your kids to church and raise them with your beliefs. Even if you're not so religious, yet non-judgmentally letting your children experience the world of a community of belief can be a powerful and moving experience for you and your kids. Let them see and appreciate how various people choose to express their faith and do forms of worship.If you're not religious, it's important to share your beliefs with your kids at an early age, but not to force them on your kids. Let your kids experience a wide range of different beliefs, faiths, and ways of interpreting the world. Let them find their own expressions of faith.
As your children grow up, try to respect their own burgeoning belief system and their own faith in something. It might be different than your own, and even contentious, if you let it be so. If you're a committed atheist, what will you do, if your child wanted to be confirmed to the Catholic church? If you're a person of great faith in religion, what will you do if your child renounces your area of belief/faith or how it is expressed?

, Don't wonder (or struggle) alone. Form strong bonds and long-term relationships with people who share your quest/faith. Faith-based friendships and relationships will help you to grow in your faith together, learning and supporting each other by agreement. If you're dealing with doubt, spending time with friends who have settled such beliefs can help you channel that doubt into an iron-clad decision (a faithful life).


Faith-based friendships don't need to revolve around only one thing. You don't have to be locked in constant science or theological conversation with buddies, and you don't have to be consistently debating with the other religious or science-minds. Every now and then, just go fishing.

, Open up the storage room of your faith for others to freely take -- or add. Faith works in mysterious ways in motivating events and people. You won't know unless you think and talk about (and get involved in such) stuff. While faith-centering can make some benevolent and good-hearted, it can make others condescending, limiting clear-minded discussion, presuming and acting preachy. If you believe that you've a lock on the one true way of understanding the world, it can make it hard to simply listen and share thoughts/beliefs with people of other ways of conceiving of faith. Try your best to share your concept of faith and represent its good news (gospel) accurately, being respectful of the others' freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.


Make an effort to spend quality time with people who believe and live-out very different things than you do. Join other kinds of organizations–local softball teams, bowling leagues, game nights, neighborhood organizations–and forge (reshape) good-faith relationships with people who may believe and behave differently than yourself.
Memorizing inspirational quotations about faith and speaking in platitudes might sound good occasionally, but it also puts your faith on a restricted ""diet of canned food"". Faith is greater than the impressive quotes, bigger than soundbites. There's no fast-track to developing a deep faith in what you believe and living a faithful life. Be generous and humble with your faith, but don't show it off proudly, bragging and humbling others. Humble yourself, meekly but be firm and definite.

, Whatever your beliefs, it's important to use your faith to give back, both to your own community and to communities in need of help.


In religious communities, mission trips are often a part of youth groups and are a big part of some churches contribution to community service and organizing. During mission trips, groups of believers spread the word and usually do some kind of community-building activity, like volunteering as teachers, home or church builders, or doing other essential work.
Secular non-profit organizations like Peace Corps, Red Cross, and Doctors Without Borders are usually non-discriminatory and focused primarily on the humanitarian side of volunteer work, and less on the ""spreading-the-word"" side. If your big goal is to help, volunteering your time with a non-governmental non-profit can be a primary way to do it.

, If you're grappling with change of (or to find) faith in something, or seeking to name and use a faith that you feel, but have trouble voicing -- it can be stimulating and uplifting to join a group or congregation in that arena. Acknowledging a higher power in an organized setting offers many people satisfaction, relief and strength. If you think you might be one of them, but weren't raised in a religious kind of faith, spending some time exploring different denominations and faiths, learning about their belief-systems and finding what speaks to you the most exercises your power of choice.


If you were raised in a church, but are feeling dissatisfied, you might be in a crisis of faith. Do you use the doubt or question you're experiencing to reforge (with sparks flying) your beliefs? Or to find faith elsewhere? Each person will need to answer this question for oneself, but exploring other options is always a smart way to go about answering it. If you're unsatisfied in one congregation, try another. If your religion is giving you more questions and conceptual irritants than answers, start reading up on your or another way of believing. Have faith that you'll find (receive) the right answer.

, Buddhists have faith in the Noble Eightfold Path, which is a method of living in moderation as a way of ending human suffering by eliminating clinging desires. Faith in Buddhism derives from the pali word saddhā, which often refers to a sense of conviction. The saddhā is often described as ""a conviction and determination to accomplish one's goals and cultivate a sense of joy"". Learn more about Buddhism in the following articles:

Let go of thinking life should always go your way.,
Ask God for help by praying.,
Read or listen to the stories of others.,
Be grateful.,
Get beyond yourself.,
Adopt an eternal perspective.",How to Trust God when Life Is Hard," God answers every prayer, but he does not always answer “yes.” Sometimes, he says “no” or “wait.” Be happy when things go well, enjoy each day and look for the good in it, but let go of feeling entitled to a problem-free life. We have free will to choose to do good or bad, and so does everyone else in the world. So sometimes, bad things happen. Sometimes, we do not get what we want—because what we want would actually not be good for us. Remember that God knows more than you do. Remind yourself that God has your best interests in mind and loves you.;
, But remember that God never promised to shield you from difficulties. He only promises to be with you—if you want that. Being angry and blaming God won’t help you to get through the valley. Asking him to be with you can help you endure far more than you’d ever be able to on your own. You may wonder how to pray. Just speak, trusting God will hear you. Pray for his comfort and strength, rather than praying that he’d simply remove difficulties. You will grow in faith and courage if you pray this way.

, Their experiences will help you. Author William Sirls writes, “God doesn’t keep us from tests and trials. … He helps us get through them.”Sirls' book The Reason, or other books about people who experienced God's help as they faced difficulties, can give you hope.

, Make a list of the things you appreciate about your life--even if it is as basic as a roof overhead or food on your table. Tell God you are thankful for them. The simple act of noticing the good things in your life helps you to have a more positive attitude and helps you to see God’s hand in all things—good or bad.

, Reach out to others who can help or encourage you. Any difficult situation seems worse if you are facing it alone. Ask others to support you, pray for you—and do the same for them. And offer to help those who are worse off--which will put your problems in their proper perspective.

, God promises to make all of us well, if we only believe. But he doesn’t promise that will happen right now, in this life on earth. Some prayers get answered in heaven. We will be able to trust God when we focus on the fact that this life (and its struggles and pain) is temporary, but heaven is eternal.

Think about your current relationship with God.,
Evaluate what is distracting you from God.,
Seek guidance from a trusted person of faith.,
Devise a plan to deepen your faith.",How to Stay Focused on God1," Sit down when you have a quiet moment and evaluate the current state of your spiritual life. Be humble and honest with yourself. Ask yourself whether you incorporate your faith into your everyday routine, whether you use your faith to guide your decisions, and whether you feel close to God.Don’t be discouraged if you discover that your spiritual life needs some work. The point of this exercise is simply to figure out where your strengths and weaknesses are right now.;
, Ask yourself which aspects of your life are pulling you farther away from God. External pressures and responsibilities, such as work, school, and relationships, are common distractions. Don’t forget to consider internal distractions as well, like pride or materialism.For instance, if your pride drives you to try to solve all your problems without any help, you might have a hard time turning to God for guidance.

, Whatever your spiritual or religious affiliation, it can help to get advice from a leader. This person can help you identify barriers that are blocking you from deepening your relationship with God. Alternatively, they may also be able to help you see that you are actually doing quite well in your current spiritual practice.


Go to a trusted member of your spiritual community and explain your dilemma. Ask them how you can improve your focus on God and your spirituality.

, Think about how you would like to maintain or improve your relationship with God. Set some spiritual goals for yourself. Think about what you want your relationship with God to look like in a month or a year. Then think about how you can change your habits to make it happen.For instance, if you want to feel closer to God on a day-to-day basis, you could establish the habit of praying for a few minutes every morning.

Consider your status in the company.,
Learn about your company's policies.,
Brainstorm sabbatical plans that will benefit both you and the company.,
Plan a sabbatical no longer than three months, as a general rule.,
Present a written plan to your employer.,
Figure out your finances.,
Train an interim employee if necessary.,
Update your CV before you leave.,
If you cannot get a sabbatical, think carefully about resigning.",How to Take a Sabbatical1," You are much more likely to be granted a sabbatical after you have been working for your employer for several years and have become well respected by your boss.However, if the reasons for your sabbatical are time-sensitive and clearly benefit the company, it might be worth asking even if you do not meet these criteria.


For example, an intensive training course that would teach you job-relevant skills might be a compelling reason for the company to grant you a short sabbatical even as a relatively new employee.;
, Talk to the personnel department to find out if your company has an official sabbatical policy. If it does, your company may offer no pay, partial pay, or full pay. Many companies do not have an official policy, but may be willing to grant a sabbatical anyway if you make a good argument as described in the steps below.


Make sure your job will be kept open for you during a sabbatical.
Check whether your benefits will be suspended, and whether alternate health care plans or other benefits will still be available through your company., There are many reasons why a sabbatical will make you a better employee. Any sabbatical should leave you more motivated and creative after your return, and a company struggling financially may appreciate the short-term savings of granting a sabbatical. However, try to come up with more specific plans, along with reasons they would benefit the company:


Will your travels abroad or participation with a volunteer organization provide new language skills, international contacts, or cultural understanding that will assist you in your job?Will you learn new skills, either through classes, self-directed projects, or visiting other organizations?
See the section on ""getting the most out of your sabbatical"" for more ideas.

, Sometimes, you'll only need a few weeks off to take a training course or get certified in a specific task. Only ask for more than three months off if you are well-respected, a longtime employee, and have a compelling reason why the longer sabbatical is necessary. Unlike in the academic world, taking a corporate sabbatical for too long could hurt your reputation in the organization., Present a plan that describes the benefits to the company and yourself as a worker, and proposes a duration for your sabbatical. Mention that you are willing to train an interim employee if necessary, or to assist coworkers who may be taking on some of your duties.


If possible, make your request six months before the intended start date of your sabbatical, so your supervisor and coworkers have time to make necessary changes.

, If your employer will not pay you during your sabbatical, you will need to finance your break by yourself. Try to save money in advance by paying off debts, and reducing expenditures. If this isn't enough, consider the following options:


Take out a home equity loan, or ask for personal loans from family and friends.
If your sabbatical lasts longer than a couple weeks, spend it in a region with a much lower cost of living. If you rent out your old place, sublet it with the permission of your landlord, or arrange a house swap, you could reduce your costs significantly, or even break even.
Consider getting a part time job, such as freelancing or pet-sitting.

, If the company cannot function without you for the length of your sabbatical, it may need to find a temporary employee to cover for you. Train this person in your duties before you leave, or show willing coworkers how to cover your most important or time-sensitive duties while you're gone.

, If you have any recent job experience or certification that needs to go on your curriculum vitae, add it to the CV now. You may not remember to do this after you return from sabbatical.

, You can ""make your own sabbatical"" by resigning, then pursuing other non-work opportunities. After several months or even a couple years, you can search for a new job. There are obvious risks to this plan, as there is no guarantee you can get another job promptly. However, if you have the financial security to take an independent break, and you are pursuing genuine goals, you can put your ""sabbatical"" accomplishments on your resume when you decide to apply for a job again.

Make time for your faith every day.,
Block out distractions.,
Read your religious texts.,
Pray.,
Reflect on God.",How to Stay Focused on God2," Putting in a little bit of effort on a regular basis can help you stay connected to God all the time. Set aside some time for your spiritual practice every day. Take this time just as seriously as any of your other important appointments.For instance, you could use your lunch hour to read faith-based texts, or you could set aside half an hour for prayer and reflection before bed. You may even go so far as to writing your spiritual practices into your schedule like any other obligation to make sure you stick to them.
Many people like to make their spiritual practice part of their morning routine. Spending time with God first thing in the morning can give you a positive foundation for the rest of the day.

, Commit your full attention to your spiritual practice. Go somewhere you won’t be distracted to pray, read, and reflect. Take a deep breath and set aside your worries and distractions while you deepen your relationship with God., Connect with God by reading and thinking about your sacred texts. Mark the passages that resonate with you, and spend extra time reflecting on them. Look for ideas and themes in your sacred texts that you can apply to your own life.Reading books by religious leaders and scholars may also help you deepen your faith and your understanding of God.

, Praying daily is one of the most effective things you can do to get closer to God. Prayer is very personal, and you can pray about anything. Try using your prayer time to ask for guidance and inspiration, to affirm your personal faith, or to pray for your loved ones.You can pray anytime and anywhere. However, it’s still a good idea to set aside a specific time for prayer every day, so you won’t feel rushed or distracted.

, As you observe the world every day, let the things you see guide your thoughts towards God. When you feel moved by something, take a moment to ponder what it tells you about the nature of God and your personal relationship with God.As your faith grows, you might find God reflected in many different aspects of life, including art, the natural world, and other people.

Talk with friends and family who share your beliefs.,
Attend religious services.,
Use your faith to guide your choices.,
Find ways to serve your community.",How to Stay Focused on God3," Find other people with whom you can share your spiritual journey. Discuss things like how you incorporate your faith into your everyday life and how you avoid getting distracted by worldly issues.If you don’t know anyone who shares your beliefs, work on making some new friends at your place of worship, or search the internet for likeminded groups of people.

, Keep your beliefs strong by participating in the services and traditions of your faith. Visiting your place of worship regularly will help you stay connected to your spiritual community, as well as to God., Throughout your life, you’ll be faced with decisions, big and small. Before you make a decision, think carefully about which actions will help you achieve your spiritual goals and live by the tenets of your faith. Whenever you can, make choices that bring you closer to God.Prayer can help you make good choices when you’re faced with difficult decisions.

, Helping other people is a great way to grow in your faith and get closer to God. Look for local volunteer opportunities that reflect the values that are most important to you.You may be able to find volunteer opportunities through your place of worship.

Prioritize your faith, but be flexible in your methods.,
Lean on your faith during personal tragedies.,
Reflect on your faith when you feel unworthy.,
Don't allow others to dictate your beliefs.",How to Stay Focused on God4," Even if your faith is your top priority in life, you may have to accept that there will be times when you don't have as much time to observe your spiritual practices. When such times occur, be easy on yourself. Try to carve out as much time as you can, but you may have to get creative.For instance, if an overloaded schedule keeps you from attending a worship service, you might listen to a podcast or video while commuting to work.
If you generally dedicate an hour in the morning and evening for prayer and worship, you might have to cut these down to half an hour during busy weeks.

, Going through a traumatic event such as abuse or the loss of a child may threaten your faith in God. You might ask ""Why me?"" or wonder why bad things happen to good people. During these times, rather than questioning why things happened a certain way, seek out a deeper connection and understanding with God to help get you through.You might take on a spiritual adviser, receive religious counseling, or study scripture to glean understanding from your situation.
Religious and spiritual beliefs tend to help people heal faster, so lean on your faith during such times. You may find that on the other side you become more focused on God than ever before., There may come a time when you make a mistake in life that doesn't align with your spiritual or religious views. You may then become distant from God because you are ashamed. Know that most faiths acknowledge and understand that you are not perfect, and that you never will be. Be willing to forgive yourself so that God can forgive you, too.Seek out guidance from someone in your faith. Explain to them what happened--maybe you were unfaithful in your relationship or you drank alcohol in excess. Then, ask for recommendations on how you can forgive yourself and feel worthy again.

, It can be difficult to follow your spiritual practices when those closest to you oppose them. Others can make you feel ashamed about your faith in God, or they may try to discount the validity of your beliefs. You may have to make a choice between keeping these people in your life, or letting them go. Talk it over with someone you trust before making a decision.


If your family members disagree with your beliefs, you might simply avoid discussing your views around them. Or, if they seem open-minded you might try to compassionately share your views.If a friend or coworker opposes your faith, you might choose to end the relationship, especially if their presence in your life is distracting you from your faith.

"
"
Consider traveling.,
Find social responsibility opportunities.,
Plan your personal goals or growth.,
Learn new skills.,
Conduct independent research.,
Turn these plans into the most concrete goals possible.,
Plan each day out.",How to Take a Sabbatical2," This can be done in combination with most sabbatical goals. Seeing another culture and making contacts is often beneficial, both personally and career-wise.If your company is looking for international contacts or markets, choose a location the company is interested in to make your sabbatical more likely to be approved.

, You could volunteer for a charity, or do field research for humanitarian or environmental causes. Some companies interested in social responsibility may appreciate having a worker who represents them in this type of work.

, This could mean attending a meditation retreat, running a triathlon, or writing a novel. Other goals could be as simple as spending time with your family, especially if your job requires a lot of time away from home or after-hours work. Not only will this type of goal make you more confident and happy, your employer may also benefit from a happier, more motivated worker.

, Search for training courses, certification opportunities in new software or procedures, or language-learning programs. You may be able to visit another branch of your company or a sister organization, and do a little work for them to increase your knowledge and learn from a different corporate culture.


If you can't find opportunities like these, you can design your own schedule to teach yourself one of these skills.

, This is essentially work away from work, and can be a compelling reason for your employer to approve a sabbatical if you have a useful independent project proposal. Depending on your job, you may be developing a new product, process, or theory.

, Decide on a specific volunteer program to join, or a specific location to travel to. Give your research project, skill learning opportunity, or personal goals their own timeline and deadline, so you are motivated to reach those milestones.

, Even with concrete goals, it can be difficult to actually complete them without a regular work structure. Hold yourself to a certain amount of ""sabbatical goal time"" each day, whether this means spending time with your children or actively working on a project. This will cut down on wasted time and missed opportunities.

Do what feels comfortable.,
Consider a formal event.,
Explore informal rituals and ceremonies.",How to Use Rituals and Ceremonies to Overcome Grief1," There is no right or wrong way to grieve. There is also no right or wrong type of ritual or ceremony to have to help you overcome your grief. Doing what feels comfortable to you will feel more authentic and help you work through your loss.Don’t let anyone tell you what type of ceremony or ritual you should have to overcome your grief.
For example, your family may tell you that you should have a private ceremony for your fish. But if a public burial is what feels right to you, then do that.
Think about what will help you move through the grieving process. Write down what you want to get out of the ritual.
For instance, you might write, “I want to do something that will celebrate my friend’s life and help me remember him.”;
, Depending on the type of loss, you may want to have a formal ceremony or ritual to overcome your grief. The formal aspects, such as specific clothing, a set order of activities, etc. can provide you with structure and set some limits for your grief.There are religious and community leaders that can help you or even hold a formal event for you. This can reduce some of your stress.
For example, you might say to your rabbi, “I’d like to have a ritual for my uncle. Could you help me?”
If your loss is due to the death of a loved one, you may want to have a formal memorial ceremony.
You can also have a formal event when you are grieving for other reasons like a community center closing or a local natural disaster.

, They don’t have to be formal events held in specific settings or on specific days. A ritual or a ceremony can be anything you do to help cope with your grief.If you don’t feel up to a formal ritual or ceremony, then consider informal and more casual activities you can use to overcome your grief.


Think of activities that represent your loss. Use that activity as the ritual or part of it.
For instance, if your dog recently died but used to love walking to the store, then make a ritual of walking to the store once a day for a while.
Or, for example, you might make a ritual of writing a daily letter to your ex in your journal until you’ve gotten out all your emotions about the breakup.

Figure out your motivation.,
Look at the facts.,
Acknowledge the little risks you take.,
Respond to well-meaning critics.,
Look down both roads.,
Think well of yourself.,
Act quickly.,
Stop dwelling on the negative.,
Keep the past in the past.,
Find support.,
Accept the transformation.,
Redefine success.,
Stop looking around.,
Fail.,
Press on.,
Leap often.",How to Take a Leap of Faith," Ask yourself if the leap of faith you're about to make is motivated by fear or love. Decisions motivated by love are usually easier to follow through on. Every leap of faith will bring a little fear with it, but fear must not be the only thing pushing you forward.Ask yourself one simple question: if no one else were around to watch you or remark on your decision, would you choose to take this leap or not? The option you would take with no audience is probably the decision you would make based on love.;
, Emotions fade with time, but facts and reason remain consistent. There will always be something risky about a leap of faith, but there should also be some factual evidence to support the possibility of success.


Jumping from a bridge or an airplane would be suicide, but putting on a bungee cord or a parachute turns the experience into a risk you can probably walk away from.
If you'll definitely fall without divine intervention, don't make the leap. If you have enough support to at least break your fall, however, you can consider the leap.

, Even the simplest of everyday tasks has a risk factor. Think about the daily risks you take that you have grown accustomed to. The possibility of things going wrong might seem slim with these risks, but recognizing the risk involved can help you see that you are already capable of confronting potential hazards.For example, even getting in your car and driving to work in the morning presents some sort of risk. Your car could break down, another car might hit you, or something gravely unpleasant could happen to you once you arrive at the office. Since these risks are all fairly unlikely, you usually don't think about them, and even if you do, you don't let them stop you from going to work as usual each day.

, There will be many people who try to talk you out of your leap of faith, and most of these people will be well-meaning individuals who love you and are concerned for your well-being. Learn to appreciate their concern without letting it stop you.


Think back to a time when you took a big risk that paid off and recall the excitement and freedom you felt.
Then, think back to a time when you allowed the fears of others to hold you back instead of leaping. Recall the disappointment and bitterness you felt.
If the advice your loved one gives you evokes the feeling of liberation, listen to it. If the advice evokes a sense of disappointment, ignore it.
Act calm and try to reassure your loved ones that you have things under control, even if you're only pretending at the moment. If you seem calm about your decision, most of your loved ones will probably feel a little less stressed about it, too.

, Consider what might happen if you take your leap of faith. Then, think about what will likely happen if you don't. Compare the two possible futures and ask yourself which looks better to you.


Try to imagine yourself in a year. Create three different pictures: your life if you succeed, your life if you fail, and your life if you don't budge. Ask yourself which picture you could feel the most proud of and chase after it., Have a little trust in your ability to succeed. If you leave the ground expecting to fall on your face, you probably won't leap as high or as far as you actually could.


The decisions you make about your own life should be empowering, even if you're scared witless when you make them. Don't allow yourself to feel unworthy of the dream you have or lesser for pursuing it.

, Don't put it off any longer. If the opportunity and desire exists now, commit to taking your leap of faith now. Delaying your decision until you no longer have the chance to make it is nothing more than an indirect way of choosing not to jump.


If you can't start today, then set a date. Mark that date on your calendar and tell people about it so that you remain accountable. Treat your leap of faith as a reality starting today, even if the first physical step comes later.

, It really might be true that a thousand different things can go wrong, but fixating on those things now won't do anyone any good. While your life is in the middle of transition, you need to plan for the worst but expect the best.When you're standing at a high summit, you might tell yourself ""don't look down"" to ease the fear of falling.
That same principle should be applied here. Looking down at everything that could go wrong will make the fall more frightening and less successful.

, Now is not the time for regret. If everything about your life was already perfect, you never would've been tempted to take this leap. Idealizing what was will only make it harder to look ahead and work toward the best possible outcome.


Focus on the present and the immediate future. Always think about the ""next step"" and walk so quickly that you don't have time to glance over your shoulder at the ground you left behind.

, Connect with people who are willing to support you during your plummet. This support might be material in nature, but for the most part, emotional support is what you really need to look for.Find others who are in a similar state of free fall. They may have made a leap of faith similar to yours, or they may be undergoing their own test of courage. Either way, these individuals will probably be able to relate to the fear and excitement you're experiencing.

, The free fall period that follows your initial leap will change you, but even the most painful changes are good as long as they allow you to grow. If you resist the change, however, you will only rob yourself of the opportunity to mature.


Leaps of faith are frightening and difficult moves to make, but difficulties have a tendency to strengthen those who work their way through them. Once you realize that the experience has its own benefits regardless of the outcome, you can begin to learn from it.

, Contemporary society tends to define success in terms of how much fame or fortune you have, but those measurements of success are not absolute. Even if your leap of faith doesn't allow you to live comfortably, it may still be a success in other ways.


Focus on the positives in your life that disregard conventional ideas of success. You may feel very satisfied with your family life or social life. Even if nothing is quite the way you want it to be, you may still find fulfillment simply by pursuing your passions. As long as you feel spiritually nourished, your life is in a state of success.

, Don't compare your life to the lives of those you know. Everyone has different circumstances, so there's no real way to compare two different people in equal terms.


One person's idea of happiness may not match your own, and even if it does, the timeline they follow to reach that point won't be the same as yours simply because you're starting from two different positions and taking different steps to get there.

, It isn't enough to simply accept failure as an option. Until you actually experience failure, you won't learn to confront it and you won't be able to harden yourself against it.


Of course, this doesn't mean that you need to intentionally mess up a big break or engage in pointlessly reckless behavior. The idea here is simply to accept failure as a part of life. Instead of thinking that it's a necessary evil and trying to avoid it, accept that it will come and greet it when it does.

, Regardless of whether you fail or succeed, you need to maintain the momentum you've built up and continue on with your life. This might mean sticking with the path you put yourself on, turning around, or pursuing an entirely new venture.


If you fail, focus on your next move instead of the failure itself. Ask yourself if you need to retrace your steps, try harder along the same path, or pursue a new path altogether.
If you succeed, celebrate, but don't linger and become complacent in your success. Figure out the next step you need to take on the path you're on to continue and deepen your current success.

, After taking one leap of faith, take another, then another, and another after that. As with anything, practice will improve performance. Taking risks and leaping into the unknown becomes easier when you do it more often.


With experience, you'll gradually gain the ability to deal with and resolve unexpected problems that appear each time.
Experience will also grant you the ability to dust yourself off and walk away from each crash landing more effectively.

Decide what your attitude toward God or your spiritual life is.,
Write about what God or spirituality was for you in the past.,
Write about the current state of your relationship to your spiritual life or God.,
Write down what you want your spiritual life or relationship to God to look like in the future.",How to Surrender to God1," There are different attitudes people have toward their spiritual life. Determining what your personal relationship toward a spiritual life is can help you determine the best way to cultivate that spiritual life. For example, research shows that there are two types of attitudes towards religious commitment.: intrinsic and extrinsic. There is also a third dimension of religiosity called the “quest dimension”. Depending on which attitude or dimension that you have, you will approach your spiritual life in different ways. Intrinsic commitment: Having an intrinsic religious or spiritual attitude means that you believe in the religion or the spiritual world as absolute truth. You hold your belief in your religious or spiritual beliefs above all other beliefs.

Extrinsic commitment: Having an extrinsic attitude means you see your religious or spiritual beliefs as a means for you to live a fuller life, but do not regard religion above other beliefs you have. For example, you may use prayer as a means to gain relief from a stressful experience. For some people, having an extrinsic commitment to religion helps then fulfill social responsibilities or advancement.Quest:The quest dimension describes a kind of person who does not need to believe in a reality where God or any spiritual figure must exist. Instead, you believe that the complexity of religion or spiritual matters is important to grapple with, but you also work to cultivate doubt and skepticism alongside your faith. In other words, you expect your faith to change and grow with you.;
, To decide what spirituality or God means to you, you should write about your feelings and thoughts to help clarify where you want spirituality or God to go in your life.


The past is a very important part of you and should be used to decide what spirituality or God means to you now. Memory can be a rich source of knowledge that guides your decision making. Write about important experiences that involved spiritual enlightenment or God’s presence. For example, write about a time you felt profound peace when there was turmoil in your life.
Write about important relationships that taught you about spiritual growth or God, or write about relationships that hurt your spiritual life or relationship to God. For example, a relationship with a parent or guardian might have helped you grow closer to God.

, What do you believe about the spiritual or God now? What has changed in your beliefs or values? Write about these experiences, relationships or ideas that have shaped your most current relationship to your spiritual life or God.


For example, a recent change in a relationship like a divorce, having kids, or starting a new bond could have helped move you towards the idea of seeking a more spiritual life.
Write down the big questions you have about your relationship to God or the spiritual.

, Setting goals, even with your spiritual life, will help you to create the spiritual life that you desire.These goals can be spiritual goals such as finding time to talk to God, pray, or read religious texts. They can also be goals that help others with their spiritual needs, like giving to charities, volunteering, or praying for someone.

Ask for help.,
Choose when to have it.,
Select activities that have significance.,
Decide where to have it.,
Consider including others.",How to Use Rituals and Ceremonies to Overcome Grief2," Depending on the type of ritual or ceremony you decide to have, you may need assistance organizing it. Even if it is an informal ceremony, including someone else in the planning process can help you by giving you ideas for activities, helping you decide whether to include others, and offering moral support.


If you would like to have a formal ceremony or ritual then consider asking your religious or spiritual leader for help planning and holding it.
You might say, “I’d like to have a ceremony to help our family overcome our grief. Could you help me plan it?”
Even if you are planning a personal ritual, it’s okay to ask someone close to you for help.
You might say, “I’m planning a ritual to help me cope with the loss of job. Do you have any suggestions?”

, Ceremonies are usually held only once or every once in a while. Rituals can be something you do once or on a regular basis. Once you have decided what you want to do, you can decide when you will have the ceremony or ritual and how often you will do it to help you overcome your grief.Think about when the ceremony or ritual will be most memorable and meaningful for you.
For instance, will you have a ritual on the anniversary of your marriage or on the anniversary of your divorce being finalized.
Ask yourself if this is something you want to do once, or something you want to do on a regular basis.
For example, do you want to have one home-going ceremony for your friend or do you want to do a ritual each year on her birthday?

, Rituals and ceremonies include specific activities that have importance to you and are related to your loss.Think about what activities you can include in the ritual or ceremony to help you cope with your loss. Including words, songs, or movements that have meaning to you will help you overcome grief.


Make a list of songs that are significant to you during your loss. Consider playing, performing, or asking someone to perform one or two of them at the ceremony.
Write a letter or speech expressing your grief. If you feel comfortable, you can read it during the ritual or even bury it or shred it.
Some rituals include dance, handshakes, hugs, and other movement based activities.
For instance, you might decide to give a small bow to your deceased martial arts teacher when you drive past the dojo.

, You may have several options of where to have your ritual or ceremony depending on what type you decide to have. Whether you choose a formal public ritual or an informal personal ceremony, you should pick a location that has significance to you. Holding it in a special place will help you overcome your grief.


The location can be a public place like a park, religious building, or community center.
For instance, you might plan a ritual at your football field to cope with the loss of your coach.
You can also decide to have it somewhere private like your home or even your vehicle.

, Including others in your ceremony or ritual can help you overcome your grief by providing you with emotional support.If they are experiencing the same loss, inviting others to take part in your ritual or ceremony can also help them overcome their grief.


This can be an opportunity to share memories or thoughts about the loss.
Ask family and friends close to you to attend. You could say, “I’m having a ceremony to help me grieve the loss of my home because of the fire.”
Or you might say,” I’m organizing a candlelight vigil for our teacher and I’d like for you to attend and speak.”

"
"
Center yourself first.,
Be mindful.,
Express yourself openly.",How to Use Rituals and Ceremonies to Overcome Grief3," Take the time to calm yourself and prepare your mind and emotions for your ritual or ceremony. Even just centering yourself for a few minutes can help you get the most benefit out of what you are doing.


Take a few deep breaths. Slowly inhale deeply. Hold your breath for a moment or two and then exhale slowly. Repeat this a few times.
Remove any distractions that may prevent you from fully engaging in the ritual or ceremony.
Turn off your electronic devices and anything else that might disturb you.
Remind yourself why you are having the ritual or ceremony. Say to yourself, “I’m taking this time to help me overcome my grief.”

, One way to overcome your grief is to put all your attention into the ritual or ceremony. By focusing your thoughts and senses on your activity you are also allowing yourself to feel your grief and work through it.Don’t try to mindlessly perform the ritual or ceremony. Think about what you are doing and why you are doing it.


If you get distracted by a thought during the ritual, that is okay. Just try not to react to it. For example, if you get distracted by a thought that you need to switch out the laundry, don't stop what you are doing to go switch the laundry. Just let the thought pass like watching a cloud float by.
Pay attention to all of your emotion, thoughts, and senses during the ritual.
For example, you might notice the smell of the candle you lit, the flicker of it’s flame, and how peacefully you feel.
You might think something such as, “I’m polishing the silver like Grandma used to do. It feels so heavy. I miss how she would make it gleam.”
Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions arise when you are performing the ritual. Don’t fight them; it is a natural part of you overcoming your grief.

, One of the purposes of having the ritual or ceremony is so you can overcome grief. You won’t be able to do this if you hold your emotions in or feel that you have to act a certain way.Express whatever you are feeling in that moment. There is no right or wrong way to express yourself.


You can cry, yell, scream, or do whatever you need to do to overcome your grief.
For instance, if you feel like wailing then say to yourself, “It’s okay for me to do this and express my grief this way.”
If you aren’t fully feeling the impact of your loss yet, then don’t feel like you need to cry or do anything you aren’t feeling.
For example, you can remind yourself, “I don’t have to cry right now. I can express myself how I need to.”

A famous book about the history, meaning and practice of Zen Buddhism is The Way of Zen by Alan Watts. There are religious bookstores or stores with sections on religion to help aid you in finding texts to read. The internet also has an abundance of information and forums to help you.
Consider joining a book club that is reading theological or spiritual books.

, Follow up with them about how things are going for you in your spiritual life. Pastors and spiritual leaders hope to see individuals grow in their faith and are also prepared to support you when you go through hard times.


Establishing contacts with members of your church, mosque, temple, or place of worship, will help you feel connected to the spiritual community. Talking to another person who is knowledgeable about your faith can also help you make sense of your own spiritual life.Ask for advice or help from people within your religious or spiritual community. In some instances, the aid given to you by religious or spiritual people will differ from the advice given by people who are outside of this community. You may be challenged to think outside of a self-centred mentality and that might mean being nice or doing good for the people or situations where you have been wronged.

, Getting to know a small group of people will help you establish more meaningful relationships with people who are interested in growing in their spiritual life.


Going to a spiritual small group will help you stay active in your spiritual community. These groups great places to learn about spiritual life, share food, grow, practice spiritual practices together and share the struggles and joys of life together.
These groups will help you with a sense of belonging and bring you closer to individuals who share your spiritual journey. "

Go to church, mosque, temple, or a place of worship regularly.,
Get involved in your spiritual community.,
Do service for others.,
Practice prayer and/or meditation.,
Keep a journal daily, for at least twenty minutes.",How to Surrender to God3," If a spiritual community is a good fit for you, they will nurture you in your spiritual life. Often it takes some time to find a really good spiritual community, so check out multiple spiritual communities.


Tell people that you are looking for a good spiritual community. Generally, the best way to find a spiritual community is through word of mouth.
One way that you can tell a good spiritual community is by whether the people there seem to have full spiritual lives. If the people who attend the spiritual community seem to be genuinely joyful and excited about their faith or spiritual life, you may want to stick around. If not, keep looking. , Go to activities and events and establish yourself as a part of the community. It is a good idea to do this as soon as you start attending a spiritual community that you like. The longer you wait to become involved the more difficult it will be to reach out.


Avoid spiritual communities that make you feel uncomfortable about showing your true self. If you feel stifled by the belief at a particular spiritual community, you may want to keep searching.
Avoid communities that may seem clique-y or are hard to socialize with. For example, a community with an extrinsic commitment to religion may put more value in religious traditions and appearance over spiritual growth and community.

, All societies, cultures, and spiritual communities promote this prosocial behaviour.When you do work for others you will often feel more connected to your spiritual life. Service will often help you to grow and change because you will work in places and with people you might not normally come into contact with.


You can find ways to volunteer through your spiritual community or a community organization. Talk to your spiritual leader or a community official about how to get involved volunteering regularly. For example, if you have free Saturday mornings you can volunteer at the local food pantry or kitchen that provides meal services for people in need. , Prayer and meditation help you to intentionally cultivate your spiritual life. These practices also help you develop both your own discipline and focus.


Research shows that meditation has many health benefits, including decreasing depression, helping with eating disorders, boosting endorphins and decreasing aggression and hostility in individuals. Many people pray with other people regularly in prayer groups. Praying with others will help you build relationships with people as you cultivate a healthy prayer life.

, Start keeping a journal about your spiritual journey. Journaling helps you keep your priorities straight and adds clarity to your understanding of what is going on in your spiritual life. Write down important or inspiration quotes from texts to keep your connected and motivated in your spiritual growth.

Make a tiny emergency fund of about $1,000.,
Save up to 2, then 3 and prepare, eventually, for up to 6 months in an actual ""emergency-fund"", perhaps in an insured ""money market account"", for only true emergency expenses: for the loss of a job, having a serious illness, etc.,

Find ways to enhance yourself.",How to Run a Business Spiritually," Many spiritual people hold on to a notion that money or success are bad and therefore should be avoided. The problem with this is that it leads to never having enough or having continuous money struggles. Remember that there is a joy in wealth, a joy in financial security, a joy in being free from debt and a joy in owning. All of these things are spiritual in themselves and so can be thought highly of., Through delighting in the joy of others at receiving a service they truly need or find helpful in their daily lives, you realize the many ways in which you can offer a service to them. This, in turn, leads to financial success for you. By remaining sensible and joyful yourself, you make sure that you carry on making good decisions and handle people well. Through focusing on other people's joy, you can create a dynamic that is not entirely about the money.


Delight in doing yourself favours. Much success comes from simply delighting in doing yourself favours because you begin to identify things that would benefit you and be of use and value and have a constant energy to go and do them.

, A business that is not sustainable will not survive for long. Thus, by finding ways to reduce the wastefulness of your business, be it recycling or otherwise on a small and large scale, you create a sustainable environment within your business that can allow it to continue to flourish.


If you don't like accounting, get an accountant to handle that side of your business. Not liking that aspect of the business doesn't stop you from running it but you must have someone stay on top of it at all times.

, All of the persons relevant to your business, including customers, business partners, advertisers and so on, will not want to do business with you if you practice without any morals. Having good morals gives you strong disposition in making deals. In your business dealings, be considerate of the following:


Do not steal or allow yourself to be stolen from.
Do not cheat or allow yourself to be cheated.
Do not take negative advantage of others or allow others to take negative advantage of you.
Do not rip people off or allow yourself to be ripped off
Do not exploit others or allow yourself to be exploited.
Do not make promises you cannot keep.

, Keep contacts of other business owners, and begin to keep a book of contacts. These contacts allow you many opportunities and advice and allow you to do favours for others. By keeping good company in your personal life, you stay motivated and in sight of what is important.

, The more creative people there are in your business, the easier it will be to solve the problems. Most creative people find ways to turn problems into a solution.

, As well as making the business operational, make sure that it is for humans - do not neglect aesthetics, values or brilliance in the making. For instance, you may wish to have a calligrapher write meaningful poems onto the walls, displaying messages to all-comers that promote a joyful and sensitive environment. Or, have a graffiti artist paint a beautiful mural on the wall, symbolic of greatness.

, Be mindful of how you are treating them. A business works because because of the people involved. Through developing mindfulness of the people who work for you, interact with you and purchase from you, you become aware of many of the mistakes that people make and many of the struggles that they face. As a result, they are more included in the company and more willing to do what they can for it.

, Through inspiration comes motivation and energy. And from this comes a drive for success. If you are able to transfer the reasons and goals of the company successfully, they will want to work and do their best because they will enjoy it.

, Ignorance and business do not mix well. The more you pay attention, the less ignorant you become. Be conscious of your own suffering and stress so that you do not fall into disaster; it will never do to let yourself go until you break down and cannot work anymore.

, Find time for yourself to prevent burnout. If you do not take care of yourself, then your work will suffer also. A human being needs exercise and play as well as work in order to function. Make sure that you look after yourself well and find time for yourself.

, Through enhancing yourself, everything you do will be enhanced. enhance your perceptions, your intelligence and your capabilities, these are good places to start but make sure that you keep on doing so that you can reach your fullest potential.

Keep your already fully-funded emergency fund built up for the next emergency. Use the rest of your available money to help you complete college savings and paying off your home early.


Some people choose to invest a smaller amount, because they want to get children through a costly school or pay off the home first, but this can lead to problems for your and others' lives when you have little pad, no extra now or as you grow older.

In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving at 12% return in a mutual fund in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12% and inflation is at 5%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 7% per year!

Before starting the spiritual cleansing process, there are several important steps that must not be skipped:


Thoroughly clean out the junk and unnecessary items from your house (physically).,
Gather the things you'll need.

,
Gently pour the water into the salt, adding a prayer or invocation.,
Take the water and either using your fingers or a little brush, sprinkle the holy water around the walls of every room every door and every window.,
Pour the remaining salt/water mixture in a line in front of any doors leading in and out of the building.,
Go back into the house, and in each room light a small white candle and some incense.,
Put a bunch of fresh flowers into the main room of the house.

",How to Spiritually Cleanse Your Home of Psychic Disturbances," Give what you don't need to others who do, or have a garage sale and give what remains to others (as long as it is in good condition, of course). Many times, spiritual unrest follows a disorganized venue.
Thoroughly clean your house, top to bottom: literally, ceilings and attic to floor and basement. wash the walls (dilute vinegar or lemon water are quickest and easiest), dust, vacuum, clean carpets... and don't forget those sundry storage places like garages and sheds.
Air out the house for several days if you can. With all the windows and screens now clean and fresh, the fans and ducts without dust and mold, you can literally say out with the old and in with the new air in your house. So if the weather is going to be nasty for a few days, use that time to clean out..then let the house air out during the lovely fresh-aired days following. turn off the HVAC unit and open everything you can open. This is a good idea to do twice a year (spring and fall) anyway.;
,, An example of a Universalist prayer: ""May the blending the elements of pure salt to preserve the sanctity and pure water cleanse this space, in the Name of ........."" (here add your own prayer or finish the invocation to whichever deity you have belief in). Do this in a sacred and meaningful way, in the knowledge that you are creating a powerful medicine to cleanse and heal your home.

, Make sure that everywhere has been treated.

, As you do so be sure to recite the names of all who live in the house and all those whom you wish to pass freely in and out, including all pets that need to go in and out. This allows them to move with ease across the boundaries that you are setting up.

, Leave both to burn out to the end.

Change the subject.,
Don’t be defensive.,
Explain to them that you’re not interested in changing.,
Allow them to express their beliefs.",How to Stop People From Trying to Convert You to Another Religion1," If this is the first time your loved one has tried to explain to you why your beliefs are wrong and theirs are right, try changing the subject as gracefully as you can. If they are perceptive, they will realize that you aren’t interested in this kind of conversation with them.For example, you could say, “That’s really interesting Grandma. I need to go see if Mom needs any help in the kitchen. I’ll be back in a minute and I want to tell you about a big project I’m working on at school.”
You could also be more direct and say, “Grandma, I know you really want me to convert to your religion, but the truth is, I’m just not interested. Can we lay the subject to rest and enjoy our time together today?”
Bring up a really exciting movie that you have seen recently.
Ask them if they’d like something to drink or excuse yourself to the bathroom.;
, Sometimes the problem with religious family members is that they have multiple attempts to try and show you the “right way.” However, if you want religion to not be an issue that comes up over and over, then do your best to approach them lovingly.If you behave defensively towards them, it demonstrates to them that you are not secure in your own beliefs, and that they may have a chance to change your mind.
When they tell you about how great their religion is, say something like, “It sounds like you’ve found something that really makes sense for you. I’m happy for you! I’ve also found a religion that really feels good for me.” This shows them that you support their belief, but that you have different beliefs of your own without being defensive.

, For some, it may be enough if politely explain that, while you respect that they have their own beliefs, yours are different, and that you aren’t interested in being changed.You could say, for example, “I think that it’s admirable that your faith in is so strong. I have my own religious beliefs, and while it is good that you have your own, different beliefs, I’m not interested in converting. Maybe we could talk about something else?”

, Realize that their is a difference between a loved one simply talking about their own beliefs and trying to convert you. Try to recognize that sometimes, they may simply be wanting to talk about a religious belief that is on their mind or something that they read in their holy book. If they aren’t telling you how they have the best religion in the world, and then bashing your beliefs, they probably aren’t trying to convert you.If your loved one seems as though they are just talking about their religion, then don’t shut them down. You don’t have to agree with them, but you also don’t have to make them feel as though religion is a taboo subject around you.

Read outsiders' viewpoints on your own religion or belief system. Understand why others might not see it your way and notice what prejudice looks like, if you encounter any.
Include philosophic and secular viewpoints in your study of other faiths.

, While they may be called or observed differently, many traditions have similar core values, such as helping the needy, leading a moral, ethical life, and being loyal to the faith.

, If something is unfamiliar or different, don't shut it out. Explore it and understand it.

, The beliefs of those following other faiths were most likely learned much the same way you learned your own, from family, community, and participation in religious instruction.

Don’t answer the door.,
Be polite.,
Allow them to initiate their speech.,
Explain that you are not interested.,
Try to avoid engaging in debate.,
Realize that they probably won’t give up right away.,
Close the door.",How to Stop People From Trying to Convert You to Another Religion2," The easiest way to get someone who comes to your home to stop trying to convert you to their religion is to not answer the door. You aren’t obligated to answer the door to anyone. The downside of doing this, though, is that they may try again another time.


Look through the peephole to see who is knocking on your door before answering. If you don’t have a peephole, try peeking out the window.
If they ring the bell and you aren’t going to answer, try to make it seem as though you aren’t home. Turn the TV on mute and be as quiet as possible.

, If you do answer the door, there is no reason to be rude and simply slam the door in their face. You may not agree with their beliefs or their way of trying to convert you, but being rude won’t make the situation any more comfortable.Say, “Hello, how can I help you?” Don’t just open the door and say, “What do you want?”
Additionally, being rude may only serve to make them feel as though they need to show you the way, making them even more insistent.

, They will usually begin by explaining who they are and what their religion is. They will ask if they can come in to talk to you about their beliefs, and why they should be your beliefs too. Letting them get their first bit out will make it seem less rude when you say you aren’t interested, and turn them away.


Normally, their introduction will only take a minute or two. If they begin to rattle on for 5 minutes while standing outside their door, then it’s OK to interrupt them to explain that you’re not interested.

, Do this politely. Explain that you are not interested in converting to their religion. If you want to, you can tell them what religion/belief you follow, but you don’t have to.For example, you can say, “Thanks for stopping by, but I’m not interested in converting to your religion. I feel comfortable with my own beliefs, and I’d like to stick with them. Have a nice day!”

, It may be tempting, especially if you have strong beliefs of your own, but if you want them to leave you alone, engaging in conversation with them will not help you accomplish this. Remember that your visitors have strong beliefs, which have led them to walk around town trying to “save” everyone. It is unlikely that you can convince them of your own beliefs.That said, if you have time to waste, and feel like engaging in debate, there’s no reason that you cannot do this. Just realize that this will take up a lot of your time, and will likely lead nowhere.

, People who go door-to-door are used to having people turn them down, so they probably won’t be phased by your explanation. They may have counter arguments for why you should let them in to hear about all the ways their religion is the right one.At this point you can become more firm in your insistence that you aren’t interested. Tell them you have a lot of things to get done, and although you appreciate their visit, you have to go now.

, If the visitors continue to insist that you should hear them out, you can either just close the door without saying anything, or you can quickly make up an excuse and close the door without waiting for a response.


For example, you can say, “I really have to get back to what I was doing. Bye!” or “I’m sorry, I have something in the oven that I must check on. Have a nice day.”

"
"
Try to ignore them.,
Politely tell them you aren’t interested.,
Make up an excuse.,
Walk away.,
Notify the authorities.",How to Stop People From Trying to Convert You to Another Religion3," In public places, you may often come across people who stand on a street corner preaching beliefs at passers-by. If they have not directly targeted you, just keep walking.


Try to avoid making eye contact with the person. If they are simply preaching to whoever will listen, they will seek out eye contact with people. If you make eye contact, they are more likely to approach you.
To keep the situation from being awkward, you could take out your phone and pretend to be answering it, talking, or texting. This may deter them from interrupting you. This will also keep the situation from being awkward if they try to stop you as you can simply act like you didn't realize they were trying to gain your attention.

, You can try to explain that you aren’t interested in converting, or that you are very happy with your current set of beliefs. Be aware though, that this is unlikely to deter them. They likely have several arguments prepared against many different rationales.For example, you can say, “It seems like you really know about your religion, and that’s great. However, I am as convinced about my own religion as you are yours, so I’m not really interested in converting.”
If you are interested in engaging in conversation with them then do so. However, don’t expect that you can change their mind.
Don’t try to reason with them. If they are standing outside talking to strangers, they are probably quite convinced of what they believe. Trying to be rational about how everyone is entitled to different beliefs probably won’t make much sense to them.

, If the person has singled you out and is trying to tell you about why you should convert, tell them you have an important meeting that you are about to be late for, or that you are rushing to pick up your child/younger sibling from school.For example, you can say, “I’m sorry, but my little brother is waiting for me to pick him up from school and he’s all alone. I can’t hang around chatting anymore.”
Don’t wait for a response. It’s possible, but unlikely that the person will say something like, “OK, have a nice day!” More likely is that they will ask you to hang on so they can give you a bunch of different pamphlets and other information on who you can get in touch with to learn more about their religion. The easiest way to get out of it is to offer your excuse and then walk away quickly. It may not be the most polite route, but it will get you out of the situation.

, If the person persists and doesn’t seem to be put off not matter what you say, simply walk away. Realize that they may still say things to you as you walk away and they may even start to be rude. Ignore these things. Realize that you are under no obligation to stand around listening to something you aren’t interested in hearing.


You may feel rude doing this, but you should remember that they are being rude by trying to force you to stand around listening even though you have already tried to politely decline.

, If the person seems to be acting unnecessarily aggressive towards you or towards others, notify the police. While it is not illegal in the USA to talk about your beliefs openly in public, it is illegal to harass people.If this person is threatening people or following them persistently even when they try to get away, this is harassment.
If the person physically assaults you or someone else, call 911 and inform them of the situation right away. If you can, try to get a picture of the person or video footage of the incident on your phone.

Understand that your journey is yours alone.,
Keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings.,
Make a set of goals and prioritize them.,
Decide on the scope of your journey.",How to Go on a Spiritual Journey1," Everyone's spiritual journey, whether in response to difficult challenges or uplifting opportunities, is unique. Despite this, many spiritual journeys will use similar tools or go down similar paths.Remember that, though advice from others can be helpful, nobody can tell you how your journey should be going, or what direction it should be going in.


You are ultimately responsible for the direction of your journey. If one of the steps in this guide produce stress or harm for you, skip it for the time being and find an alternative that helps you contemplate your life.
No religion has a monopoly on truth. If a religion or its followers begin to control or scare you, consider backing up and consulting a different source.;
, Though this may seem like pre-planning, your journey begins now. Take inventory of your thoughts, feelings, fears, and expectations. Record your thoughts about daily life and your long-term thoughts. Every week, read over your entries and contemplate your accomplishments and challenges for the week. Use this as a grounding exercise to understand your worries, hopes, and ambitions in context.


Such practice is often referred to as keeping a ""mindfulness journal.""Its purpose is to reveal to you the thought patterns that govern your life, possibly negatively, so that you may focus on transforming them.

, The mindfulness journal can help in organizing your thoughts in regards to goal-setting. Spiritual journeys can help those who want to be calmer and less angry, who are anxious about death, who want to enlarge their sense of wonder about the world, or who are struggling to leave behind an old belief system. As this is your journey, it will help you heal or change whatever it is you decide to focus on.


Prioritize what interests you intellectually as well as emotionally; think about what you are curious about, as well as what you might change to live a healthier life. Spiritual journeys can incorporate both intellectual and emotional aspects of your life.
Remember that spiritual goals may take a lifetime to accomplish, and often change along the way. Avoid setting deadlines for your goals, or allowing them to stress you out.

, Do you have a single challenge you need assistance with? Or are you looking for long-lasting personal transformation? Are you simply looking for a meditative practice to add to your routine, or are you having a heavy crisis of faith? Understand beforehand how sweeping your journey may be; like therapy, a spiritual journey may require all your focus in changing your relationship to the world, or it may only need a small amount of your time and attention.


Many spiritual journeys are lifelong affairs that constantly build upon themselves. Spirituality is a crucial part of life, and is hardly ever separate from it.Allow your scope to change as is necessary.

Read sacred texts.,
Consult public services that focus on spirituality.,
Read or listen to popular spiritual sources.,
Don't be afraid to use community support.",How to Go on a Spiritual Journey2," Religious texts such as the Bible, the Torah, the Quar'an, the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita, or the Upanishads can give you a new perspective on life or open your eyes to other people's beliefs or thoughts. Though you do not need to subscribe to any of the teachings laid out in religious texts, you can better understand the context of your questions and struggles by understanding how spiritual questions have been posed throughout history. Reading sacred texts can also point you in new directions, allowing you to ask questions you didn't have the words for before.


You may want to accompany your studies with educational courses. Universities, community colleges, and continuing education centers offer courses in the history of religious practices and texts.
If you do read scholarly texts alongside sacred texts, be aware that there is a difference between theology and ""religious studies."" Religious studies can be thought of as studying religion from its outside, while theology is often written by practitioners of that religion., Certain public figures can act as a resource or guide for your spiritual journey. An obvious one is the leader of a local church or clergy; they often will meet with individuals and help them make decisions. Before you meet with such a leader, it may be helpful to attend a few services or events in order to understand the attitudes that underlie the congregation's beliefs.


Other civic institutions may have a chaplain on staff who are skilled guides when it comes to certain topics, such as grief or loss.
Such institutions include hospitals or army outposts, but you may need to be a regular user of their services to consult with their chaplain.

, There are many popular writers and speakers who communicate spiritual or religious ideas in ways that make sense for everyday life. Helpful books can be found in the ""spiritual,"" ""religion,"" or ""new age"" section of bookstores or libraries. Seminars and reading groups may be held by colleges or community centers in your area. Public radio and online podcasts are often good sources of programming that present research, critique, and discussion of spiritual ideas.


Avoid figures that actively request financial support, promise reliable answers, or who seem to be selling something. Oftentimes, they are not counting your spiritual journey as a priority.
If you can afford it, traveling to retreats, camps, and spiritual meetups can be a healthy way to expand your horizons and meet new people.

, Though the stereotypical image of the spiritual journeyer portrays a monk praying alone, spiritual journeys can be enriched by the inclusion of others. Talk to friends or family members about your questions or the ideas you are trying to refine. Attend local meet-ups or study groups that focus on your topic at hand. Whether you are trying to improve a skill, such as mindfulness or meditation, or trying to become more culturally literate, learning from others can make the process more fulfilling.


Not only is this a way to find mentors, this is also may lead you to mentoring others, which can enrich your journey.

Practice meditation.,
Incorporate exercise into your spiritual life.,
Create reflective spaces.,
Investigate alternative states of consciousness.,
Visit sacred places.,
Investigate yourself!",How to Go on a Spiritual Journey3," Meditation can help deeply probe your sense of self, still anxiety, and clear your mind.It is a technique for directing attention and refining how one focuses on their self. Meditation doesn't have to be performed while cross-legged on the bare ground; modifications such as walking meditation exist, and many religions have their own form of self-contemplation.Yoga can add a physical component to contemplation and can help you in clarifying your spiritual goals.
There are many different variations on meditation. They can be learned and practiced in social settings, whether they be spiritual meetups or regularly-meeting meditation groups led by an expert. These meetups are often free to attend, or ask for a small donation.

, The body is understood by some religions to be a temple for the spirit, so maintaining your temple makes sense from a spiritual standpoint.More than that, though, regular exercise can elevate our mental capabilities, helping to relieve mild depression and promote positive thinking.A holistic and balanced approach to life, including exercise, can keep one involved in and attuned to the world, increase mindfulness, and improve quality of life.


Exercise needn't be exhausting. Moderate exercise, spread out throughout the week, can keep one's body fit and in shape., Reflective, quiet spaces in which to contemplate life can shield you from a daily intake of information and stress. College campuses and work places incorporate aspects of nature, movement and rhythm, quietness, and relaxation in order to improve mindfulness and groundedness. Creating a comfortable space in your home, office, or dorm that you can visit in order to unpack the day's events can promote your spiritual well-being


Reflective spaces may incorporate images, icons, and posters, smells (such as incense or flowers), and either silence or meditative music.

, Recent research in psychoactive plants (such as psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, and marijuana) indicates that they may promote openness and a more accepting personality after even one use.These sorts of plants, most generally associated with shamanism and 60's counterculture, contain drugs that are the subject of intense pharmaceutical research due to their ability to positively influence thought patterns and relieve chronic stress.Educated use of psychoactives may improve or add to spiritual practices and understandings.


Many of these plants are illegal to possess or cultivate in the United States.
Psychedelic drugs are notorious for carrying the risk of a ""bad trip,"" which may spiritually confuse or disorient users. Psychoactives can still be largely beneficial when used in a sparing, informed, and limited capacity.

, Sacred places are often historically significant locations that hosted important religious events or practices. Sacred places include a range of sites, many of which are visited heavily throughout the year (such as Stonehenge or the Vatican), others of which may be interesting to historians only (such as certain cathedrals).Sacred places are often grand in scale and communicate a feeling of the sublime to visitors. In being unordinary, sacred places can help cement spiritual understanding in your life, as well as deepen your appreciation for history.


Some sacred places are associated with sacred events, such as the Hajj. It may make more sense to time your visit with religious calendars.

, Continue to monitor how your practice and research impact your thinking. The mindfulness journal is an important spiritual tool--it keeps you in touch with your findings, your doubts, and new aspects of your beliefs and location in the world. Notice if negative thinking is increased or decreased as you explore, and change what and how you explore based on these changes.


The spiritual journey is there to serve you, and though it may not be comfortable at times, you should be able to see how it is improving your relationship to yourself, others, and your sense of compassion.

Think!,
Act!,
Share!,
Pray!",How to Get out of a Spiritual Slump," Our feelings flow from our thoughts. So replace negative thoughts with truth: that God loves you and has promised you strength for the trials of life, and his presence. Rather than just stewing in your own doubts and fear, focus on the promises of God found in the Bible. (for example, read 2 Corinthians 4:8).;
, Act as if you have more faith than you do. Imitate those whose faith you admire. Your actions may transform your attitude. Use people who have strong faith as your role models. If you don’t know any, you can find inspiring stories of people of faith in the Bible. In his book Always True (Moody Publishers, 2011), pastor James MacDonald offers this: “Is the spark and passion you used to have replaced by lethargy and apathy? That’s not what God wants for you, says Hebrews 6:12. He wants you to be 'imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.'” (p. 48) Who are those inheritors of promise? The heroes of the faith whose stories are in the Bible.

, Don’t be afraid to talk to others. You’re not the only one who wrestles with doubt and lagging faith. Talking honestly with others about your faith is the first step toward reviving it when you are in a season of sluggish faith. And who knows, you might end up encouraging someone else who felt alone in their doubt.

, Talk to God about your questions and doubts. It’s not like you’re fooling him—God already knows how you feel, but praying about it can be the first step toward revival. One man who encountered Jesus told him, “I do believe, help my unbelief!” Just praying about our struggles will help us experience God's love. MacDonald writes: “if in times of doubt we take our questions directly to the Lord, then our faith increases. We can’t claim we won’t doubt; instead, we aim toward knowing what to do with doubts when they do come at us.” (p. 55)

Attend services to check your comfort level there.,
Make sure, that in your heart you have the need to follow and change from the religion your parents follow, to this other religion.,
If you are certain, then at dinner one evening, when you are alone with your parents, talk to them.,

Find a time and place.,
Simply ask.,
Be considerate.,
Ask more questions.,
Be sensitive if they get upset.",How to Question Your Parents' Religion," There are many feeling when it comes to religions. Some people can preach it to the whole universe with pride while others wish to practice in private and in peace. With these different feelings, it's necessary to put it into consideration. Usually, it is appropriate to ask your parents personal questions when it's just them and you. It's better if they're in a good mood.;
, Weird as it may seem, any question can set off a good conversation. If your not sure what to ask, consider the following.


""Mom, Dad, what religion do you guys believe in?""
""What does the religion believe in exactly?""
"" Is it part of our heritage? The ____ religion?""
""Are there certain rules to this religion?""
""What do you guys love the most about the religion?""

, When they respond, you should sit and listen to their reasoning. Be open minded when they do this, it could be quite personal for them to explain their beliefs to you. If you do not agree with some of their beliefs, simply keep that part to yourself. Do no interrupt as they explain to you.

, If you are still unsure of their religion, keep asking questions. It's important to notice their mood when you continue the conversation. If they seem annoyed that you keep asking, simply allow the subject to die and depart from the conversation. If they ask you why you were curious, tell them their feelings.

, If they respond angrily, apologize immediately and depart. Sometimes when people question religion, it can offend the people of the faith. Or sometimes the way you ask can offend the person, so remember to choose your words and tone of voice wisely.

Be clear on the definition.,
Understand the science.,
Learn the levels.,
Appreciate the benefits of seeing auras.,
Learn the colors of auras and their meanings.",How to See Auras1," While, in general, auras are thought of as distinctive atmospheres that surround a person, you must realize that auras are more specific than that. They are considered by some to be made up of vibrations--electro-photonic vibrations that are generated in response to some sort of external excitation. What's key about an aura is that it contains information about the essence of the person or object that it surrounds.;
, Auras around humans are composed in part from electromagnetic (EM) radiation that spans from microwave and infrared (IR)radiation on the low-frequency end to UV light on the high-frequency end. The UV light is more related to our conscious activity (thinking, creativity, intentions, sense of humor and emotions) and is the part that can be seen with the naked eye. The electro-magnetic energies of the aura surround the body in an oval- shaped field. This ""auric egg"" emits out from the body approximately 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) on all sides. It extends above the head and below the feet into the ground. , The aura consist of seven levels (also called layers or auric bodies), and these correspond to the seven chakras in the body. Each level has its own unique frequency but also relates to and affects the other levels around it. Consequently, if one level is unbalanced, it can lead to unbalance in the other levels as well. Physical level. On this level, you require simple physical comfort, pleasure and health.







Etheric level. On this level, you need self-acceptance and self love.







Vital level. On this level, you want to understand situations in a clear, linear, rational way.







Astral level. On this level, you seek loving interaction with friends and family.







Lower mental level. On this level, you require alignment with your divine will and a commitment to speak and follow the truth.







Higher mental level. On this level, you must have divine love and spiritual ecstasy.







Spiritual (intuitive) level. On this level, you require connection to the divine mind and to understanding the greater universal pattern.







, Learning to see someone's aura can tell you a great deal about that person and his or her character. Learning to see your own aura can inspire you to make changes that will improve the signals that you radiate.


Spot a liar. Aura's can't be faked. If someone is being dishonest with you, you'll be able to spot it as you ""listen"" to their thoughts via their aura.






Get clues into someone's nature. A bright, clean aura indicates that a person is good and spiritually advanced. A gray or dark aura reveals someone to have unclear intention. Someone who presents himself to be a spiritual teacher, master, guru or other spiritual leader or guide should have a clearly defined yellow-golden halo around the head.






Diagnose diseases. Reading auras can allow you to detect a problem in the body before any physical symptoms present themselves.






Enhance personal growth. Reading auras can raise your consciousness, aid in spiritual development and strengthen your awareness of the natural world.

, Auras exist in a wide range of colors, which convey a message about the person or object they surround. While there are a number of variations, each with a specific message, these are the basic colors.



Red. Red pertains to the heart, circulation and the physical body. Viewed in a positive light, it can indicate a healthy ego; on the negative side it may speak to anger, anxiety or an unforgiving nature.







Orange. Orange pertains to reproductive organs and emotions. Looked at positively, it indicates energy and stamina, creativity, productivity, adventurousness, courage or an outgoing social nature. Looked at negatively, it can speak to current stress related to appetites and addictions







Yellow. Yellow relates to the spleen and life energy. It is the color of awakening, inspiration, intelligence and action shared, creativity, playfulness, optimism and an easy-going nature. However, a bright yellow can indicate fear of losing control, prestige, respect or power.







Green. Green relates to heart and lungs. When seen in the aura, this usually represents growth and balance, and most of all, something that leads to change. It speaks to a love of people, animals and nature. A dark or muddy forest green aura indicates jealousy, resentment, feeling like a victim, insecurity and low self-esteem.







Blue. Blue is related to the throat and thyroid. Its positive associations are a caring, loving nature, intuition and sensitivity. Dark shades of blue indicate fear of the future, of self-expression or of facing or speaking the truth.







Violet. Violet relates to crown, pineal gland and nervous system. It is considered to be the most sensitive and wisest of colors. This is the intuitive color in the aura and reveals psychic power of self-attunement.







Silver. Silver is the color of spiritual and physical abundance.







Gold. Gold indicates enlightenment and divine protection. An individual with a gold aura is being guided by his or her highest good.







Black. Black draws or pulls energy to it and transforms it. It typically indicates a long-term inability to forgive or unreleased grief and can lead to health problems.







White. White is a pure state of light and represents purity and truth. It can mean that angels are nearby or that a woman is or soon will be pregnant.

Know when it's time to cleanse.,
Cleanse your aura.,
Protect your aura.",How to See Auras2," We pick up other people's energies without even being aware of it. When those energies are negative, they affect our aura negatively. You may have had an experience like this: you're in a good mood and looking forward to spending time with a friend. You're enjoying your evening but at some point realize that you're feeling irritable and anxious. When you get home, you're in a full-blown bad mood, and you're not sure how you got there. A situation like this indicates that you should cleanse your aura. Even if your aura doesn't seem out of balance, it's a good idea to cleanse it periodically to release any negative energies.

, Focus on your root chakra located at the base of your spine and associated with the color red. Envision it anchored to the earth by a red light that extends beneath it. Then envision yourself engulfed in a shower of brilliant gold light radiating down from the sun. Let the light penetrate your body and your aura. Hold this image for some time. Then envision a violet light extending from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. See and feel it as a warm, protective blanket and believe that it has the ability to heal and protect any gaps in your aura. At this point, the cleansing and healing process is underway, and you should feel yourself becoming stronger, releasing negative energy and feeling more at peace. Meditate on this feeling for a while. When you feel comfortable, imagine a white light surrounding your cleansed aura for additional protection. , You can take other steps to protect and strengthen your aura; these include massage, shielding, cord cutting and heavenly intervention.

Try Reiki energy healing. This light touch therapy increase the flow of energy by helping to remove stagnant or blocked chi. A Reiki practitioner acts as a medium to receive divine energy and channel it into your energy field where it pushes through blocked chi to prevent further mental, emotional, physical or spiritual dysfunction.






Create a shield. Visualize a bubble or pod of white, loving light enveloping you. This shield of protection can repel any negative thoughts, feelings or other psychic attacks directed at you and prevent energy vampires from draining you.






Cut the cord. Invisible energy cords can emanate from you and attach to another person, place, object or situation. While positive cords of love can never be severed, etheric cords based on fear can be cut in order to prevent further drains of energy. Call upon Archangel Michael to use his sword to cut the negative cords or envision a laser beam from a favored crystal slicing through them.
Ask for angelic assistance. Call on angels for help; they're always available to assist you but must be invited before they're allowed to intervene. Ask Archangel Michael for negative cord cutting, Archangel Raphael to fill energy voids with green, healing light and Archangel Metatron to clear chakras.

Start by sensing.,
Develop your peripheral vision.,
Tune in to colors.,
Learn how to see.,
Practice on yourself.",How to See Auras3," A good way to begin seeing auras is to practice sensing them. That means paying attention to how you feel in someone's presence. Take a deep breath, exhale and then focus on the physical sensations in your body and your gut reaction. Ask yourself how being around the person makes you feel--serene? jumpy? agitated? Think about what color your would attach to this person. As your abilities are enhanced, sensing and seeing auras will become easier. , Our peripheral vision is less damaged than the central part of our retina and has healthier photosensitive cells. Also, since we've trained our central vision to be used in certain ways over the years, it can be difficult to call on it now to see in this new way of viewing auras. One simple exercise you can do is to practice concentrating on one spot for 30-60 seconds. This will increase your sensitivity to light. , Doing some training with bright, primary colors can help you develop the ability to see auras. Cover a book in blue or red paper and stand it upright on a table several feet away from you. Be sure the wall behind the book is white or neutral and the light in the room is soft but not dim. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, relax and then open your eyes and look at the book. Don't focus on the book, instead look a little to the side and past it. After a while you'll see a pale narrow aura coming from the book that will change to a bright yellow or green as you hold your soft focus. When you get comfortable with looking at one book, try covering several books with different color paper and looking at them. As you get better at seeing colors, work your way up using plants, animals and then people.






It's okay to blink normally and quickly while doing this exercise. The aura may disappear for a second when you do, but it will reappear quickly if you stay relaxed and hold your focus.






Keep practicing to get used to the way your eyes must maintain that steady, un-focus. Don't strain your eyes or tense your eyes or forehead.

, Have a partner stand 18"" in front of a blank, white wall in a room that's not too brightly lit. Look at the wall behind the person and a couple inches away from his or her body. Do not look at the person, or you'll lose the aura's image. Instead, look beyond where he or she is standing and try to notice an area around the person where the background wall may look lighter than the rest. Try to see the color; ask yourself what color you would use to describe this area.


Once you've identified the color, you can ask the person to sway from side to side. Their energy field should move with them.






If you saw different colors in different areas of the person's aura you eyes weren't necessarily deceiving you; an aura can definitely be different colors depending on what's happening in different areas of a person's body. Practice for only a few minutes eye and avoid straining yourself. Each individual develops this skill at a different pace.






The brightness of a person's aura has a lot to do with how they feel. If they feel happy and full of life their aura is stronger, larger and brighter. Try playing your partner's favorite music to help energize his or her aura and make it easier to see.







, Sit in a dimly lit room and relax. Take a couple of deep breaths. Set in your mind the goal of seeing your own aura and focus on that goal. It's important that you believe this is something you can do. Touch your index fingers together, rubbing them and pushing them against each other. Aura is “sticky”, and once one finger sticks with another one, the energy will “hang” between fingers. Now, focus on the area between fingers as you continue to rub them together. After a bit, move your fingers apart leaving about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between them. Focus on the space between them and see if you can make out a colored mist, or fog or smoke between your fingers. With continued training, the aura will get more clear and easier to see. When it does, repeat the exercise with your hands, rubbing them together and moving them apart to see the aura between them.

Make a Psi Wheel.,
Situate yourself in a room with no wind and no distractions.,
Hold your hand on one side of the wheel (palm facing the wheel) and watch it rotate.,
Try moving the wheel without placing your hand near it.",How to Spin a Psi Wheel," Make sure it is easily knocked over when you blow on it, as this means it will be easy to spin. If it is not balancing, make a new one.;
, If there are any fans on, turn them off. If you are listening to music, turn it off.

,


Telekinesis believers will tell you that your psychic forces are making this happen. Try concentrating very hard on moving the wheel; visualize energy flowing from your body, out of your hand, and pushing the wheel. Does it work better when you do that? If so, you might want to put that psychic energy to work and make a psi ball or use dowsing rods.
Scientists will tell you that the warmth of your hands causes the air on that side of the wheel to heat up; since heat rises, the warm air goes up, creating an upward current that spins the psi wheel. Try getting your hand warmer by cupping your hands on your mouth and blowing, then immediately try to rotate the wheel. Does it work better that way? Try sticking your hand in the freezer, then rotate the wheel. Does it work?

,


Cover your mouth and nose with a cotton blanket so your breath does not affect the wheel.
Sit about half a meter away from the wheel in a comfortable spot with a good view of the psi wheel.

Clear your mind.
Think about how much you want it to spin; yearn for it to spin. Build up the want for the wheel to spin.
Make it move.

Ask, out loud or in your head, for the wheel to move.
Imagine blowing on the wheel causing it to spin.
Imagine the wheel spinning rapidly.
Imagine pushing the wheel with your fingers.
Imagine energy flowing from your eyes pushing the wheel.

Make your concept clear about God.,

Help the old people in getting what they want to the maximum possible extent.,
Have a tolerance power.,
Understand the importance of gifts from nature.,
Appreciate the perfection of human body.",How to Experience God," Do you want to see God as a person or want to realize him without any shape? In Hinduism like Ram, Krishna and so on, there are numerous gods. God does not conform to a particular shape. Since God does not have a particular shape you have to find your own way of defining God. You can define your views on god in a similar fashion to that of Christianity.The following steps are applicable to everyone.;
, When you help others by giving money, putting your labor, offering your good suggestions, serving patients etc., but without charging any fees, then others will feel the presence of God in you and bless you.The blessings gained will definitely help you and your family in your bad time.

, Smile gives happiness and a cry gives pain. After all every one strives for happiness in his life. God or nature is full of happiness. Grab it and enjoy.

, You can feel the presence of God in their smiles when they get what they want.The blessings from elders will definitely protect and help us in our bad time.

, Behave like the sun: What temperature can any human sustain? Maximum 40 °C (104 °F). After that, it is called a fever. But the sun with many thousands of degrees, burns himself and gives light and energy sufficient for entire world receiving nothing from us. Here is God or Supreme power or nature.

, Natural resources are the gifts from God/Supreme power. Water, Oxygen, Fire, Light, Fruits and many more natural resources available on earth are necessary for every single human being's existence. They have been provided by nature (universe) free of cost. Hence all of the humans can feel the presence of God in the whole universe.

, Human body is made up of many complicated but perfect systems,like heart, brain, kidney, liver, etc. This is given by nature.

Place expected ideals firmly in your thoughts and circumstances.,
Allow as much time (weeks, months or years, decades) as is needed to reach your farthest flung ideals.,
Compare, saying this: ""I expect this!"",
Suspend momentary pleasures.,
Visualize--""see""--the answer already on the way through one opening concept, as your portal, your doorway, as a narrowed vision, for what can be gauged and seen clearly (ie, believed):


Expect to achieve what you believe and see the process in your mind, and do it.,
Agree with those who have your good at heart, in mind, and receive that favor and blessing that agreement with the right people can bring.

,
Process it: Produce it.,
Set real goals--the immediate, short, medium and long term ones: Expect actively with your hands working and expect with your feet walking, because it is real as you are prepared to see it and make it.,
Expect, for example, and birth a profitable idea to:


Plan what you need, formalizing, inventing, designing,
Finding, buying, making, building,
Fulfilling needs, caring, marketing, selling,
Hiring, training, managing, growing,...

",How to Expect Beyond Hope," It is much more than hope. Decide that you will begin on the path toward your chosen future; it may take years: think of a journey, a career, other lives affected, even in generations to come. Visualize the opening of a path that you really want to follow and think of what is next, and beyond the horizon that you believe will happen.


Hope, on the other hand, is much less provocative, much like wishing, with a bit of ""seems possible..."" added in.;
, Join trust and faith (the opposite of fear and doubt); blend hope, love and action (opposite of despair) into one flowing process for meaning, fulfillment, profit and joy, the pleasure of reality--No!--not like mere fantasy. Think of the meaning of ""expect"":
~ noun - a mental attitude involving the process of looking forward, anticipating, for example: ""a sure prospect of future profits"" -- look actively (not looking back) realize with certainty, such as: ""There is every expectation of this to happen at the planned time, profitably.""
~ verb - the act of looking forward, anticipating, examples: ""to have great expectations"", or the ""degree of probability"" that something will occur
~ math - expected, statistical probability' it is called ""mathematical expectation"", for example: ""It is expected with a 98.7% certainty (formal probability)"".

, -- realize that expecting is pregnant hope: full fruited life previewing its factuality, expressed in the vim and vigor of trusting deeply.


Now say, ""I hope for this!"" how does that feel -- like a dry shriveled raisin without the flow of life; lacking viability, hope means you would ""like"" it... Hope is nice, your need it, but expect is strong, and that should feel much better -- believe, achieve, receive the expected result...

, Postpone involvements if the person may not be right one and hold an expectation in grasp: It can bring the peace of mind that overcomes the entire world-outlook of guilt, anger and fear (anxiety) of the present and future.


Postpone career entry for a higher education, a bachelors degree, a masters and a doctorate. Some people wait on many commons things empower expectations to become a doctor of science, law or medicine.

,


The Wright Brothers expected heavier than air flight as expected by many. Many gliders had succeeded already...

Columbus expectation of sailing West to get to the East Indies was ""based on evidence and observations"" of many that they would not fall off the edge of the Earth, expecting the world to be proved to be spherical.

Edison tried well over 1000 experiments before his electric light bulb worked because he ""expected it to work"" by working it out, and he fulfilled that.



,, Your expectation take shape and will appear to people when it is actively processed; it moves from the shadows of your future into full expectancy. The proceedings of hope and trust must be put into action: becoming visible, taking form.


Initialize it actively -- not just telling about it.
Actualize real firm workings that others can touch or use in word and deed.

,


Will you require more education? What effort or who does not profit from knowledge and coordinated understandings from education using what others can offer.

, If you start to see colors, they may be clear and bright, or cloudy and muddy. Some people, especially beginners, can only see one dominant color while others may see multiple colors.


The longer you work at reading auras, the more colors and variations it is possible to see. It just takes time and practice., Staring at the same spot will produce after-images that are the direct inverse of what you are actually gazing at. After-images are not auras. You'll know the difference because the after-image will appear for a short time in front of your eyes,no matter where you look.


After-images are typically color paired: black and white, red and turquoise, orange and blue, yellow and violet, and green and pink., Drawing a body outline and then shading in colors around it can be a fun way of recording what you see for later analysis. It's also something to show your subject so they can relate to what you're seeing.


Some colors seen in auras are hard to recreate in an artistic medium. Just get as close as you can, but describe any differences somewhere on the page.

, According to those who read auras, individuals with a red aura tend to be energetic, enthusiastic, adventurous, and temperamental. They can be strong, competitive, and good at sports. They are typically direct, forthright, and honest, but they typically need to be number one., As described by those who understand auras, people with a yellow aura seem to be intelligent, analytical, inventive, logical, overly critical of themselves and others, eccentric, and motivated, but might become workaholics. They often choose their friends carefully and are not prone to loneliness. They might be more likely to undergo depression and become withdrawn under certain pressures. They can be confident and handle themselves well in front of crowds., Those that read pink auras have described these individuals as generous, loving, caring, loyal, healthy, and romantic. Typically, once they find their mate, they remain loyal. They usually welcome family and friends into their homes and can be gracious hosts. They seem to have high morals and don't tend to stand for injustice in the world.

, Those who read auras describe people with blue auras as great communicators with the tendency to be intuitive, eloquent, charismatic, intelligent, organized, and inspirational. They might want a balance of their head and heart to make tough decisions.They tend to help alleviate anger in others and are peacemakers., These individuals, according to aura readers, can be extremely creative, hard working, determined, realistic, popular, prosperous, and respected. They might be perfectionists associated with practical beauty in the things around them, such as gardening and cooking., Those with an orange aura have been described as typically generous, social, honest, kind, good-hearted, empathetic, sensitive, and charming. They might also be impatient and quick to end relationships. They can be quick tempered but they also easily forgive and forget., Those said to have purple auras can be sensitive, mysterious, philosophical, intuitive, knowledgeable, admirable, and in tune with animals and nature. They might be selective with their friends and keep them close. They tend to be unlucky in love, but they are typically devoted once they find a match., If someone is described as having a gold aura, they might be lavish, obsessive, giving, social, proud, and independent. They tend to surround themselves with beauty, typically cannot stand to have their flaws exposed, and love to entertain and gain attention and admiration of others., Individuals that read auras have found a few other colors that exist, but these are not as prominent. They consider these types of auras negative auras based on the personality traits associated with them.


The brown aura is read as two different shades. The light brown aura is associated with discouragement, confusion, and a lack of confidence in oneself, the situation, or others. The dark brown aura denotes deception and selfishness.
The black aura is associated with hatred, depression, and major illness. Individuals with a black aura can be considered miserly and cheap."

Be prepared.,
Meet the person/target.,
Analyse the person and situation.,
Be calm, unemotional and responsive.,
Make a firm point, ask a firm question; try to make your audience really think.,
Listen to their response.,
Bring the conversation finally towards topics like, but not limited to, free speech, free expression, free inquiry.",How to Discuss Religion Calmly," This is the most crucial prerequisite for discussion on any topic. Reading is the most important thing in preparation. Thanks to the recent wave of writing, there is more than enough material to have a good understanding of arguments and counter arguments. The first rule of engagement is 'know thy enemy' so have also a decent knowledge of religious text, doctrine and dogma.;
, Whether this discussion is planned, as in with a close friend or relative, or with someone you meet randomly on the train, patience is essential. After having put so much time and effort into the preparation you will no doubt be, to say the least, anxious to vent. Let the topic present itself and you will feel far more relaxed. Your goal should not be to de-convert, at least in the first conversation. It should be to get the person to think critically about their beliefs and other aspects of life in general.

, This will give you an idea of how best to approach the discussion. Though it is often pointed out that atheists have no 'one opinion fits all', the same is true of the religious, some having markedly differing opinions, even in the same denomination, so you must understand exactly what the person's opinions are instead of prejudging from what they have labeled themselves as. This will also allow you to create some boundaries.

, This will be the biggest test of your ability. It is most important in any discussion and is difficult to master; you will improve it with experience. Any one discussion will not often begin in the same way as one had before, therefore you must respond to the point in question directly and, with that, edge closer to a point you wish to make.

, Vary the point and question depending on the particular discussion, trying to fashion them to line up with whatever the person is putting forward the most as supportive to their viewpoint, e.g. morality or design or consolation. Depending also on the length and scope of the conversation you may have to firmly argue or question more than once.

, A good thing to do is to repeat what they said before retorting so as to (a) show that you're listening, and (b) make their point clear to yourself.

, Other points here should stress evidence, reason, critical thinking, etc., trying to wrap up the discussion without directly talking about religion.

Find a forked (Y-shaped) branch.,
Try to find the branch in the same area that you'll be using it.,
Decorate the dowsing rod.,
Hold one fork in each hand.",How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods1," This branch can stem from a tree, a bush – any substantial wood source. Search for a branch that is at least a foot long, from tip to tip. Make sure that the forks are relatively equal in length; otherwise, your dowsing rod may be unbalanced.


Scan the ground for forked twigs that have already broken – perhaps by the passing of a deer, or perhaps by something more mysterious. If you see a perfect Y-shape that is still growing from a tree, feel free to break it off and use it.
If you break the forked branch from a tree, do it with intention. Don't blindly blunder about, smashing trees to bits. Think about the tree, the surrounding area, and why you are commissioning this dowsing rod. Consider leaving something of your own behind to replace what you have taken from the tree.;
, If you're going to be using this dowsing rod to, say, explore an unfamiliar stretch of woods, or look for water in a mysterious valley, try to find your dowsing rod nearby. Look at the brush at the edge of the woods; look for a tree at the rim of the valley. Some dowsers prefer to use branches from particular trees, and many dowsers prefer that their rods are freshly cut.Hazel and witch-hazel branches are commonly used in Europe and the U.S., respectively – as are willow and peach-tree cuttings.Most of these branches are popular because they are light and porous: many believe that rods from these trees can better absorb vapors rising from buried metals or water, which weighs down the un-forked end so that it points toward the source.

, You can use the forked branch as you find it, but you may also consider putting your own mark onto the rod. This is especially fruitful if you plan to use it more than once, or if you plan to give it to someone as a gift. Consider carving patterns into the dowsing rod (carefully!) with a knife, wrapping beads or charms around the wood, or even painting portions of it.


Consider wrapping fabric around the forks of the rod to make it more comfortable to hold. This can also function as decoration.

, Point the dowsing rod (the bottom section of the Y) away from you at arm's length. Make sure that the fork is parallel with the ground or tilted very slightly downward. Learn How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods to get into the right headspace!

Acquire two equal lengths of wire, each about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long.,
Bend each wire into an ""L"" shape.,
Make handles.,
Hold one rod in each hand, when dowsing.",How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods2," The wire can be brass, copper, steel – any sturdy but bendable material. For an easy divining rod, try cutting a wire coat hanger into two equal pieces – or straightening two coat hangers by untwisting their hooks.


Choose the rod material based on purpose and availability. Brass and copper are especially popular because they don't rust. If you have wire fencing or coat hangers readily available, however, it won't hurt to work with what you have.Use a strong pair of wire cutters to trim the metal to size. There is no hard, fast rule that the wires must be 20 inches long. Make sure that they are long enough to dip of their own accord, and short enough to hold comfortably.

, If your wires are 20 inches (50.8 cm) long, make the twist about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from one end. The bend should create a 90-degree angle in the wire. The short leg will become the handle of each rod. The longer legs will dip, cross, and guide you as you approach what you are looking for.

, The handles should cover the smaller legs of the L-shaped rods – 4-5 inches of the wire, or whatever is comfortable. These handles protect your hands and give you a firmer grip. There is no one way to make a usable handle, so work with what you have available.


Use a length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) dowel rod, with a hole through the center. Alternately, glue several cotton reels together into a cylinder.
Use a pen. Remove the innards and caps of two cheap plastic pens, then thread the wire through the pen body. You may also pass the wire through a couple of drinking straws.Wrap a rag, a cloth, or a piece of felt around the shorter leg of each ""L"". Tie the cloth in place with tightly-stretched rubber bands, a piece of twine, or even a safety pin.

, Hold the wire by the handle (the shorter leg of the ""L"") so that the long part is parallel with the ground. Make sure to hold the dowsing rods loosely enough that they can swing freely from side to side. Hold the rods at arms length away from the body and about 9 inches apart. Remember to keep the rods parallel with the ground or tipped very slightly downward. Learn How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods to find what you need to find.The rod should rest flat over the index finger, while the butt of the handle should fit into the heel of your hand.
Do not grip the handles, as the rods must float freely to work. You may, however, close your hand slightly to improve stability."

Learn about altar traditions (optional).,
Choose a location.,
Choose or construct an altar surface.,
Add other furniture or shelves to the altar if necessary.,
Ritually prepare the space (optional).",How to Create an Altar1," If you are constructing an altar for a specific purpose or holiday, you might want to look up details of that tradition online before you begin. Searching for photos and examples of similar altars is a great way to get started. Many people mix and match components of different religions, spiritual traditions, and cultures that have personal importance to them.


Day of the Dead altars typically include pictures of saints and deceased relatives; candles; flowers, food, and drink.You can make a similar altar in homage of a deceased friend or relative, using food and toys that person would enjoy.
St. Joseph's Day Altars are constructed in many places on March 19th. They are usually constructed in three tiers covered with food and decorations, surrounding a statue of St. Joseph.You can construct a similar altar to celebrate another holiday. After honoring the saint or holiday, eat the food with friends and family or give it to people in need of food.;
, If you plan to quietly meditate or pray, select a quiet location out of the way of passers-by. If you wish to keep your altar as a central focus point or use it for group ceremonies, place it in a larger room.


If space is limited and you travel a lot, consider making a portable altar. This can be a collapsible table, a tray, or even a cloth that can be packed in a suitcase along with a few altar decorations., Your altar may be located anywhere you choose for example it could be a stack of stones in your garden, on shelves on a glass-protected cabinet, on a cloth on the floor, on your kitchen table, in a designated room, or any place that you feel it should be. If you plan to use the altar for rituals that require table space, for instance grinding herbs or burning incense, make sure it is large and flat enough for that purpose.

, Also, you may choose to place a cushion or chair in front of your altar for meditation or prayer. If there will be children or people shorter than you using the altar, consider whether you need to add an additional lower surface that everyone can reach.

, You may wish to burn incense or ritually burn sage to prepare the space. Alternatively, recite a prayer or speak without preparation, asking the deity or power you worship to bless the altar.

Be familiar with your own religion first.,
Read from religious texts like the Bible, Quran, Bhagavad Gita, various Dharma Sutras or other relevant religious texts for 30 minutes daily with people at the same level you are at.,
Decide which target group you wish to focus your proselytizing.,
Focusing on a particular group does not preclude learning about the beliefs and religions of other groups.,
Whatever religion you belong to, there must be peculiarities which you may not agree with.,
Practice the principles and teachings of your religion without preaching about your religion overtly.,
Help others in small or big ways in accordance with your faith when they need help.,
Volunteer at local social charities and invite others to join.

,
Invite your target to secular events first.,
Do not underestimate the effect and influence you will have by volunteering in non-faith based social efforts.,
Ensure members of your own congregation are adequately taken care of.,
Before you introduce yourself to someone, each time tell yourself honestly the reasons why you wish to convert that person.,
On first contact, avoid using familiar religious terms that may offend the target person you are attempting to proselytize.",How to Convert People to a New Religion," Be familiar with the various strains, denominations and dialectical differences of your own religion. People tend to ask about a tradition of your religion without knowing that may be a practice peculiar to another sub-group of your religion. Spend regular time understanding and meditating on your own beliefs. Keep a journal explaining your daily enlightenment to yourself.;
, Post a few invitations in public places.

, You need to understand the basis of their current beliefs. It is easier to focus more on a particular group rather than spreading yourself thin on every possible group on the planet. Most people enjoy having conversations based on their own background and knowledge. The first step to proselytizing is gaining trust and friendship.


For example, if the target person or group is either Christian, Jewish or Muslim, read up on Christianity, Judaism and Islam and learn about their history and influences these religions have had on each other. Chart their differences.
If the target person or group is either Buddhist, Hindu, Confucian, Taoist or Shintoist, learn about the roots of these religions and the historical influences these religions have had on each other.
If the target person or group is Agnostic, Atheist, Communist or Humanist, read up classical philosophies like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Familiarize yourself with the influences these classical philosophers and Hellenism has had on your religion and on the current legal and political systems. Read up on the motivations, conquests and failures of major empires and political systems. At best, avoid telling members of this super-intellectual group what you know about their beliefs. Rather let them tell you what they believe and question their beliefs.

, No matter which religion you belong to, knowing more about other religions and belief systems will help you understand and interact with people better. Therefore reading outside your target group, like selections of the Quran, the Hadith, the Bible, the Talmud and various religious texts is both helpful and enlightening. Who knows, you may get converted yourself and find your true self after exposing yourself to a wider choice of religions!

, Find out how much these peculiarities affect your sincerity to your religion before deciding on the venture of proselytizing. Charting the differences between religions of each group (e.g. between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) helps you to understand your own.

, This is key!

, Eg: Shelter or other provisions.

,, If they seem comfortable after a few months, invite them to faith based events.

, Tactfully work yourself around your neighbourhood or office encouraging people to recycle and conserve the environment. Practice environmental conservation yourself. Ensure that the religion you intend to preach discourages attitudes that are contrary to the safety of the planet and its inhabitants.

, Are you certain your religion is suitable for a target person, when your congregation is not even aware that there are members struggling to get to services because they could not even afford or are unable to use public transportation?

, Is it for personal trophy, to make the world a better place, to guide the target person to a better future out of sincere concern or to contribute to efforts ensuring your personal belief system would become a dominant influence? If the reasons do not match that of your beliefs, call it a day and return home to meditate on where you have gone wrong. Discuss and share the problem with somebody you trust. This will help you avoid going astray and embarrassing your religion.

, For examples, crusade (offensive to most Muslims) and New Testament (offensive to practicing Jews).

Decide who to dedicate the altar to.,
Include icons, figurines, photographs, or pictures.,
Include mementos or objects related to the subject.,
Consider adding candles.,
Decorate with flowers.,
Share food and drink with the honored person.,
Add any other decorations or ritual objects you think is appropriate.",How to Create an Altar2," One common use of altars is to honor and remember a religious figure, or a deceased relative, friend, or historical figure. Some of these are dedicated to multiple people, such as a deceased friend and his patron saint.


In some traditions, these are called shrines instead of altars.

, Unless you belong to a religious denomination that does not allow images of the divine, place an image of the person or people you are honoring in a prominent location on the altar, such as on a high stand at the back of the altar. You may wish to include several images, representing different sides of the honored person. For instance, a photograph of the person at her wedding and a photograph of her with her family.

, Display objects on the shrine that remind you of the person being honored. This can be gifts they gave you, objects they enjoyed in life, or objects that represent what they did in their profession, hobbies, or personal life.


If you are honoring a religious figure, research what objects they are associated with online. Patron saints, deities of polytheist traditions (Greek, Hindu, Roman, Egyptian, etc.), and most other religious figures have many objects or actions associated with their worship.

, Place candles around the edge of the altar so you can light them in memory of the person, or in honor of the religious figure. This is a common and simple ritual used in many places around the world.

, You may wish to keep a bouquet of flowers on the altar, and think of the person every time you replace them with a fresh bouquet. Alternatively, grow flowers in a pot at the altar's base, or keep dried flowers as permanent decorations.

, Keep a plate and cup on the altar, and provide your deceased friend's favorite food and drink on holidays or important occasions. After leaving it on the altar for the length of the meal, you can share it among your friends or give it to those in need.

, Change your altar however you wish to help you honor the person and live by his ideals. If that person belonged to a different religion than yours, consider adding a symbol of that religion as well. If the altar appears too somber for your needs, add brightly colored scarves or other objects to make it a happier place to remember your friend.

Talk to your parents.,
Consult a religious leader.",How to Contact Your Guardian Angel1," There is a wealth of knowledge in websites online and in books at your local library. Even though many religions believe in guardian angels, they hold very different opinions about their nature.


While most faiths think that angels are a separate kind of being different from humans,others believe that people become angels after they die.Catholics believe that every person is assigned a guardian angel.Muslims think that every believer has two guardian angels, one to go in front and one behind.There are many conflicting views of guardian angels in Judaism. Some scholars assert that people do not have individual guardian angels but that God may send one or many angels to a person at a time of need.Others believe that every mitzvah a person does creates an angel companion.Still others say that an angel called Lailah watches over a person from conception to death.;
, If you're very young and not sure which religion your family belongs to, ask your parents for help. Ask them what they believe. Tell them about your attempts at contacting your guardian angel and make sure that they are fine with you doing that.

, Ask your parents if they will help you meet with a local religious leader to ask him or her about guardian angels. If you're old enough, you can go on your own. If you don't have a regular place of worship, you can try contacting local ones that interest you. Most religious organizations are happy to educate people about their faith when asked, even if you don't believe the same things.

For other specific examples, see Make a Taoist Altar, Create a Simple Buddhist Shrine, or Set up a Wiccan Samhain Altar.

, Many altars begin with a cloth to keep the altar surface clean and communicate the intent of the altar. For example, a simple white cloth can help you stay focused and contemplative. A bright, decorated cloth can help raise your spirits, while an outdoor altar could have a cloth with muted autumn colors that don't distract from nature.


To continue the example of an altar dedicated to the four classical elements, you could choose four small cloths and lay them next to each other: red (fire), white or light blue (air), dark blue (water), and brown (earth).

, If you belong to a religion with sacred texts, include a copy on the altar to read for inspiration. Otherwise, consider adding a different book, poem, or other text that is important to you, and will help you reach the mental, emotional, or spiritual state the altar is intended to provide.

, Orthodox shrines commonly have icons of the saints or other religious figures. Hindu shrines may include figurines of the gods that are being honored. Even if you're not religious, think of artwork you could include that is related to your altar's purpose.


Continuing the example of an elemental altar, you could include a charcoal drawing of flames (fire), calligraphy drawn with a bird's quill (air), a watercolor painting of a seascape (water), and a clay statuette (earth).

, These vary widely depending on the spiritual tradition and personal preference of the altar's builder. You may have many herbs, crystals, and specialized containers if you conduct many rituals. On the other hand, it's completely acceptable to simply include a candle which you light before you pray, or a journal in which you write your thoughts.


An elemental altar might include a candle (fire), a fan (air), a glass of water (water), and a handful of soil (earth). You can hold each of these items in turn as you contemplate the element and what it represents, or invent a more elaborate ritual.

, Add to your altar however you like. You may wish to add flowers, decorative figurines, or other decorations. You may decide to put photographs of happy memories around the altar. You may prefer to keep the altar relatively bare. It's all up to you.


Other related objects that could go on your elemental altar include seashells, rocks, feathers, partially burned wood, or anything else you think represents or complements the elements.

"
"
Decide how to conduct yourself near the altar.,
Pray.,
Meditate.,
Burn oil or another offering.",How to Create an Altar4," When you approach the altar for worship, adopt a specific posture, make a habit of adopting a specific posture. You may stand, sit, kneel, or adopt any other posture that makes you feel attentive to the altar and what it represents. If you think it's important to adopt a celebratory or energetic mood, you could even dance around the altar.

, You do not need to be religious to pray, or need to address anyone or anything in particular. If you are religious, you may wish to learn traditional prayers. Alternatively, express yourself silently, quietly, or loudly as you feel comfortable. Commonly, people pray to ask for healing for themselves and their loved ones, to ask for forgiveness, or to request guidance in making a decision.

, If you don't feel comfortable praying, or if you simply need to relax and calm yourself, meditation is a useful skill to learn and practice. Some people do not distinguish between meditation and prayer.

, Burning a candle, food, or another object is often considered an ""offering"" to another power. Most Christian and Jewish worshippers do not offer animal sacrifices, and sometimes consider it to be against their religion. Even if you belong to one of these religions, you may decide to make another offering, such as the small container of oil burned on Orthodox shrines.


This can be interpreted as a literal offering (carried in the smoke), or as a symbolic act to show you are willing to make a sacrifice. It can also simply be a ritual you use to worship, without having to analyze its meaning.

Identify your guardian angel.,
Create an altar.,
Learn a special prayer.,
Designate a time to contact your angel.",How to Contact Your Guardian Angel2," Before you try to contact your angel, make sure that you know who your angel is and what your angel’s special powers are. If you are trying to contact a specific angel, then take some time to learn a little more about that angel.


To identify your guardian angel, watch for signs. Pay attention to names and symbols that come up a lot. For example, if you notice that the name Michael keeps coming up, then your guardian angel might be Michael.You may also choose an angel to contact based on that angel’s associations. For example, Raphael is associated with healing and protection for travelers, so you may want to contact him if you have been dealing with illness or if you are planning a trip.Some people think of their deceased loved ones as their guardian angels. For example, you might identify a grandparent with whom you were close as your guardian angel.

, Creating an altar might help you to contact your guardian angel by designating a space for spiritual energy. To create an altar, set aside a small space, such as a bookshelf or the top of a dresser. Place a cloth over the area and then add a candle and an object that reminds you of your guardian angel. Some people like to include photos, food, herbs, crystals, incense, and water as part of their altars.


Think about the objects, colors, and other items associated with your angel as you choose items for your altar.
Purchase a special candle just for your altar. Only use the candle when you want to communicate with your guardian angel.
Place photos of deceased loved ones on your altar if you think of them as your guardian angels.

, Many people use special prayers to help them make contact with their angels. Some angels have prayers that you can learn and use when you contact your angel.If your angel is not well known, then you may want to consider writing your own prayer to that angel. You can write a prayer by following the basic structure used by other prayers to angels:


address your angel
acknowledge your angel’s special powers
identify your needs
close your prayer

, To increase your chances of contacting your guardian angel, you should designate a specific time each day to pray and meditate. Having a daily practice will give your guardian angel more opportunities to contact you.


For example, you might start or end each day with five minutes of prayer and meditation near your altar.
You can also contact your angel in times of need, but make sure that you make regular contact with your angel as well.

"
"
Pay attention to what feels like strong intuition, or your ""gut."",
Keep a notebook.,
Remember that your guardian angel is by your side.The feeling of never being alone and always being protected is the greatest gift an angel can give.",How to Contact Your Guardian Angel3," Some people believe that this is the main way angels communicate with us. If you need to make a tough decision and don't have time to meditate, mentally ask your angel. If an answer pops into your head, your angel may be guiding you., Write down whatever you think your angel may be telling you. Record inspirations that may occur during meditation. Memories are easily confused and insights forgotten. Having a clear reminder will help you keep your thoughts organized.

, Let this knowledge give you the confidence to get you through tough times.


Try imagining that your guardian angel is standing right behind you whenever you have to do something that is difficult. Doing so will help to give you strength and remind you that your guardian angel is watching over you.

"
"
Prepare your space.,
Light a candle.,
Sit in a position that is comfortable.,
Breathe deeply and clear your mind.,
Greet your angel.,
Listen for your angel's reply.,
Emerge from your meditation slowly.,
Practice your meditation.",How to Contact Your Guardian Angel4," Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed, such as your bedroom. Turn off any electronic devices that may distract you, such as the television, phone, or computer. Turning off the lights and shutting your blinds will also help.

, Candles are a great way to focus your attention during meditation. If you have created an angel altar, then you can light the candle on your altar. If you do not have an angel altar, then you can just light a candle and place it on a table in front of you.


If you do not want to light a candle, then you can also use a rosary to help focus your attention or listen to some repetitive nature sounds, such as ocean waves or rain sounds., Meditation requires you to be still for a long time, so make sure that you are comfortable. For example, you may want to sit on a cushion. You can even lie down to meditate, as long as you're sure you won't fall asleep., Close your eyes or watch your candle. Try not to think of anything, not even your guardian angel for a few minutes. Focus on keeping your breath steady and slow.If you notice that you have started thinking about something, then take a moment to acknowledge the thought and then refocus on your breathing.

, In your mind, say ""hello"" to your angel. Thank your angel for watching over you. Then, let your angel know about any problems that are bothering you and ask your angel for guidance.


If you have learned or prepared a prayer, then take a moment to recite the prayer. You can do this in your head or say the prayer out loud.

, Any sign that your angel is there will most likely be subtle. For example, you may hear a faint noise, see a fleeting image in your mind's eye, notice a sensation of warmth, or get the feeling that someone is in the empty room with you.


Some people believe that angels cannot interfere in our lives without being directly asked to. If you're not sure your angel is there, try asking your angel to let you know someone is there.

, When you have finished speaking with your angel, say goodbye. You may want to end your meditation with a prayer as well. If your eyes were closed, open them. Then, sit quietly for a minute or two as you let your mind go back to normal.

, Keep in mind that meditation is a difficult skill to master. You probably won't get it right on your first attempt and that is okay. Just keep practicing your meditation and it will become easier.


Remember that it is fine to start with just a few minutes of meditation per day and work up to longer periods of meditation as you become more comfortable.

",How to Consult the I Ching Using Yarrow Stalk," Yarrow stalk was probably used in ancient times, since it grew around the temples and shrines, but you can use any other 50 identical objects (e.g. matches, pens or cotton swabs), as well.;
, There should be 49 stalks left.

, Just randomly separate them into those two pillars.

, Since 49 is an uneven number, one of the two pillars has to be at least one stalk bigger than the other pillar. Take away one of the stalks from that and put it aside.

, Take the last pillar, which should be made out of 1 ~ 4 stalks (since some numbers are not dividable by four), and put them aside. There should be a number between 40 and 46 stalks left now.

, Take your 40 - 46 stalks and start over from part 3. Do this over and over again, until you've got a number of stalks between 6 and 9 left.

, According to the amount of stalks, you have left, you write down the first line of your hexagram. The first line is always the bottom line. The lines are:


Six stalks - Old Yin (also called Changing Yin or Strong Yin): --- o ---
Seven stalks - Young Yang (also called Weak Yang): ---------
Eight stalks - Young Yin (also called Weak Yin): ---   ---
Nine stalks - Old Yang (also called Cahnging Yang or Strong Yang): ----x----

, In order to get a full hexagram, you will have to do steps 1 - 7 another five times, until you've got all the six lines.


You will have to draw the second line above the first (bottom) line. The sixth line should be the upmost line on top of the hexagram.

Learn to move psi.,
Position your hands.,
Feel the psi flowing.,
Move the psi.,
Make a shell.,
Program the ball and fill it in.,
Move your psi ball.,
Experiment with other methods.,
Experiment with compression.",How to Make a Psi Ball2," This is simple once you know how, but it can take a while to get the knack. The psi ball is created by moving psi energy into a desired location in the form of a small sphere. For some, the standard psi ball is a little bigger than a baseball, and smaller than a softball. However, they can be made quite large - to fit around the body in the case of a shield, or even bigger than that.

, You can use one hand or two, you can hold them vertically or horizontally. Just do what feels right. Make sure you don't get your hands in a position so that it makes you tired and makes you get all shaky because of strain. Some people find it a bit harder to feel the psi if the fingers are touching.

, Visualize psi in your solar plexus. The solar plexus is the point where your lower ribs meet in the middle; place your hand on your stomach and your pinky touching the top of your belly button. This is the area you are going to want to use. There are many impressions of what psi looks like, such as water, fire, light... Choose the one that seems right to you. Imagine it in your sternum moving around slowly, and attempt to feel your solar plexus while visualizing this. There is a major chakra located here.

, Visualize it slowly moving up, going up your chest and over to your shoulders. Try to feel it while doing so. Have it go down to your arms, and to your hands, have it pool there for a little. Bring it back up, and then back to your sternum. Do this a few times, until you start to get the hang of it.

, Pull psi from your solar plexus. When you get to your hands, instead of letting it pool, have it flow out of your palms and shape into a hollow sphere. This sphere is what you are going to use as a shell.

, This means projecting your intentions into the psi ball, to control its behaviour. Basic programming should be to maintain the psi on the inside, and to keep it in one location instead of having if fly every which direction. After you have successfully created a shell, you will want to fill it in; allow the psi to flow into the shell. Your psi ball is ready.

, Move it just like you moved the psi from your solar plexus. This time it won't be in your body, though. This can take practice; you will get better.

, There are many ways to make psi balls, some people have much better success with doing it a certain way. The principles of it are the same; locate your ""energy"" source, move the psi, then put the psi into an area and use what ""energy"" you have to create the psi ball.

, Create the psi ball the size of a beach ball, then when you feel you're ready compress it down into a smaller, denser ball. A lot of people seem to have good results with this.

Gather your energy.,
Hold your hands steady.,
Picture a hole appearing in your hand.,
Focus the flow.,
Program the psi ball.,
Release the psi ball.",How to Make a Psi Ball3," This could be from your own body or from another source. You could visualize the energy entering and filling every part of your body from the Earth through your feet, or from the sky and the sun through your crown chakra. Some people imagine energy coming into the body on the in-breath and out through the hands on the out-breath.

, When you feel like you have enough energy hold out your hands. You can either hold them like you hold a basketball, you can cup them like you are holding a baseball, or you can even hold out one hand. Do whatever feels natural to you.

, Picture a trapdoor cover opening and letting the energy flow out. Imagine a hose in each of your palms slowly emitting psi. It doesn't have to be very fast, or have very much pressure, it just has to naturally flow. Don't let it out of your hands; the next step will help with this.


At this point you should be able to sense the psi. It could feel like heat, pressure or tingling. When you feel this, move your hands closer together a bit - if there is resistance (even a little) you will know you're sensing it.

, Using visualization, compact the psi into a ball in your hand. You can also make it into a cube, or a triangle, or pretty much anything!

, This comes easier to some people than others. Have a very clear intention in your mind. Sometimes it may help to say it in words in your head. The point is make sure your message is very clear.


Psi balls can be programmed for pretty much anything. A common use is to get someone's attention - program the ball to ""poke"" someone, to let someone know you want to speak to them. The ball can travel long distances to give the message.

, If you programmed it, then it should carry out its programming as soon as you let go. If you made one just for practice, then it should naturally dissipate.

Astrologers believe that all things happen for a reason and that order (as numerologically represented by numbers), instead of chaos or randomness, exists in this universe, and noticing select numbers repeatedly holds meaning.
To others, it's either a complex subconscious fixation (similar to when you have certain song lyrics that keep running through your mind), a super-conscious fixation (as in your higher-self or God-self), or due to anxiety and stress (or impending ""insanity"").

, This too could be considered an unconscious attachment.

, An analyst would also have to comb through your comprehensive charts to find the commonalities.

Listen to your gut.,
See if you make small scale predictions.,
Note your capacity for empathy.,
Evaluate whether you feel other people's experiences.,
See if you sense danger.",How to Know If You Are Psychic1," Those who believe in psychic powers feel those who have them can sense things before they occur. You may be prone to very strong ""gut feelings"" one way or another about a situation. Try to tune in to your gut feeling over the course of a few days and see how accurate it is.You may get gut feelings about a situation that prove to be true. This does not have to be something major. It can be a small gut feeling. For example, you feel drawn into a clothing store to find the perfect outfit.;
, Not all predictions are major. While some people claim to have predicted natural disasters or other major events, many people who think they have psychic powers can make predictions on a small scale. Pay attention to whether tiny flashes of intuition prove true.For example, you may know who's calling the second your phone rings, predict the general timeframe a package will arrive to your house, or know what song will play on the radio next.
Some of these small predictions may be a coincidence or based on knowledge you already have. If your mom always calls at a certain time, for example, it's not unusual to assume she's calling when your phone rings. However, if such predictions occur frequently, they could be a sign of psychic powers.

, Those who believe in psychics feel they're more intuitive about other people's emotions. When you're around other people, gauge your level of empathy. Think about whether you know someone's feeling without having to be told.If you know someone well, it's not uncommon to sense what they're feeling. People often give off unconscious tells about their feelings, which most people who know them well pick up on. Psychics, however, can allegedly read energy even from strangers.
If you have physic powers, you may feel a deep connection to a stranger's energy. You may, for example, pass someone in the grocery store and get a sense of sadness or happiness from them.
A psychic's capacity for empathy is allegedly very strong. You will not just be able to sense people's emotions but you may feel them as if they're your own.

, Psychics can supposedly get a sense of another person's past and history just from being around them Think about how you feel when first meeting people. Have you ever gotten a strong sense of a person's past without being told? If so, you may have psychic powers.For example, you meet a stranger at party and get images in your mind's eye of palm trees and beaches. Later, you find out this person grew up in California.
You may also get a sense of experiences from someone's past. For example, you may meet someone and feel a sense of abandonment or deep loss. Later, you may find out something about the person's past that points to this. Maybe one of their parents died young, for example, or left the family.

, Those who feel they have psychic powers feel they can sense danger. Think about times when you've had a sense of foreboding. Did this ever prove true? If so, you may be psychically gifted.For example, you may feel a strong sense you should not enter a building or attend a social event. Later, you may find out something dangerous happened there. For example, maybe there was a fire at a department store you felt wary about entering.

Change begins with you making a choice to change and that starts with being humble enough to realize that the events of your life are the direct product of your belief system and decisions.,
Ask yourself some frank honest questions: Do I really believe I deserve to be successful?,
As to the last question, can I change?,
You could also choose to do nothing.,
If you are in search of a healthy, happy and good life, then an honest appraisal of your circumstances is necessary!

,
So right now at this very moment start with a clean fresh blank slate.,
Now is the time for a change in belief and this will require you to take a humble approach and have an honest view of your circumstances?,
Any meaningful change is usually a slow process but all journeys begin with a first step.,
The secret to success is making every day you live a successful day and that is very easy to do if you are constantly alert to how you are thinking.,
It is vital to understand that what you think about today is working to create your future.,
Remember change begins with making a choice to change and that can start now.

",How to Change Your Belief System With Honesty and Humility," So if your life or your business is not producing the results you want then take a minute or two to humbly look at what you truly believe.;
, Do I love myself? Do I like myself? Am I resentful or angry about my past? How do I feel about making money? Have I asked for help? Do I waist time in negative thoughts? Do I expect instant success? Am I willing to learn and develop? Do I blame others? Can I change?

, Yes! You can change any time you wish. You can change this very instant. You can make a decision this very moment to open a book, turn off the TV, go for a walk, feel grateful for the many blessing of life, open your mind and listen to your heart.

, You could continue to delay or procrastinate and pretend rather than perform. Remember the idea of having to change yourself is uncomfortable and it is easier to remain as you are. You can choose rest over effort, delay over action, entertainment over education, delusion over truth, and fear over confidence. What will you choose?

,, To do this all you need to do is forget about your past, your past errors in judgment, your past mistakes, your past bad feelings and realize that at whatever point you are currently at in life, it is a result of all of your past decisions and choices. Another helpful thing is to forgive yourself and others for any wrongs that have been done.

, Start out by reviewing your current routine or schedule. What are you doing to better yourself on a daily basis?

, This means that by doing simple constructive things over a period of time you will bring long term beneficial results into your life.

, When you direct your attention to thoughts of love, gratitude, thankfulness, happiness and joy you will be activating some of the most powerful forces in the universe.

, So if you want to bring abundance into your life, begin now and feel that you already have abundance. See yourself as already in possession of your dreams and goals. Believe you deserve to have the best that love and life have to offer. Believe you can be anything you want to be. You can be love, you can be happy and you can be healthy!

Think about your interests.,
Notice sudden anxiety.,
Evaluate your dreams.,
Notice frequent deja-vu.,
See if you have synesthesia.,
See a doctor or therapist for any concerning signs.",How to Know If You Are Psychic2," Psychics may have strong natural interests in the paranormal. Evaluate your interests throughout the course of your life. Have you always been curious about things like ghosts, reincarnation, and premonitions? If so, this could potentially point to psychic powers., Those who believe in psychic power believe psychics can feel energy around them. You may experience sudden anxiety in response to the world around you. This is especially common in places where people may have had traumatic experiences, such as cemeteries and hospitals. You may also feel anxiety suddenly during the day without cause. This could be because, without knowing it, you passed by a place where someone suffered trauma. You may also feel anxious when alone sometimes. You may, for example, be frightened when alone at night or in the dark.

, People who believe in psychic powers feel psychics are prone to very vivid dreams. This may be because physics are able to feel the energy of the world around them and this may manifest in very intense dreams. If your dreams are usually vivid, you may have psychic powers.On occasion, aspects of your dreams may appear in real life. For example, you may dream you lose an object only to really lose it the next day., Deja-vu is the sense of experiencing something before it occurs. Those who believe in psychic powers believe deju-vu is a result of unconsciously experiencing things before they occur. If you have psychic powers, you may very frequently experience deja-vu. It may occur multiple times a week instead of just once in awhile, for example., Synesthesia is a mixing of the senses. You may get a sense of taste when you hear a sound or associate a color with a particular person. Those who believe in psychic powers feels psychics are more prone to synesthesia.You may eventually find your synesthesia helps you make accurate predictions. Someone who gives off a yellow vibe, for example, may be very friendly, while darker colors like deep blues may indicate a mean or brooding personality.

, While many people believe psychic powers are real, there is no scientific evidence to back this up. Many signs of psychic powers, like acute anxiety, can be signs of underlying mental health conditions or physical problems. Before assuming signs indicate psychic powers, see a doctor and therapist to rule out medically-proven conditions.

"
"
Notice frequent tingling sensations.,
Pay attention to twitches.,
Evaluate unusual sensitivity.,
See a doctor for unusual physical sensations.",How to Know If You Are Psychic3," People who believe in psychic powers feel psychics can pick up on energy in a room or from a person. This may manifest itself in bodily sensations. You may feel odd tingling sensations or butterflies in your stomach frequently throughout the day.You may eventually find sensations are related to certain events or emotions. You may, for example, feel a tingling sensation when a loved one is in danger.

, Some believe psychic powers may manifest themselves in nervous twitches. You may start to have a twitch in your arm or eyelid, for example, when something is wrong. Notice if you're prone to unusual twitches and whether they're related to your environment at all., Some people believe psychics are naturally more physically sensitive. You may physically off in response to certain events or emotions. For example, bad news may cause you to feel weak, fatigued, or nauseated., As psychic powers are not a proven phenomenon, it's important to see a doctor for physical symptoms. Heightened sensitivity, twitches, and tingling sensations can point to underlying medical conditions. Rule these out before assuming such sensations are caused by psychic powers."

Visualize the protection.,
It is good practise to often cleanse a space or room before beginning.,
Use certain crystals for strengthening the cleansing and protection in the space.,
Carry crystals upon your person.,
Say your prayers.",How to Have Psychic Protection," Personal protection first: Before any activity begins, the person will need to visualise themselves enveloped in a big coloured bubble of protection. The bubble can be any colour you like although white or gold are good strong protective colours.


Another form of personal protection is for the person to imagine they are stepping into a big sleeping bag, then they pull the bag up to their neck.;
, This can be done with a 'smudge' stick using sage or sweet grass etc. the person should light the smudge stick and walk around the four corners of the room waving the smudge stick in the air, thus cleansing the area.

, Black tourmaline, moonstone or other protecting stones should be used by placing them in the four corners of the space to be used for any psychic work.

, One for spirit communication and one for repelling negative energies or unwanted spirit entities.

, Finally, some effective prayers must be spoken, these can be in tune with the practitioner's personal faith, e.g. pagan, Christian etc. The prayers should contain words to the effect of protecting the psychic and the client and also should contain after reading protection upon the home vacated and the home to which the psychic will travel and any members of the psychics family in that home. After the prayers are spoken, gestures should be made by drawing either the shape of the cross or a pentacle in the air. This completes the practise.

Find an ideal place to plant the sage.,
Plan ahead when you will start your plant.,
Wait for the right time to harvest.,
Wait one day before you start wrapping your sage.",How to Make a Smudge Stick1," Before you start your sage plant, you will want to find a place outdoors that will provide optimal growing conditions. Sage grows best in full sun and well-drained soil. A clay pot is ideal to help with drainage for your sage plant especially if you live in a rainy climate. If you have to keep your plant indoors, make sure to keep it next to a sunny window.
, There are two methods to starting your plant:

Start from seed. If you decide to grow from seed, plant the seeds 6-10 weeks before the last frost. You can sow the seeds outside in a bed placing them about 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) apart. However, growing sage from seed can be challenging and it can take up to two years for the plant to reach maturity. Many gardeners choose to start plants from cuttings because of this.
Start with cuttings. If you tried starting fro seeds, and the plants didn't germinate properly, then try to start a plant with sage cuttings. Cut a stem off a healthy mature sage plant at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Remove the leaves at the bottom, but make sure to keep at least a couple pairs of leaves at the top. Place your sage cutting into soil and water it. Be careful not to give it too much or too little water.

, It will take approximately 75 days, or two and a half months for the sage to be ready to be harvested. Once it's ready, take the trimmers and cut the stems of the desired leaves at the base of the plant. Be sure not to harvest more than half the plant so it will continue to grow for future harvests.

If you are not confident enough to grow your own sage, or if it is too late in the season to start a new plant, you can purchase a sage plant.

, Place your trimmings in a paper bag or on top of newspaper overnight. Make sure they are not left in plastic or out in sunlight because this can cause the sage to wilt or it could start to decompose."
"
Ready your mind and body.,
Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down.,
Affirm to yourself that you are going to have an out-of-body experience.,
Close your eyes and relax.,
Allow yourself to almost fall asleep.",How to Have an Out of Body Experience1," Choose a quiet place you find relaxing. You can be indoors or outdoors, as long as you are comfortable. Make sure you won't be interrupted. OBEs are most common in the morning at 4:00am-6:00am, however trying this at night or when you are tired will probably just make you fall asleep.;
, Many people choose to lie down on their backs, but be forewarned that temporary sleep paralysis is more likely in this position if you do fall asleep. These may consist of dark figures, ghosts or whatever you fear entering your room. Though this may sound scary, the more you realise they cannot physically harm you for they are your mind's creation, the less scary it is to endure.

, Say to yourself ""Mind awake-Body Asleep"" or ""I will have a lucid dream."" Repeat this several times until it is the only thought left in your mind.

, Become less conscious of your external surroundings. Empty your mind of thoughts and ideas. Meditation techniques can be helpful here to maintain an empty mind while still remaining focused and aware.

, Actually sleeping would defeat the purpose. Instead, let yourself drift close to sleep while concentrating on being conscious of your sensations and mental state.

"
Look for a logical explanation.,
Research your location.,
Try to duplicate the experience.,
Try to capture the experience in a different way.,
Remain objective.,
Call in the Pros.",How to Investigate a Paranormal Activity or Experience," As cool as it would be to have a paranormal experience, if you don't investigate the logical explanations you'll always have that edge of doubt in your mind. Look for the everyday explanations. For example, if doors are closing when no one is near, is there heavy or moderate air flow? Are the hinges loose? Is the door jam crooked? If there are ""orbs"" in pictures you took around the house, stop to think whether you recently dusted the room. The only real way to find evidence of the paranormal is to actively try to disprove your experience. That way if you really cannot find a logical explanation, it means it really must have been something unusual. The best paranormal investigators will always describe themselves as skeptics.;
, If logic can't explain your experience, it's time for some research. Search for things like deaths or other traumatic events on the property, other reports of paranormal activity at that location, and other locations with similar manifestations.

, Go back to the location under similar circumstances, perhaps with a friend to act as a witness. Take recording equipment, cameras and EMF detectors. See if the same event happens again and if you can record it in any way.

, If you heard voices, try to snap photos or run film in that location as well as recording the EVP (see the Wikipedia link at the bottom for information on EVP.) If you saw a figure, set up sound and temperature recording devices as well. The more ways you can document the haunting, the better.

, Keep your mind open to all possibilities. Neither dismiss your experiences as ""just imagination"", nor accept each bump and flash as proof of a haunting. Weird things happen all the time. The fun part is figuring out why!

, If you have significant evidence of a haunting (photos, recordings, multiple witnesses, etc) call in the paranormal professionals. Check with your local university's psychology department, the newspaper or even the Yellow pages. But be careful. The field of paranormal investigation is awash with frauds and con men, so check out your expert's credentials thoroughly!

Consider the consequences and be prepared for a confrontation.,
Have a target and motive in mind.,
Choose the right moment.,
Dwell on the offenses, both past and present, to build your energy.,
Maintain the energy and thoughts.,
Keep your face relaxed and expression cool.,
Look at the person until they notice and make eye contact.,
Maintain eye contact for a few seconds, then look away.,
Return to whatever is it that you were doing beforehand.,

Avoid looking directly at the person at first, if you are within their eyesight.,
Squint or widen your eyes.,
Keep your lips drawn into a straight line.,
Dip your chin a little.,
Slowly turn your head to look at the person.,
Try to make eye contact, and maintain it for a few seconds.,
Walk away as though nothing has happened.",How to Give the Evil Eye," Evil eyes are meant to be noticed. They are meant to make the target feel uncomfortable or guilty. Unfortunately, they can also lead to confrontations. Your target may try to ask you what's wrong. If you are already very annoyed with this person, talking to them might be the last thing you feel like doing. Your target may even take the evil eye as a challenge and try to start a fight with you.


Have an escape route if you want to avoid unwanted conversation. Do not give the evil eye when you are still stuck in line or in class. Instead, try to give it just as you are leaving the line or classroom. This will prevent the other person from cornering you.
Have some sort of response in mind if the person does try to talk to you. A simple ""nothing"" will prevent the person from talking further to you, but it will also leave them questioning what they did that annoyed you.;
, Evil eyes tend to be personal. They are as much of a mental exercise as they are a physical one. They do not work well on random people who did nothing to annoy you. Because of this, you should have someone—a target so to speak—in mind. If you don't, seek someone out who has wronged you in some way. Jealousy is one of the most common reason for giving the evil eye.Your target maybe someone you don't know, but who did something annoying, such as ordering the last cupcake, humming too loudly and off-key, or refusing to calm her hyper, screaming child.
Your target may be someone you have known for quite a while—and you may dislike everything about this person's appearance and personality. It can be a sibling, or even the precious, teacher's pet who can do no wrong.

, This will depend on who your target is. Because evil eyes are meant to be noticed, you should wait until your target does something that irks you. For example:


If your target is someone you don't know, wait until they do something annoying, such as paying for the cupcake you wanted so badly.
If your target is someone you do know, you can give the evil eye after he or she does just about anything. It can be as simple as a sneeze or a girly hair flick.

, An evil eye is not just about looking a certain way. Your target should be able to feel the anger and hatred seething off of you. Chances are, you might already be thinking about the offense (such as that annoying humming). If you already know the person and want to let them know how much you dislike them, you might need to dwell on previous offenses to get that energy built up. Here are some ways to build up this energy:


Think about all the annoying things the person did in the past. Think about how unfair it is that they can get away with violating the dress-code while you get ticketed for your shirt becoming un-tucked when you bend over to get something out of your backpack.
If you are having troubles finding past offenses, try thinking about things that make you upset or angry instead, such as: discrimination, politics, abuse, and so forth.
Focus on something that happened that made you really angry. The more recent the event, the stronger the feeling will be.

, Once you have started the train of negative thoughts, keep them up. You will need to keep at this until you are done giving the evil eye.


If you are having trouble keeping up the energy, imagine something bad happening to your target, such as them dropping the cupcake (frosting side down) on the dirty floor.

, Calm anger is more intimidating than out-of-control anger. Don't snarl, bare your teeth, or arch your eyebrows in a villainous way. This won't look very intimidating and will take away from the intensity of your stare.


The most you should be doing is squinting or widening your eyes. Your mouth can be drawn into a straight line, as though you tasted something bitter.

, This may not happen right away. Don't give up. Keep staring at the person and don't let your gaze wander. Eventually, the person will ""sense"" your gaze, and turn to look at you.

, The longer you know this person, the longer the stare should be. For example, if this is a stranger who ordered that last cupcake you wanted, half a second to a full second should be enough. If this is someone you know, like that annoying teacher's pet, a second or two will be plenty.


Keep in mind that the longer you look, the more likely the person you are giving the evil eye to will talk to you.
When you look away, allow your face to relax into its usual expression.

, Act as though nothing has happened. This will help make your evil eye stand out from your usual routine, and make the person realize that they did something wrong. It may also help prevent them from approaching you and confronting you.

, This will help make your gaze all the more intense.

, If you are in the person's line of sight, try to position yourself so that he or she can only see the side of your face. This will allow you to turn your head and look at them slowly in a most intimidating way.

, This sudden change from your normal gaze will alert your target that something is wrong. This is the first step to making him or her feel uncomfortable.

, Try not to bare your teeth or snarl. This won't look very intimidating. The last thing you'd want to look like is a cartoon villain; you will look more comical than intimidating.

, This way, you will be looking out at your target from under your eyebrows. This will make your face look more angular, and thus more threatening.

, If they are already looking in your direction, this will make you look more ominous. If they aren't looking at you yet, they will eventually notice your gaze.

, Think of it as though you are looking ""through"" the person. Try not to blink, as this may break the intensity of your stare.


If you want, you can raise one eyebrow slightly, for a more sarcastic touch.

, Once the person has noticed your evil gaze, break eye contact and leave. If you can't walk away, slowly look away, and return to whatever it was that you were doing.

Clip the sage into relatively same lengths.,
Grab the string and tie a knot at the base of the stems of the leaves.,
Set the bundles inside somewhere where it is dark and dry.",How to Make a Smudge Stick2," Remove any spotted or brown leaves. Arrange the leaves into bundles of the same lengths., Hold the bundle in one hand and wind the string up the bundle. Once you reach the top, wind the string down the bundle creating a crisscross design. This helps hold all the leaves in place. Wrap the leaves as tightly as possible. Tie another knot at the bottom of the bundle., You can hang them on a drying line, or lay them flat to dry. If you lay them down flat, it is better to put them on a screen to help airflow. It is also good to flip them over every day or so. Depending on how humid it is, it can take up to a few weeks"

Ensure the stick is dry.,
Use the white smoke from the smudge stick to cleanse rooms, spaces or people.,
Fully extinguish the flame when you are finished cleansing an area.",How to Make a Smudge Stick3," After the smudge sticks have dried, now they are ready to burn. Holding the stick at the base, use a match or lighter to ignite the top end of the smudge stick.

Allow the sage to catch fire for a moment, and then carefully blow out the flame. Let the stick smolder and white smoke will start to travel upwards. Hold the sage over an ashtray or bowl to catch any fallen debris. Traditionally a shell is used for this purpose.

, Gently wave the smoke from the smudge stick around the room where you want to clear the energy. The smoke will remove any negative energy left behind and leave a nice fragrance in the room. The same process can be done on a person. Slowly moving the smoldering sage around the person’s feet, limbs and head to help cleanse the energy around them., Press the smudge stick down to stifle the smoke completely. Try to avoid using water to put out the smudge stick because this can damage the stick for future use. Never leave burning sage unattended."

Try to slow the vibration.,
Let your body become paralyzed.",How to Have an Out of Body Experience2," As you relax further, you should become more aware of what's happening inside your mind and body than anything happening in the room around you. Try to feel the vibration of your body, coming from both the larger pulse of your blood and breath to the individual movements of your cells. You may think you hear sounds like a tornado/wind. The urge to move here will be tremendous, especially if it's your first time. Just relax deeper and deeper until the sounds passes, but avoid falling asleep.

, Visualize the movements of your body slowing and the sounds and sensations of vibrations getting fainter. Soon everything will be completely silent and your body will be still.

, Some say it feels like a lead blanket has been placed over you. You may notice all of a sudden that you can't move your arms or legs. Don't panic! If you try to force yourself to move you may wake up. You will, however, be able to move your eyes, mouth, nose, and face, so try moving those slightly instead.

Open your astral eyes.",How to Have an Out of Body Experience3," Don't move your actual hands or visualize the rope. The ""rope method"" relies on the imaginary feeling of the rope, not a mental image. Focus on the texture, thickness and heftiness of the rope. Feel the tension in your arms between the strength of the rope and the pull of your weight.If you have trouble using the rope technique, try imagining a ladder instead. Some people find this easier, especially if they are more accustomed to climbing ladders than ropes.

, Feel your muscles contract and your body move upward when you pull. Don't visualize: imagine you are doing this in pure darkness. Keep going up. Soon you will find yourself out of your body, triggering the ""projection reflex.""


If you experience vibrations in your body as you climb, try to relax more, or else you will only lose more energy and it will become harder.
If you have trouble, try climbing up as you inhale and then resting as you exhale.
The rope method is a more practical variation on the more iconic technique of visualizing yourself floating up. Though floating out of one's body all at once makes for a better image in the movies, it's not as effective in real life.

, Once you know you are out of your body, open your eyes. You should be viewing your room from the side of your bed, with your body still lying there still with eyes closed.


If you want, try to open your third eye first, low on the center of your forehead.

Visualize every detail of the space around you.,
Visualize the space around you as seen from a different point in the room.,
Rise from your body to the spot you were visualizing from.",How to Have an Out of Body Experience4," Make sure you get a good look at your surroundings before you lie down. Now try to recall and feel the location and shape of every object in the room, as it looks from where you are resting., Once you have the image of the room clear in your mind's eye, shift that perspective to try to see that image as though you were standing over or near your body. In some ways you should already feel like you have left your body.

, Stay very relaxed, but be forceful in your will to gently bring yourself to that point. Feel yourself moving up and over to that space, and visualize your perspective changing. Then open your astral eyes.

Find the right time to devote yourself to God.,
Make a timetable for your daily prayer.,
Allow one hour for prayer.,
Don't feel bound to rules and regulations.,
Search the path to God in your own way.,
Reconcile within yourself the needs for your prayers.",How to Spend an Hour in Prayer," It doesn't have to be first thing in the morning if you aren't a morning person. Find a time that suits you best and when you will have at least an hour to spend one-on-one in God's presence.


It could be after work or after tea time, when everyone's doing their own thing and you can go into your room and be alone.
Don't forget to let people know that you are praying and would like some time alone with God. If you haven't told the people in your house that you are religious, perhaps just say that you need some space for at least an hour.;
, Due to the busy schedule that many people have today, it's important to schedule a specific time for prayer. This way you will be able to pray at the set time that you have assigned and will establish a habit to do so.

, It's hard these days to sit and just connect with God for one hour. However the more you do it, the easier will find it to be and you will be inspired, perhaps, to set aside more time to connect to your Creator and give the deserved praise.

, Having a relationship with God isn't about schedules, routines and rules. God doesn't see time. However a schedule will help you fit your beliefs into your lifestyle. God understands your schedule and he doesn't condemn you if you have accidentally missed your set prayer time.


He is the God of patience and understanding, and, when you do find time to converse with him, he looks lovingly upon you and you will learn how to rely on him for everything that you need.

, You don't need to align to praying the decorum of others. It's really a time between you and God and a time of worship, thankfulness and request.


Remember during prayer to be straight forward and not babble on, he knows what your request is before you even speak it.
He is a sovereign deity and he deserves all reverence. However, he is also your Father, and best friend. He would love to hear you speak to him just like you would speak to your Dad.

, There is no right or wrong thing to pray for with God. You can thank him for the day he has given you, the lung he has given you to breathe with, the heart that is keeping you alive or you could ask for guidance to find a new job, relationships or finances.


There is no long monologue that God is requiring from you daily. He wants you to be open, honest and straightforward. He does know what you are about to say before you say it but he likes to see you pray to prove that you are continually relying on him.

Remember that everyone's a person.,
Don't try to convert them.,
Don't make it a big point of the relationship.,
Don't force an atheist to do something that makes them uncomfortable.,
Remember there's a difference between atheists and anti-theists, and there's a very thick line between them.,
Under no circumstances should you ever slander their beliefs.,
Realize that you don't know what's going to happen to you until you die.",How to Respect an Atheist,";
, Just . . . don't. Trying to convert somebody to your religion is like waving a big red flag that reads ""HEY! I DON'T APPROVE OF YOUR WAY OF THINKING AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY MINE INSTEAD."" This is almost the complete opposite of respect. It's actually quite disrespectful.

, If you had to ask a question to find out if somebody's an atheist, like ""Where do you go to church"" or you outright ask ""Do you believe in *insert religious deity here*"" then chances are they didn't want to talk about it anyway. If you know, great. But they're still the same exact person you knew them as before.

, This stands for anybody, really. If something makes you uncomfortable, don't do it. If what you're asking somebody to do makes them uncomfortable, you shouldn't be asking.

, Atheists are saying ""I do not believe in the existence of a supreme being or beings."" Anti-theists are saying ""The very idea of religion is revolting, wrong, immoral."" If someone is an anti-theist and they are targeting your religion while around you, you are under no obligations to deal with their views. Get away from them - that kind of social interaction isn't good for you anyway.

, Let's use metaphorical cake to understand this. If you are religious, you're saying ""I like cake."" and the atheist is saying ""I do not."" Do not say ""But you haven't tried it yet!"" or ""No, you're wrong and you like cake - you should try it."" just say ""Okay."" and offer them doughnuts. Or ham. Or whatever metaphorical food atheists would eat.

, To them, you're wrong. To you, they're wrong. No one knows exactly what's going to happen until all is said and done and they're six feet under. And that's okay.

Make your move.",How to Become Superior To Others," Why do you want to be God? What is your purpose? What is your resolve? If you can't do this then don't bother.;
, If you want to achieve power among the masses, you must at least have some sort of special intelligence or ability. Be a brilliant tactician/strategist, strive to be a resourceful and competent leader. If possible, get an IQ higher than 120.

, Either be a sociopath and wipe out all those who you believe to be unworthy to live in this world, or be a type of leader who lets everyone be themselves with equal footing all around.

, As much as being God of a new world, you're still human. There's a 100% chance that others will gang up on you to try to defeat you so allies are a must. But choose carefully, don't choose a complete idiot as they will become useless and don't ally yourself with a mind more powerful than you, as this will surely backfire in the future.

, Every conqueror will gain enemies, so strive your best to learn how to build, manage, rule and fight with an army of your own. Master the basic skill of psychological warfare: Learn your enemy's weakness and learn to exploit that weakness. Again, be, as much as you can, a brilliant tactician/strategist as this will help in eventual future skirmishes.

, What kind of conqueror are you if you don't have funds? You're only human so you can't possibly make money just by imagining it. Invest in stocks, save money, etc. Do whatever it takes to get money... as an old saying does go, ""Money makes the world go round.""

, At times, your last resort would be to lie. To achieve your goals you must do everything necessary to get them. That includes elimination of your own men, etc.

, The second hardest to pull off, as you must eradicate any type of threat in your way. Be it a political leader, enthusiast, or just someone whom you feel as a threat, especially those who're smarter and better than you. Think two steps ahead of your opponents consider it just like a game of chess.

, Finally, the hardest task to pull off, keep your head in the game. Don't lose it. Don't have pathetic delusions of being a god when you're not even close to being a government lapdog. There's a 100% guarantee that most times you will think of giving up. Don't. When you ever feel that you're losing it, overcome it. Note that some consider this optional.

, This is vital to developing true deity.

Focus on subjects where you are certain you can find new ground and progress. Another option is to look into your life, or your inner self, and think about what's going on right now. Anything that will help you focus and see helpful pictures or thoughts. If you want, journal or draw.

, ""How can this be a good or bad thing?"" ""What causes it?"" ""How can I solve it?"" After looking inward, consider your position among others around you. It may be high or equal or low, but don't let that determine whether it is good or bad. Examine each type of situation, each relationship, and decide whether it would be better to be change or be more flexible.

, The spiritual beliefs of your ancestral roots may speak to you about your family history.

, Create steps to progress with goals still remaining. Say a prayer. Sing a song. Take a break and hop around a bit.

, Think about what activity or what action(s) you've done recently that helped you feel fulfilled. Was it reading books, or a holy book(s), or taking a walk, meditating, helping people in need, doing yoga...? Plan steps to do something fulfilling in the next few days and weeks. Close with a prayer, a resolution. Consider sharing it with others.

, Don't only think about your body (though you should do that too), your soul is also important for you. Don't only think about your own concerns, but think about those of others as well.

, (Most, though not all, icons of spirituality possessed this quality.) Grow in shrewdness or wisdom. (These teachers also possessed this!) Explore other belief systems. Develop an open mind in order to develop a closed mind. This means learning ideas and perspectives different from your own so that you can develop your own opinion about them. Sacrifice and accept the sacrifice of others.

, Doing this even on scratch sheets of paper is fine. Literate people have some amazing gifts--along with responsibilities--the rest of the world is doing without, so take advantage of them. Have a conversation with people who have experiences you want to know more about or who have 'been there.' Discuss or explain spiritual concepts, practices, or inspiring words with someone else in need. Teachers are learners.

, Go with a friend. This can be any size group. Have some questions in mind before-hand and ask them at an appropriate time.

, Avoid what you dislike. Look the world as the platform for presenting your talent, always seek advice and guidance from elders. Enjoy all moments of life.

, Try giving things such as clothes that you no longer need or use to those who could really use them. You'll feel much lighter after the experience, freeing you up to live your path even more."

Attempt to have your religion recognized by a government agency.",How to Become a Pastafarian," That's it — according to the official website for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), all that's needed to become a Pastafarian is to want to be one. You do not need to:Participate in any sort of ceremony
Pay any sort of fee
Make any sort of promise or pledge
Give up your current religion
Know anything about Pastafarianism
Have a literal belief in the FSM;
, So you've just become a Pastafarian by willing yourself to be one? Great! Now's the perfect time to learn what you've just signed on for. The following are some of the fundamental pillars that make up the beliefs of the Pastafarian religion — however, you don't have to literally believe in them to be a member:The supreme deity is known as the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM). He is an invisible, omnipotent, omniscient eternal being that takes the form of a giant clump of spaghetti with two meatballs and eyes. He created the entire universe in four days, then rested for three.
Pirates are considered holy beings. According the religion, pirates help fight global warming and protect against natural disasters. Every Pastafarian should strive towards pirate-hood.
Pastafarian heaven is a land of ""beer volcanoes and stripper factories.""

, For a great introduction to your new religion, try browsing any of the Pastafarian scriptures. The most important book to Pastafarians is the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The Quill Award-nominated Gospel was published in 2006 following an open letter by author Bobby Henderson to the Kansas State Board of Education that satirically protested its ruling requiring the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.The Gospel discusses the various aspects of Pastafarian belief in depth, making it indispensable for new members.


Another major Pastafarian holy book is The Loose Canon (available online), which includes religious stories, guides for everyday life, prayers, and the writings of numerous important figures in the church such as Captain Jeff., This set of rules (also known as the Eight Condiments) given to the pirate captain Mosey by the FSM himself provides the basic code of behavior for all Pastafarians. There were originally 10 rules, but Mosey dropped and broke two on his way down the mountain, which accounts for Pastafarians' ""relaxed"" moral standards. The eight surviving rules are:""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Act Like A Sanctimonious, Holier-Than-Thou Ass When Describing My Noodly Goodness.""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Use My Existence As A Means To Oppress, Subjugate, Punish, Eviscerate, And/Or, You Know, Be Mean To Others.""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Judge People For The Way They Look, Or How They Dress, Or The Way They Talk, Or, Well, Just Play Nice, Okay?""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Indulge In Conduct That Offends Yourself, Or Your Willing, Consenting Partner Of Legal Age AND Mental Maturity.""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Challenge The Bigoted, Misogynist, Hateful Ideas Of Others On An Empty Stomach.""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Build Multi-million Dollar Churches/Temples/Mosques/Shrines To My Noodly Goodness When The Money Could Be Better Spent (take your pick)

Ending Poverty,
Curing Diseases,
Living In Peace, Loving With Passion, And Lowering The Cost Of Cable.


""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Go Around Telling People I Talk To You.""
""I'd Really Rather You Didn't Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You If You Are Into, Um, Stuff That Uses A Lot Of Leather/Lubricant/Las Vegas. If the other person is into it, however (Pursuant To #4), then have at it.""

, In Pastafarianism, pirates have a status similar to saints in Christianity or bodhisattvas in Buddhism. In fact, the mere existence of pirates is said to prevent natural disasters/ All Pastafarians are encouraged to adopt the dress, speech, and behavior of a pirate, especially if they are going to be preaching the holy word of the FSM.


Pirates typically dress in flamboyant, colonial-era clothing, with ruffled shirts, bright jackets, bandanas, and eye patches being common.
Pirates enjoy beer, grog, wenches, the high seas, and anything that can get them a day off of work.

, Like any religion, Pastafarianism has its own yearly holidays. These special days call for joyous celebration, humble reflection, and special devotion to the FSM. A brief calendar of the most important days in the Pastafarian calendar can be found below:Every Friday: Friday is the sabbath day for Pastafarians. However, it doesn't require any sort of special effort — Pastafarians may celebrate this day by ""drinking beer and relaxing.""Ramendan: A month of sacrifice during which Pastafarians eat only pasta and noodle dishes after sundown. Start and end dates vary from year to year.
Pastover: Pastafarians enjoy a feast of pasta, dress as pirates, and participate in a ritual passing of the eye patch. Date varies from year to year; usually in March or April.
Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19th): Self-explanatory. Pirate costumes are recommended but not required.
Halloween (October 31st): Pastafarians are obliged to dress like pirates.
""Holiday:"" Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined Christmas-like event in late December (no specific date is given by the church) any way they like, but especially with pasta, pirates, and beer.

, Devout Pastafarians may choose to pray on the Friday sabbath, every day, or whenever they feel like it — there are no strict rules about when and where to pray. Though Pastafarians have major figures have written several commonly-used prayers, you don't need to use these — any sincere prayer (even one you make up on the spot) will be received by the FSM. If you choose to pray, end all your prayers with the holy word ""Ramen.""


Here's just one Pastafarian prayer — you can find many more here.Prayer of Knowledge
Grant, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, thy sauce;
and in sauce, noodles;
and in noodles, meatballs;
and in meatballs, knowledge;
and from knowledge, knowledge of what is tasty;
and from knowledge of what is tasty, the love of spaghetti;
and from spaghetti, the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Ramen.





, While Pastafarians are encouraged to spread the good word of the FSM in their daily lives, they are not allowed to harass, bully, or otherwise bother people who don't accept the FSM. Not only is this against several of the I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts, it's also just plain rude and not in line with the relaxed, pasta-eating, live-and-let-live philosophy of Pastafarianism.


Note that this rule isn't just for people of other religions who consider Pastafarianism a heresy — it's for atheists and agnostics as well.

, Pastafarianism is designed to be a religion that its followers can enjoy. While followers of the FSM range from the extremely casual to the devoted, none should take their Pastafarian beliefs so seriously that they can't crack open a beer on a Friday afternoon the way the FSM intended in his infinite wisdom. Don't get stressed out about anything related to practicing Pastafarianism — remember, it's a religion with a holiday called ""Ramendan.""

, Pastafarians who wish to deepen their faith may eventually choose to join a sub-sect of the religion. These sects interpret the word of the FSM differently, leading to different practices and beliefs for their members. Unless a sect breaks one of the I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts, there's no ""right or wrong"" sect to be in — it's a matter of personal preference.


Two of the biggest sects in Pastafarianism are the Orthodox and Reformed sects. Orthodox believers tend to have more conservative, literal views of Pastafarian beliefs, while Reformed believers tend to be more open to allegorical meanings.
For instance, many Reformed Pastafarians believe in Automated Creationism, which is the idea that the FSM sparked the creation of the universe with a single event (the big boil), then let natural processes eventually create life. Orthodox Pastafarians, on the other hand, believe that the FSM deliberately and literally created all things.

, The Church of the FSM encourages its members to promote its message so long as this does not lead to harassment or persecution of others. One of the most popular ways to do this is to distribute propaganda in the form of flyers, booklets, brochures, and so on. Official propaganda materials from the church are available here.You may also make your own propaganda materials if you wish. However, make sure your materials are consistent with Pastafarian doctrine. It wouldn't be appropriate, for instance, to pass out flyers saying ""The Flying Spaghetti Monster hates people who follow other religions."" This isn't true — the FSM accepts people of all faiths.

, Ready to stop being a follower in the Church of the FSM and start being a leader? Becoming an officially-ordained minister is easy and can be done online here. You will need to pay $25 to receive your official certificate and have your name added to the register of ministers.

, Heroes of the Pastafarian faith don't give up when they're told that they don't belong to a ""real"" religion. Getting your religion officially recognized by local, state, or national government agencies is one of the bravest, most self-sacrificing things a Pastafarian can do. Not only does it increase awareness of Pastafarianism, it also helps to illustrate the arbitrary nature of other religions' special privileges in society. One good way to do this is to wear a pasta strainer on your head in official photographs. The following are some examples.


In 2013, Czech Pastafarian Lukas Novy won a legal battle to wear a strainer on his head for his government ID photo, citing religious reasons.In 2014, Christopher Schaeffer became the first openly Pastafarian politician in the U.S. when he wore a strainer while being sworn in to the Pomfret, NY Town Council.Shawna Hammond was allowed to wear their religious headwear for her driver's license photo in Oklahoma. Jessica Steinhauser demonstrated her religious freedom by wearing her metal colander on her head for her driver's license photo in Utah. In 2015, the New Zealand Government approved the church's application to conduct marriage ceremonies.

, Add these notes in your dream journal.

, You may also find that objects or people appear to you after dreaming of them. For example, you may have a dream of getting a relaxing massage and then encounter an advertisement of a day spa upon waking up the next day. Make sure to continue the magic of the dream time by taking advantage of these encounters and acting on them. You may not know where the experience of booking a massage will lead, but by doing so you demonstrate your willingness to pay attention to your inner wisdom. As you follow the prompts of your dreamer self, you send an important message that you respect the dream world as much as the 'real' world.

, For example, if you often dream of the ocean, you may want to gather shells, driftwood, or a small container of sea water. Light a candle on your altar before going to sleep and ask to receive further insight about your dreams.

, You can also draw, paint or sculpt images that appear in your dreams. Journal your response to your dream art.

, Write first as yourself and then write back from the perspective of the symbol. This is a potent way of discovering what the message is from your dreaming mind.

, Describe the dream in detail, then choose dream symbols or characters and watch your dream come to life. As you develop a closer relationship with your inner wisdom, the messages you receive will help guide you on your true path.

, Even if you're clueless about the next step to be taken believe that you can and take action.

, This music does not glorify God. It only talks about sexing somebody or something of that nature. It doesn't one time mention God's name. It's all about Jesus, the creator.

, You must believe. If you don't believe, what can God do for you? You must believe and trust in God.

, You can't hate people. God showed humanity and compassion to everyone he came in contact with, whether they were good or bad. Even that person you dislike you still have to love. Who knows, seeing the difference in you could turn their life around and bring them to Christ.

, It is important to get the word of God in your heart. If you don't know Jesus' way, whose way are you following? You may think it's yours, but it's really the devil's way. The reason God kicked Lucifer out of Heaven was because he wanted to do things his own way rather than God's way.

, Whatever sins you have committed, always confess so God can forgive you. God knows we will mess up from time to time. When you fall get back up each time and look to God for forgiveness.

, He gave His life for the whole world. We need to give Him all of our undivided attention daily. You could do this by witnessing to others about Jesus, reading the Bible, praying, and fasting. All these things that can help you keep a true heart.

, You must forgive others. If you don't your Father in Heaven will not forgive you for your sins you have committed. So, don't hold grudges.

Know the number's significance.,
Calculate your Life Path Number.,
Account for any Master Numbers.,
Note that we do not add the dates together in one fell swoop, i.e.",How to Find Your Lucky Numbers in Numerology1," Your Life Path Number is considered the most significant of your core numbers. It offers your life's potential outline, the path you will take through life and the themes that will shape it. This number reveals what lessons you will learn, challenges you will face, and opportunities you will receive in the form of a broad outline. Ultimately it is your choice to deviate from this number's lesson, but within Numerology it is believed that following the path of your Life Path Number is the most fulfilling choice to make.


Any positive traits associated with this number will manifest as unique skills and capacities that aid you in all aspects of life.
Negative traits associated with each number show you personal deficits. Or rather, point out areas in your inner and outer life that need attention in order to find balance.;
, In essence, you add each number in your birth date together until a single digit is achieved. The method however is very specific. We'll use the birthday December 17, 1986 as an example.(Note: Check the section near the bottom of the page for more information on each number you calculate.)


Reduce the month, day, and year to single digits. It is common for some numbers to take multiple reductions. In such cases, repeat the same technique until a single digit or Master Number is achieved.

Month: 12 = 1+2 = 3

Day: 17 = 1+7 = 8

Year: 1986 = 1+9+8+6 = 24 = 2+4 = 6



Next take the resulting three single digits or Master Numbers and add them: 3+8+6 = 17 = 1+ 7 = 8.
And so in the instance of December 17, 1986, we get a Life Path Number of 8.

, Containing a host of set meanings - often of great purpose and power - the numbers 11, 22, and 33 are considered Master Numbers. When calculating in numerology, the general rule is that the month of November (11), as well as the 11th and 22nd days of any month, are reduced to 2, 2, and 4 respectively. However, in the case of Life Path and Birthday numbers, an exception is made.For example, if the above example were instead November 17, 1986, our initial reduction would result in: 11+8+6 = 25 = 2+5 = 7 yielding a Life Path number of 7.

, 1+2+1+7+1+9+8+6. Instead the month, day, and year are first reduced on their own, and then added together. This is symbolic and connected to the Period Cycles, which divide your life into three sections of growth, thematic meaning, and challenge.

, Find a place, like a forest, and take a walk there by yourself. Give yourself at least an hour for this activity. Notice the trees around you and the wind on your face. Center your thoughts on the simple act of walking. This action will place your mind in a contemplative zone.Engaging with nature in this way allows you to think about its effect on your life.

, Read a book. Watch a film. Listen to an album. Go to a museum and look at paintings, sculptures, and videos. All of these activities are meditative in nature. Art allows us to feel another’s experience of the world. Immerse yourself in these images, sounds, and words! Analyze the individual details that make up these works. This concentration will lead you to realize that each person shares the desire to express what is inside of them.


Maybe you don’t understand visual art, this is fine. The importance of these activities is that they take you to a place outside of your comprehension.

, This can be an incredibly affirming way to meditate. It's not difficult to grow a plant. Taking care of a plant involves focus and love, which are both building blocks for a personal spirituality. If you never take the time to notice the world, then it will be impossible to hold affection for it. Every day you watch your plant grow, you will be observing the intricacies of the world.

Clearly understand what evolution means.,
Clearly understand what natural selection means.,
Realize that all major world religions state that God is the creator.,
Now let's think about the act of creation.",How to Believe in God and Evolution," In biology, evolution is the change in the inherited traits of a population of living organisms through successive generations. In sexual reproduction, every individual is supplied with hereditary material in the form of genes that are received from existing life, their parents; then, half the genes of the new born are from each parent, passed on to their offspring, introducing variations each time. More fundamental changes among offspring are a result of either the random introduction of new genes called mutations (perhaps broken or fused genes) or the slight rearrangement of existing genes during reproduction.


What this means is that every creature is slightly different and each new generation has an overall slightly different mix of genes to the previous one.;
, Organisms tend to have more offspring than their environment can support, which means the offspring will have to compete for resources including food, shelter and mating partners. The organisms which are better adapted to their environment (e.g. faster organisms won't get eaten by predators) will be able to fulfill its basic needs and thus reproduce, effectively passing on their genes. Their offspring will inherit these ""effective"" genes, albeit with slight differences due to mutation. The offspring with mutations which make them even better adapted to their environment (e.g. a mutation which makes them even faster), have a higher chance of survival, more reproductive success and thus more offspring with more adapted genes.


This means that traits which make organisms better adapted to their environment have a higher chance of being passed onto the next generations, and becoming more common in the population over time.

, God would have created the environs and His system of genes that contain specific DNA, as coded plans for various systems in His living creation. So each expression of a gene involves communicating definitive coded information within the living cell. Those highly specific genetic ""blueprints"" tell the cells which proteins, mineral compounds, DNA, RNA and enzymes to make and manufacture each cell in a certain orderly, interdependent manner for each system to work as planned by God (or was origin of, by and for nothing with no guide or plan?). And even nutritionally essential trace elements and vitamins can profoundly affect their interdependent processes that only function well as designed/planned. So how, why and where did even the simplest life with exquisite genetic instructions, come to be (as the origin of life) with reproductive, inheritable traits. So expressing millions, billions, trillions,... of instructions defining individual, personal traits, and the recognizable racial, tribal and family traits are from what origin? They are from the all powerful God, outside of time, beyond some supposed, universal limits -- by the knowledge and power of The Creator/God. The God who can not go away -- but is ""eternal"" -- gave life its origin, its potentials, with physical and other laws, basic rights and freedom.

, If we think about how human beings create or make things, we first design them and we build them. Production was first done by hand, as society progressed and developed, basic machines were used, then as civilization developed further we had the industrial revolution and high-tech machines began doing much of the production. As technology continues to improve the methods we human beings use to make things improve further, we have teams, software to help use design, more advanced robotics to help develop prototypes, and make big buildings. So if we humans can easily see how our own creative process changes and grows, lets think about how much larger things are created.


If we wanted to create every animal, plant insect, tree, fungus, fish on Earth would we sit and design each one and fashion it, or would we create a system that creates every living creature and more?
If we think this way than we raise God higher by understanding that God as Creator, has made the laws of physics and space and time and chemistry and evolution. Its such a simple thing to think one level higher about a process of creation rather than creation one-by-one. There is no need to create individual animals, when the world itself is created to make life in all its forms and refine it and spread it and allow intelligence to develop right up to the human species.
As human beings of higher intelligence it is now more important than ever to understand how the environment works by carefully and scientifically studying it. There is no need to ignore science the Human Brain is naturally inclined to be curious and science is merely the systematic use of our curiosity.
With science, the increase in our collective knowledge, will then allow us to shape our environment and With the guidance of all religions, for understanding our role, can allow us to care for every living creature.

Discover your innate talents and imperfections.,
Add the value of the letters in your full birth name using the chart below.,
Learn by example.",How to Find Your Lucky Numbers in Numerology2," Also referred to as the Destiny Number, the Expression Number highlights the personal gifts and shortcomings you brought into this world. If your Life Path reveals the road on which you walk, the Expression Number reveals the flavor and character of your steps. Considered from the perspective of reincarnation, your Life Path Number is akin to the lesson you must learn this lifetime. Connected to this, your Expression Number reflects the core being - including your personal history from any past lifetimes - that you brought with you to Earth. The name is used because it represents the inborn character of the self as well as that which was passed down to you at birth.

, Similar to calculating your Life Path Number, we reduce the number values of each name individually before combining the results. This honors the individual character your name's (and self's) different facets before uncovering their combined meaning.

, As an example, we'll take the name Robert Nesta Marley.


ROBERT = 9+6+2+5+9+2 = 33 = 3+3 = 6

NESTA = 5+5+1+2+1 = 14 = 1+4 = 5

MARLEY = 4+1+9+3+5+7 = 29 = 2+9 = 11

And finally adding them together we get 6+5+11 = 22 Since we end with a Master Number there is no need to reduce. And so Bob Marley has an Expression Number of 22.

Learn your Heart's Desire.,
Calculate your Heart's Desire Number.",How to Find Your Lucky Numbers in Numerology3," Calculating this number rests in the vowels of your name. For thousands of years, many cultures have used the chanting of vowel sounds to induce trance and elevate themselves to higher states of consciousness. So, one could say that coming in contact with the vowels (so to speak) of one's self, will lead you to a greater purpose. Likewise, your Heart's Desire Number (also known as your Soul's Urge or Motivation Number) can help you gain understanding of what drives your true inner self. It answers the question, ""What is my deepest sense of purpose?"" This relates to what you want to be in life and what you would like to have and accomplish. The relationships your nurture as well as those you avoid can be revealed in this core number.

, Add the numerical value of the vowels in your full birth name. Using the same example ROBERT NESTA MARLEY we get the letters O, E, E, A, A, and E. Referencing the same chart above, this yields the following equation:


O+E = 6+5 = 11 = 1+1 = 2

E+A = 5+1 = 6

A+E = 1+5 = 6

2+6+6 = 14 = 1+4 = 5

Learn how you interact with the world.,
Calculate your Personality Number using the consonants of your full name.",How to Find Your Lucky Numbers in Numerology4," If the vowels tell us what is most true about our inner self, perhaps the consonants tell us what is seen on the exterior. In the study of Numerology, this is held true. One's Personality Number reveals those parts of yourself that are easiest to show to others. It articulates how to filter the people and experiences you want out of life through your external behavior.


This number goes beyond your own agency and also explains what others observe about you within a brief encounter. It shows the principal personality traits that are noticed with little effort on the part of those around you.

, Follow the same pattern as above using only the consonants to determine your number. Returning to ROBERT NESTA MARLEY we get the letters R, B, R, T, N, S, T, M, R, L, Y. Note that we count Y as a consonant and not a vowel in this case. Within numerology Y is always considered a consonant if it is next to a vowel with which it forms the same syllable. So it is in this example, where it functions to produce an ""ee"" sound.


R+B+R+T = 9+2+9+2 = 22 = 2+2 = 4

N+S+T = 5+1+2 = 8

M+R+L+Y = 4+9+3+7 = 23 = 2+3 = 5

4+8+5 = 17 = 1+7 = 8

Learn the significance of your birthday.,
Determine your Birthday Number.",How to Find Your Lucky Numbers in Numerology5," Though your Birthday Number will influence you less than the other four numbers, it still included as part of the core. It represents a special gift or talent that will help you on your life path. In the many spheres of New Age knowledge and practices (such as Numerology), it is not uncommon to find those who believe we choose when we are born, or that we are destined for our specific birthday. And so the Birthday Number holds a special significance, explaining what unique gift we have to bring forward, This requires no calculation and is simply the date on which you were born. In this case there is no need for reductions. So for example if you were born on the 13th, 23rd, or 31st, your numbers would 13, 23, and 31, respectively.

Read memoirs and biographies.,
Talk to spiritual people.,
Remember your experiences.",How to Be Spiritual Without Being Religious2," Go to the library and look up books about people you admire. You will find that they also struggled when they tried to live lives with meaning. Politicians, scientists, writers, and religious leaders have all doubted that their path was the correct one.


Some of the most impressive people have felt spiritually empty. This is natural. One must doubt life's inherent meaning, in order to hope that life has significance., You probably know one or two people in your life who you think have found inner peace. You should engage them in conversation. Ask them for advice. Sure, they may not have the perfect answer to your problems, but they might have struggled with the same questions that disturb you.


You could ask: ""How did you find meaning in your day to day life?""

, When you were a child, you probably did not struggle with connecting with the universe. You were a different person then. You should meditate on that time in your life. You can also focus on more recent experiences of serenity. Try to understand how you managed to enter those spaces of tranquility.


We are each made up of past selves.They still live within our memories. These previous versions of ourselves can teach us lessons if we let them.

Consider the variety of religions.,

Consider the nature of a god figure.,
Consider the source of morality and immorality.,
Look at the role of faith.,

Work out whether you can find reasons for belief.",How to Look at Theism vs. Atheism More Logically," It is difficult to credit any one religion as being True or any one god as being True when there have been so many throughout human history. None appears to have any greater claim to being more credible or reliable than any other. Why Christianity and not Judaism? Why Islam and not Hinduism? Why monotheism and not polytheism? Every position has had its defenders, all as ardent as those in other traditions. They can't all be right, but they can all be wrong. Too Many Gods...;
, Theists often claim that their gods are perfect beings; they describe gods, however, in contradictory and incoherent ways. Numerous characteristics are attributed to their gods, some of which are impossible and some combinations of which are impossible. As described, it's unlikely or impossible for these gods to exist. This doesn't mean that no god could possibly exist, just that the ones theists claim to believe in don't

, No religion is perfectly consistent when it comes to doctrines, ideas, and history. Every ideology, philosophy, and cultural tradition has inconsistencies and contradictions, so this shouldn't be surprising — but other ideologies and traditions aren't alleged to be divinely created or divinely sanctioned systems for following the wishes of a god. The state of religion in the world today is more consistent with the premise that they are man-made institutions.

, A few cultures, like ancient Greece, have postulated gods which appear to be as natural as human beings, but in general gods are supernatural. This means that they are fundamentally different from human beings or anything on earth. Despite this, however, theists consistently describe their gods in ways that make the supernatural appear almost mundane. Gods share so many characteristics with humans that it has been argued that gods were made in the image of man.

, Theism means believing in the existence of at least one god, not that one necessarily cares much about any gods. In practice, though, theists typically place a great deal of importance on their god and insist that it and what it wants are the most important things a person can be concerned with. Depending upon the nature of a god, however, this isn't necessarily true. It's not obvious that the existence or desires of gods should matter to us.

, In most religions, gods are supposed to be the source of all morality. For most believers, their religion represents an institution for promoting perfect morality. In reality, though, religions are responsible for widespread immorality and gods have characteristics or histories which make them worse than the most vile human serial killer. No one would tolerate such behavior on the part of a person, but when with a god it all becomes laudable — even an example to follow


Closely associated with taking action that should be considered immoral is the fact that there is so much evil in the world today. If there are any gods, why don't they act to eliminate it? The absence of substantive action against evil would be consistent with the existence of evil or at least indifferent gods, which is not impossible, but few people believe in such gods. Most claim that their gods are loving and powerful; the suffering on Earth makes their existence implausible.

, A common characteristic of both theism and religion is their reliance on faith: belief in the existence of god and in the truth of religious doctrines is neither founded upon nor defended by logic, reason, evidence, or science. Instead, people are supposed to have faith — a position they wouldn’t consciously adopt with just about any other issue. Faith, though, is an unreliable guide to reality or means for acquiring knowledge

, Most religions say that life is much more than the flesh and matter we see around us. In addition, there is supposed to be some sort of spiritual or supernatural realm behind it all and that our ""true selves"" is spiritual, not material. All evidence, though, points to life being a purely natural phenomenon. All evidence indicates that who we really are — our selves — is material and dependent upon the workings of the brain. If this is so, religious and theistic doctrines are wrong.

, Perhaps the most basic reason for not believing in any gods is the absence of good reasons for doing so. The above are decent reasons for not believing and for questioning — and eventually leaving — whatever theistic and religious beliefs a person might have had in the past. Once a person gets beyond the bias in favor of belief, though, they may realize something critical: the burden of support lies with those claiming that belief is rational and/or necessary. Believers fail to meet this burden, though, and thus fail to provide good reasons to accept their claims.

Engage in energetic coupling.,
Stretch your muscles and exercise.,

Sit across from one another.,
Visualize an image of the receiver.,
Connect your mind to your partner's.,
Picture the message you want to send.,
Transmit your message.,
Write down what comes to the receiver's mind.,
Compare results with one another.,
Send a pulse.,
Attract attention using your mind.,
Scan across the horizon for psi-symbols.,
Determine specific colors on a chart.,
Try out a card game.",How to Develop Telepathy," It is very important that both the sender (sends the mental message) and the receiver (receives the mental message) both believe telepathy is possible. Both partners should maintain open minds about this form of communication. The receiver and the sender should also desperately want telepathy to work. When partners are close minded, there tends to be very poor results., One of the main requirements of telepathy is to separate yourself from your physical body. This allows you to focus on thought, and the message you are trying to send. Some ways of doing this are wearing headphones while playing recorded white noise, or wearing goggles painted white.This is especially important for the receiver. If the receiver is bogged down in conversation or argument, he or she will not be able to accurately receive the message you wish to convey.

, This is when there is some sort of bond between the receiver and the sender. When you have an affinity for someone (a best friend) or when you both share common interests is when the energetic coupling is at its peak. Try engaging with the other person by asking them questions, such as: what is your favorite color, where would you like to visit, and/or where are you from?Once this initial bond is formed, you will want to try and read their thoughts before they come out of their mouth. Pick up on visual and contextual clues as to where the conversation is headed.
This bond can also be formed if you get a ""feeling"" when they talk. This could be warmth when they talk about their background, or coldness when they say their favorite color is blue.
One the bond has been formed, the energetic coupling can last days, weeks, or even months. Even if you are separated thousands of miles apart, the bond will stick. This bond will help when you are actually participating in the act of telepathy.

, This step is designed to help you relax your mind, and focus better. Yoga is the best exercise routine to perform as it is both spiritual, and not that intense. Grab a soft mat, or lay on your floor. One of the most common yoga moves is to sit on your butt, with your eyes closed, as you raise your hands slowly. You can find more here How to Do Yoga.Remember that the goal is to relax, so do not strain yourself too much.

, Relaxation is very important in order to decouple different forms of energy. Close your eyes, while sitting upright in a chair. Focus on which thoughts are clearly in your mind. Separate those from ""static"" buzzing around in your head. By separating these two forms of energy, you will be able to discern your own thoughts from possible outside interference., Each of these positions has different responsibilities in the telepathic process. If you do not decide before you begin, you could wind up sending mixed messages to one another. The boundaries should be clearly established at the beginning. Choose someone who you know, and trust., After you have decided who will be the receiver, and who will be the sender, sit across from one another in an upright position. Your bodies should be facing one another, and your eyes should be closed. Spend a few minutes clearing your mind, and settling into your position.While telepathy can technically happen far away, it is best to start out up close and personal. It is also best to limit the amount of time you commit to one session, otherwise you could become mentally tired., The sender should picture the receiver as clearly as possible (with their eyes closed). This should be as detailed as possible. Make details in your mind about the person's eye color, weight, height, length of hair, personal quirks, etc. If you are doing the transmitting from far away, feel as if the person is sitting right in front of you.If you are far away from the receiver, have a picture nearby to remind you of what they look like before you begin telepathy.

, The sender should visualize in their mind a silver tube. This tube connects the minds of the receiver and the sender. The tube is full of energy and it will transmit the message you want to deliver. It is important to focus your mind on the tube, and solely on the tube. You have to believe that the message will send through this tube, and that it is real in some way., This could be an apple, a bag, a colored pencil, etc. You should visualize it in all its detail. What color is it, what is it used for, and where is it located? Another important aspect of this is to inject feeling into the object. How do you feel when you taste an apple? When you draw using colored pencils? Feeling and emotion will help carry your message much more efficiently and clearly., After your mental image is charged up, direct it through the silver tube. You have to believe that the message will transfer through, and reach the receiver. Push it through with all of your brain power. Feel the emotion of your mental image as it passes through. This may take up to 15 minutes in order for the message to get to the receiver.If it takes too long, it may be that this transmission experiment has failed. If so, stop and meditate. Eventually come back and try the transmission again, using a different image.

, During the process of communicating a message via telepathy, the receiver should be concentrating on picking up signals. The receiver should also imagine the silver tube, and the energy that flows through it. The receiver then writes down whatever comes to their mind. This could be a feeling, an image, or both. Every detail should be written down, or described., Look at the receiver's paper and check whether it is the message you tried to send. If it is, then you can go onto harder levels of telepathy. If not, do not immediately try again. Your mind needs to be rested and completely relaxed. Take time to meditate, and then try again with a different image., Sit a bowl of water down in front of you. As you do so, sit in a chair, upright, with your eyes closed. Picture the bowl of water in all its detail. Then imagine a string connecting your mind to the water. You have to believe that this will work. Now feel a pulse of energy at the top of your forehead. Learn how it feels, and how much energy it is conducting. Finally, send the pulse down into the bowl, along the edge of the string.If this method is accomplished, the top of the water should move. This method may take up to ten minutes.
Really build up the energy pulse. You need to be in complete control of it. Maintain it for a long time, before you release it down the string and into the water.

, When you are at a restaurant, close your eyes. Visualize the waiter/waitress. Picture their smile, their dress and the food they are holding. Then think about them turning around, noticing that you are waiting on them. Wait for them to come over. This exercise is meant to increase your mind's ability to draw attention, and pull another willing recipient closer., Have one person be the sender. This person will scan a group of individuals. While doing this, the sender will place psi-symbols (tight packets of energy) in the realm of selected persons. After that person is done sending those symbols, the other will attempt to retrieve the symbols. That person will scan as well, looking for where they have left the symbols. Retrieving is best done with your eyes closed., Make a chart out of large poster board. This chart should have on it at least 5 colors. They should not be written out, but actually displayed. Use a magic marker to draw a colored in circle of each color. Then, the sender will place a psi-symbol on one or more of the colors. The retriever will write down which colors he or she thinks is marked., Take five random cards. Look at what they are, without showing them to another person. Focus solely on one. Place a psi-symbol on it. Flip them over, and place them apart, flat on a table. Continue to focus, and visualize the card. Ask the receiver to pick out the card."

Focus that energy and direct it toward their system.",How to Develop Telekinesis," One of the main exercises when it comes to telekinesis is visualization -- either of yourself or of the objects around you. These exercises won't warrant results unless you have the skills to back them up, so start visualizing! Similar to meditating, you'll see the results in your mind, aiming to have them play out in real life. (Imagine it)


Start with visualizing small objects. Work on every detail -- feel, smell, color nuances, maybe even taste. Work your way up until you can visualize entire scenes, yourself within them.;
, Anyone well-versed in the world of telekinesis will tell you that meditation lies at the very core of developing your superhuman skills. In order to channel your energy into the objects around you, your brain needs to be 100% clear. No other thoughts must pervade, disrupting and distracting you from the thoughts you need to channel. Meditation is the quickest way to develop this skill. (Don't listen to music while you are meditating otherwise it will be quite difficult to concentrate). If you find it really hard to clear your mind, try to listen to meditation music. Focus on nothing but meditation music.


It's practically a badge of honor nowadays to be doing 50 things at once, our lives buzzing fervently with piles and piles of things that need doing; we're juggling so many plates that if you're not dropping one, you're doing it wrong. Meditation allows you to escape this modern way of life and make it all go away, allowing your mental prowess to take center stage.

, Just like hypnosis, going into telekinetic practice with a closed, skeptical mind will not warrant results. If you think you can't, you can't -- that's what it boils down to. So ignore all those naysayers, ignore the science, and give it 110%. It's possible nothing will happen, sure, but it's definite nothing will happen if you don't let it.


There is no room for doubt here. You absolutely cannot doubt yourself or the possibility of something actually happening. Positive thoughts breed positive thoughts -- negative ones work the same way. One negative thought can spur on a thousand more, turning you into a skeptic. Believe that you can do it. It's only then that you can.

, A ""long time"" in the telekinetic world, at least when it comes to practicing, is years. Not weeks, not months, years. You may have to practice hundreds, maybe even thousands of times before you stumble upon that magical, effective mixture of energy. There's no telling when or where it will strike -- you just have to keep at it.


The reward in this is nothing till it happens -- that's the kicker. Unlike weight loss or playing guitar, it's not something that you can see gradual progress at. You'll be practicing day in and day out until one day something finally happens. It's just a matter of having the wherewithal to make it to that point.

, If you're meditating, hopefully this won't be an issue. Can you imagine trying to channel your energy and dispelling all excess thought when you're strung out about your job, your relationship, or what someone said today at school? Nope. Impossible. So relax. Let it go. For this to work, you have to fully and truly be in this moment. Your brain cannot be anywhere else.



Yoga is another way to get rid of the stresses of everyday life. In addition to meditation and yoga (exercise in general, really), make sure to take a bit of time every day to yourself. Just having 10 to 15 minutes getting in your zone can make the rest of the day that much easier.

, This is the idea that forms the basis of telekinesis: you and the object are one in the same. You have to abandon the belief that anything else is so. You know how all the matter in the universe started from stars and we are, therefore, stardust? It's exactly that. You can move that spoon in front of you because it's a natural extension of you.

, The challenge is to try to purely spin the wheel. Place a glass jar or container over the wheel to prevent wind from spinning it.

, Telekinesis is all about moving the things around you. In order to channel your natural energy into this nearby object, you'll need to concentrate and concentrate hard. It's easiest to start with very lightweight objects, like a match or a small pencil. The farther apart the molecules inside the system, the easier to manipulate it. You can work on chairs later!


Aim for these practice sessions twice a day for an hour in total. Visualize the object moving. To the left? To the right? Rolling, scooting, getting pushed or pulled? Is the entire object moving, or just one side? Get as specific as possible.

, A psi ball is a ball of energy that you can feel, manipulate, and, with time, take on complicated tasks. With your hands held around your stomach, feel the energy at your core. Hold your hands like they're cupping a ball. How big is it? Is it radiating? What color is it? Once it's concrete, move it around and let it morph shape and size.


In time, you can use this ball to deliver energy into other objects. The same way a baseball would knock over a vase, your psi ball can pummel into real-life objects, affecting them in much the same way.

, In addition to working with small objects, work with fire! Light a candle and watch it glow. Clear your mind and let the flame fill your thoughts. Watch it flicker and move. Focusing on it, move it with your energy. Move it right, move it left, stretch it up, smush it down, grow it brighter, dimmer, and make it yours. Does it dance like you want it to?


Flames can actually be a bit easier to manipulate. They're already balls of energy and not weighty objects that put up a fight. Use this exercise when you're feeling particularly tired as a sort of telekinetic pick-me-up.

, Since you're devoting so much time to this (an hour every day, right?), be sure to switch it up -- you never know what methods will and won't work for you until you try them all. Here are some ideas:


Try the classic spoon bending technique. But don't use your grandma's good china! Hold it out in front of you horizontally with both hands. The curve of the handle needs to be pointing up. Focus on a psi ball in your core, getting hotter and hotter, brighter and brighter. Move the ball through to your arms and down to your fingers, where your fingers will eventually bend the spoon like butter. Do this when you feel your psi ball is at its hottest.
Get an object that rolls. Start out giving it a light poke, concentrating on it zooming across the table. With each day, give it less and less of a poke, still focusing on it maintaining that push.
Work with a compass. Since it's free floating, some say it's easier to work with (ignoring all that magnetic talk). You can either concentrate on it, eyes open, or close your eyes and wave your hand over it in the direction you want it to move. Of course, if your eyes are closed, you'll need someone else (or a camera) monitoring it.

, You know out-of-body experiences, or OBEs? That's astral projection -- where your ""soul"" leaves your body and ventures onto the astral plane. It requires a deep state of hypnosis and entering a state of ""vibration."" And then some serious mind over matter business, moving your soul from your body and into the world around you.


This is very, very, very difficult to do. In order to not get frustrated, start out small. Try to move an arm or a leg and have a sort of out out-of-limb experience. Then you can move onto your entire self, wandering through rooms and into the ether. Even though it is scary, relax and return back to your body

, Do not continue until your fatigue is back to a normal level. It's like taking an exam when you've had 2 hours of sleep, 15 Red Bulls, and the person behind you keeps smacking their gum. In other words, you won't do well. In fact, your results will be better later on if you just rest up. Listen to your body and mind!

, Energy can be defined as ""the capacity to do work,"" which is any change in the state or motion of matter. There is energy continually running through our body, the same energy that keeps us moving, breathing and simply working. We obtain the energy from food, which is measured in calories, known as chemical energy. In muscle cells, only about 40% of the chemical energy is actually used for mechanical work. Potential chemical energy released by cellular respiration is converted into kinetic energy in the muscles. But instead of using physical, kinetic energy to move such things, one should use the chemical energy already stored in the body. Although we cannot see the energy (with the naked eye) it is still very much there.


The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, although it can be transferred or changed from one form to another. The energy of any system and its surroundings is constant. A system may absorb energy from its surroundings or it may give up some energy from its surroundings, but the total energy content of that system is always the same.

Telekinesis is not magic, although probably mistaken for thousands of years; one is really just transferring the energy from their body (the surroundings) to an object outside of the body (the system).



, Since the core tenet of this idea is that you and the object are one and the same, it's important that you feel that as the connection flows through your body. Here are two exercises to work on recognizing the link:


Exercise 1: Flex every muscle in one of your arms for 12 seconds, including your fist. After those 12 seconds are up, completely relax the arm and study the feeling of heat going through it. The heat may pulse, or feel almost of an electrical sensation. That feeling after the muscle has been contracted is that energy. Being able to control that without the initial trigger of moving your muscles is what you want to obtain. Once you have control over this, you must be able to sustain energy controlled emission, and not bursts.
Exercise 2: Find yourself an ideal conditioned, cool area. Completely relax your body, so much that you can sit (or lie) there without getting the hair on your body to stand up. The longer you practice controlling the energy that naturally wants to heat you up and keep you from freezing, the more you can control how much extra energy is used in useless things. Eventually you should be able to send the energy out through your body, to any part of your body (one arm or leg, a hand, chest, etc.) on demand.

, Decide whether you wish to pull, push, or spin the system. Each option has a different approach than one trying to change the state of or levitate the system.


Pulling the system is simple, because you know the direction of the energy.
Levitation is extremely hard, as one has to reduce the inertia of the system to make it light enough for the electromagnetism of the system and its surroundings to react.
Changing the state of the system requires changing the total amount of kinetic energy in the system (which we commonly know as heat). The amount of heat energy (calorie) is equivalent to 4.184 joules, which also equals the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water 1 degree Celsius. But other common substances such as metals or glass have much lower specific heat values. You can see why changing the state of an object would be hard for the mind to do.

, How you choose to do this depends on you. Different methods work for different people, just as we have different ways of thinking. Try feeling the system first and pay attention to the weight of it, how much energy does it take to physically move it? Then try to match that with the energy you feel in your body when you are not touching it.


Remember that a continuous flow of energy is needed; once you start to change the system, you must keep that energy focused on it, or else it will go back to it's primary state. This is Newton's first law: What is at rest, stays at rest (unless a force is acted upon it, and that's you)!

Gather your supplies.,
Create the board.,
Fill in the board.,
Balance two pencils.,
Understand the pencil’s movement.,
Set up the atmosphere.,
Get a camera ready.,
Begin recording.,
Wait to see what ""Charlie"" says.,
Share your results.,
Upload from your phone.,
Upload from your computer.",How to Do the Charlie Charlie Challenge," For the Charlie Charlie challenge you’ll need a piece of paper and two pencils. If you want to make your own vine or video meme, you’ll also need a camera.


You can use the camera in your smartphone or cell phone.;
, Position your paper longways or horizontal. Draw a grid on the paper of a simple cross. In other words, divide the paper into four sections or quadrants.


If you want to make efficient lines, you can use a ruler to make your marks., Label two of the quadrants with ""yes"" and two with ""no.” It is important to place the yes and no’s in opposite corners. When the pencil moves it can only select yes or no.

, Align two pencils along the grid you created earlier. One pencil should be on top of the other pencil to form a cross along your drawn lines. You will probably need to realign the pencils right before you ask a question.


Gravity has a major effect on the pencils and ultimately determines the answer of the questions., You don’t physically do anything to the pencil for it to start moving. A combination of gravity, surface level, and awkward pencil placement will inevitably move the pencil to “yes” or “no.” Once the pencil is in place, you should have just enough time to ask a question before the pencil moves.


If the pencil doesn’t move, then you’ve balanced the pencil perfectly, and the surface you are using is in balance. In this scenario, alter the balance of the top pencil, so the pencil moves.

, To make a more exciting video, you might want to dress up the area of where you are performing the challenge. Candles are good props to set an occult feeling. You could also use a white or lace tablecloth.


You could also plan ahead and shoot the video in the style of the Blair Witch Project. This technique requires a hand held camera (a smartphone's will work fine) and a flashlight. Have all the lights turned out and begin the challenge only using a flashlight for light.

, Generally, people participating in this challenge want to upload their results to Twitter or Vine. If you're going to do that, you'll need to record your challenge. A camera phone should do the trick. You can either record the video yourself or get a pal to film the results for you.


Before filming the Charlie Charlie Challenge, make sure the pencils are set up in their proper place.

, Ask ""Charlie Charlie, are you there?"" and follow up with your question. Use a yes/no question so that ""Charlie"" can answer you; for example, you might ask, ""Charlie Charlie, are you there? Will I pass my English test?"" or ""Charlie Charlie, are you there? Will Tim ask me out?""You can add some drama by creepily singing “Charlie"" repeatedly. This will give your video more of a horror film feeling.

, If it works, the top pencil will move to point to one of the answers. Feel free to squeal or scream accordingly! The most popular videos result in the user completely freaking out from the results.


Once the pencil moves, have the camera operator jump, yell, and move around the room quickly., If you're a social media fan, you'll want to upload the video to Vine, post your outcome on Twitter or Facebook, or even share it on YouTube. Use the hashtag #CharlieCharlieChallenge to mark your post as part of the trending challenge.The video shouldn’t be longer than 15 seconds. If your video is longer, you may want to trim the content or recreate it.

, The easiest way to upload your results is by using a smartphone. Smartphones have apps that allow you to quickly upload your results. Select your prefered social media platform, and use their app to upload the video.

, Plug your phone into your computer and wait for the computer to detect your device. Your computer should detect the device and show a popup message of options for you to do. The easiest way to isolate the video is by manually going through your phone’s files and selecting the video.


Once the video is uploaded to your computer, you can post the video onto the internet. Sign into the social media site of your preference and go to the upload section.

Find a quiet, private place to relax and concentrate.,
Close your eyes.,
Begin asking questions of your spirit guide.",How to Do a Spirit Guide Communication with a Pendulum,"  Choose an object that has meaning to you, and can be attached to a string, allowing for easy, smooth, swinging movement. 


You can also purchase a pendulum if you prefer, but be cautious about choosing one made up of stones.  It is better to choose one that is made of brass or other metals.  Stones have their own energy which might interfere with clear movement.  Sit at a table or have a flat surface on your lap. ;
, See yourself having a conversation with someone who has passed to spirit.  Someone you love would be ideal, for instance. 


Holding your pendulum still in front of you, ask your spirit messenger to indicate a ""yes"" for you and notice the movement of the pendulum. 
Gently tap the pendulum on the surface in front of you and say ""thank you"".  Do the same process again for ""Yes"" and ""I don't know, or wouldn't want to say at this time"".

, Once you are centered and know the movements of the pendulum, that will indicate ""yes"", ""no"" and ""not at this time""

Learn about the different kinds of psychic abilities.,
Practice your psychic ability with small objects.,
Try other exercises with objects.,
Meditate in order to develop your physic abilities.",How to Develop Psychic Abilities1," Some psychics are strongest in one psychic area or they choose to focus on one at the expense of others.


Imagine you are using your “third eye” – the chakra (or energy field) that is located above your real eyes. Visualize this third eye opening and expanding. See what you notice in the mind’s “inner screen.” Try this with your eyes shut.Clairvoyance means you are able to see spirit images. One aspect of clairvoyance is “remote viewing,” which is the ability to see things that are not known by the common senses. Clairvoyants work through the aura to receive impressions from spirit communicators.For remote viewing, determine a remote location you want to sense. Shut your eyes, and think about the location. Shift your intention upward to your third eye. Note the first impression you have, and write it down. Clairaudience means the ability to receive spirit impressions but in the forms of sounds. Words are transmitted through the aura into the medium’s subconscious, as if the medium is a telephone. To practice clairaudience, repeat a word in your mind as you think it. This helps develop your inner voice. Clairsentience is the ability to sense the presence of a spirit, including its emotions and personality.;
, Some psychics, such as those working on criminal investigations, will use clothing. The key is to find an object that’s been used, as psychics believe it will have more energy than an unused object.Put the object in your hands, close your eyes, relax, and feel – what your body feels. You could ask yourself whether you think the object belonged to a man or woman, what the emotions were of the person who owned it, and what kind of work they did.
Write what comes to you as instinct. This is called an energetic impression. Don’t edit anything. It’s best if the person who gives you the object actually knows the owner but doesn’t tell you. That way you can compare what you write down to the actual facts.

, Have someone hide an object, and see if you can find it. The key, again, is to see whether you can sense the energy in the object. Try to “feel” where the object is located.


Visualize yourself connecting with the object’s energy in order to figure out its location. Ask yourself whether it seems somewhere high or low, and whether it’s hidden under something or placed inside of something.
You could use pictures instead as the objects. Have a friend select photos out of magazines, and seal them in envelopes. Then, see how many details you come up with about the photos.

, This will allow you to clear your mind and better focus on your sixth sense. It's extremely important that you reduce clutter.


Upon waking in the morning, make an effort to lie still for a few minutes without opening your eyes. Try to notice as many sounds, textures and smells as possible before you decide to open your eyes. This exercise, if carried out for several weeks, can greatly help to increase your levels of awareness and intuition.
To meditate, close your eyes and draw in a deep and slow breath. Then, inhale through your nose. Hold the breath in for a moment. Breathe back out through your mouth.Playing soft music in the background could help you still your mind. Or you could chant a mantra to do so – this is a word or short phrase that you repeat to yourself over and over again. The goal is to screen out unwanted mental clutter. The reason meditation works is that it helps you turn off your analytical mind and free up the subconscious mind.Imagine a “plus” sign when you inhale, and imagine a “minus” sign when you exhale. Do this exercise repeatedly. Clear your mind of all negative thoughts, as they can impede psychic abilities. "

Cultivate your intuition.,
Keep a dream journal.,
Free write.,
Learn to notice small things.,
Record what you see.,
Learn to watch and listen closely.,
Exercise your non-visual senses.,
Direct your thought outward.,
Develop a meditation practice.,
Take a walk.",How to Develop Your Sixth Sense," Intuition is the term for “gut feeling”—something that you know or think likely based on instinctive feeling rather than conscious reasoning. When you get an instant liking or disliking for someone you just met, or have a good or bad feeling about something about to happen, it’s considered intuitive feeling.


Scientists believe intuition is a form of quick information processing, and it’s a skill that can be developed with practice and attention.The ability to use intuition develops out of repeated exposure to various situations and outcomes—the more rich and complex your experiences, the more likely you are to develop unconscious, intuitive knowledge about a wide range of situations and experiences.
Consequently, developing your intuition begins with exposing yourself to people, places, and things and observing them closely. Pay careful attention to your feelings in response to the things you encounter. Note how you feel and react to them—perhaps even begin keeping a journal in which you note these feelings and the circumstances that gave rise to them.The more practiced you become at observing others and your unconscious reactions to them, the more attuned you’ll be to your intuition.;
, Dreams are thought to be unconscious expressions of our inner feelings, thoughts, and ideas. As such, they can contain valuable intuitive information of which your conscious mind may be unaware.Make it a habit to write down everything you can remember from your dreams immediately upon waking up. Note people, events, places, objects, and feelings.
Try to make connections between the content of your dreams and ongoing feelings or situations from your conscious life.
As you begin to draw connections between your conscious and unconscious experience, you’ll become more aware of and attuned to the more subtle ideas and experiences happening below the surface of your immediate consciousness.

, Free writing involves sitting down with a blank sheet of paper and writing down whatever thoughts come. Free writing can be an extremely useful practice because it allows you to tap into the part of your consciousness that exists before your rational mind intercede.To free write, sit down in a quiet, distraction-free place. Take out a blank sheet of paper and begin writing whatever comes to mind, even if initially it’s just “I don’t know what to write.”
Continue writing until you’ve exhausted your thoughts.
If you need a bit more prompting to help you get started, you can begin by asking yourself a question such as, “What do I need an answer to?” or, “What’s been on my mind lately?”You’ll be surprised by where you can go through free writing and by the unexpected insights you’ll stumble upon.

, Part of developing a sixth sense is learning how to pay close attention to your surroundings, particularly to small or minute details.


The more attention you pay to your surroundings, the more aware you become of slight changes and variations, and the more attuned you become with the world around you.Enhancing your perception this way helps you to notice subtle shifts and changes in your environment and eventually to anticipate certain things before they happen.
For example, imagine a street you travel frequently. Try to imagine it in as close and as much precise detail as you can. Where are the various shops located? Which traffic signs are posted? What are the parking regulations? What kind of landscaping does the street have? Write down as many details as you’re able to remember, then go visit that street and carefully fill in the blanks in your memory. Write down a detailed description of what you see. Later, test yourself to see how accurately you remembered the details you wrote down. Learn to notice and absorb this level of detail wherever you go.

, Teach yourself to focus your attention outward rather than inward. Doing so will help you develop sensitivity to what goes on around you and will teach you to quiet your own thoughts and preoccupations when necessary.


Take a notebook with you when you go places. Note what you see and sense in as much detail as possible. Make this a regular practice until you find yourself doing it automatically, with or without the notebook.

, When talking with someone, train yourself to put your full attention on them. When you learn to observe someone closely and attentively, you often learn to pick up on small, nearly imperceptible cues that will indicate what the person is truly feeling or thinking.


Note small variations in their tone and inflection, watch the movement of their eyes and the contraction or dilation of their pupils, pay attention to the words they choose, and notice the pauses and silences between their words.

, We tend to rely on our sight to interpret the world around us, so much so that sight can come to predominate over our other senses. But if you consciously work on prioritizing senses other than sight, you can begin to perceive more subtle variations in the environment of which you were previously unaware.


Try closing your eyes and using your other senses to perceive people as they walk by. Note the sound of their clothing, footfalls, and breathing. Note their smell. Note the subtle changes in the air around them as they move. Note any temperature changes that occur as they pass. See if you can detect where their attention is directed and if you can tell when their attention falls on you.
As you become more sensitive to people and the energy they give off, see if you can notice the particular type of energy of each person who passes. Can you pick up on any tension or on any negative or positive energy?
Try to assess the energy of rooms you walk into. Can you sense any positive or negative energy?

, When you’re overly focused on the running dialogue in your own head, you easily miss what’s going on with other people and things in the world around you.


When you find yourself caught up in your own head, consciously turn your focus outward and notice the people, places, and things around you.
Quiet your mind by telling yourself that you don’t need to think about whatever is going on in your head. Instead, decide to be quiet and serene.

, Part of learning to be attuned to the world around you is learning to quiet your own mind and calmly observe. Meditation trains your mind to move away from its normal freneticism and to tap into your body’s inner calm.Begin by finding a calm place where you can sit quietly.
Close your eyes and begin paying attention to the sounds, smells, and physical sensations around you.
Breathe deeply and regularly, focusing on breathing through your diaphragm and noticing the pause between each breath.
When random thoughts pop into your mind, gently and calmly let them go. Don’t follow them.
Gradually build up the length of time you spend meditating. At first, you may only practice for 5 minutes a day. Gradually build up to 10 minutes a day, then 15, then 20.

, Going for regular reflective walks can be an excellent way to get out of your conscious mind and into a more intuitive, sensory state.


Find a quiet, calm place to walk. Many people feel that being close to nature helps connect you to a place that’s “bigger than you,” which helps you become more attuned to the world around you and less fixated on your conscious and rational mind.
As you walk, intentionally turn your attention outward. Focus on what you see, smell, taste, and touch. Try to pick up the smallest sounds you can. Pay close attention to small changes in the landscape. Try to sense the smallest changes in temperature, wind, and pressure.
Keep a notebook in which you record the things you perceive. Take note of what you observe and how you react to those perceptions.

Before getting suspicious of your medium/psychic, remind yourself that their abilities are almost nothing like how the media portrays them.,
Make sure they're asking specific questions, not something that seems 50/50.,
Again, don't give questions out right away, give them time to focus.,
Try to get readings from medium/psychics who work for companies like California Psychics.",How to Find a Legit Psychic," Some are stronger than others. Giving a reading takes focus on a specific person or group to be able to conjure pictures or videos in their head. Example, when a medium/psychic is talking to the dead, they can't see them with their eyes, the ghosts gives off energy and sends pictures to the reader's head. If they have trouble with something like getting a name in their head, it's okay, don't freak out, but don't give them the answer right away, see if they can get it.. If they're close, tell them, and it will help them concentrate better. Again, medium/psychics aren't anything like the media, and they don't get answers off the spot. It takes concentration.;
, When questions are general, and can relate to most people, it's usually a scam. Demand personal questions, otherwise, don't bother coming back to them.

, Usually, people get too excited and answer for the medium/psychic for them! It helps people scam others! Let them give a few guesses, if they're VERY close, like, ""Is your sister's name something like Saya?"" ""No. Sarah."" They're on the right track if they say a very close name on the first try. If they do something like, ""Is your sister's name Jennifer?"" When her name is Sarah, give them a look that says, ""Nope, try again."" Just try not to get too excited about your reading and shout out all of the answers, that's how people give medium/psychics a bad name and get scammed.

, Usually, the company demands a screening before the medium/psychic becomes a member. Also, try to look for a website that allows complaints.

Take care of animals.,
Volunteer.,
Aid your friends, family, and neighbors.",How to Be Spiritual Without Being Religious3," Consider adopting a pet. Or, if that seems like too much of a burden, you can try pet-sitting for a friend. You can also volunteer at a local animal shelter. Simply focusing on another being’s needs can allow you to recognize how important each living thing is.

, Hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices are always looking for help. You are not only being generous by aiding the sick and elderly, but you are also making a significant difference in the world. These concrete actions strengthen your bond to the universe.


Don’t feel limited by the suggestions above. Food pantries, mental health clinics, and community centers are all places that need help as well.

, Speak to your neighbors, and ask if they need help with a project. Help your nephew with his homework. Take your friend out to lunch and ask them about their problems. Figure out if they need help by asking questions like:


You seem stressed out, is there anything I can do?
We haven't talked in a while, do you have time to grab a coffee?
How have you been feeling lately?

Learn how to rely on and recognize intuition.,
Hone your ability to feel empathy.,
Learn how to concentrate.",How to Develop Psychic Abilities2," Intuition is a belief or sense of something that is not anchored to logical reasoning. It’s a gut instinct that transcends logic.Although everyone has intuition, some people are able to develop it more than other people. Work on developing your intuition by trusting it; it’s the gut feelings you get when you first meet someone.Make sure your motives are pure; that will free up psychic tendencies.Pay attention to random thoughts and feelings. Keep a journal handy at all times, and try to write down those thoughts that seem to come out of nowhere. You may notice after a while that patterns tend to emerge. Thoughts that previously seemed completely random and unconnected begin to form themes or recognizable ideas.
Allowing yourself a few minutes to be still upon waking makes it much easier to remember dreams with more detail than if you rush out of bed in the morning and hurry to start the day. Try setting your alarm clock to wake you up ten or fifteen minutes before your normal waking time. Give yourself some time to remember your dreams and make a few quick notes in your journal. The subconscious is more unrestrained during sleep.

, Some people believe that psychics are acutely tuned into other people’s emotions, pain, and energy. They are able to experience those things in other people as if they are their own.


Although people can be born with empathy, people can also acquire empathy. Some people believe that everyone is born with some degree of psychic ability, so this can be developed. Become an expert reader of body language. Psychics learn a lot about a person by being able to read their non-verbal cues. These can provide key predictors of inner feelings.
Psychic healers will sometimes place their hands on another person so they can better perceive their emotions. Protect yourself from negative psychic energy. This is called psychic protection. That means that you are able to protect yourself, or shield yourself from negative energies of other people.

, You need to develop your ability to concentrate if you want to perceive someone else’s thoughts or move objects with your mind. Being able to focus the mind is critical.


Hold a picture for one minute while looking at it. Then close your eyes, and try to reproduce this picture with every detail you can remember in your mind. This visualization technique will help improve your concentration abilities.Use the power of imagination and daydreaming. It's no surprise that children, who are more imaginative, are better able to use their subconscious. These attributes will encourage psychic abilities. "

Learn more about your personal energy field.,
Study the major chakras and work on unblocking them.,
Figure out how to see a person’s aura.,
Get rid of your negative energy.,
Be still and quiet in order to perceive natural energy.",How to Develop Psychic Abilities3," Psychics believe that all people are surrounded by electromagnetic fields that they use to pass energy on at a psychic level. You can use these energies better if you understand what they are.


Auras and chakras are two aspects of your personal energy field. If you understand what they are, you can better control the flow of energy into and out of your body. It can take many years to hone your telepathic abilities. You should try to practice these skills on a daily basis, if possible. Auras are energy fields that surround the body; chakras are the places that energy flows into and out of the body.
You can try to perceive other people’s personal energy fields, and, thus, increase your ability to read the thoughts of other people. Have people draw pictures on cards, and then try to figure out what the person drew without being shown cards.

, Within the body are seven major chakras. These are openings in which energy flows in and out of the body. The top two chakras are mental centers, the four on the front deal with emotions and the four on the back of the body focus on will. The root chakra relates to physical.


If a chakra is blocked, energy doesn’t flow. This can cause illness and suppression of emotion. If chakras are too open, this can lead to overreaction and emotional problems.Imagine that you are opening and closing the third eye, which is the chakra just above and between your actual eyes. Shut your actual eyes, and imagine the third eye opening more., Auras are the energy field emitted by all human beings. They vary in color and intensity. If you learn how to sense a person’s aura, you can better perceive their thoughts.Energy is everywhere, including radiating from the body. Stand about 10 feet away from another person. Have them stand against a plain white or black background.
Look at their nose with relaxed gaze, and use your peripheral vision. The aura will look like a slight fog first. Keep your gaze at the fog. Once you see it, hold the gaze and you should be able to see it. When you blink the aura will probably disappear.

, In order to become sensitive to other people’s feelings and experiences, you need to operate at a higher level energy frequency with your own energy.


Negativity and unhappiness are energy that will cloud your psychic abilities. Think positively as much as you can. Start by grounding yourself. This will help you learn how to control your energy. Stand with your feet apart, and your arms hanging loosely. Bend your knees slightly, and sink your feet into the ground. Mentally move your energy to your feet. Visualize roots extending deep into the ground out of your feet.

, You will want to get out of the clutter of modern life with all of its distractions to perceive energy better.


Keeping away from the rowdiness and activities of noisy distractions can help the mind think more clearly, in terms of developing inner mental accuracy and focus. Drink in the beauty of natural sounds, like the chirping of birds, the babbling of water from a brook, waterfall, etc.
These natural echos are known to enhance intuition and psychic abilities. Remove the distractions of electronic devices - cell phones, television, and even electric lighting can be a barrier to psychic abilities.

Familiarize yourself with the powers you want to develop.,
Practice predicting events.,
Increase your clairsentience by practicing psychometry.Psychometry is the art of reading the energy of an object through touch.The idea behind this is that people, surroundings, and events can leave behind impressions or energies on objects.,
Work on your remote viewing capabilities.Remote scanning is easy to practice.,
Learn the art of scanning.,
Keep a dream journal.",How to Develop Powers1," Focus on developing one or two psychic powers at a time, rather than spreading yourself thin trying to learn a dozen simultaneously. Figure out which mental abilities are the most important to you and work diligently toward achieving them.


Clairvoyance means to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human senses.Empathy means being able to feel deeply the emotions of another person. An empath can channel the emotions of another person.
Clairaudience is the psychic gift of hearing. You can contact spirit guides or angels through your sense of hearing, or tune in to sounds of the universe or the astral plane.
Astral projection is when you can detach yourself from your physical body and move around in reality unseen. Most people achieve it when in a trance or during sleep.
Psychokinesis means to levitate or move things with your mind.;
, At night, take time to write three predictions for the next day. Before you do so, close your eyes and focus. What impressions are you getting? Any gut feelings? What song is running through your head? How do you feel? Who do you see? Is your mood changing?


Do this each day and note the patterns that emerge when you are right and wrong.
Keep detailed notes about your predictions.

, A clairsentient is believed to read these impressions and energies by touching that object. This ability may allow you to sense the characters, surroundings, and events related to a person by holding an object that belongs to them in your hands.


Have a friend blindfold you and then hand you a small object. Ask them to choose items that are used frequently, like keys or jewelry, since these are believed to have a stronger energy around them.
Take the object in your hands, then relax and note any ideas, impressions or feelings you have. Write down everything. No piece of information is insignificant. When you’re done, go over the session with your friend.
Ask them to give you feedback and see if they can provide validation for any of your feelings.

, Choose any location. Determine what you are trying to sense about the location before you begin. Are you looking for a person? Are you trying to see events taking place there? Then focus and picture that place clearly in your mind. Note any thoughts or impressions that came to you as you visualize the location.


When practicing remote viewing, close your eyes and direct your attention upward to your Third Eye, which is located in the middle of your forehead, slightly above eye level.
If possible, try practicing remote viewing with a group, as well. These sessions can become quite powerful in a group situation.

, Every person is believed to have their own energy, which they exude, much like an aura. When you scan someone's energy, you can tune into their frequency and learn things about them by interpreting their energy.It is a skill that psychically sensitive people are believed to have. Practicing scanning can help you develop the skills of an empath.


Try this exercise – find someone, preferably someone you don’t know well, and stand 4 - 6 feet (1.2 - 1.8 m) away from them. Both of you should close your eyes and imagine the other as a ball of energy or light.
As you both imagine this, scan each other's energy, top to bottom, and note any associations you feel – colors, numbers, words, images, or sensations. After a few moments, both of you should open your eyes and discuss what you ""saw.""
Discuss how these “visions” correlate to your lives.

, Leave this journal on your bedside table so that you can write down your dreams as soon as you wake up from them. Each dreamer has a code of symbols they see repeatedly in dreams. Writing down your dreams can help you decipher your code. This is important if you want to astrally project or practice lucid dreaming. In addition to writing down dreams, write down any questions or intriguing thoughts you find yourself having repeatedly.


If you are trying to contact your spirit guides, this may help you tune into them and find answers.
Write down any persistent ideas or images that occur during meditation.

Clean the foot.,
Submerge it in rubbing alcohol.,
Rinse it off.,
Keep the alcohol for next time.,
Put it in a sodium tetraborate mixture.,
Rinse it off and leave it to dry.,
Cap the foot.",How to Cure a Rabbit's Foot," If you have a rabbit’s foot that you have got from a local farmer or from a rabbit that you have shot yourself, you can cure it and use it as a lucky charm. The first step is to thoroughly clean the foot to make sure that all the dirt, blood, and any little parasites in the fur are dealt with.


Wash the foot in a tub of warm water with anti-bacterial liquid hand soap. Make sure you clean it thoroughly.
Once it’s cleaned, rinse it thoroughly to get rid of any soap.
Squeeze out excess water from the foot and leave it dry out a little.;
, The next step is to submerge it in rubbing alcohol and leave it to sit for 48 hours. You should use 70% isopropyl rubbing alcohol.You can buy this online, or from a hardware store or a big supermarket. Place the foot into a jar and then pour in the rubbing alcohol. Make sure the foot is completely submerged in alcohol, and then screw on the lid.


You could also use a zip lock bag instead of jar, but make sure it is secure and there are no leaks.
Note the time and date of when you submerge the foot, and then leave it alone for 48 hours., After 48 hours has passed, return to the foot and remove it from the rubbing alcohol. Give the foot a thorough rinse with water and make sure you have cleaned off any lingering alcohol. Squeezing the feet will help you to get out any alcohol that has seeped deeper into the fur.

, There is no need to throw away the alcohol. If you intend to cure another rabbit’s foot in future, keep hold of the jar of alcohol and use it again. Make sure you label it clearly and keep somewhere safe and secure., Once you have rinsed off the foot, you now need to submerge it in another mixture to complete the process. In the US, it is common to Borax, a detergent booster. This a sodium tetraborate, which will be branded differently depending on where in the world you are. You should be able to find an equivalent in the laundry section of your local supermarket.


In a new jar, zip lock bag, or other container, mix 15 parts warm water to 1 part sodium tetraborate.
Stir the powder into water well, and then place the foot in the solution.
Leave it in the jar of sodium tetraborate solution for 24 hours to give the chemicals time to work on dehydrating the skin and tissues., After a day has passed, remove the foot from the solution and again thoroughly rinse it off, being sure to work out any of the remaining solution from the fur. Wash the foot in warm water until you feel the grittiness of the sodium tetraborate solution has been completely removed.


Rub the foot dry with some paper towel so that there is no excess or dripping water.
Then leave it out to dry completely in the air. You can dry a foot out in the sun or inside.
A foot should dry out in a day or so, and then you will have a cured rabbit’s foot.

, Once the foot has dried off, it will have recovered its fluffiness and softness. To finish it off, or make it ready for a key chain, you will need to cap the foot. You could do with a variety of different things, such as a piece of leather or even an empty shell casing. Glue the foot into whatever you decide to use to cap it, and then leave it dry.If you intend to use it as a key chain, be sure you place a hook or loop through the cap.

, Repeat the chant if necessary until you get a response.

, It's best to start by asking simple yes or no questions. Give the spirit suggestions for communication such as one rap for yes, two raps for no.

,, While it can be startling to actually make a connection, it is important to maintain control of the situation.

, Join hands until the spirit leaves, then either replace the offerings, dim the lights and prepare for a fight, or blow out the candles and end the session for the night.

Meditate.,
Relax.,
Practice being more aware.,
Strengthen your intuition.Intuition is that gut feeling you get about people or situations that you can’t really explain, you just have a hunch about it.",How to Develop Powers2," Any powerful psychic will tell you that meditation is key. It is a discipline that could train your mind to become ultra-aware and tuned into your environment. With a quiet mind, your awareness can be freed and the useless clutter eliminated.At first, your mind may wander and you may get frustrated. Don't worry; meditation does take practice. Keep up your diligence and you will be rewarded.


Find a quiet environment where you won’t be interrupted.
Start off slow with a manageable goal. Practice meditating 10 to 20 minutes per day.
Once you’ve mastered that, increase the duration accordingly.

, The normal state of consciousness works much too quickly for any type of psychic connection to develop. Our brains are constantly sifting through stimuli and only a percentage of what's out there makes it to our awareness. Taking time to relax clears your mind of needless thoughts. It may even allow you to tune into things you wouldn't otherwise be aware of. This will help you develop clairvoyance and clairaudience. It’s also easier to interpret intuitive feelings you get when you’re relaxed.


Incorporate simple ways to reduce stress in your life – sleep 8 hours each day, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.Practicing yoga is known to decrease stress levels and promote relaxation.

, Mindfulness means to continually pay attention to what’s going on at any given moment in an objective way. When you are able to focus on the present, you are able to operate ideally.This can help you achieve psychokinesis. Work on trying to be truly aware as much as possible. Relaxing and meditating can help you a lot with learning mindfulness.


Practice by choosing a few activities you do each day and staying focused on them as you’re doing them. This will help you develop the habit of mindfulness and paying attention.
Focus on senses individually to practice being in the moment. For example, close your eyes and use your ears as your primary sense.
Listen to the small sounds coming from the next room, for instance. Do you hear papers shuffling or fingers typing on a keyboard?, There is no logical explanation for the feeling, but it will usually feel very strong to you. Everyone has intuition on some level. This intuition can be developed through practice and experience.


Developing your intuition can help you have a deeper understanding about the world around you.
Keep detailed notes about intuitive feelings you experience.
As you learn more information about any given thing, see if it lines up with your original intuitive feelings about it.

Learn to see in the dark.,
Exercise and stay fit.,
Practice the elements of Parkour.",How to Develop Powers3," It is possible to train your eyes to adjust more quickly to poorly lit (or unlit) areas. Dedicate 30 minutes each day to training your eyes. Spend time in the darkness so that your eyes become accustomed to making out details in the dark.


Use sunglasses often, even when you don't need them.
Over time, your eyes will acclimate more quickly to darker surroundings.

, To gain physical powers, you’ll need to be dedicated to staying fit. This is an ongoing process in which you are constantly evolving and becoming better. Lift weights to increase your strength. Run often to increase your speed and stamina. Practice yoga to relieve stress and open your mind. Try hiking and rock climbing to train yourself to scale objects.


Don’t start off by overextending yourself. Only do what you are capable of and work up to the harder stuff.
Superhero-like physical abilities will not be developed overnight.
Break yourself of unhealthy habits. For example, if you're a smoker, increasing your stamina, endurance, and overall fitness is going to be a lot more difficult.

, Parkour is an urban sport.Parkourists move about their environment as quickly and efficiently as possible, regardless of obstacles that normal humans would deem unpassable. They propel themselves using only their bodies and surroundings, negotiating obstacles in seconds. They must keep up momentum (to retain efficacy and strength) by running, climbing, jumping, swinging, vaulting, and more.


Parkour is a non-competitive sport.
It teaches you to navigate any environment by being able to see how you can use it to move through it.

Become an expert at detecting lies.,
Persuade others with subconscious techniques.,
Use body language to read auras.",How to Develop Powers4," Detecting lies involves monitoring a person's verbal and non-verbal responses. Look for inappropriate amounts of detail, which can signal lying. Be conscious of their breathing, which will quicken when lying. People who are lying usually avoid making eye contact and will look around at anything except you. They will also fidget and touch their face, throat and/or mouth for no discernible reason.Try practicing with a friend. Explain that you are teaching yourself to detect lying with your psychic abilities.
Do not mention you will be looking for physical signs that they are lying.
Then have your friend tell you a number of things, some of which are true and some that aren't.
Write down your impressions and compare notes with your friend afterward.

, The skill of persuasion is not as unusual as you might think. For instance, a good salesman knows all about persuading people. There are a number of techniques you can employ. One is the concept of obligation and reciprocity. Giving someone something, no matter how small, usually makes them feel obligated to return your kindness. This will often result in you getting what you want.


Start small and work your way up to your actual goal. Begin by requesting innocuous things from your target that most people would probably say “yes” to. This will condition them.
Get them in the habit of saying yes and they will usually find it difficult to start saying no.
Try mimicking your target’s mannerisms, vocalizations and movements very subtly. Then make your request. Note your success rate., Everyone is believed to have an aura.When you meet someone new, you can determine the color of their aura based on how they project themselves. The main colors associated with auras are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The meanings for each color can get very complex:Red can denote a positive ego, but it can also mean anger, anxiety, or nervousness.
Orange can be a sign of creativity and sociability. It can also be a sign of stress or addiction.
Yellow implies optimism, inspiration, and intelligence.
Green refers to health and a love of animals, nature, and people.
Blue means that the person is calm, caring, loving, sensitive, and intuitive.
Violet can be a sign of psychic powers. It can also mean that the person is artistic.

Visualize your way.,
Recognize your spirit guide.,
Make a specific connection.,
Try automatic writing.If you are having trouble connecting with your spirit guide through visualization, or just want to try a different method, you can use automatic writing.,
Write a letter to your guide.Another way to connect with your spirit guide through writing is to address a letter to it.,
Ask questions.Whether visualizing your spirit guide or writing to it, you should feel free to ask it questions.,
Keep a record of your connections.You may enjoy keeping a journal of all the connections you make with your spirit guide, whether through visualization, writing, dreams, meditation, or some other means.,
Create the right environment.You’ll need to be in the right space and mood in order to connect with your spirit guide.,
Breathe.,
Meditate.You can use any of the various meditation techniques to relax and focus your mind and body.,
Try using aids.,
Consult a spiritual advisor.",How to Connect With Your Spirit Guide," When you feel relaxed and ready, you can start by visualizing a journey to meet your spirit guide. Close your eyes, take a few breaths, and begin picturing in your mind whatever imagery suits you. For instance:Imagine yourself climbing a set of stairs. At the top, there is a door. When you open it, you will find a room or space where you can greet your spirit guide. Picture yourself climbing each stair, one at a time, until you are ready to reach the door. Let the staircase be as high as seems right to you.
Imagine yourself rising upwards out of your home, away from your street, into the sky, and into outer space. Picture the stars, moons, and planets that you might see there. Feel for the one that seems like the right place to meet your spirit guide, and go there.
Imagine yourself walking through a dense forest or field of tall grass. Feel your way to a clearing, and picture yourself entering it to meet your spirit guide.
Try connecting with your spirit guide through dream visualization, such as lucid dreaming.;
, Once you have reached the place where you can meet your spirit guide, you should be ready to make a connection with it. Keep in mind that your spirit guide might be someone or something (such as an animal or other creature) that you see, but you might also only hear it, feel it, or just “know” that it is there., When you have found your spirit guide, it will be nice to have a confirmation that it knows you are there and wants to communicate with you. Try:


Asking its name.
Asking for a sign.For instance, your spirit guide might play a melody that is very special to you, or cause you to smell a scent that you like, or say something about you that no one else would know—anything to show that you are connected.
Looking for synchronicities and coincidences that show you are connecting with your spirit guide.For example, perhaps your spirit guide will say a quote that you will read later in the day.

, Get a pen and paper, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and ask your spirit guide to write through you. Keep writing without stopping until you feel the connection has ended for now. Afterwards, analyze what you wrote to see how your spirit guide was communicating with you.


Automatic writing might take the form of recognizable words. However, your automatic writing might also incorporate images, doodles, and even alternate languages and alphabets.
Whatever comes out, don’t filter it as you write. Just let it flow as long as you feel connected.
Use your intuition when trying to interpret your automatic writing.Look for connections to things that interest you, questions you have, and images, phrases, or ideas that keep coming up.
Don’t be surprised if your automatic writing is difficult to interpret or even impenetrable.Be patient if you don’t understand, and see if your spirit guide will help reveal things in time.
Don’t just look for answers to questions you have, or reflections on yourself. Try to understand the character of your spirit guide as it is expressed in the automatic writing. This can help you become closer to your guide.

, Get yourself in the right mental and spiritual state through breathing exercises, meditation, or other means. Then, using paper and a pen, start drafting a letter to your spirit guide.


Once you have finished your letter, you can keep it in a special place (such as a box), or symbolically deliver it to your spirit guide (burn it, throw it in a river, or let the wind carry it away).
Afterwards, look for signs and synchronicities that show your spirit guide has received your letter.

, Remember it is there to guide you, so ask it whatever is on your mind. If you are writing to your spirit guide, you can use two differently colored pens—one to write down your questions, and another for your spirit guide’s answers. Questions you might ask include:


""Who am I?""
""What do I really want?""
“What should I do about X?”
“What changes should I make in my life?”
“What is my purpose in life?”
“What is holding me back?”
“What is the universe made of?”
Any others that are specific to your life, goals, worries, dreams, or interests.

, Record the day and time, how you connected, the messages or signs that you received, how you felt, and anything else you recollect.

, Create a quiet space by cutting out distractions (computers, phones, television, etc.). You can even hang a “do not disturb” sign on your door if you want to be alone. Dimming the lights, wearing comfortable clothes, and lighting incense or candles can also help., Once you have prepared your space and are sitting comfortably in an upright position, start by taking a few slow and deep “grounding breaths.”This will increase your alertness and focus.

, This will help you enter the right mental state to connect with your spirit guide. Try this simple mindfulness meditation exercise as a start to help relax and open your mind:Sit down in a comfortable position, such as on a pillow or mat.
Close your eyes.
Take a few deep breaths, exhaling slowly each time.
Turn your attention to your breathing cycle. Think and feel each time as you breathe in and out.
If your attention wanders, just bring it back to focusing on your breathing.
Keep your mind open. Don’t stop to judge any thoughts that you have.
When you feel that your mind has cleared and you are relaxed, you can try to connect to your spirit guide through visualization or other techniques.
Try meditating for a minimum of 5-10 minutes at least once a day. Don’t get frustrated if you can’t connect with your spirit guide right away. The regular practice of meditation will help to open your mind, if you are patient.

, While you will connect with your spirit guide on a mental and spiritual plane, you may find that certain tangible objects help you reach it.Many believe that certain crystals hold spiritual powers, for instance. Likewise, you may also like to prepare for meeting your spirit guide by starting with a tarot reading.

, Connecting with your personal spirit guide can take time and practice. Often, it requires techniques that go beyond what you can learn from a book or self-study. If you are serious about connecting with your spirit guide, consider working face-to-face with a spiritual advisor.


Spiritual advisors can take a variety of forms, depending on one’s beliefs and practices. You may find help from a guru, priest, shaman, psychic, medium, or similar individuals.You can connect with a spiritual advisor in your area by asking for recommendations from friends or a spiritual center. You may also find some that advertise their services online or in print media.

Relax.,
Listen to your intuition.,
Change up your routine.,
Avoid social media.,
Open your mind to chance opportunities.,
Deal with bad luck.,
Keep your future expectations high.,
Be optimistic.,
Be aware of things that bother you and do something about them.",How to Change Bad Luck," Learn to release tension on a regular basis. Tension keeps you from noticing chance opportunities and experiences.Try to reduce the amount of stress in your life. To release tension, try meditating, going for a walk, or meeting up with friends.


If you feel anxious, figure out what's making you tense. For example, if you're worried about oversleeping and missing the bus for work, make a backup plan. Arrange backup transportation in the event that you do oversleep and then stop stressing about it.;
, By listening to your gut, you're allowing things to happen without trying to rationally control the outcome. This means you're open to chance opportunities and outcomes.


Intuition is just one part of allowing chance to change your luck. You can't completely control events, but you can follow a hunch that might have rewards., One of the biggest things you can do to change your luck is to expose yourself to new, chance opportunities. If you do the same thing everyday, you're limiting those opportunities. Changing your routine can be as simple as changing your route to work, talking to new people, or meeting up with friends at a new venue.Changing your routine may also make you happier, since you're less likely to become bored with a repetitive routine. Random experiences will create new opportunities.

, Constant updates and messages can stress you out, make you feel lonely, and even make you envious. Avoiding social media will prevent you from comparing your luck and life with other people's situations.If you find it difficult to stay off of social media, try being active, enjoying nature, learning something new, listening to music, or exercising., Scientific studies have shown that luckier people have open minds and seek out chance opportunities.Chance opportunities are those random encounters that seem to benefit lucky people.


The good news is that by opening your mind, you're more aware of the chance opportunities.

, Rather than focus on the negative outcome, appreciate any positives. For example, if you got into a car accident and needed costly car repairs, focus on how lucky you were to walk away uninjured. In doing so, you're creating your own good luck, simply by changing your outlook.


On a similar note, be grateful. Some studies have shown that reflecting on things you're grateful for can make you happier and luckier., Consider your dreams and set achievable goals to get you closer to meeting them. These goals will create opportunities and new experiences which are critical for changing your luck.Working toward future goals prevents you from getting stuck in a rut of a routine and exposes you to new people and situations.

, When you're optimistic, you tend to view things positively, even if it's an outcome you don't want. In being optimistic, you can view a negative situation in a positive light.


For example, imagine tripping and breaking your arm. An unlucky person would focus on how bad luck made him fall, while a lucky person would instead think how lucky he was that he broke his non-dominant hand.

, Believe that you have the power to change your situation. Start by addressing what's upsetting you and decide what you need to do to feel better about it. Whether it's financial, a relationship, school, or work, realize that you have the ability to turn the issue around positively.


By changing your problem, realize that you have the power to effect change. You're not subject to the whims of luck or superstition.

Light a chalice.,
We light this chalice,
for the light of truth,
the warmth of love,
and the fire of commitment.,
Close your eyes.,
Center yourself.,
Say a prayer.,
Personalize the prayer.,
Extinguish the chalice.",How to Say a Unitarian Universalist Prayer," While a chalice in UU tradition is a candle in some kind of cup or holder, it doesn't need to be fancy; simply place a little tea candle in a candle holder and light it. Blow out the match, and look at the flame for a few seconds to bring yourself to the present moment. This step is optional, but it's highly recommended. You may speak some words; here's a common example:

,
We light this symbol of our faith,
as we gather together.

, Some people find it easier to calm themselves and concentrate on what's being said, without distractions, by closing their eyes.

, Take a few moments to become centered within yourself. Imagine your soul or life spirit being active in all parts of your body, and then slowly calming and coming together at your heart. Some Unitarian Universalists may hit a gong and raise their hands. As the sound slowly drifts, they lower their hands. Consider doing this especially if you have trouble feeling centered.

, There are possibilities from literature as well as sacred texts - Unitarian Universalism draws from many sources. You can find many prayers by Unitarian Universalists at Worship Web.

, Add whatever wishes or concerns are on your heart and mind, either silently or aloud, for example, ""I send my positive thoughts to Uncle Joe during his surgery and ask for a quick and full recovery."" If you don't know who you're praying to, don't fret, you're in the same boat as many UUs. If the prayer is heard and answered by an external power, that is good. If the prayer just makes you feel more peaceful and connected to the life spirit of the universe, that's good too.

, Unitarian Universalists often will not blow out a ritual candle, but rather will use a candle-extinguisher -- a bell-shaped, inverse metal cup that hangs down from a handle to cover the flame. But nobody's going to ""get"" you if you blow it out with a puff of breath! If someone recited the prayer with you, you may choose to blow out the candle together. Enjoy watching the drifting smoke.

, Lucky charms should be something that you feel close to. This should be an object that has personal significance and connection to your own history.

The feathers below the net of the dream catcher are said to filter the good dreams down to the dreamer.

Humans have a history of making up convenient explanations for things unknown.,
Explain that 'intelligent design' (a pseudoscientific term used by creationists) is just the awe of new experience or of overwhelming complexity.,
Clearly define faith or belief: some people have faith that there is a god.,
Point out that there are many gods.,
Recognize that religions, abstract from their gods, are important as social institutions.,
Clarify that to give up on a god does not mean you give up on morals.,
Ask ""Where did the god come from?""",How to Explain or Defend Atheism," For example, some had thought the sun to be a living god; others believed (and a very small number still do) the earth to be flat and the center of the universe. In short, explanations based on gods and heaven have been steadily replaced as new knowledge is gained. History suggests that remaining mysteries will be sufficiently explained in terms of familiar and rational forces rather than by supernatural ones. For example, many people believe that a superior being created life, while atheists believe that this is just another scientific phenomenon to which people have assigned a supernatural explanation. People once believed that it was a choice between blind chance and a god creating living organisms; therefore, most educated people saw a need for a god. We now know that the random process of DNA mutation is coupled with the nonrandom process of natural selection. An atheist might want to point out that the scientific consensus is that the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution account for the beginning of the universe and the origin and diversity of life. While this does not rule out the possibility of a god's guiding the development of life, it does show that a god is not needed as an explanation for the origin of life.;
, It is a poor argument for a god. It is an argument from ignorance, a god-of-the-gaps argument, and as the gaps are filled, the god is gradually removed from the picture. If a caveman were handed a modern camera, he would not guess that it was a result of step-by-step gains in knowledge over a very long time. It would seem inexplicable, magical, perhaps supernatural. 'The gods must have made it' may be a natural thought, but it would be wrong. While a caveman might imagine that a god created the camera out of nothing (poof!), the camera would have been created through a number of steps, out of simpler parts. Living organisms are also made of many parts that developed gradually through evolution. A creationist may try to claim that the eye is an example of irreducible complexity (see Argue Against Evolution of Eyesight), but unlike evolutionary biologists who have an explanation, creationists do not explain the mechanism that a god would use to create an eye.

, For some people, the existence of a god is a given (it can be automatically accepted), like the fact that the sun will rise tomorrow. This is a philosophical belief and is (as yet) untestable by science. An example of another philosophical belief not testable by science is the belief that we are living in a world created by a supercomputer to deceive our five senses (like in The Matrix). Since we use our senses to observe the world around us and to do science, there is no way for science to investigate such a belief. So far, all phenomena that have been explained (e.g., lightning, diseases, the origin of the universe and life) have had natural explanations rather than supernatural one. So far, a supernatural explanation has never won out. Supporting a supernatural explanation may be possible, but it would be extremely difficult, as all natural explanations would have to be first excluded. An atheist does not have faith in a god like some other people. An atheist argues that one must have a reason to believe in something before considering it.

, Which god should a person believe in? You, as an atheist, just believe in one god less than a religious person.

, People clearly have an innate affinity for stories, akin to the popularity of movies, plays, legends, novels and ballads. Our willingness to believe in well-told stories (even supernatural ones) is a trait of human psychology. Religions influence behavior through scripture and tradition presented with or without explanations. Evolutionary biologists have suggested that religion is either a result of the sophisticated human brain or was selected for due to a beneficial effect, such as promoting cooperation among people.

, Atheists simply accept responsibility for the moral code by which they live their lives. If you are feeling confrontational, contrast this sharply to the practice of accepting the moral code of the Bible.

, in response to ""Where did the universe come from?"" The main reason for positing a God is to explain where did life and the universe originate because they seem designed but positing a God just pushes the questions further away because how do we explain the existence of this God that just happens to have all of the power and answers - it is just as difficult and substitutes one problem for another and leads to an infinite regress. This line of thinking is of the sort of a hypothetical person happening upon a sandcastle on a beach and thinking that it would be silly to think that the waves built it - it must have been a person - but alas who built the person? If a deity of unfathomable knowledge and power could just happen or just exist then why not take it a step back and consider that perhaps a Universe of unfathomable beauty and complexity just happened?

The first step to praying without ceasing is to memorize the Lord's prayer and study what each verse in Mathew 6:9-14 means.,

Understand what religion is.,
Before opening a discussion about religion ensure you have a good understanding of how organized religion works.,
Purchase books and reference material for research; Books like God is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens, The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon by Daniel Dennett, and others.,
Understand some of the basic arguments against organized religion.,
Be aware that there are a number of positive contributions made to society by religion.",How to Discuss the Negative Aspects of Religion1," Religion is a system that establishes symbols, narratives, and traditions that relate humanity to spirituality and moral values. The word religion is often used interchangeably with faith or belief in God, but religion differs from personal belief in that it has a public aspect.


Basic belief in the God of Abraham would be theism. Catholicism would be the religion.;
, At the very least you should have an understanding of the main Christian religious ideologies (Catholicism, Presbyterianism/Protestantism, Immersionism) and hold an understanding of Islam and Judaism as these are the most discussed religions.

, Having an understanding of the history of various religions and counter arguments to points about morality is important.

,



General Religion:


Lack of personal thought: When you subscribe to a religion, you substitute group-think for focused, independent thought. Instead of learning to discern truth on your own and formulate your own beliefs, you’re told what to believe.

Fixed perspective: By saying “I am a Catholic” or “I am a Buddhist” you rob yourself of spiritual depth perception and attach blinders that do not allow you to see all realities.

Lack of power: Religions are authoritarian hierarchies where power is heaviest at the top and lightest at the bottom where the majority of believers are. Religions are very good at turning human beings into sheep. They operate by eroding your trust in your own intellect and gradually convince you to put your trust into some external entity, such as a deity, or great book, convincing you that without these you would be lost.

Wasted time: Religions often dictate that you have to pray, attend church, and read religious texts regularly. Some people take this even further with memorization of religious texts or other wastes of time.

Forgo intelligence or become a hypocrite: When you subscribe to an organized religion, you have only two options: You can forgo intelligence, or you can become a hypocrite. You either willingly believe every piece of drivel fed to you by the religion (for example, believing that the earth is only 6,000 years old) or you can recognize that many parts of religion are nonsense but believe it to be infallible all the same.

Where you're born has a lot to do with your religion: Born in North America? Chances are you follow a Judo-Christian religion. Born in India? Maybe you're a Hindu. Born in Tibet? Could be a Buddhist. If you were born somewhere else, to some different set of circumstances do you think you still would have found your way to your religion? Or are your current beliefs really just a by-product of your environment and not a conscious choice you made.

Religion rules with fear: Fear of hell, fear of excommunication, fear of disappointing one's parents, fear of abandoning the community, fear of being different. When you practice organized religion instead of conscious decision making, you live under a constant fear. Eventually you forget it's even there.



Islam:


Violence: Although the majority of adherents are peaceful, those who do choose to commit acts of violence and terror in the name of Allah will find ample justification for their actions in the Qur'an and the sayings and examples of the prophet Muhammad. Human rights issues: The greatest obstacle to human rights under Political Islam is its strong adherence to Sharia law. Many aspects of the Sharia are at odds to the ideas enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In an Islamist state no individual or group can have any rights that do not conform to the tenets of the Sharia. Death for Apostates: ""Apostasy in Islam (Arabic: ارتداد, irtidād or ridda‎) is commonly defined in Islam as the rejection in word or deed of their former religion (apostasy) by a person who was previously a follower of Islam.""Freedom of belief is enshrined in Islamic texts however there is disagreement among Muslim scholars as to the limits of that freedom. For example, Afghan Abdul Rahman, who converted to Christianity, faced the death penalty for his apostasy and it was not an isolated incident. Women's Rights: Muslim proponents never tire of telling everyone that will listen that Islam has given more rights to women than any other religion. Certainly, if by ""Islam"" they mean ""Qur'anic Islam"" the rights that it has given to women are impressive.However,Islamic Law is not derived solely from the Quran and many of Muhammad's extra-Quranic sayings (the Hadith) appear to curtail women's Human Rights severely.For example, Muslims who practice female genital mutilation cite authentic ahadith to support the practice (Muhammad encouraged it as he believed it was 'more pleasurable for the husband').Furthermore,A review of Muslim history will bring to light many areas in which - Qur'anic teaching aside - women continue to be subjected to diverse forms of oppression. Muslim societies, in general, appear to be far more concerned with trying to control women's bodies and sexuality than with their human rights. Judaism:

Other:

Mormonism:

Restorationist (Christian primitivism): (Jehovah's Witnesses)



, Religion enhances local communities in which human relationships can flourish, religious communities make massive contributions through deeds of charity and social action, and religion can give people a sense of community and make people feel welcome.

, Telling your parents can be harder on teens than on adults whom have already moved out. Be prepared to lose friends. If your parents are very religious then it may not be a good idea to tell them. However sometimes not telling anyone is a cause of distress, if this is true for you it is probably better to tell them. A lot of the time your parents and/or friends will take it better than you expected!

, Take time to learn about how the universe works via science. A lot of the time the universe will seem more spectacular when you are an atheist.

There is no process or initiation for becoming an atheist (except possibly a ""coming out"" to others). If you can honestly think, ""I don't believe there is a god/gods,"" you are already an atheist.;
,
Consider the following examples:


A stranger comes to your door and tells you that your child has been killed in a car accident outside their school.

You would feel a pang of emotion, but this is a stranger. Do you believe them? Do they know who your child is? Is this some sort of cruel joke? Do you really believe that your child has been killed? You will be inclined to harbor some strong doubts.


Two police officers come to your door, squad car in the driveway. They tell you your child has been killed. They need you to come with them to identify the body.

You will in all likelihood believe them, they are police officers. You will feel the emotion as though you know for a fact that your child is dead. It will be real to you.


You should notice that the difference between these two examples is the authority of the messenger, not the message itself. These examples are also chosen for their emotional content, because the emotional content is a large part of what makes a situation real to us.
The point is, whether we believe something based on authority, or emotion, or both, we cannot know it is true until we see with our own eyes. The highest authority you can imagine could tell you the simplest thing, and you may believe them, and they may believe themselves, but that does not in any way make it true.

,
The difference between belief in a scientific theory as opposed to belief in a religious dogma, boils down to the difference between the institution of science and the institutions of various religions.
The underlying concept in religious institutions is that the nature of reality is known. The nature of reality is written in a book or scroll. This writing was originally done, or dictated, or inspired, by a god. Religious institutions are primarily concerned with spreading information about the ""known"" nature of reality, because in their understanding of reality, that is what they are required to do. Religious ""facts"" are not subject to testing, and in most cases cannot be tested. Religious ""facts"" are supported by evidence that is open to interpretation, or no evidence at all. Religious ""facts"" are not reviewed by all religions to reach a consensus.
The underlying concept in the institution of science is that the nature of reality is unknown. The institution of science is primarily concerned with discovering the nature of reality without making assumptions. Scientific theories must, by definition, be testable (falsifiable). Theories must be published for review by other scientists with the intention of reaching a consensus. Accepted theories are supported by evidence that is not open to interpretation, or is consistently interpreted by qualified scientists. If evidence is found that contradicts a theory, the theory will be abandoned.
One believes in a scientific authority, because they derive their authority from the review process, and because they have an interest in discovering truth. One believes in a religious authority, because they have been given authority by their superiors, who in turn get their authority from their subordinates. Religion has no interest in discovering truth because the ""facts"" are already known.

, People throughout history have looked critically at their religious beliefs and found fault. If you have issues and problems, then look at them honestly, with the notion that you will not be punished for trying to find what you truly believe. If your beliefs are valid, then they will stand up to scrutiny.
Most of the religions that have ever been, have gone extinct. You would be hard pressed to find people worshiping Thor or Quetzalcoatl. Take a hard look at why you don't believe in Thor, or Rah, or Zeus. Would you be Islamic, Christian, or Jewish if you where raised in Iran, Mississippi, or Israel?

, You don't need a god/gods to be moral. Atheists are not unethical. Like many theists, many atheists donate to charity and live lives that are morally similar to those of theists. Atheists just might have different motivations for doing so.
With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.
-Steven Weinberg

,


An atheist does not believe that a god/gods do exist. Most atheists observe that there is no proof that a god/gods exist. Because there is no verifiable evidence that a god/gods exist, they do not incorporate a god/gods into their decision making. Agnostics do not believe it is possible to know of the existence of a god or gods.
You do not have to be anti-religion. Most atheists, however, do disapprove of organized religion as well as the doctrine of faith as a virtue. There are others who still attend religious services for their own reasons, such as an agreement with some of the moral tenets, membership in a community, or even just a fondness for the music.
You do not have to write off the possibility of unverified or unverifiable phenomena. You can acknowledge that they are possible without insisting or acting as if they are true, or trying to convince others that they are true.
You do not have to subscribe to any set of beliefs. Atheism is not a religion. Atheists hold a wide variety of beliefs and outlooks, the only similarity being a lack of belief in a god or gods.

, Culture, tradition, and tribal loyalty are important to many people, including atheists. By denying belief in a god/gods, one need not totally dissociate oneself with the culture associated with his or her former religion. Virtually every northern hemispheric culture celebrates a winter solstice holiday. A possible explanation for this is the lack of agrarian work to be performed and the abundance of food stores for the dearth winter months ahead. Such a celebration can be, and is in many cases, still important to an atheist for its intrinsic values -- those of sharing and community, among others. Formerly Christian atheists still exchange gifts with their theist friends, put up Christmas trees, and gather with family and friends during Christmastime, without any religious connotation necessary. The same can be said of those formerly of other faiths or never of any faith.

, The Scientific Method is universally accepted as the best way to understand the world.

, This will help you understand why people believe what they do and help you understand your atheism in that context.

, While most atheists argue that theists are making a positive assertion (and thus bear the burden of proof), it is important to thoroughly understand your former faith and its tenets as well as those of other faiths. The more versed you are in other religions and the more you understand why people believe what they do, the better basis you'll have for your worldview. Also, it will help you fend off those that will try to convert you to their religion, once they learn of your atheism.

, Do not be shy, but don't be condescending. Try to help them understand your point of view in a non-confrontational manner. However, you may choose to hide your perspective if it is clear you are going to run into trouble. In some countries or regions, the price of atheism can be very high.

Spend time with other atheists.",How to Deal with Religious People if You Are an Atheist1," You should never feel like you have to lie or pretend about what you believe (or don’t). If you’re asked about your religious beliefs, be honest. However, you also don’t need to be a walking advertisement for atheism at all times either.If you’re in a room full of believers, think carefully before steering the conversation towards your lack of belief. There’s nothing wrong with sitting quietly sometimes, and it never hurts to listen to others talk about what they believe.
We all have to sometimes listen to people talk about subjects we don’t care for or don’t understand — hockey, poetry, auto repair, or whatever it may be. Just “sit it out” and wait for the subject to change.;
, Instead of sitting back and hoping the conversation doesn’t turn toward religion, or waiting for it to pass on to another subject if it does, you can work to steer the conversation towards topics that may be more comfortable for everyone involved.


Consider the audience, and bring up topics that are likely to be of general interest. It may seem trite to discuss sports or the weather at Thanksgiving dinner, but it’s probably preferable to a knock-down, drag-out fight over deeply-held religious beliefs. Even politics may be a less contentious topic to bring up.For example, if your religious friends start to discuss their church activities try saying, “That’s great you’re so involved in your church. What other activities do you enjoy doing outside of church? I’ve been trying to find some new activities to do.” This is likely to shift the conversation to jet-skiing, stamp collecting, volunteering at an animal shelter, etc.

, As an atheist, there will be times when you will feel you need to stand up for what you believe — be it the teaching of creationism in public schools or prayers before city council meetings. It’s okay to decide that every little thing isn’t worth fighting for, though — like choosing to simply sit quietly during a prayer before a group meal. You have to decide for yourself when to “let things go.”If someone happens to complain that you aren’t bowing your head during the prayer or showing the proper reverence in some other setting, calmly offer to discuss the topic privately later.
If, for instance, you are at Thanksgiving dinner and are asked to give some sort of blessing or say what you are thankful for, you can do so without invoking any god or religion. Say something like “I am thankful for the people who grew this food, those who provided it, and those who prepared it. I am thankful that we can all be together now to enjoy it, and each other’s company.”

, While it’s healthy, instructive, and usually necessary to spend a good bit of time around religious people, it’s also alright to seek out the comfort of being around others whose perspectives align more with your own. With a little searching, you’ll probably find a welcoming community of fellow atheists.


Atheists make up about 3% of the U.S. population; however, within your community, it may seem as if you’re alone, particularly if you live in a small town. Try finding support online.Check out the websites for American Atheists, American Humanist Association, or similar groups in your area or nation. They may have local get-togethers or events."

Stay calm and don’t get defensive.,
Don't try to force your point of view on others.,
Agree to disagree.,
Don’t argue with someone trying to convert you to their religious beliefs.,
Walk away when a calm discussion is not possible.",How to Deal with Religious People if You Are an Atheist2," Instead of reacting defensively when someone attacks your point of view, take a moment to collect your thoughts. Determine what you want to say before you say it.Remember, you don’t have to defend your point of view to anyone. Your views are equally right and important.
Use “I” statements. This will help to diffuse a potentially bad situation. For example, “I am feeling attacked right now. I would appreciate it if I could have a moment to collect my thoughts.”, Even if you are resentful because you feel like religion is often forced upon you, don’t stoop to the same level. If “bullying” tactics don’t work in convincing you that you should be religious, don’t expect the reverse to work with others.If you are resentful towards religion, consider that much of your resentment probably stems from people attempting to force their beliefs on you.
Think of how you’d like to be treated if the situation was reversed.
Allow others the opportunity to speak. Otherwise, you’ll come across as aggressive, which will likely lead to conflict.

, Don’t try to determine whose point of view is right, especially when dealing with something as deeply personal as religious belief. Attempting to resolve who is right and who is wrong will only prove futile. Focus on explaining what you believe and why in a calm, reasoned manner.If you’ve been going back and forth, put an end to the conversation, at least for the time being. You may want to say, “It seems like we’ve been going back and forth on this issue for awhile. I respect your opinion and I hope you can respect mine, but I think we should agree to disagree.” Don’t bring up the subject again unless there is new information to cover.
Remember, everyone, regardless of their beliefs, assumes they are right. You’re not going to convince someone otherwise in one conversation., Having a lively discussion with someone who hopes to convert you can help to clarify your thoughts and learn more about others' beliefs. Getting into a heated debate or outright argument with someone who is never going to budge, however, won’t achieve anything positive.Give them an opportunity to speak. Once they have finished their thought, thank them for their time. Give a measured, calm response, or none at all if you so choose.
If the person is a friend let them know you value their friendship, but feel uncomfortable by them trying to convert you. If they keep trying to convert you, you may need to reconsider the friendship.
If the person shows up at your door, don’t just slam it in their face. Let them say what they came to say, take any materials they offer you and thank them for their time.

, If things get too heated, simply walk away. There is no shame in leaving a conversation that isn’t going anywhere. You can always choose to resume the discussion at another time if you choose, but you need not do so if you see no point in trying again.Let them know you’re ending the conversation. You can say “I am feeling disrespected right now and am going to take myself out of this situation.”
Walk away and give yourself some time to cool down.
If you think of another point you’d like to make, don’t put yourself back into a bad situation. Send an email or ask if you can discuss the topic with the person at a later time.

Do your homework.,
Define what atheism means to you.,
Ask questions and listen to answers with curiosity and respect.,
Avoid taking cheap shots.,
Be open to learning something new.",How to Deal with Religious People if You Are an Atheist3," It is very difficult for a constructive dialogue to take place if there is no common ground of understanding between the two parties. Before engaging in a conversation with a religious person, educate yourself on the basics of their beliefs.Especially if you are very unfamiliar with the person’s religion, search online, read articles, consult books, and consider taking a look at the faith’s sacred text(s). This will help you better understand where the other person is coming from, and will help you to generate questions about their faith.It is completely fair for you to expect the same of the other person. Offer to recommend some key atheist works that speak to your point of view, and ask the person to consult them to facilitate your discussion. You can always delay and resume the conversation at another time., Before you can explain to others what it means to be an atheist, you need to be able to explain it to yourself. You don’t have to use a textbook definition of atheism — there is no single “atheist” view, just as there is no single “Christian” or “Hindu” view. Come up with a definition that works for you.Before you begin the conversation, ask if the person understands what an atheist is. You may want to say, “I’m looking forward to talking with you about atheism. Before we start, why don’t you tell me what you know about it.”
If they don’t know anything about atheism, or assume that it means you believe in nothing or are satanic in some way, don’t criticize them for it. Instead, quickly provide them with some basic information about atheism. You can start the conversation by saying, “Why don’t I tell you a little bit more about atheism, so you know where I’m coming from.”
If necessary, provide some source recommendations for the other person to consult and request that you resume the conversation at another time.

, Make an effort to understand the other point of view by listening and asking questions. This will show that you are engaged in the discussion. If you don’t have specific questions, ask open ended ones such as, “Tell me more about your beliefs” or “How did you come to believe what you do?”


Listen when they respond. Make eye contact and focus on what the person is saying. Now is not the time to be planning your next question or trying to look up something on your phone.Don’t ask questions that are purposely leading and antagonistic. For example, refrain from saying something like, “What makes you think your religion is so much better than others?” Instead, try asking, “What aspects of your religion set it apart from others?” This is a nicer way of asking the same question.

, You may think the other person’s belief system is ridiculous, but offering ridicule will get you nowhere positive. Just because you may have read somewhere that there is a negative correlation between IQ and religiosity (that is, that less intelligent people tend to be more religious) doesn’t mean you should make generalized assumptions or critical remarks about the other person being “foolish” or “delusional.” Offer respect if you want to be given respect.Steer clear of open-ended or hostile questions that won’t move the conversation along. For example, refrain from asking, “Why are Christians so crazy?” You’re not only generalizing, but you’re backing the person into a corner, as they couldn’t possibly begin to answer your question.
Don’t blame the person for all the evils you believe have been done in the name of that religion. You don’t want to be blamed for all the evils done by those who rejected religion, do you? You can ask, however, how their religion reconciles evil acts done under the guise of the faith.

, Don’t just say you’re open to learning something new; mean what you say. In learning more about other faiths, you’ll only broaden your own worldview. If your beliefs will be threatened by knowledge, then maybe they ought to be reconsidered anyway.


An atheist should be someone who is open to asking questions and seeking answers. Like a good scientist, an atheist should never be afraid of being proven wrong. Truth should be your ultimate goal.If the person invites you to a religious service, agree to go as a respectful observer. You don’t have to convert to their religion or share their beliefs, but you will certainly learn something new. You in turn can invite them to a gathering of others like you.

Rise above rhetoric.,

Reach a happy ending.",How to Deal With Ignorance with Regard to Atheism," Ignorance is a lack of knowledge. Being ignorant does not mean intentions are malevolent. See an encounter with an ignorant person as an opportunity to educate and open a meaningful dialogue; bringing with it mutual respect and understanding.;
, Though most of the 40,000 religions throughout recorded human history are built on the same premises merely dressed differently; it's important to know exactly what the people you are dealing with actually believe. Read about all the major religions, and investigate whatever ""reasons"" the followers of these particular religions use to justify their beliefs. This will not only enhance your performance in a debate, but squelch any ignorance and misconceptions you yourself hold.

, Atheism is not a dogmatic institution. You clearly have your reasons as I do for being atheist. Nor is atheism a belief, it is merely a lack of belief. Ask a theist why they do not believe in ""Helios"" or ""Omniscient Shoe Soles on Saturn"", or why they are a follower of one religion over another. Describe why a ""possibility"" does not equal a reality. Explain that the reason they don't believe in pixies, unicorns, Helios and a god of another religion is the same reason you don't believe in their ""god"".

, A lot of theists pride themselves on their ability to have ""faith""; euphemism for ""believing in something you have no reason to"". Explain how the universe can be explained without ""God"" and why God is not a necessary entity. Explain how reason is the way a human brain works naturally, and stepping out of this constraint and residing independent of what you can observe is absurd.

, Most of the religions in circulation today have archaic roots. It only takes a look up at the night's sky to realise the scale of the universe. Our planet is not even a mote of dust in all this, and we have some people arrogant enough to propose they know the meaning (should there even be any) of it all despite the fact that all human understanding is taken from this mote of dust. Explain that you humbly accept our relative ignorance as a species (on a scale of the entire universe), and choose to contribute to the objective search for a real answer through scientific inquiry, reason, logic and humanistic ideals.

, It's possible that the person will resort to flinging claims out that appraise their cycle of faith. Accusations such as you being ""the devil"" or corrupting may pop up. If it gets too heavy, bring the conversation down a notch and calmly detail the fallacies with their accusation. Do not get angry or resort to insults.

, Your goal should not be to deconvert the theist. Your intention should only be to educate them with regard to why you are atheist. In some societies, atheism is an enigma - largely unheard of and unjustly vilified in isolation from the larger world. It's hard to deal with a person who's only seen one way of life. Take it easy.

, For some people, ignorance is comforting and they will choose to reside in it. They will assert that you are a Satanist or an enemy of ""God"" or make ridiculous generalizations they are sure of. If you discern a person like this, just leave them be because you are wasting your time.

, Ideally, you will both learn a bit about each other's position and come to some degree of tolerance. Take note, you don't have to ""respect"" each others belief/lack of belief; it's merely important that you tolerate and accept that you hold different positions. Don't treat such an encounter as a means to an end, and don't feel disappointed if you don't fully agree with each other by the end.

Consider what it means to be an atheist.,
Be skeptical of things that you cannot directly perceive.,
Decide whether you are atheistic or agnostic.,
Do not feel that you need to be anti-religion to live without religion.,
Don't believe in a deity.,
Ask questions about the nature of being.,
Establish your own moral code.,
Understand that atheism need not completely define your ideology.,
Consider which elements of religion, if any, you want in your life.,
Respect the beliefs of others.,
Don't try to convert people to atheism.,
Empathize.,
Be ready to explain your beliefs.",How to Be an Atheist," Atheism is the lack of belief in a particular deity or higher spiritual power. Theism denotes belief in a deity — so atheism is literally the absence of that.


Being atheistic commonly (but not always) includes disregarding traditional religious spirituality and practice in favor of a more materialistic, rationalistic, and often humanistic conception of the universe and ""being"".
Most atheists embrace the idea of materialism, in the philosophical sense: that nothing exists beyond the physical matter that includes your being. Materialists believe that you have this life, and this life alone. Don't mistake it for the colloquial meaning of materialism, which means being preoccupied with acquiring physical things.
Some people mistakenly link atheism with satanism, since they both reject God. This is not true, however, as satanism comes with a whole set of beliefs and rituals. Atheism is, by definition, the lack of any religious beliefs or rituals.;
, If you are a skeptic, it means that you demand evidence before believing something, and that you only believe things when a scientific consensus indicates sufficient evidence. Many atheists and agnostics consider themselves skeptics.

, Gnosticism indicates a state of certainty, while agnosticism is the belief that one cannot know for sure. You may be agnostic if you do not have a yes or no answer to the question of whether God exists. You do not have to write off the possibility of unverified or unverifiable phenomena. You can acknowledge that they are possible without insisting or acting as if they are true, or trying to convince others that they are true.A gnostic theist is completely certain that there is a god or gods.
A gnostic atheist is completely certain that there is no god or gods.
An agnostic theist believes there is a god or gods, but doesn't claim to know it with certainty.
An agnostic atheist believes there is no god, nor gods, but doesn't claim to know it with certainty.

, Some atheists love to advertise their opinions and publicly debate believers, while other atheists prefer to live peaceably within their means. You have the right to live out your atheism in whichever way feels true to yourself—but be aware of the consequences of your actions. Perhaps you will change someone's life and belief system for the better by debating their faith, or perhaps you will come across as intolerant.

, That simple. No prayer, no worship. Consider your stance on the following statements:


Evolution exists, and events occur based on coincidence and happenstance.
No man in the sky dictates your actions or the events around you.
Fate and destiny are myths.
Many atheists are still open to possibilities and acknowledge that there is a lot left to discover. For example, there was a time that we couldn't see germs and science had not even conceived of their existence: that did not mean they didn't exist, only that their existence had not yet been discovered and scientifically validated. Rational atheists are open to new scientific discoveries but reject God as an explanation for things they don't understand.

, With regards to mortality, most religions offer explanations that can be described as metaphysically dualistic: that there exist two distinct spiritual realities, not necessarily conforming to each other's laws of time and space — e.g. Heaven and Earth.


Materialism can leave some people feeling empty and spiritually ungrounded. However, atheism does not have to be such a bleak affair! Thinkers such as Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Sartre pioneered the Existentialism movement in the early 1900s, readdressing the spiritual void left by atheism and capitalist industrial society. They presented a new way of looking at the human being — as an animal that transcends his/her animality through the capacity for free will.
Consider that the essence of ""being"" can lie in making your own choices, respecting the choices of others, and avoiding being consumed by unwanted routines and commitments. Purposeful being can consist of transcending, innovating, and breaking the rules. The essence of your existence is the ability to decide who and what you want to be. You are free!

, You probably have a reasonable concept of right and wrong: you know when you've made a mistake. You don't need to ask your deity to forgive you — you can learn from your mistakes and grow as a person.


Consider that you dictate your own morals. Your own practice and skills determine your success. Everything is on you. It's up to you to decide what is immoral, and act appropriately.
Morals may stem from ancient human interactions. The ability to treat others well paves the way for trust between members of a group, and trust allows humans to accomplish complex collaborative tasks. Instead of one person going to hunt for food alone, since he or she cannot trust others, a proven record of trust allows a group to make a hunt far easier.

, You do not have to subscribe to any set of beliefs. Atheism is not dogma — it is a way to practice thinking for yourself. Atheists hold a wide variety of beliefs and outlooks, though the main overarching similarity is a lack of belief in a god or gods.


Many atheists are secular humanists who believe in charity and helping others. On the other hand, many atheists are individualist objectivists who believe in fighting for individual goals. Some atheists are left-wing liberals, and others are right-wing free market advocates. There are many different ways in which you can build your ideology, and atheism is merely one part of it.
The one thing that all atheists have in common is a disbelief in deities. Most atheists believe that the universe is ruled by purely natural laws — that no supernatural force from beyond this plane sets events into motion. Beyond this, you're free to decide which ideas are important and relevant to your life.

, Perhaps you cannot bring yourself to believe in an omnipotent God, but you love listening to uplifting gospel music. Perhaps you do not want to live by a set of religious codes, but you still draw guidance and inspiration from scripture. At the end of the day, you are free to define yourself in any way that feels true. Being an atheist does not necessarily mean rejecting your roots, but rather considering which beliefs, if any, are worth absorbing.


Being an atheist can be tough, depending on where you live. You may deny beliefs which have been passed down through centuries, and with which a majority of population agrees. If you are having trouble reconciling your atheism with your friends, family, and culture, try to find common ground—moral, philosophical, ideological—between yourself and those who share your roots.
It is okay to be uncertain if you do not feel ready to define yourself in such certain terms as ""theist"" or ""atheist"". Take the time to think through your questions and come up with answers that bring you peace.

, Let your rationality guide you, but do not let it lead you astray. Following a religion does not make anyone superior, nor does your atheism make you superior to anyone. Atheism has no dogma. Don't be fanatical when discussing your beliefs with others, and try not to be pretentious. It's fine to be passionate about your beliefs, but there is no need to dismiss people for their methods of creating meaning.


An atheist respecting the beliefs of religious people is no different than a Jewish person respecting a Catholic's views. Remember that their views cannot be proved or disproved.
If someone attacks with their opinions, you have every right to defend your decision. Consider, however, whether it will help either of you to argue about your difference in belief. Consider whether either of you is actually going to change his or her stance on the subject.

, Atheism is not a religion, it's the absence of any religion. Trying to proselytize or get people to change their minds about their beliefs makes you just as evangelistic as a religious person. Do not force your beliefs onto anyone. Not only will people be less likely to listen to aggressive, dismissive rhetoric—but you will risk falling into the same pattern of dogmatically-skewed logic that many atheists claim to eschew.If someone is going to lose their religion, they will walk that path in their own time and through their own questioning. Ask yourself whether it is your place or prerogative to move the process along.

, Try to see the similarities, rather than the differences, between yourself and religious people. The world is filled with kind, brilliant theists as well as kind, brilliant atheists. We are all human, and we are all trying to make sense of our existence. Consider your own search for existential meaning—perhaps through your exploration of atheism, and perhaps through other channels—and try to imagine how a religious person may have found similar peace through their own unique search., Learn how to explain why you are atheist, in case people ask. Atheism is often misunderstood, and you may get questions from curious people. Be as polite and informative as possible, and answer their questions as well as you can. Explain that it is not a belief, but a conclusion that you have come to based on the available evidence in the world.


If you are probed further about your atheism, it would be smart to bring up Bertrand Russell's Celestial Teapot idea, and explain that it does not make sense to you to believe in something simply because mankind lacks the evidence to disprove its existence.
Open yourself up to a rational, two-way discussion. Treat other people—religious or otherwise—as intelligent human beings who are worthy of your respect.

Decide what to tell them.,
Respect them.,
Don't push your atheism.,
Be yourself.,
See if you can find any other atheists in the community.",How to Be an Atheist in a Christian Home," This is a big decision, and it depends on your situation. If you are unable to live on your own, then it can be risky to tell your parents that you are an atheist. Some parents react very badly, and you will have to deal with them until you are old to be independent of them. So, you should seriously weigh the risks and benefits of coming out as an atheist at home. You have to determine, for yourself, what their reaction will be to you being an atheist.


If you do wish to tell them, you might start testing the waters by asking their opinion on religion influenced issues such as abortion, gay marriage, or other political stances. See how they react to your opinions. If they react harshly, they will probably be more harsh in response to you being an atheist.
When you are ready to come out as an atheist, tell them in a polite manner if the subject comes up. If they pester, bother or even yell at you for being an atheist, don't make an argument. If they try to argue, tell them that you are not going to debate this. You have made your choice, and it will not change. But let them know that you are still the person they knew before you became an atheist, and that will not change.;
, You might not support their beliefs, but you should respect the person and their opinions. In time, they will learn to respect you as well. If you are polite and courteous, it may counter any negative stereotypes they have of atheists.

, If someone says, ""God bless you"", don't automatically take the opportunity to point out that God doesn't exist. Instead, take it in the spirit it was given. If it is said snidely, then let them know you don't appreciate the tone. If it is said genuinely, say, ""Thank you."" Don't cause unnecessary friction.

, If they ask you to a religious activity (e.g. going to church), say ""no"" in a polite manner, if you don't wish to attend. On the other hand, don't shun people just because of their religious beliefs. If you do go to a religious service, don't be disruptive or disrespectful. Decide which parts you wish to participate and which parts you don't. Be natural.

, Socializing with someone can help you make a new friend that agrees with you. If you can't find one, or maybe none of them wish to talk to you, you can go online and see if there are places you can go. Anywhere you can go to be around fellow atheists will ease the burden.

Moral argument. A specific atheist was morally inferior therefore God exists.
Biblical argument. Quote biblical passage therefore God exists.
Intelligence argument. You wouldn't understand even I tried to explain to you, therefore God exists.

, Explain that simpler explanations of the universe are preferable. Richard Dawkins explains this in The God Delusion.

, Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion asks, ""would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?"".


Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.

,,,, There are many problems with omnipotence, omnibenevolence, omniscience and omnipresence.

, Understand the theory of Russell's teapot. Bertrand Russell posited there is a tiny teapot orbiting the sun to demonstrate the burden of proof is with the theist not the atheist. And one last thing: if God existed, we would be in a much better place by now.

Stay calm.",How to Argue That God Does Not Exist," The argument from poor design states that if God is perfect, why did he create us and many other living creatures so poorly? For instance, we are vulnerable to many diseases, our bones break easily, and with age our bodies and minds break down. You could also mention our poorly-made spines, inflexible knees, and pelvic bones that make childbirth difficult.Together, this biological evidence indicates that God does not exist (or that he did not create us well, in which case, there is no reason to worship him).


Believers might counter this argument by stating that if God is perfect, then he created us as well as could possibly be expected. They might also argue that what we see as imperfections actually have a purpose in the larger workings of God’s design. Point out the logical fallacy in this right away. We can't live our lives hoping that one day an explanation for why our eyes or shoulders were designed so poorly will arise. Reference the philosopher Voltaire, who wrote a novel about people looking for meaning after a devastating earthquake hit Paris. We are pattern seeking animals, so naturally we look and hope for patterns where none can be found.;
, It argues that whiles modern science can explain many things, it cannot explain others. You can refute this by saying that the things we do not understand are decreasing every year, and that while natural explanations have replaced theistic explanations, supernatural or theistic explanations never replace scientific ones.


For instance, you might cite the example of evolution as one area where science has revised previous God-centric explanations for the variety of species in our world.
Argue that religion has often been used to explain the unexplainable. The Greeks used Poseidon to explain how earthquakes happen, which we now know is due to the movement of tectonic plates to relieve pressure.

, Creationism is the belief that God created the world, usually within a relatively recent time-frame like 5,000-6,000 years ago. Draw on the wealth of reasonable evidence that disproves this, such as evolutionary data, fossils, radiocarbon dating, and ice cores to argue that God does not exist.For instance, you might say, “We find rocks all the time that are millions or even billions of years old. Doesn’t this prove that God does not exist?”

, There are several variations on this idea. You could explain that in relatively poor nations, almost everyone believes in God, while in relatively rich and developed nations, few people believe in God.You could also state that people who are well-educated are more likely to be atheists than those who have lower levels of education. Together, these facts make a strong case that God is only a cultural product and belief in God depends on one’s particular social circumstances.


You could also suggest that people who are raised in one religion overwhelmingly tend to stick with that religion throughout their lives. Those who were not raised in a religious household, conversely, rarely become religious later., This “common consent” argument might also suppose that because belief in God is so high, such a belief must be natural. However, you can explode this idea by proposing that just because many people believe something, it is not right. For instance, you might suggest, most people believed slavery was acceptable at one time.


Suggest that if people are not exposed to religion or the idea of God, they will not believe in God.

, Therefore, you could argue that even if God exists, there is no way to know which God should be worshipped.


This is known formally as the argument from inconsistent revelations.

, Most religions offer their holy texts as both a product of and evidence for their God. If you can demonstrate that a holy text is inconsistent or otherwise flawed, you’d provide a solid justification for God’s nonexistence.


For instance, if God is described in one part of the holy text as forgiving, but later wipes out a whole village or country, you could use this apparent contradiction to demonstrate that God could not exist (or that the holy text is lying).
In the case of the Bible, often entire verses, stories, and anecdotes were falsified or changed at some point. For instance, Mark 9:29 and John 7:53 to 8:11 contain passages that were copied from other sources.Explain that this demonstrates that holy texts are just a mishmash of creative ideas produced by people, not divinely inspired books.

, This argument proposes that where atheism exists, God would descend or intervene personally in the world to reveal himself to atheists.The fact that so many atheists exist, however, and that God has not attempted to persuade them through divine intervention, means that God cannot exist.


Believers might counter this claim by stating that God allows free will, and that therefore, unbelief is an inevitable outcome of this. They might cite specific instances in their holy texts of occasions when their God revealed himself to people who still refused to believe.

, If the believer’s faith is premised on the idea that God created the universe because “All things have a beginning and an end,” you could ask, “If that is so, then what created God?""This will emphasize to the other person that they are unfairly concluding that God exists when in fact, the same basic premise (that all things have a beginning) can lead to two different conclusions.


People who believe in God might counter that God -- being omnipotent -- is outside of space and time, and is therefore the exception to the rule that all things have a beginning and an end. If they counter in this way, you should direct the argument towards the contradictions in the idea of omnipotence.

, In other words, if God exists and is good, he should eliminate all evil. ""If God truly cared about us,” you could argue, “there would be no wars.""


Your conversation partner might reply ""Governments by man are ungodly and fallible. People, not God, cause evil.” In this way, your conversation partner might again invoke the idea of free will to counter the notion that God is responsible for all the wickedness in the world.
You could also go one step further and argue that even if a bad god exists who does allow evil, he is not worth worshiping.

, However, you can explain that your own behavior (or that of any other atheist) is little different than that of the believer. Admit that while you are not perfect, nobody is, and belief in God does not drive people to necessarily be more moral or righteous than anyone else.


You could also reverse this proposition by arguing that not only does religion not lead to goodness, it leads to evil, since many religious people commit immoral acts in the name of their God. You might, for instance, draw attention to the Spanish Inquisition or religious terrorism around the world.
In addition, animals who are incapable of understanding our human concept of religion show clear evidence of instinctual understanding of moral behavior and distinguishing between right and wrong.

, Many people believe that only with God can one live a rich, happy, and full life.However, you could point out that many people who do not believe are happier and more successful than those who are religious.


For instance, you might draw attention to Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens as individuals who met with great success despite the fact they do not believe in God.

, Omniscience, the ability to know everything, seems to be at odds in most religious dogma. Free will refers to the idea that you are in charge of your actions and therefore responsible for them. Most religions believe in both concepts, but they are incompatible.


Say to your conversation partner, “If God knows everything that has happened and will happen, as well as every thought your mind creates before you think it, your future is a foregone conclusion. That being the case, how can God judge us for what we do?”
People who believe in God may answer that although God knows an individual’s decision beforehand, individual actions are still each person's free choice., If God can do anything, though, he should be able to, for instance, draw a square circle. However, since this is logically incoherent, it makes no sense to believe that God is omnipotent.


Another logically impossible thing you could suggest God cannot do is to know and not know something at the same time.
You could also argue that if God is omnipotent, why does he allow natural disasters, massacres, and wars?

, In reality, it is impossible to prove that something does not exist. Anything could exist, but in order for a belief to be valid and worthy of attention, it needs hard evidence to back it up.Propose that rather than proving God does not exist, the believer needs to provide evidence that God does exist.


For instance, you could ask what happens after death. Many people who believe in God also believe in an afterlife. Ask for evidence of this afterlife.
Spiritual entities such as gods, devils, heaven, hell, angels, demons, and so on have never been (and cannot be) scientifically examined. Point out that these spiritual features can not be proven to exist.

, God is Not Great, by Christopher Hitchens, for instance, is a good place to start. The God Delusion, by Richard Dawkins, is another excellent source of rational arguments against the existence of a religious deity.


In addition to researching arguments in favor of atheism, investigate the rebuttals or justifications from the religious perspective.
Be familiar with the issues or beliefs that might invite your opponent’s criticism, and ensure you can adequately defend your own beliefs.

, For instance, when explaining how one’s religion is culturally determined, you should get the other person to agree with each of your premises (the basic facts that lead to your conclusion).


You might say, “Mexico was settled by a Catholic country, right?”
When they answer yes, move on to the next premise, like “Most people in Mexico are Catholic, right?”
When they answer yes, move on to your conclusion by saying, for instance, “The reason that most people believe in God in Mexico is the history of the religious culture there.”

, Belief in God is a sensitive topic. Approach the debate as a conversation in which both you and your conversation partner have valid points. Speak in a friendly manner to your conversation partner. Ask them for reasons as to why they believe so strongly in their faith. Listen patiently to their reasons and tailor your responses appropriately and thoughtfully to what they have to say.Ask your conversation partner for resources (books or websites) that you can use to learn more about their perspective and beliefs.
Belief in God is complicated, and statements about God’s existence -- either for or against -- cannot be taken as fact.

, The existence of God can be an emotionally-charged topic. If you are excited or aggressive during the conversation, you might be incoherent and/or say something that you regret.Try deep breathing to stay calm. Breathe in slowly through your nose for five seconds, then breathe out through your mouth for three seconds. Repeat until you feel calmed.


Slow down your rate of speech so that you have more time to think of what you want to say and avoid saying something you later regret.
If you start feeling angry, say to your conversation partner, “Let’s agree to disagree,” then part ways from them.
Be polite when discussing God. Remember a lot of people are sensitive about their religions. Be respectful of those who believe in God. Do not use offensive or accusatory language like bad, stupid, or crazy. Do not call your conversation partner names.
In the end, rather than making a concise point, your opponent will often default to ""I'm sorry you're going to Hell.” Do not respond with an equally passive-aggressive retort.

Refuse to give up.",How to Be Free from Sin," In a broad sense, ""sin"" refers to anything that falls short of the holiness of God. The easiest to spot are usually actions, but sins can also include thoughts and attitudes.Certain actions are considered sins, but the desire to perform those actions is sinful, as well. For instance, wanting to commit adultery is a sin just as actually committing adultery is.
Temptation is not a sin, though. If you're put in a compromising situation with someone you find physically attractive, you may feel tempted to act on that attraction. Actually acting on that attraction and committing adultery as a result, or imagining the act of committing adultery even without doing it, is the sin. Simply feeling tempted to do so is not.;
, Even though mankind was created in the image of God, the fall of Adam and Eve—the first humans—signified the fall of all humanity. As a result, humans are sinful by their very nature.


In other words, you don't have to be taught how to sin. Sin is already firmly fixed inside of you at the very core of your being from the time of your birth.

, When Jesus died on the cross, He carried the sins of humanity with Him. Christ's sacrifice canceled out the debt of original sin.


In the Old Testament, animal sacrifices were used as a way to repent for the sins of flesh. Even these sacrifices were imperfect, though, so the stain of original sin still remained. As both Son of God and Son of Man, Jesus became the “perfect sacrifice,” capable of freeing the human soul from the chains and punishment of original sin.

, Accepting Christ and being freed from sin does not mean that you will never do another wicked thing ever again. Christ's sacrifice freed your spirit from the shackles of sin. Your flesh—including your body, mind, and heart—will still have to deal with everyday sin.


Your soul can be free from sin even though your body still sins. Being free from sin on a soul level should mean that you also seek freedom from sin on a physical level, though, even though it can never be permanently reached.

, As previously noted, Jesus saved the soul from the consequences of sin by sacrificing Himself on the cross. You must make a conscious decision to accept the offer of salvation before your soul can truly be free, however.


If you haven't done so already, ask Christ to come into your life, forgive your sins, and set you free.
This is a crucial first step. Without relying on Christ to free you from original sin, you'll still be captive to sin in all its forms.

, God wants your love. If you come to love God more than you love your sins and the temporary pleasures those sins bring, you will naturally begin to shift away from your sinful nature.


Focus on doing good works—the works of the Spirit—before worrying about avoiding wicked works of the flesh. When you fix your eyes on that which is good, you are less likely to be drawn toward that which is evil.
When addressing a specific sin or temptation, overcome that evil with something good. For instance, do something nice for someone you love instead of simply telling yourself to stop stewing in anger toward someone else. Acting on the impulse to do something good can distract you from an otherwise bad impulse to do bad more effectively than doing nothing would.

, You may tell yourself that a particular sin is nothing more than a “bad habit” and, as such, isn't that serious. Breaking free from that sin and a lifestyle of sin can only happen once you acknowledge just how serious your own sins are.


All sin is evil and falls short of God's holiness. This includes both the littlest lie and the most gruesome murder.
Addiction support groups usually ask their members to begin by admitting to the addiction. A person cannot fix a problem until he or she admits to having it. In the same way, you can only break away from sin by admitting to the sins you've committed.

, Promise God that you will intentionally avoid sin and seek good. You will inevitably mess up sometimes, but the intention to stay on the right path must be firm and true.


If you are unable to make this vow, you may need to do some soul-searching. If your desire to resist sin still isn't sincere and that lack of sincerity is causing you to hesitate, pray to God, asking Him to give you the right heart and mind to abandon your sinful lifestyle and turn to a life in the Spirit.

, One of the biggest powers you have against sin in your life is the Word of God. Study the Scriptures regularly. Your goal should be purity of understanding rather than mere memorization.


A thorough understanding of God's Word can help you identify sin more readily and prepare for the temptations and traps that could lead you there.
Moreover, regular Bible study can also strengthen your faith and make you more aware of God's promises. As your understanding of God's love increases, your desire to love the things that God loves will increase, too, making it easier to resist that which is wicked.

, Ask God to guide your steps and help you avoid sin. Pray in this manner continually, regardless of whether or not you are actively facing a present temptation.


Prayer of all kind is a useful tool in the fight against sin, even when you don't specifically pray for strength against temptation. Through prayer, you can communicate with God, which allows you to grow in your relationship with Him. As your love for God deepens, your interest in sin will usually fade away more effectively.

, Every person has his or her own weak points, and those weak points may vary from person to person. Identify your own by looking for signs of sin in your own actions and thoughts.


Habitual sins are often the hardest to identify, even though they're the ones you are most familiar with. That being said, you can usually spot them by looking for thoughts and actions that drive a wedge between you and God.

, Don't test your faith by intentionally putting your soul in harm's way. When you see temptation lying ahead of you, avoid it instead of confronting it.


Ultimately, the goal is to avoid sinning, so any steps you can take to reach that goal are good steps to take. To that end, it is wiser to avoid the temptation to sin altogether when doing so is possible since confronting temptation only increases your risk of caving in.
For instance, if you were preparing for a major exam and accidentally found a copy of the instructor's answer sheet, holding onto that answer sheet for the duration of that exam will make you more likely to use it. Disposing of it or returning it to the instructor removes the temptation of cheating from you, thereby guaranteeing that you won't do it.

, Your commitment to a life free of sin must be a personal one. Mingling with people who can help you stay committed can be beneficial, but you also need to be prepared to walk apart from the crowd.


Following the crowd will get you into trouble, even if the crowd seems to be made of religious or well-meaning people. Everyone is flawed. You need to be able to see and follow the path that God has put in front of you regardless of whether or not anyone else is following it.
On the other hand, spending time with people who share your beliefs can be a good thing because they can help keep you accountable. You can also use these human relationships to enhance your understanding of God through discussion and acts of love., When you do sin, repent immediately and with sincerity. Don't delay or waste time trying to justify your actions.


Even though your soul has already been freed from the chains of original sin, you can only release your spirit and conscience of your own sins by taking them to God and asking for forgiveness. In the midst of your repentance, you should also ask for the strength to turn away from the same sin in the future.

, No matter how many times you fall, you need to pick yourself back up and keep trying. The struggle against sin in your life is not a “one time” issue. It's something you'll need to face throughout your entire life.


The good news is that it's a struggle you don't have to face alone. God has freed your soul from sin and will not abandon you in your efforts to resist sin in the flesh. The final victory belongs to God, and as long as you cling to Him, you'll experience the benefit of that victory.
Remind yourself of the reward waiting for you by regularly meditating on the promise of salvation that God has made to you. Sin can seem like a very appealing source of immediate satisfaction, so thinking only of the present moment can make it difficult to resist sin. Shift your focus to the even greater source of satisfaction waiting for you in the future."

",How to Be an Atheist Parent," They're your kids. There are worse kids out there. You'll probably do more harm worrying about every little thing. Parenting is about using your instincts, experience and making good use of all the resources you have. Religion has little to do with physical difficulties you may have raising children.;
, Why are you an atheist? How strongly are you committed to atheism? Do you want to actively raise your children as atheists, or expose them to religion and allow them to make up their own minds? You should discuss these questions with the child's other parent if they will be involved in raising them.

, Religions offer their followers answers to 'big' life questions like ""Why do we die?"" and ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" These questions are bound to arise and it is good to have thoughtful reasoned responses prepared before they do. In particular religion can offer a great deal of comfort during grief. If a Grandparent, pet, or loved one dies it can be difficult to comfort your child without falling back on ""they are in a better place."" If the person or pet was very sick try explaining that it is good they are no longer in pain. You may want to encourage your child to think of fond memories of the deceased and explain that they live on in those happy memories.

, As an atheist your morals are not based on the rules of a holy text or leader but you still need to instill them in your children just as you follow laws and the rules the apply to society in general. You probably don't need to over think this. It is not difficult to explain why sharing is good, or hurting others is bad. If you want stories to back up your lessons you can use non-religious stories like Aesop's Fables, folk or fairy tales to start discussion about moral questions and of course set a good example yourself. You may like to explain to your child that some people follow the laws of their religion because they fear their god's retribution or because they want to go to a heavenly place when they die. The atheists who obey the law, have good morals and respect the human rights of others do so because it's the right thing to do.

, Your children are bound to encounter religion through other children and adults. You should explain to them why other people believe in a god/s and why you do not. Religion has shaped the world as political events and history events have. Your children can have an understanding and appreciation of this without having to believe in anything.


When your children are young be sure to teach them not to mock other's beliefs. A child who is raised with a rational science-based view of the world may find it difficult to believe that other people (especially adults) believe in a god. This, combined with a child's tendency to speak their mind can lead to trouble.
When your children are older teach them how to defend their non-beliefs.

, Let them know that who they are is perfectly okay.

, Having diverse friends and family is good for children of all kinds to learn from.

Follow the example set by Christ.",How to Avoid Temptation to Sin," Everyone has their own temptations. Though Jesus never sinned, even he was tempted to. (Hebrews 4:15) Spend a few moments self-reflecting to identify your personal temptations. Then, pin down the personality traits that lead you to temptation - maybe you're insecure or you're never satisfied with yourself. Perhaps you prioritize pleasure over responsibility. No two people are exactly alike. Your temptations might resemble those of your friends, family, or other associates, but there's also a chance that they're unique to you. A priest, counselor, or other trusted person can help you discover your unique temptations and the flaws from which these temptations developed.

If you're having a hard time defining exactly what your temptations are, begin by pinpointing the things in your life that make you sad, then try to find a thought process or habit you possess that leads to these things. For instance, let's say you're in a committed relationship with a woman you love but you frequently feel intense guilt because you flirt with other women. Search your heart. Ask yourself, ""what do I think or do that makes me want to act like this?"" After some reflection, you may find, for instance, that you're worried about whether you're still attractive. The source of your temptation in this case is your sense of insecurity.;
, Your aim when fighting temptation should take into account the fact that, as a human being, you're incapable of perfection. Don't set an un-achievable goal like ""I will never sin again."" If you do, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Realize that you will inevitably sin again (and again and again). Set a realistic goal that takes this into account. ]


For instance, if you've been neglecting your child's vocal recitals in favor of nights spent at home watching TV, you might set a goal of never missing another vocal recital (except for emergencies) and of reducing your time spent watching TV every week by four hours. This goal is well within your grasp.
For a few very serious sins, it is absolutely necessary to set a zero-tolerance goal - for instance, you should obviously never commit murder or marital infidelity. These sins can cause irreparable damage to others' lives.

, You were blessed with free will for a reason. Don't waste your opportunity to act decisively against your personal temptation by giving into the separate temptation of inaction! Stand up and take action now. Make it your goal going forward to not give in to your temptation. The hardest part of overcoming your temptation can be getting started. Don't sabotage your journey before it's begun by telling yourself you can't do it.


When Jesus died, he gave us authority over the forces of evil. (Mark 16:17) Never fear or run from the forces of evil in your own life. With hard work and sincere faith, nothing is beyond your grasp.

, The one thing you can't change about yourself is your past. Don't let yourself be overcome by regret for sins that happened in the past. The only right path is forward, towards righteousness. If your past is marked by sin, acknowledge your mistakes without excessive guilt. Build upon your past mistakes. Strive never to make your old mistakes again. Even if you relapse, you'll have made progress away from your sinful past.


If you haven't already, sincerely ask God for forgiveness. God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. In his eyes, once you are forgiven, it's as if you had never committed sin in the first place: ""And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."" (Hebrews 10:17)

, Certain people, places, and situations make sinning easy. Certain sins are impossible without the right equipment, setting, or people. Make sure that you stay far away from the things that lead you to sin. If you have a drug addiction, stay out of the parts of town where these things are sold. If you're frequently persuaded by certain friends to commit acts of vandalism, don't hang out with these friends. By distancing yourself from the people and things associated with your sin, you're eliminating opportunities for sin and giving yourself less chances to fail.


Generally, it's a good idea to help other people work through their own sins. However, if you're struggling with the pull of your own temptations, sinful people can make it difficult to escape. Wait until you have your temptations under control before returning to help these people with their own sins.
Eliminate the sources of temptation from your home. For instance, throw out a pornography collection.
You may, in some cases, need to eliminate distractions from your own home. For instance, kick out a roommate who frequently convinces you to neglect your responsibilities.

, You don't need to fight your temptations alone. There is no shame in asking for help from God or from another person. If you're having difficulty avoiding your temptations, don't hesitate to turn to a priest, clergyman, pastor, counselor, or trusted friend. Accepting help is a strong, sensible thing to do and part of these peoples' purpose is to help you when you're experiencing difficulty.


Certain temptations (like, for instance, the temptation to look at pornography) aren't necessarily seen as sinful by mainstream society, although they are. If you're looking for help with such a temptation, it might make more sense to consult a priest, rabbi, imam, etc. than a secular helper.

, There's truth to the old saying ""Idle hands are the devil's playthings."" If you keep yourself busy with good, virtuous work or an assortment of hobbies, you'll have less time to yourself and thus less time where you might feel the temptation to sin out of boredom. Devote yourself to your job or your studies by taking extra hours or signing up to be a tutor, for instance. Spend time learning an instrument or a new language. If you have lots of free time, do anything you can to fill your time with activities that can help you grow closer to God, or that make you a healthier, richer, or better person.


If you're struggling to think of things that you can do to occupy your time, a good place to start is at a local homeless shelter, crisis center, or community outreach center. Talk to the management - there's a good chance they can make use of your unique talents to help the unfortunate in your community.

, Temptation, unfortunately, doesn't just go away when you choose to resist it. Temptation persists. Sometimes the conscious decision to fight a temptation will even make the temptation temporarily stronger. If you decide to resist your temptation to gorge on chocolate, for instance, you may start getting cravings after a day or two without it. It takes time for temptations to fade - some never do. This doesn't mean that you're better off giving up! Fight your temptations tooth and nail. Don't quit, even if you suffer setbacks or relapses. The more persistently you fight, the better chance you'll have of beating your temptation.


Never reward yourself with sinful ""allowances"" or ""breaks."" Resist the slippery slope of instant gratification. This instant gratification can act deceitfully, causing you to feel that it's not wrong, although it is in God's eyes.
Treat your temptations like bad habits that you must break. Work towards forming new good habits to replace your old ones by repeating good, virtuous behavior over and over again.

, Know that, no matter how hard you strive, it's impossible to live a life without temptations. We will always, at certain points, feel a temptation to sin - whether it's as innocuous as the urge to lie about our reason for being late to a meeting or as serious as the urge to strike someone who's insulted you. It's also inevitable that we will give in to this urge at some point. However, it's possible, through our efforts, to reduce the hold that temptation has over us. The fight against temptation is like waging a lifelong war - be prepared to celebrate your victories and to learn from your defeats.

, Never fall prey to self-hate. You are not loathsome or pathetic because you feel temptation. God always forgives. Don't get caught up in punishing yourself, even if you find yourself falling prey to temptation again and again. Use your time more intelligently by sincerely asking for God's forgiveness and working to move past your sins.

, Christian scripture is full of stories, teachings, and proverbs we can draw upon when we're trying to avoid our sinful temptations. The nature of sin and temptation is a frequent topic of discussion throughout the bible - simply turn to a passage like Romans 7:18 for an illuminating perspective on the difficulty of struggling against temptation: ""For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.""


Many of the most revered figures in the Bible had intense struggles with temptation(often marked with failure.) Adam and Eve committed the first sin by giving in to the temptation of eating the forbidden fruit. King David, one of the most important figures in biblical history, had one of his soldiers killed so that he could give in to temptation and steal his wife! Reading the bible can help us understand how such great men and women struggled - and overcame - their temptation.

, Working through a particularly nasty temptation is hard work. It's easy to lose hope and even to start to believe that God has abandoned us. Nothing could be further from the truth. Thoughts like ""Life is hard, so God must hate me"" aren't just wrong, they're harmful. When you're struggling with temptation, God is pulling for you more than ever. God wants to see you succeed. He wants nothing more than for you to overcome your temptation. So, if God tests you, don't lose your trust in him. Instead, rise to his challenge.

, Even if you're not Christian (or religious at all), it can be a wise policy to strive to achieve the perfection of Christ, a figure so revered that he is widely beloved outside of Christianity as well as within. Jesus lived a life of purity and perfection. He devoted his life to helping others. He practiced nonviolence, though he was willing to endure it. He suffered temptations, but he resisted them every time. Strive towards Jesus' perfection - ordinary humans can't achieve it, but they can better themselves by trying.


Christians believe that, through his mortal sacrifice, we are cleaned of all sins:(1 John 1:7) ""But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans if us from all sin."" If you're interested in Christ's salvation, contact a priest, minister, or other clergyman in your area.

Fill the baptistry with warm water ahead of time.,
Make sure the person wears appropriate clothing.,
Tell the person to keep calm and avoid struggling.,
Walk into the water.,
Ask them to repeat after you as you say the confession.,
Speak slowly and enunciate each word.,
Say the confession in phrases.,
Give them the benediction before you immerse them in the water.,
Tell the person to plug their nose.,
Place one hand on their back and one on their front.,
Guide the person backwards into the water.,
Raise the person up out of the water.",How to Baptize Someone," You’ll need to fill the baptistry early enough that it has time to fill, which could take 20-30 minutes. At the same time, don’t fill it so early that the water gets cold, unless the baptistry is equipped with a heater. Ignore this part if you are not using a baptistry.Baptisms can be performed in any standing body of water such as the ocean, a pool, or a river.;
, Before you perform the baptism, check over the person’s clothes. Make sure white clothing is thick enough that it won’t become see through. If they are wearing anything loose, make sure it won’t float up and accidentally reveal something. Shorts are better to wear than pants, so they don’t retain as much water.Dark, tight-fitting clothing is often the best. Some churches have robes specifically designated for baptisms.

, Since the feeling of falling backwards may cause the person to tense up or fight against you, warn them of this possibility ahead of time. Tell them to relax as much as possible and remember that you will be supporting them.


This is a good time to tell them about how you’ll lower them and then raise them back up. Tell them that you’ll need them to work with you as you raise them up out of the water.

, Get into the water first, and have the person who is being baptized follow you. Most of the time, you will stand facing the audience and the person being baptized will face sideways. Position yourself so your chest is next to their shoulder.


In some situations, the person being baptized may face the audience. You should still stand at their side, so you can properly support them.

, The confession varies depending on the church and the people involved, but it’s typically a few sentences either way. Break the confession into small phrases, which the person being baptized will repeat after you say them.

, The person may be nervous if they are in front of a crowd, so it is important that they clearly hear what you want them to say. Speak each word fully so they can understand it.Use a slow, calm voice to fit the seriousness of the situation.

, When the person is ready to repeat after you, start by saying, “I believe that Jesus is the Christ,” then pause and let them repeat the phrase. Then say, “The son of the living God,” and let them repeat. Continue, “And I accept Him as my Lord and Savior.”Other versions of this confession ask questions rather than having the person repeat after you.
Examples of questions to ask are: Do you believe that Jesus is the son of God? Do you believe that He died and was raised to life? Do you accept Him as your Lord and Savior? After each question, the person says, “Yes,” or “I do.”
Talk to the pastor of your church, or another local church, for other versions of this confession of faith.

, After they have repeated their confession of faith, say a blessing over them to make their baptism official. Say, “Ellis, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for the forgiveness of your sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit.”, After the confession has been repeated, encourage the person to plug their nose to avoid getting water in it when they submerge. It is not mandatory that they plug their nose, but most people prefer to.If they don’t wish to plug their nose, tell them to cross their arms over their chest.

, As you get ready to dunk them, place one arm around behind them. Either place your hand on the small of their back, or place your arm around their shoulders. Your other hand will either hold onto the arm they are plugging their nose with or be placed onto their crossed arms., By it’s earliest definition, to be baptized means to be submerged under water. Gently lower the person backwards into the water until their body is all the way under. If the person is small, their feet may come up off of the ground when they are fully submerged.If it is easier for both of you, let the person bend their knees.
In some traditions, you dunk the person underwater three times, once each for the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This is up to you, your church, and the person, but make sure they know if you are putting them under three times.

, You may hold the person under the water for one or two seconds, then lift them up with your lower hand. You’ll need their help, in most cases, so the person should try to stand up as you lift them. If they seem to be stuck in the water, place both of your hands under their arms to lift them up.To show them the love of Christ and illustrate their new status as part of God’s family, give the person a hug before you leave the water.

These people are egomaniacs who love attention. The religious leader that decides whether the members views are valid or not and carefully explains the rules that only his/her opinions and answers to provocative questions are true and not to be questioned is likely a cult leader.

Think about the quantum physics .,
Think about the near death research.,
Read the story of the death of the 16.,
Think about the reincarnation research .,
Think about enlightenment .",How to Argue for a Life After Death," Quantum physics has proven by physical tests that a higher field of consciousness (information field) in the universe exists (Alain Aspect , Amit Goswami). The ruling string theory assumes that it has our material universe there are many other dimensions of energy. The former head of the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, Professor Hans-Peter Dürr believes that the brain by thinking a field of consciousness (quantum field) forms that can exist after the death of the body in the higher dimension further Dürr: ""Basically, there is no such thing as material. Primarily, there exist only connections to material foundation. We could therefore call it consciousness material. Energy appears only as coagulated, secondarily, solidified spirit. Many discoveries of quantum physics are not only immaterial, but that is a work in completely different ways that has nothing to do with the standard three-dimensional spatial sense we have. It is a pure information field, a sort of quantum code. It has nothing to do with mass and energy. This information field spans the entire universe. The cosmos is whole information because this field has no limit. There is only one, but this one united entity is differentiated.""
You are 78 years old. Do you believe in an afterlife? Is there existence after death? Dürr: ""That is an interesting question. What we consider the here and now, this world, it is actually just the material level that is comprehensible. The beyond is an infinite reality that is much bigger. This world is rooted in. In this way, our lives in this plane of existence are encompassed, surrounded, by the afterworld already. My existence in this world is written on a sort of hard drive on the tangible (the brain). I have also transferred this data onto a spiritual quantum field (independent consciousness field). I do not lose this information, this consciousness. The body dies but the spiritual quantum field continues. In this way, I am immortal. "";
, The near death research confirms that the mind can think independently from the body. 1991 the 35 year-old Pam Reynolds underwent a brain operation. Her blood was routed from her brain and she was placed in a state of artificial coma. Her head was attached with wires to measure brain waves. It was ascertained that no brain waves could travel during this half an hour. The thought processes were blocked, and examined as no hormone release could occur. Hallucinations were not possible in this state. And it just so happened that Pam Reynolds had her out of body experience at this time. She floated with her soul out of her body. She observed from above all of the details of her operation. She then floated through a tunnel to a world of light. There, she met her dead grandmother and other people. The beings there lived in a paradise dimension and possessed positive energy. With their energy, they strengthened Ms. Reynolds So that she could go through her operation successfully. In a BBC interview, Pam Reynolds explained that she had experienced the breath of God. The special aspect of the case of Pam Reynolds lies with the fact that modern measurement equipment shows that the consciousness of a person exists even when the stuff of the brain is shut off. This leads one to conclude that there must be an independent consciousness separate from the body. The body and soul are two independent manifestations of energy. The case of Pam Reynolds was tested with many other patients. They confirmed the results. , Karmapa, the second highest master in Tibetan Buddhism (after the Dalai Lama). Enlightened Tibetan masters traditionally stay in their bodies for three days after death. This is recognized by the fact that their bodies do not begin to decompose and that the heart chakra is warm. This fact can be explained with the continuation of life after death. The 16th Karmapa died in 1981 in a hospital in Chicago. He stayed three days after his death with his soul in his body. The body did not rot in that time and the heart region was warm. Dr. Levy cared for him until his death: „He lay there in bed, dying with cancer, and he looked as if he were to have his tonsils removed. Every time I walked in the room, he smiled and his face brightened. I looked at him and said, “how are you today?” and he smiled and said “I’m okay”. For his Holiness, it was all just business as usual. It was just one more experience, the experience to find out if cancer would kill him or not. For him, it did not make a difference if he lived or died. You might as well have been talking about chicken soup with him. The way his death neared, was just one more tool with which he could work with others and help them.
Even in death, his Holiness never ceased to amaze the Western medical establishment. 48 hours after his death, his chest was still warm. In this moment, my hands were both warm, and his chest was warmer than my hand. In order to test this, I moved my hands to the side of his chest, away from his heart, and there it was cold. I then felt the middle again, and above his heart it was warm. I pinched his skin and found that it was still elastic and completely normal. After 36 hours, the dead typically have skin comparable to dough. And his skin was still like that of the living after 48 hours. It was as if he weren’t dead.
Shortly after we left the room, the surgeon came and said, „ he is warm, he is warm.“ And then it came to be that the medical staff asked again and again if he were still warm. It was naturally consistent to the traditional Tibetan experience. Developed individuals like his Holiness stay in their bodies after breath and heartbeat have stopped, within a state of deep meditation. After three days the Samadhi ended. It was recognized that his Holiness was no longer warm and that the process of death set in. After this, the atmosphere changed, it too became normal.”

, The reincarnation research approaches more and more to the fact that there are past lives. Thousands of reports were investigated . The witnesses could accurately describe the previous places and situations, although they were never there and had heard nothing about it in the normal way. The most well-known reincarnation researcher in the West is Professor Ian Stevenson from the University of Virginia. He examined over the course of 40 years over 3.000 reincarnations situations throughout the world. Often, he noticed similarities in behavior and bodily signals in line with the former incarnation. One of the most well-known cases of reincarnation in India is Shanti Devi. She was born in 1926 in New Delhi and could remember her previous life as a housewife in Mathura. Although she was never in that location, she was able to describe her previous husband, her previous house, and the city itself. She could even remember where she had always hidden her money in her former life. , Who is enlightened can, thanks to its expanded consciousness, look in the beyond and know the life after death and the happiness in the Paradise. The sacred books of mankind based on the enlightenment experiences of their authors. Buddha looked at his former life, when he became enlightened. He confirmed that there are several areas in the beyond. Krishna also knew from experience that there is a life after death. It's the same with Jesus and the authors of the Bible (the enlightened Jews). The Koran is based on the enlightenment experience of Mohammed (he lived for three years as a yogi in the desert) and his view of paradise. One might think that the enlightened are imagining their perceptions. Against this speak, however, the attempts with the clairvoyants. The American professor Gary Schwartz tested the most well-known mediums of the United States from 1998 to 2001. The mediums could experience the beyond with their spirits and make contact with the dead. Gary Schwartz compared their statements about distanced things with a control group of average people. The mediums had a ratio of correct answers of 83%, whereas the control group got only 36%. If the mediums know things far away it is very possible, that also their knowing about things in the beyond is correct. "

Do not seek revenge: Jesus gives us clear guidelines in forgiveness - ""Father... forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors... Matthew 6:9-13.,
Do this, otherwise God will ""not"" forgive us: Matthew 6:14-15 states ""if you forgive men when they sin against you, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.,
Make a decision to forgive, even if you have been hurt by words or actions of people -- yet you decide to immediately forgive the person, no matter how you feel:
Then you say aloud, ""Father I choose to forgive this person"" and the pain disappears.

,
Take this big step toward obedience, as soon as you have forgiven but still memories of the specific person or incident, e.g.,
Avoid a grudge like: ""what that person has done to me is unforgivable"" -- but, compare this to what people did to Jesus, the betrayal and the crucifixion.,
Remember that Jesus said: (Matthew 5:43-48)


""You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.’:

""44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.,
Guard your heart: be careful to whom and what you give your affections; this is an important principle also to avoid getting entangled again, overcome by those things again, or else the end could be worse than the beginning.

",How to Avoid Being Bitter (Christianity)," So we have to forgive others, because we want our Heavenly Father to forgive us, not one of us are perfect, we cannot stay bitter.;
, But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" We have to do it, if we want God to forgive us.

,,: the pain of divorce, or a horrifying rape comes back to mind -- then you declare aloud: ""Satan I 'have already' forgiven this person and 'choose' not to be bitter anymore"".


Forgiveness is a commandment. Mark 11:25 ""And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you.""

, Our situation looks small in comparison to what Jesus has experienced, and yet Jesus said,
""Father forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.""

,

46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 48 Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.""

But, you know that ""God's love is perfect love"", but can we ever earn perfection? No! He perfected His gift of love/grace in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us so that we may be perfect in His grace -- ""perfected by grace"".

Point out that clearly evolution if it works is by failure of a previously successful part or system in genetic accidents called mutations.,
""Describe a strictly reactive system that is disintegrated and lacking intelligence that forms interdependent, successful systems inadvertently--call it evolution."",
Examine a partly functional eye.,
Observe needed simultaneous existence of the entire eye and all its functions plus the optic nerve from the eye to the brain and especially the sight center in the brain itself.,
See that the a non-functional part of an eye would not enhance survival and so the eye should not exist at all as it is not logical to evolve in unsuccessful pieces.

",How to Argue Against Evolution of Eyesight," The fact that life in any form and the eye have highly interdependent, simultaneously successful systems may make evolution seem illogical or nonsensical. There are many well known genetic system ""crashes"" (failing to work as usual) like down syndrome, Siamese twins, idiot savant... but there's more to consider like spina bifida--birth defect with an open spinal column or protruding nerve meninges -- and births without appendages or with stubs. Do these benefit the individual... but where are such obvious, but useful changes in the individual at those or nearby sites in the genetic codes... where is the occasional, super-ability (out of bounds in the positive direction)...;
, Evolution could not work proactively, but by random chaos it would be able in one dimension or another to avoid falling into total failure although life was blind, deaf, brainless and even totally senseless at some original form in the eons of time according to evolution--call it a system of mistakes, ie: failing to work properly, and so that is success...

, The retinal, photosensitive cells alone without millions of parallel nerve fibers connecting it to the brain, without the optic center processing millions of pulses of light, or how would there be any optical image processor in the brain without the rich blood supply to the retina. Each part would have little if any value. Such independent structures would have not aided survival. Separately, such parts would not have any theoretical reason to exist (no benefit to life)! So were they or were they not multiple, interdependent, codependent systems? So clearly they were passed on to the next generations without purpose, and so they blindly improved by random chaos and by failing to connect...


Consider the pupil of the eye and the retina that did not exist at exactly the same moment--would they ever ""get together"" since they would neither have any correlation to each other nor help survival separately?
If the focal distance and a workable shape of eye did not “come about” at the necessary distance from the photoreceptors in the retina, the eye nerves would neither have a reason to exist nor to even connect to the brain.
If the bag of fluid which forms the lens did not appear in the eye at the same time as photoreceptors regardless of the distance it would be useless to the individuals success.
If the retinal nerves network did not “exist” exactly at the same moment as the sclera (dense fibrous opaque white outer covering of the eyeball) and the part covered by the transparent cornea, iris and the pupil did, then the eye wouldn’t see. The uncovered retinal nerves, not bathed in fluid, not protected from sunlight and air, would clearly either die from exposure or scar over and have no value--as exquisitely fragile.
An extremely large and uncorrelated nerve bundle alone has no value. In fact if there were no already, successful eye, the optic nerve would not exist according to logic of evolution.
If the optic nerve (which carries the nerve signals of light “images”' to the brain) were not “involved/engaged properly” at exactly the same moment as the retinal nerve network, the eye wouldn’t see.
If the sight center of the brain that “sees” did not “begin” to correctly process sight at exactly at the same moment as the optic nerve, then the nerve would have no reason to transmit or to be attached to the brain and the eye wouldn’t see.

, All of the necessary advanced functions, and their interdependent relationships are all required to exist (at the exact same instant), or the eye would have no function or reason to exist. The parts would not work separately at the most rudimentary level (in some aquatic creature according to evolutionary theory) before it evolved into a mouse (shrew or what have you) and then to a monkey like creature, etc. according to a well known accident-and-systematic-failure-theory of origins (""evolutionary theory"").

Understand the economics of Fascism.,
Understand how Fascism views war.",How to Be a Fascist," Enrico Corradini, Julius Evola, and Corneliu Codreanu are all excellent sources on Fascist/proto-Fascist ideology. Among the more philosophic roots of Fascism are rejection of decadence and materialism, and the value of action over compromise. Fascism views life as a constant struggle, and so to be a Fascist is to be a human of strength and willpower.;
, To apply Fascism, one must have a spirit of Nationalism - valuing the legacy of your country’s people, and putting their interests before yourself and before the rest of the world. Take pride in your ancestor’s accomplishments, and strive to do good in their name and uphold your country’s noblest traditions. Action begins at the local level, so find opportunities to volunteer around town. In Fascism, what is good for the community is good for the People and the State.

, Fascism rejects electoral democracy, because it sees democracy as simply enabling politicians to lie to the people to get in power, and thus the leaders do not truly represent the People. Instead, Fascism believes in putting together a system where those fit to rule ensure that power stays in the right hands, and so power is passed through a dynastic or oligarchic system. Understand that in a Fascist country, you will not always get to vote for your leader, but your voice can still be heard in public forum meetings or referendums, for example.

, Fascism rejects Capitalism on the grounds that it is too individualistic and that wealthy corporations will abuse their power, such as underpaying workers or outsourcing jobs. However, Fascism also rejects Communism on the grounds that it does away with private property and thus the incentive to work completely, as well as promoting the notion of class warfare. Instead of class warfare Fascism believes in class collaboration - the different classes must all work together to help strengthen their community and their State. Fascism advocates a mixed economy where people can own property and open their own businesses, but major corporations must always be answerable to the will of the State, and must always serve the common good of the People.

, In Fascism, war is not always promoted, but it is seen as something that can’t always be avoided. Fascism views war as acceptable in defense, but also as a valid option for securing natural resources and land for the good of the people. Fascism sees war as an opportunity for the People to mobilize around a common goal and achieve victory, and so a strong military is always a must.

Pick your battles.,
Identify what you’d like to argue against specifically.,
Do your homework.,
Address faith and institution separately.,
Address the difference between religion and morality.,
Seek out flawed logic.,
Anticipate counter-arguments.,
Don’t expect to create a convert.",How to Argue Against Christianity," Striking up a debate with someone who welcomes discussion, chooses to proselytize, or is belligerent towards non-Christians is very different from picking a fight with someone whose values you don’t happen to agree with. Christians who are going about their business don’t want to be attacked for their beliefs any more than you do.;
, Do you have a problem with an ethical standpoint presented in the Bible (such as opposition to homosexuality)? If so, you might point out other edicts in the Bible that modern Christians don’t adhere to and ask what makes them fit to pick and choose. Do you think your own faith is more valid than Christianity? If so, have points of comparison and contrast ready and be familiar with the texts of both religions. Do you dislike the idea of institutionalized religion in general? If so, focus on the atrocities committed by various religious institutions (not just Christianity) throughout history.

, Though it’s possible to come at the other debater entirely from your own perspective, it will be much easier to poke holes their argument if you’re willing to venture onto their turf. Research a few relevant historical points, Biblical quotes (and their context), and differences in Biblical translation/interpretation to both strengthen your own argument and anticipate various responses. Any time you think you have a good point, look it up online to see what has already been said about it and modify/scrap the idea as necessary.

, Whether or not you agree with this, backing away from the idea that all faith is inherently flawed might be necessary to gain traction in your argument. (After all, people have been arguing over the unknowable for as long as they’ve been capable of arguing.) To make your target more realistic (and keep the attack from getting personal), consider focusing the debate on the church itself. Point out wars waged in the name of Christianity (such as the Crusades and the Bosnian War), the fact that the Old Testament was used to justify slavery in America, the fact that the church has a long history of covering up sex abuse against children, and so on. Ask the other debater how (s)he can feel justified in supporting an institution with questionable morals, especially if that support is financial.

, Some Christians argue that their faith is useful for instilling morals. If this is the case with your debater, let them know about your own philosophy and civic volunteering to demonstrate that it’s possible to be a good person without being a Christian. Point out some of the many instances of abuse within the church and ask why Christian values didn’t prevent these acts. If your debater responds that members of the church are free to choose whether or not to be moral, point out that non-believers are free to do the same, making Christian values no more or less useful than any others.

, If your debater is a literalist, have a few Biblical self-contradictions ready and ask which one the Bible would have you believe. While you’re at it, point out variations in the translations and editing over time – or better yet, ask if the debater has read the text in its original language. (This is also useful if the debater invests his/her argument very heavily in the wording of a particularly passage.) If your debater believes that accepting Jesus erases sins and is the only way to reach salvation, ask what (s)he thinks happened to Jewish victims of the Holocaust in the afterlife. (Be very careful about how you do this: remember, this is an exercise in pointing out inconsistencies in logic, not trying to associate an innocent debater with a heinous war criminal.)

, If, for example, you propose that science is more trustworthy than religion, expect to hear the argument that science is constantly being reinterpreted – in many ways, more so than Christianity. What people accept as fact today would have been laughed at 100 years ago (which can be said about a huge number of points in history), making it reasonable to assume that much of what we take for granted right now will become defunct in the future. Additionally, be prepared to debate whether or not the amount of scientific advances (ex. global warming, mass warfare, nuclear weaponry, and so on) is helpful or harmful to society.

, Let go of the need to emerge from the debate victorious: you are about as likely to win over a firm believer as (s)he is to bring you into the fold. Instead, aim to have a diplomatic, well-reasoned exchange that does you justice and gives you both something to think about.

Once you reach ‘I’ which is a ‘9,’ start back at 1 as you continue along the alphabet.Some sources only use digits 1 through 8, but there are 9 numerology name numbers, so be sure to use all 9 digits when numbering the letters.
The system can also be summarized like this:

1– A, J, S
2– B, K, T
3– C, L, U
4– D, M, V
5– E, N, W
6– F, O, X
7– G, P, Y
8– H, Q, Z
9– I, R



, To find out your true name number, you will need to use your full name. You can find your entire name on your birth certificate or an official identification document. Don’t forget to include your middle name if you have one as well.


If you have a name that’s been passed down through your family, such as John Smith II, or you have unique prefixes or suffixes, include it as long as it is part of your full, official name.
If you have legally changed your name, use that name since that is now how you identify yourself.
You can use nicknames, but they won’t give a completely accurate result.

, Now that each letter has a numerical value, you can start putting numbers with the letters in your name. Below where you have written your name, write each number that goes with each individual letter.


You will have some duplicates, but that is not a problem.
For example, if your name is John Jacob Smith, then all of the Js will get a 1, the Os will get a 6, the Hs will get an 8, and so on.

, Using a calculator or a pencil and paper, add together every single digit from your name. If your name has 20 letters, you will be adding together 20 individual numbers. You will end up with a two-digit sum after adding everything together.


For example, BATMAN is numbers 2+1+2+4+1+5, which equals 15.

, After you have added your numbers together, you will have a double or triple digit sum, if your name is long. To reduce the sum, add together the two digits within it. For example, if the sum of your letters is a 25, split the 25 and add 2+5 to equal 7. The 7 is your true name number., If you add up the letters in your name and you get a sum that equals either 11, 22, or 33, don’t reduce them. These are the three Master numbers, which can add difficulty but also depth to the personality you are discovering or the topic of numerology you are studying. These three numbers have their own personality explanations.Master numbers can be reduced, but only in certain situations. They are reduced when they are found within a date or number equation.
For example, if a total sum is a Master number do not reduce it. But if there is a Master number within the equation, go ahead and reduce an 11 to a 2 or a 33 to a 6 to simplify the equation., Once you have your name number, you can look up that number in a numerology chart to find out more about yourself. Whether you were intentionally named with a numerology result in mind or your name number is by chance, knowing your number sign can perhaps give you some insight into your personality.Some sources differ slightly in their descriptions of each number, but overall their general descriptors remain similar:

1 – Initiator action, pioneering, leading, independent, attaining, individualistic
2 – Cooperation, adaptability, consideration of others, partnering, mediating
3 – Expression, verbalization, socialization, the arts, the joy of living
4 – Values foundation, order, service, struggle against limits, steady growth
5 – Expansiveness, visionary, adventure, the constructive use of freedom
6 – Responsibility, protection, nurturing, community, balance, sympathy
7 – Analysis, understanding, knowledge, awareness, studious, meditating
8 – Practical endeavors, status oriented, power-seeking, high-material goals
9 – Humanitarian, giving nature, selflessness, obligations, creative expression
11 – Higher spiritual plane, intuitive, illumination, idealist, a dreamer
22 – The Master Builder, large endeavors, powerful force, leadership



, Name numbers are often referred to by other names such as your life path number. There are also other variations that can reveal your soul’s inner desires as well as subconscious dreams.


Your soul number will tell you your likes, dislikes, and deepest desires. Assign only the vowels in your first name and last name numbers, add them to find the sum, and reduce the sum to find your soul number.
Your personality, or inner dreams, number is found by giving only the consonant letters a number.
To find your destiny name number, you will follow the same process to find your normal name number.
When differentiating between vowels and consonants, treat Ys and Ws with special care. When Ys are used as a vowel and a W is paired with a vowel to create a vowel sound, such as ‘Matthew,’ then they are given numbers for a soul number.
Conversely, if Ys and Ws are being used in a name as consonants, do not give them numbers for a personality name number., If you find that you’re unsatisfied with your name number results or you don’t like your given name itself, you can always change your name. You may find that as you get older you want to be identified and called something else more suiting to your complex personality. Names aren’t written in stone, just legally binding paper, but that can be fixed.If you want to skip the courthouse, you can always ask people to call you by a nickname.
A new name may take some time to catch on, but be consistent with correcting people nicely and signing your new name correctly to help it stick.
You can even start by spelling your name differently to alter your name number results. For example, Tamra is an 8 but by spelling her name Tamara, she becomes a 9.

Know what it means to be a psychic medium.,
Determine your level of psychic ability.,
Conduct research on psychic medium ship.",How to Become a Psychic Medium1," Psychic mediums perceive spirits in other dimensions using one or more of the following abilities:


Clairvoyance. Clairvoyant mediums can see spirits, auras, objects and places that are not perceptible to others. People who have passed away may appear to them in visions, or they may be able to vividly sense a place to which they have never been. Psychic mediums see these visions with their third eye, located between the two physical eyes. Everyone has a third eye, but the average person's is closed or too weak to use.
Clairaudience. Clairaudient mediums can hear messages from the ""other side,"" either physically or psychically. They can communicate with spirits that are thousands of miles away, or in another dimension altogether.
Clairsentience . Clairsentient mediums experience psychic communication through pure knowing. They get surges of knowledge given from the spirits, that they then interpret.;
, Everyone has some level of psychic abilities, which help us intuit other people's feelings and connect with our spiritual side. Consider the following questions to help you determine your level of psychic ability:


Are you a natural psychic medium? Some people begin seeing visions, hearing messages, or strongly feeling the presence of spirits from a very young age. They don't necessarily know what they are experiencing until they get older. The natural psychic mediumship is exceedingly rare.
Are you clairvoyant, clairaudient, or clairsentient? Perhaps you feel on the cusp of developing abilities in one of these areas. You're sensitive and receptive to feelings, emotions, and communications from others, and you've had experiences that you consider to be paranormal.
Are you interested in becoming a psychic medium, but have never had a paranormal experience? It's possible to work on particular skills and open up the possibility of flexing your psychic muscles. With some practice, you may be able to open and strengthen your third eye.

, One of the best ways to figure out whether you have the capacity to become a psychic medium is to read accounts written by other mediums. Decide whether you recognize yourself in their stories and experiences. Learn as much as you can about the history and practice of psychic medium ship.


Read books by psychic mediums, and watch shows that feature them, to get a sense of the paths psychic mediums have taken.
Talk to a psychic medium about his or her experiences. Psychic fairs are good places to meet mediums.
Beware people purporting to be psychic mediums who may not be the real deal.

"
"
Heighten your awareness.,
Try actively communicating with spirits.,
Consider taking a workshop or course in the psychic medium ship.",How to Become a Psychic Medium2," The psychic medium ship is about being open to communication from the ""other side."" Try the following methods for raising your awareness and opening your third eye:


Pay attention to your intuition. Don't dismiss your dreams. Acknowledge the odd feelings and urges you feel. Recognize the various energies that affect you throughout the day.
Spend quiet time by yourself every morning. After you wake in the morning, before starting your day, spend time allowing thoughts and emotions to wash over you. Don't control what comes; welcome and absorb it. Open your mind to the possibility of receiving communications from energies generated outside yourself.
Try free writing. Write what comes to your mind the moment it arrives. Don't judge the words, and avoid editing them. Read back over what you wrote a few hours later. The messages you receive from other beings won't always be clear, but writing them down may help you find patterns.

, A good way to start is by finding a medium ship circle, a group of mediums who gather to receive messages from the other side. This will give you an introduction to the setting that should be arranged for effective communication. Once you're comfortable with the process, try it on your own, or invite other mediums to join you.


Set up a room in a quiet part of your house. Dim or turn off the lights. A few candles may help create a spiritual setting.
Say a prayer or chant to ready the space for communication and call on spirits to join the circle.
Recognize the presence of the spirit or spirits that join you. Allow yourself to receive images, words, feelings, smells - whatever the spirits wish to communicate.
Ask the spirit to identify itself. When you receive an answer, confirm it out loud. Continue communicating with the spirit by asking questions and receiving answers.
Know that at this early stage you will not be able to control the effect the communication has on you. You may feel frightened, or you may experience pain. As you develop your skills as a medium, you'll be better able to control the way you communicate with the other side.

, Bookstores and spiritual centers in your area may offer educational resources. Do online research and attend psychic fairs and conferences to find out more about workshops, classes and even certifications for new psychic mediums.

"
"
Offer to work with someone to facilitate communication with his or her loved one.,
Consider starting a business as a psychic medium.",How to Become a Psychic Medium3," If you have a friend or family member who is distressed about unfinished business with someone who has passed away, offer to use your abilities to help him or her.


During the séance or trance period, note that as a medium you should not ask too many questions of the person you are helping. A good medium never asks the client to tell them the name of the deceased or any details; otherwise, it is not a valid reading. It is up to you to validate the deceased loved one's name, occupation in life, birth date, physical description, how they passed, and so on.
Remember that doing a psychic reading is a big responsibility. It can be a very emotional process for all parties involved.

, It is possible to have a very successful career as a psychic medium once you're confident in your abilities. Build a website to advertise your services. Set up a room in your house or rent a space to be used for the purpose of holding sessions with clients.


Be sure to incorporate your small business according to the laws where you live.
Talk to other mediums about the business models that have worked for them, including how much they charge for each reading.
Participate in psychic fairs and conferences. Print business cards and pass them out at psychic fairs and conferences, or sign up to set up your own table.

Find an intuition buddy.",How to Become Clairvoyant," Direct intuition, also called literal intuition, is the sort of intuition you harness when you ask yourself about a specific situation.Make yourself comfortable. Sit down in a quiet place and focus your breathing until your body relaxes.
Identify a situation you would like insight on. Focus on this situation for several minutes.
Ask aloud or in your mind for a direct intuitive experience about it in the near future.
Let it go. You may need to do this multiple times before anything comes of it, but by focusing your energy on one specific situation, your intuition is more likely to pick up on cues for that situation than on anything else.;
, Indirect intuition, also called symbolic intuition, focuses on the mind's natural ability to pick up on things of key importance by developing your ability to see in and interpret mental symbols.


Grab a pencil and a piece of paper.
Ask yourself, ""What does my life need right now?"" Repeat this question three times, pausing in between each repetition while imagining yourself moving to a more meaningful answer each time.
After asking the question three times, pick up your pencil and draw the first symbol that comes to mind.
Interpret the symbol. Figure out what it represents from your perspective and how that concept plays into your life.

, The human mind enters the REM stage of sleep every 90 minutes, and during this state, the mind dreams. Dreams can be a powerful tool in your journey to interpret cues from external stimuli that your subconscious has already analyzed.Before going to sleep, put a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed. Ask yourself a question or focus on a specific situation in your life that you need an intuitive answer to. Repeat it as often as possible before falling asleep.
When you wake up, write down anything you dreamed about. If you did not dream about anything, write or draw whatever enters your mind.
Repeat as needed until you get an answer to your question or situation.

, Blind readings use a system of cards to help you focus your energy and subconsciously answer questions using your intuition.Sit down at a desk with three blank cards.
Think about a question or situation you need your intuition to help you with. Write three different solutions to that question, assigning one to each card.
Flip the cards over so that the answers face down. Shuffle them and place them face-down on the desk.
Run your hands over the cards. Take your time, relax, and breathe deeply.
Flip the cards over. The card you felt most drawn to should be the correct solution.

, Most instructors who teach psychic development will say that the biggest obstacle you need to overcome when becoming clairvoyant is the fear you have regarding the ability to see the future.


Identify the source of your fear. Oftentimes, your fear may be as simple as worrying about how silly you look, but sometimes, you might have a frightening image at a young age and turn off your clairvoyant abilities in response.
Get rid of your fear by chanting an affirmative phrase silently or out loud. Try a phrase like, ""I am willing to release all fear of seeing my future.""

, Before you can use clairvoyance to answer direct, specific questions, you may need to increase your ability to see vivid images in your mind. You can do this with a simple visualization exercise.


Imagine yourself holding seven balloons. Each balloon should be a different color.
Let the balloons go one by one. Watch each one float up to the blue sky until they disappear before releasing the next balloon and visualizing the same thing.Practice until you can clearly see each balloon complete its journey.

, When the time comes to use your clairvoyance on a particular question, make sure to phrase your question in a very specific manner so that you can really address the heart of the matter.


Stay away from a broad question like, ""Will I enjoy my birthday this year?"" In this instance, think about what you actually want your birthday to be like, and ask yourself a more specific question like, ""Will any of my friends or family take me out to do something special for my birthday this year?""

, After asking your question, breathe deeply three times. Focus on the area between your eyes. This spot is a chakra known as a ""third eye,"" which psychics claim to be responsible for visual clairvoyance abilities.


Continue breathing while fixing your attention on this area. Vividly imagine an illuminated horizontal oval shape in the center of your forehead. This is your ""third eye."" Ask it to open, repeating the request until it does and you feel a warm feeling rush through your body.

, Let the images come into your mind naturally. Do not force them. If they seem fuzzy or unclear, tell them, aloud or silently, to grow in size and strength right away.


Clairvoyant images will usually come as a picture inside your mind's eye, a picture seen outside of the mind's eye, a movie inside your head, or a movie outside your head.
The images may be black and white or full color. Moreover, they many appear life-like or cartoonish.
If you cannot figure out what your clairvoyant images mean, ask aloud or silently, ""What do these pictures mean?""
You should receive an answer as a feeling, thought, or sound.
If this does not work, repeat the exercise until some answer does come. When you just start out, the answer may seem hazy and uncertain, but it is important that you trust yourself no matter what.

, When people think of psychic abilities and predicting the future, they often think only of clairvoyance. Clairvoyance is the practice of future “sight,” but there are other senses you can use to anticipate the future.


Clairaudience is the ability to ""hear"" psychic energy.
Clairsentience is the ability to ""feel"" energy. Common forms of clairsentience include gut feelings and empathy.
Claircognizance is the ability to ""know"" things without being told. If you ever had a grandmother or aunt who knew whenever anyone was sick at your house without being told about it first, she would have possessed claircognizant abilities.

, To develop clairaudience, you need to learn how to fine-tune your sensitivity to the sounds around you and inside you.When lying in bed at night, consciously listen to the noises you usually tune out. Separate and identify each one. Pick out as many as possible before falling asleep, and do this for about a week.
Listen for clairaudient guidance. Picture yourself turning on a radio and tuning to your clairaudient channel. Start asking questions, and listen for any words you get in response. These words may be soft or loud, sensible or confusing, but once you hear a response, you need to analyze what it means.

, One of the most beneficial ways to develop clairsentience is to work on reading the energy and feelings of someone else. You can practice this in several ways.Ask a friend to show you a picture of someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well. Look at the eyes of the person in the picture and try to determine how that person felt at the time the photo was taken. Also ask yourself if this person is trustworthy, and if there is anything else that stands out. Check with your friend to determine how accurate your senses were.
Ask a friend to give you an object belonging to someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well. This object should be something the person has worn regularly, since these objects are more likely to absorb more energy. Hold the object in your hands and gauge whether there more positive or negative energy has soaked into it.

, Developing your claircognizance is a lot like developing your intuition. You will need to focus on exercises that help you organize your thoughts and understandings, like automatic writing.Sit down with a pen and paper. Ask yourself a question and write down whatever pops into your mind in response, even if it seems like unrelated nonsense.
Force your mind to be a spectator in this exercise. Do not let your mind think about the information you get or try to direct it. Simply write your thoughts as they roll out until they cease to come.
Read over what you wrote. If anything jumps out at you, highlight it and analyze it after you finish reading your entire thought process.

, Whether you are trying to develop intuition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, or claircognizance, tracking your psychic experiences in a journal can help you develop your abilities further.


Keeping a journal helps you understand your strongest psychic and intuitive abilities. It also lets you check for accuracy and assess how valuable your responses tend to be., Even if no one among your friends and relatives is working on developing clairvoyance, you should have at least one person whom you can openly express your thoughts to. Sharing your experiences can help sharpen your understanding of them.


Share entries from your intuition journal and discuss your interpretations.
Discuss similar experiences your intuition buddy has had and help him or her analyze any dream or experience that has remained a mystery to him or her.

If you experience an image, feeling, thought or other sense and you are not sure why it has come to you, calmly ask yourself why you are experiencing it and this allows more psychic information to flow to you.;
, The use of psychic intuition can make you tired. Physically and emotionally. Getting plenty of sleep makes you clear headed and available to receive psychic information.

Get a good camera.,
Carry a notebook and pen.,
Find a UFO sighting hotspot.,
Set up camp for several hours in the evening.,
Record any activity you see.,
Distinguish UFOs from human aircraft.,
Report your sightings to a database.,
Find a Ufology organization to join.",How to Become a UFO Hunter," ""Hunting"" UFOs describes the act of spotting UFOs, usually in the night sky, and taking pictures or recordings to capture their activity. Many people have declared they've seen a UFO, and some have even reported being abducted, but no one has been able to provide definitive proof that this has occurred. Because we live in a society of skeptics, it's absolutely imperative for a serious UFO hunter to have serious equipment for getting concrete data on UFOs.


Buy a camera that takes excellent pictures at night. You'll need a special lens that can capture the faint lights and patterns created by the UFOs.
A video camera is also useful to have. The more ways you have to document the UFOs, the better.;
, You'll need to be able to keep a record of the details of your sightings. Have a notebook and writing instrument with you at all times so that you'll be able to jot down all the necessary information right when it happens. Later, when you get home, plan to record the information in a log on your computer.

, Organizations like the National UFO Reporting Center have online databases listing sightings by state, date, and shape.Look into hotspots in your region. It's not guaranteed you'll see a UFO there, but it's a great place to start.


Plan on visiting the same spot multiple times.
If necessary, make travel arrangements to visit a spot in a different state. Some states don't have many, if any, hotspots.
Go to a place that doesn't have a lot of air traffic, so you don't mistake human aircraft for UFOs.

, Once you're there, you may have to sit tight for a long time before you see any activity. Patience is a virtue among UFO hunters; be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting under the stars.

, As soon as you see activity, even if you aren't sure what you saw was indeed a UFO, write it down. Record the following information:


The date and time of the sighting
The location of the sighting
The shape, size, and color of the UFO
Whether there were additional witnesses

, After you've hunted for UFOs for awhile, you'll start to notice patterns. Do research to find out whether what you're seeing may have an explanation; for example, if you're looking for UFOs near an Air Force Base, you might be seeing human-made aircraft, even if they look unfamiliar. Real UFOs may have the following characteristics:


They don't move in a straight line, but rather up and down or in zig zags. They may not move in regular patterns at all
They don't blink, like airplanes would
They may be shaped like discs, triangles, or something else entirely

, Ufology organizations have databases where they keep all the important statistics on UFO sightings. If you spot a UFO and report it, you're contributing to the community at large. You can also learn a lot by spending time reading through others' reports.

, There are several established organizations with chapters in every state. If you're interested in pursuing Ufology long-term, its worth joining up with a group. Here are a few options:

Read tarot cards.,
Practice palm reading.,
Practice numerology.Numerology is the study of numbers and, practitioners believe, their use in discovering their application to someone’s life.,
Practice lithomancy.",How to Become a Psychic Reader1," Some people believe tarot cards can uncover truths about the physical, mental, or spiritual state of someone or something. Use a guidebook, your deck’s instruction manual, or consult a psychic to practice learning the cards and their various meanings.


There are seventy-eight standard tarot card images divided into various subclasses (minor and major arcana). Each card is a symbol and represents a certain meaning situation.Familiarizing yourself with these cards and their associated meanings will make interpreting them easier later on. Carry a deck with you at all times -- on the bus, at school, and to doctor’s appointments.
Many cards have multiple meanings. Learn them all in order to give your reading context and depth.;
, Palm reading (palmistry) is a psychic skill which analyzes the hand to reveal individual personality and character traits. There are two varieties of palmistry: chiromancy and chirognomy.Chiromancy looks at the lines of the palm and is a more traditional palm reading technique. By analyzing major and minor lines of the hand, you might be able to discover things about someone’s physical and emotional condition.
Chirognomy uses the shape and texture of the hands and color of the skin in order to potentially draw out similar truths. By studying the hand’s shape and classifying it into one of four categories -- earth, air, fire, or water -- you might be able to discern a person’s characteristics.

, Some people, for instance, believe that numbers in your birth date, or numbers which you encounter regularly like your address, indicate your purpose in life, motivation, and fate. Practicing numerology is an arcane psychic reading practice.


Numerologists believe each number has a special cosmic vibration which, in combination with others, can reveal certain truths. For instance, a popular numerological analysis is the lifepath number. This number adds the day, month, and year together, then adds the individual digits in this number in order to arrive at the lifepath number. Each number (1-9) has a different meaning.For instance, if you were born on 04/27/1986, you’d add 4 + 27 + 1986 to get 2017. Then, adding 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 you get 9, your lifepath number.

, Lithomancy is a divination method which uses rocks and stones. Some people believe lithomancy can reveal someone’s energy and offer omens about the future.Using smooth precious gemstones, cast the stones to interpret their meaning. You can either assign meaning, or use the rocks to interpret someone’s fortune along the lines of the zodiac.If interpreting the rocks in a predetermined way, assign one rock as “yes” and one as “no” before answering a question. Drop both rocks in front of you using one hand. The rock which falls closer to you is the one which provides your answer.
You could also drop three rocks, one for “yes,” one for “no,” and one to indicate which answer is correct. Drop all three rocks. If the indicator rock drops closest to the “no” rock, your answer is negative; if it drops closest to the “yes” rock, your answer is positive.If interpreting the rocks along the lines of the zodiac, you will need to use twelve stones, each unique so that it can be identified. A list of these so-called birthstones can be found at https://www.americangemsociety.org/birthstones. Place the stone which corresponds to your zodiac sign on the table or ground in front of you. Place the other stones in a small pouch or purse and close it tightly. Shake the stones up within the bag and drop one out. Practitioners believes that the stone which comes out indicates that someone born under that sign will soon cross your path in an important role.
For instance, if you were born in February, you’d place your birthstone (amethyst) on the table. If after shaking the bag of stones and dropping one out, you saw it was an emerald, you’d know that someone born in May (the month which corresponds to the emerald birthstone) was going to cross your path soon as a lover, friend, or enemy.
Natural stones like those found on beaches are best for lithomancy. If possible, procure natural stones.

Choose a good crystal ball.,
Sit quietly in a dimly lit room with the ball before you.,
Pick the ball up with both hands.,
Gaze into the ball.",How to Become a Psychic Reader2," Purchase your ball from a legitimate psychic good dealer. If possible, examine each in person. A quality crystal ball will be made of natural quartz crystal, either clear or white in color. The correct ball should choose you as much as you choose it. You might get a feeling that the ball “belongs” to you, or you might see your name reflected in the surface of the ball. A ball three inches in diameter is an ideal size.


Do not buy a crystal ball from a pawn shop, flea market, or other used goods emporium. Such a ball may be imbued with negative energy, and may have been discarded for that reason., Candle lighting works well and provides the right ambiance for a reading. The light source should be in front and ahead of the ball so that when you gaze into it, it is illuminated adequately. If you use electric light, try to use a dimmer so that you can adjust the luminosity. Draw the curtains if you're conducting a reading during the day.

, Cup it carefully in your hands and begin to rotate it slowly from right to left. Rotate the ball at the rate of only about one centimeter every eight seconds. Be careful not to drop the ball, as they tend to be fragile and can break easily. Always hold and move the crystal ball gently, as you would a small baby.

, First, look at the patterns, refractions, and striations with your physical eyes. Continuing to turn the ball over, begin to gaze into the ball with your third eye, the one which perceives psychic energy. You may believe you're entering a trance state and receiving visions from the past, present, or future. The visions may pertain to you or a third party whose energy you perceive and use to guide your crystallomancy session.

Get comfortable.,
Have a partner bring you a series of unfamiliar objects.,
Take an object in your hands.",How to Become a Psychic Reader3," Take a few deep, cleansing breaths. Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards a few times, and roll your neck in a full circle twice clockwise and twice counterclockwise. Relax into a seated position with both feet on the ground and your hands palm-down on your thighs. Close your eyes.

, If you're just starting out, small metal objects work best. For more advanced practice, you might use unwashed clothing. Arrange the objects in front of you and focus on each one in sequence. Let your eye travel from one object to the next, staying conscious of the initial feelings or impressions you get from each.


You may arrange them randomly, but you might sense before arranging them that they belong in a natural order, like pages in a book. Perhaps, for instance, you sense that they belong in a chronological order, with those which were used or produced earliest situated at left, while those which were used or produced later toward the right.

, Turn it over and open your mind to the history it contains. With your eyes closed, allow the visions you see when you touch it to engulf your mind. If you seize on an image in your mind’s eye, or hear a small voice in the back of your mind which you think may reveal details about its owner and their fate, let your partner know.Repeat with all objects.


Try to identify the gender, age, and race of the owner.
Report your impressions with accuracy and ask your partner for verification.
Don't fret if you don't get any impressions. Not every object will inspire a vision.
You might believe that psychometric visions are accurate when they intuitively ""feel"" right; remember, though, they are just random thoughts in your head and not indicative of any actual psychic ability.

Be aware of your surroundings.,
Slow your thinking down.,
Accept the diversity of forms in which a clairvoyant vision may arrive.You may experience a premonition, knowledge about a particular situation or event occurring now or in the future, contact with a god or goddess, or the ability to see a physical aura around certain individuals which indicates their mood or attitude.,
Record any visions or hunches you feel throughout the day.",How to Become a Psychic Reader4," Reach out with your five senses. Psychic ability is a sixth sense which can best be harnessed when your five traditional senses are operating at optimal capacity.Your intuition or extrasensory perception (ESP) will operate best when you are actively listening, looking, and feeling the world around you.

, Next time you’re waiting in class or in the doctor’s office, instead of being bored or impatient, try to relax. Slow your breathing and slowly block out everything except the person or object ahead of you. Focusing your attention this way will free you of distraction. Alternately, change your environment to one with few distractions.


For instance, if you're in a noisy daycare center with many crying babies, you are not in a location where you can easily slow your thinking down. Try moving to your bedroom or another room where you can think clearly.

, When you experience these phenomena, do not be afraid or worried. They are just different forms of the same universal psychic energy which makes a reading possible.

, Utilize these revelations to make positive decisions. Don't be alarmed by the sudden arrival of visions or dreams. Clairvoyant psychic energies can reveal the past, present, or future. Some of this information will be immediately intelligible, while some will require thoughtful interpretation.

Determine what gift you may have.,
Practice meditation.Meditation could prepare you for a psychic reading session of any kind.,
Chant to tap into your psychic power.Chanting will clear your mind of confusion and discord, and could open it to the universal psychic energy.,
Stop worrying.,
Practice.",How to Become a Psychic Reader5," While you might believe that it may be possible to learn any psychic talent, some people believe they have a predisposition towards one or another methods of psychic reading. If you’ve had foreknowledge of certain facts or events (even those not related intimately to someone’s life), you may believe you have claircognizance.If you’ve had accurate visions of the future, some people might think you possess psychic energies which enable clairvoyance.If you hear voices or receive audible directions which you believe are from beyond this plane of existence, you might think you have clairaudience.


While these abilities might manifest themselves in different ways, each could have roots in a common psychic energy which the living, the dead, and the spirit world share.

, Visions you believe to be psychic in nature might arrive when deep in meditation. Assume a comfortable position. Some people like to lie down; others prefer the greater awareness they attain by sitting on a carpeted floor with their legs crossed below them in a rigid posture. Wait for a vision which feels intuitively significant, or which you feel you recognize.

, Chant your personal mantra. This is a short phrase you can use to focus your thoughts and energy. For instance, you might chant ""I am present in the moment."" Chant out loud at first, but wind down towards a silent chant.

, The fear and doubt which follow worry will cloud the mind and lead to confusion. Use mindfulness to stay in the moment rather than reflect on what might happen or what has already happened. When you focus on things you can control, you’ll be able to break the cycle of anxiety and worry that can easily suck you in. Finally, if an issue or problem in your life is so big that you have to worry about and deal with it at some point, try to schedule a time in which to do so, rather than let it take up all your time.When you are confident in yourself and your abilities, you might be able to tap into the positive energy which fuels a successful and accurate psychic reading.

, Take time each day to commune with the world you believe to be spiritual in nature, the world of psychic energy. If you find it hard to develop one particular ability, try your hand at another. It can take many years before an adept (one who might have some psychic power) can become proficient at reading.

Find dowsing or divining rods.,
Hold the rods an arm’s length away from your body.,
Keep the rods steady and straight as you walk.",How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods1," You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel. Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork.If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod. Cut the coat hanger so you have two pieces of wire that are the same length and extend at least one to two feet. You can also use two wire rods of equal length or a pendulum made especially for dowsing from New Age stores or online.
Some divining rods have an L-shape on each end, where the wire extends downward to form an L-shape. You can find L-shaped rods online or at New Age stores.;
, You should then hold the rods in each hand at an arm’s length away from your body. Position the rods so they rest flat over your index fingers and let the butt of the handles rest in the heel of your hands. Do not grip the handles too tightly as the rods need to be able to float freely to work.Hold the rods about 9 inches (23 cm) apart so they do not cross or collide. You may want to practice holding the rods in your hands a few times to get the hang of it.
If you are using one forked stick, you should hold it an arm's length away from your body. Make sure you hold the stick lightly so it can float freely in your hand.

, Once you understand how to hold the rods properly, you should practice walking and moving around while holding the rods. Make sure you keep the rods steady and straight as you walk so they are parallel to the ground.Hold the rods at arm’s length and walk slowly back and forth across the room. Do not let the rod end tip upward or downward as you move as you do not want to move the rods unintentionally with the force of your body or your arms.

Meet the requirements to be an intrepid researcher going where few others wish to tread.,
Research reported sightings.,
Assemble the right equipment.,
Set up a location where you hope to have a Bigfoot sighting.,
Know what you're looking for.,
Wait patiently for your glimpse of Bigfoot.,
Know what to do if you do see Bigfoot.,
Know how to respond if Bigfoot sees you.,
Record your memories of the events.,
Report the incident to local park ranger, or conservation officer, or other authorities.",How to Search for Bigfoot," The requirements sought by the Chinese team give a solid guide on what's needed; following their suggestions, you'll need to be someone who:Has patience (tracking the unknown is a slow and painful process);
Is physically fit

Has a basic background in biology; and
Is capable of taking photographs.
While the Chinese team is reportedly looking for an age range of 25-40the organizer of the Chinese team, Wang Shancai, is 75,so as long as you're fit, healthy, keen and well equipped, you should be set.;
, There have been 2,000 – 6,000 reported sightings of Bigfoot in North America alone,with over 400 sightings in China's Shennongjia forest region.Before you set out, it pays to find a location that has already had multiple sightings. Some of the areas where Bigfoot (or Sasquatch) has been sighted include China, the USA, and Canada.Pay attention to the times, dates, and weather from these sightings to determine the best time to hold your search.
Consider whether this is a location that you're happy to head off to and spend time exploring.

, Most likely you're going back country, so you'll need all the gear required for back country hiking or skiing, depending on the time of year you're searching.


Have adequate warm clothing and layered clothing. Wear sturdy shoes and protect yourself against the elements by covering up adequately with clothes, hats, sunscreen, etc. Avoid wearing anything scented, as this might attract the Bigfoot, or wild animals.
Bring insect repellent if you are searching in spring, summer, or early fall. Insect bites are distracting, and could cause an allergic reaction.
Bring an ointment that could alleviate the itching that occurs after insect bites.
Take adequate sustenance in the form of food and drink to maintain your energy and ensure adequate hydration.
Ensure that you have somewhere to sleep, whether it's a cabin, a tent, or the local motel.
If camping or staying in cabins, take all your camping gear, cooking gear, etc.
Have first aid equipment, communications gear, compass or GPS navigation equipment.
Any suitable items to protect yourself from wild animals such as bear canisters, bear spray, etc., as you're more likely to encounter them than anything unusual.
Take flashlights and headlamps. Bigfoot is said to be nocturnal and to have excellent night vision.In addition, you may like to consider bringing some type of spotlight in case you need to shine it at Bigfoot to confuse him and scare him off.
Have at least one decent camera; you might like to consider a small camera and a larger camera, and maybe a video camera, depending on how convenient these items are. All should be of excellent quality, with telephoto capacity and fast shutter speeds. The quieter that they operate, the better. If you're searching at night, be sure the camera can manage night photography.

, This may include setting up a camera, or bait station. If you plan to stay there and catch a glimpse in person, consider setting up a base camp.

, Sightings of Bigfoot have built up various pictures of what to look for, as follows:Taller than a human ranging between 6–10 feet (2–3 m) tall, covered in hair from head to toe. The hair ranges from black or dark brown, to gray or reddish.
Walks upright.
Weighs a lot, anything in excess of 500 pounds (230 kg) (enough to hurtle heavy things at you if provoked).
Large eyes, pronounced brow ridge, and a large, low-set forehead.
Malodorous, strong odor.
Signs to watch for include very large footprints (up to 24"" (60cm) long and 8"" (20cm) wide), hair caught on bushes, excrement, and a sleeping nest.

, To pass the time, there are some things you might do:


Make notes about your location, preferably a video record, showing how it looked prior to your wait.
Read more about Bigfoot sightings and lore.
Write your own theories about Bigfoot down, perhaps to be published later as a blog post, website, or journal article.

, Try to remain unseen; this is the best possible position for an observer. However, it is thought that Bigfoot has an excellent sense of smell and will probably figure out you're about.Remain calm and do not panic.
Remember to use your camera to record the sighting either by way of photos or film.
Make as little noise as possible.

, Treat Bigfoot with the same respect that you give to any wild animal able to attack and kill you, as well as using your knowledge about the mannerisms and behavior of humans, apes, and monkeys. David Borgenicht and Trey Popp suggest the following:Avert your gaze. Meeting the gaze may be misinterpreted as a challenge for territory or a fight. Use your peripheral vision to monitor its movements.
Keep quiet and move slowly, without any sudden gesticulations.
Restrain your dog if you brought one.
Make yourself appear as non-threatening as possible. Without turning your back to Bigfoot, sit down. Then make out like you're grooming or eating something.
Don't run. Bigfoot is thought to be able to run faster than humans.

, Some things to think about include:


what he or she looked, sounded, or smelled like;
exact date and time;
exact location with a description of the environment (i.e., in woods by swamp);
weather;
other witnesses;
what you, and others, were doing at the time of the sighting; and
anything else noteworthy, such as how much you've been drinking.

, Consider contacting the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization with your report.Preserve the area as if it was a crime scene, to avoid losing or contaminating any evidence. Collect all physical evidence, such as hair, blood, feces.

Seek a unique exception that exists of using blood to supply oxygen!,
Consider and analyze a unique, unparalleled event in creation of the eye or body... How or whether you can find that ""one"" exception!,
Understood (or find and read an explanation) about respiration to support living tissues using red blood cells--such that as you breathe, the oxygen goes throughout ""all"" parts of the body even to the eye, i.e.,
Examine how cells and tissues of your body are otherwise served by hemoglobin, a biomolecule that can temporarily bind to oxygen (the blood's color is due to the red color of hemoglobin in the ""red blood cell.",How to Accept Intelligent Design of the Cornea2," It may be a very special reason.;
, It evidently is very special!

,: the retina has a very rich supply of capillaries to feed those cells to make sight possible. See whether if makes sense to you how it is possible that no red blood cells go to only one living part of the body.


""Yes!"" it does need oxygen.
That tissue is alive, but does not get oxygen from the red blood and hemoglobin (or from any other form of blood).

,"")wikipedia:Red_blood_cells

"
"
Think about being blind if red blood cells could and did spread into the corneal tissues.,
Notice visible light wavelengths can not penetrate the relatively gigantic red blood cells that would interfere with the transmission of light to the retina in the back of the eye.

,
See what you think about this:


""Blood does not go to the cornea, due to its function."",
Consider whether this was a coincidence -- or that it was an ingenious part of the plan to enable the cornea to get its oxygen supply directly from the air.

",How to Accept Intelligent Design of the Cornea3," You would not be able to see at all.

,, But, mother nature originally would have no provision or plans about that. It couldn't see any problem, of course.

""Well, the cornea can never have oxygen delivered by the bloodstream.""
""Why must the cornea get its oxygen directly and not using the heart, lungs and blood.

,"
"
Realize that the cornea has its own private breathing ability, not using the lungs and blood vessels:


The Cornea is composed of 5 cell layers: Epithelium, Bowman's Layer, Stroma, Descemet's Membrane, and Endothelium.,
Think about this--if the cornea did not exist at all or did not have 100% functionality, then the the rest of the lens area (iris, etc.),
Think about this: the rest of the eye couldn't wait for the cornea to clear up.,
Analyze why the worthless blood fed cornea could have waited for the eons (billions of years) that it would evidently have taken for the cornea to become clear (transparent) if it had blood supply--as the eye and cornea never would have had any value at all otherwise because it would be un-sighted (if red blood had supplied the oxygen as with every other part of the vertebrate)!

,
See if you agree that the cornea had to be created in very narrow manner to differ from the rest of vertebrates receiving blood throughout.

,
Consider and explain this:


""The body would only use unknowing; unthinking; unsighted evolution to figure out that blood could not be used to feed the eye its oxygen."",
Deduce whether it is by mere chance that the cornea is the only living, tissue in the entire body to be totally separately supplied with oxygen.",How to Accept Intelligent Design of the Cornea4,"
The cornea protects the rest of the eye from foreign material and germs, but it also acts as the eye's outermost lens, focusing the entry of light into the eye.
The shape of the cornea contributes part of the eye's total focusing power!

, of the eye would lack protection from air and foreign matter and would also lose much of its focusing ability!

, It would have no reason to exist.

,,,
""That mindless system would learn how to not send blood to the cornea.""
""What a stroke of genius by an uncoordinated, unmanaged system called Darwin's or Evolutionary Theory (or not...)"".

, Not through the lungs!

Hold the rods steady in your hands.,
Walk over the area with the rods.,
Wait for the rods to cross or move.",How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods2," Start by holding the dowsing or divining rods steady and straight in your hands, at an arm’s length from your body. Make sure the rod ends are not tipped upward or downward. You should also make sure the rods are 9 inches (22.9 cm) from each other.If you are using a “Y” shaped rod, the rod should be pointed upward at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure you are able to get a good reading of the area.

, Often, water dowsers are called to locate water in a certain area, such as a rural or suburban community. You should hold the rods properly and walk back and forth slowly over the area that you are testing for water. Make sure you hold the rods lightly but with some grip so they do not roll or shift in your hands as you walk., Once the rods detect water, the butt end of the stick should rotate or be pulled downward. The rods may also cross over each other when you stand in a certain spot in the area, indicating there may be water under the surface.It may also help to visualize the water under the earth as you walk over the area with the rods. You may picture a stream or body of water in your mind as you hold the rods to help let the rods know what you are looking for."
"
Relax and visualize the lost object.,
Ask the rods to lead you to the object.,
Let the rods direct you to the object.",How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods3," You can use the dowsing rods to locate objects or items you have lost, such as jewellery. Start by holding the rods properly in your hands. Then, relax and close your eyes. Visualize the object you have lost in your mind.You may want to take a few deep breaths to calm down and relax. Focus your mind on the lost object and try to channel that focus into the divining rods.

, You may ask the rods out loud or internally. You may say, “Where is the object I have lost?” or “Find the object.” This will project your intent onto the rods., You should then hold the rods steady and straight in your hands and let them direct you. Do not resist any pulls or tugs you feel on the rods. You should walk in the direction the rods seem to be leading you to. Eventually, the rods may lead you to the lost object."
"
Visualize the energy in the area or room.,
Ask the rods to lead you to the energy path.,
Let the rods lead you to these areas.",How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods4," You can use divining rods to test the amount of positive and negative energy in an area or a room, known as the “Chi” of the room. You may decide to test the energy levels in your home, your office, or even your garden. Do this by entering the room holding the rods. Then, close your eyes and try to visualize the “Chi” energy in the room. Try to picture an energy path that flows throughout the entire room or area. Don't worry if you are not able to do this, as the rods will help you determine the energy flow or path.The divining rods can help you trace this flow of “Chi”. You can then make adjustments to the set up of the room or space so the “Chi” can flow more freely. This could then make the space feel more positive and uplifting. A room with good energy will have an even amount of “Chi” flowing throughout the room.

, You can do this verbally or internally. You may say, “Can you show me the energy path in this room?” or “Show me how the energy flows in this space.” This will allow you to communicate your intent to the rods., Follow any pulls or tugs on the rod, moving in a path. You should try to walk in every area of the room to determine how it fits within the energy flow of the room. The rods may help to guide you to where the “Chi” is flowing well in the room and where it is not flowing at all.If you notice you are walking in circles as you are lead by the rods, you may then to reposition the rods in your hands and repeat your intention to them again. Ideally, the rods should create a path through the room, touching each area of the room. Any areas that are skipped may need to be adjusted by moving furniture or items in the area to improve the flow of energy.

Practice meditation.,
Record your thoughts and feelings in a journal.,
Consider keeping a dream journal.,
Take time for yourself.,
Talk to a friend about intuition.",How to Be Intuitive1," Meditation is one of the best ways to develop your intuition. When you meditate, you learn how to silence your mind and access your feelings. By meditating on a regular basis, you may develop your intuition and find it easier to call on it when needed.To do a simple meditation, sit in a comfortable, quiet place and close your eyes. As you sit, try to clear your mind. If a thought pops into your head, then acknowledge the thought and then allow it to pass.;
, Writing down your thoughts and feelings each day may also help you to develop your intuition.Try to take about 15 minutes or more every day to record how you are feeling.


Don’t restrict yourself when it comes to journaling. Just write whatever comes to mind. For example, you might write about feeling stressed, describe a positive experience, recall a memory, or even write a poem to express your emotions.

, You might also consider keeping a dream journal to access your intuition.You can use your dream journal to compare your dreams to your waking life to see if you can learn anything from your dream experiences.


To keep a dream journal, place a journal and some paper next to your bed and write down the dreams that you remember as soon as you wake up.
For example, if you have a dream about running away from a friend or coworker, then that may indicate that you feel like getting away from the person. This could be your intuition telling you need to distance yourself from the person a bit more.

, Making time for yourself is also an important way to develop your intuition. When you are alone, make sure that you expose yourself to some things that will allow you to feel and explore your emotions.For example, you can listen to moving music, read poetry or literature, or look at art. Pay attention to the feelings that the music, art, or literature evokes from you and try to consider why you may be reacting in these ways.

, Discussing the idea of intuition with a friend may help you to understand how it works and what you can do to access it.Try asking your friend how he or she accesses intuition and share intuition experiences of your own as well.


You may also consider reading a book about intuition together to learn more about the subject.

Be totally relaxed.,
Rest your elbows at your sides to take the weight of your arms.,
Slowly pull your hands apart about 10 centimetres or 2 inches, then slowly push them back together again, but do not let your finger tips touch.,
Keep moving your hands slowly in and out, concentrating on feeling an imaginary ""balloon"" between your hands until you feel the resistance.",How to Awaken Your Psychic Power to Feel Your Aura," It works best if you are lying down flat on your back, comfortable with your head on a pillow. A great time to try this is once you're off to bed. Close your eyes and relax.;
, Then bring both of your hands together above your belly so that the finger tips of your left hand are touching the finger tips of your right hand. It will almost look like you're praying. When your hands are completely relaxed, your fingers will naturally bend, they should not be forced straight. When your finger tips are touching with your hands relaxed, there should be enough space between your palms that you could hold a soft ball in your hands. This is the starting position.

, If your hands touch, you can no longer feel the aura. The aura leaving each of your hands will form a zone of resistance between your hands, which you should be able to feel as your hands are moving toward one another. It will feel as if you are holding a balloon between your hands, and as your hands move together, you will feel the balloon ""squeeze"".

, Once you've discovered this resistance, you are now feeling your aura. You can now start moving your hands father apart, then back together again slightly to create a bigger balloon. With a little practice, you can feel your aura between your outstretched hands, with your hands as much as 100 centimetres or 36 inches apart.

Wait for the media to spot the new formation.",How to Make a Crop Circle," Making crop circles by yourself would be exceptionally difficult. Convince a friend or a group to join you - the process will be faster and more enjoyable. If you want to join an existing group, do a quick internet search to see if there are any in your area. For example, there is a popular crop circle “art team” called CircleMakers in England.;
, ""Cereal artists,"" or the people who make crop circles as a hobby, generally prefer to work with three crops that correspond to different times of year: rapeseed in April and May, barley in May and June, and wheat from June to early September. These grains will fold down smoothly, and might be your best option for your first crop circle.


Give yourself plenty of time to plan, especially if it’s your first time making a crop circle. You’ll need a few months to get all of the details sorted out and you don’t want to be rushed!

, Obtain permission from the landowner before you start planning. Ideal choices include sloped fields that rise from public vantage points (a road, for instance) and an amphitheater-like valley. Never create a crop circle on someone’s land without permission – this can lead to hefty fines and trespassing charges!

, First, gather the materials to measure your crop circles. You can either use a surveyor’s reel or a 100-ft piece of rope. Next, you need a wooden rod to help you measure accurately. Lastly, buy your “crop flattener,” or a garden roller, at your local garden tools department store.


You can also create your own “crop flattener.” First, drill holes in each end of a light plank. The plank should measure 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 2 meters) long and 3 or 4 feet (1 to 1.2 meters) wide. Tie both ends of a long piece of rope through the holes in the plank. You should be able to comfortably drag the plank behind you with the widest side of the plank flat on the ground.

, Using your pattern as a guide, drag your crop flattener across the crops in the direction of your choosing. Have a partner come behind you and step on the plank as you drag it to help smooth everything out. This will bend the crops into the regular pattern associated with crop circles.


If you want to make a small but perfect circle, anchor one end of the plank onto the ground and turn the free end in a circle around it. This can be useful for incorporating smaller circles into your design., Different angles of a flattened stalk will reflect light differently. If you’re a beginner, it might be best to flatten all the stalks in the same direction – clockwise or counterclockwise. However, if you’re more ambitious, consider alternating the direction in which the crops are flattened to create an interesting lighting effect., Flatten the crops with your feet for smaller lines or complicated designs. Step on the stems of the crop in a side-stepping motion, using the wide part of your foot to sweep the stalks in one direction. Similarly, you can create different sized crop flatteners out of different sizes of boards to create thicker or thinner lines in the crops. Just make sure the boards you use are strong enough to withstand being stepped on.

, Add a hoax-like dimension to your work by making it appear as if aliens authored the crop circles. Create swirled nests in the flattened areas by cleverly weaving stalks. Alternately, melt some iron filings into droplets on-site and sprinkle them around the flattened area to leave ""meteorite particles"" and magnetized stalks.


Make sure to leave the scene by morning! If someone spots you making the crop circles, all of the work you put into creating something “supernatural” will be lost.

, Plan your design using a large-scale map or computer software to get the most accurate circles. Mark on the map the directions you will be flattening, to avoid visible signs of passage (inexperienced circle makers can spoil a design by leaving stripes like a lawnmower would). Initial access is normally through existing farm tracks and trails - scope these out and note their positions on your map before you begin designing.


Start simple. Consider making your first crop circle from an arrangement of discs in a geometric formation. More advanced curved lines can be created by overlapping partial circular arcs.
Some cereal artists spontaneously develop designs once they're in the field. If you do this, make sure everyone in your group understands what the final image will look like.

, Use your map to find the exact location of the exact center and stomp with one foot to create a small circle. This smaller circle will be the starting point for all of your measurements. Drive a wooden pole into the exact center of the smaller circle.Make sure you drive it in deeply enough that the pole doesn't wiggle around while you're taking measurements!

, Attach surveyors tape or a 100-ft rope to the wooden pole and stretch it out as far as you need it to go. This part of the circle is called the radius, or the measurement from the center of the circle to the edge. The surveyors tape (or rope) should be stretched out to a length equaling the radius.As a reminder, the perimeter of a circle is 2πr, where “π” is approximately equal to 3.14 and “r” is the radius of your circle. For example, if you wanted your circle to be 100 feet around, your radius would be 15.92 feet.
If your design needs them, make construction lines by laying rope outlines to shapes. Then flatten circles at the intersection points.

, Enter the field on the tram line. If the field is active, there will be deep tram tracks, also called tractor tracks, crossing it at several points. Walk inside these tracks so as not to make footprints. When you've reached the location of your planned circle, walk off the tracks such that your crop circle will cover your footprints. Leave the same way.

, Avoid the use of flashlights, cell phones, or other prominent light sources. Make sure you know exactly what time the sun will rise so you won’t get caught making crop circles in daylight. Don’t worry about needing flashlights – once your eyes adjust to the darkness in the field it will be easy to see around you.


Consider purchasing a glow-in-the-dark watch as these watches don’t give off a lot of light.

, Some groups, convinced that crop circles are made by UFOs or aliens, stake out certain fields on certain nights. If such a group is active in your area, see if you can find out where they'll be on the night of your planned crop circle event.

, This may take several days, or you can speed the process by making an anonymous call. A good design will provide local newspapers with many column-inches of speculation. Furthermore, the better you hid your tracks, the more likely it will be that your crop circles will be blamed on aliens!

If you plan on sticking to cultural superstitions, make sure you know it’s only symbolic.,
Seek help if your superstitious beliefs are an indication of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).",How to Stop Being Superstitious," One way to overcome your superstitious beliefs is to learn where they come from to begin with. For example, did you know that the belief that it’s bad luck to walk under a ladder came from the idea that it was dangerous to walk in an area where work tools are likely to fall? The more you debunk these superstitions, the more you’ll see that while they may be fun to believe in, they have no foundation in reality.Here are some other surprising origins of common superstitions:


In 18th century London, umbrellas with metal spokes became popular, and opening them indoors became a hazard. Therefore, it became common knowledge that opening an umbrella indoors was considered “bad luck,” though this was really done to keep people safe!The superstition that spilling salt was considered bad luck began in 3,500 B.C., with the ancient Sumerians. However, this came about because salt was such a prized commodity back then, not because spilling salt has any inherent power to influence your luck.Black cats were actually considered to be good luck among some cultures. The ancient Egyptians considered it good luck when a black cat crossed your path, and in the 17th century, King Charles even kept a black cat as a pet. Unfortunately, many people associated cats with witches during the Middle Ages and during the time of the Pilgrims, which makes some people think they are bad luck today.;
, Is there any real reason that the number 13 should be unlucky? Why should black cats be more unlucky than any other cat? Can finding a four-leaf clover really cause good fortune to rain down upon your head? If a rabbit's foot were really lucky, wouldn't the original owner (that is, the rabbit) still own it? Though you may believe that thinking rationally is beside the point when it comes to superstitions, if you want to beat your obsession with them, then you have to use critical thinking to get there.Superstitions lie in age-old traditions. Like many traditions, they continue to be enacted, but they don’t really serve a purpose.

, Are you constantly staring at the ground to avoid stepping on cracks to the point of bumping into people on the street? Do you take winding detours in order to avoid crossing the path of a black cat? The superstitions which cause trouble for you on a regular basis are the ones you should focus on first. Maybe you spent ten extra minutes walking to work because you think that you’re taking the “lucky” path. Maybe you run back home and are late for a dinner date to put on your “lucky” earrings. If you really think about it, you may find that your superstitious beliefs are actually causing you harm instead of bringing you luck.Ask yourself if the anxiety you associate with following different superstitions is really bringing you any good energy.

, When making decisions, rely on common sense and a sound pattern of reasoning as opposed to weird feelings and supposed supernatural signs. If your friend asks you to meet her at a certain place, take the path that makes the most sense instead of the “lucky one.” When you walk to work, wear the clothing that is most appropriate for the weather instead of your “lucky” coat when it’s 80 degrees outside. Let reason govern your choices, not superstition.


Start small. First, if you spill some salt, don't throw it over your shoulder and see what happens. Then, you can build toward avoiding superstitions that scare you more, such as petting a black cat or walking under a ladder.

, While you can't control all the circumstances in your life, you can control how you react to them and what you do about it. This is far more important than being lucky or unlucky. Everyone deals with bad luck from time to time — some people more than others, unfortunately — and while you can’t control the less-than-ideal circumstances you may face, you do have power over trying to face them with a positive attitude, and of making a plan to improve your circumstances, instead of thinking superstitions or rituals can affect the outcome of your life.


It can be comfortable to believe in superstitions because this makes it harder for you to take control over your own life. If you accept that you have the power to make yourself succeed or fail, you’ll naturally be scared or hesitant to move forward.

, Another thing you can do to get into the mindset that superstitious beliefs are irrelevant is to expect the best things to happen for you instead of only imagining the worst possible outcomes in any given situation. If you’re convinced that everything is going to go wrong for you, then you’ll be much more likely to experience a conflict or a setback. If you think that you’re going to have a great day, then it’s much more likely that it will happen for you, and you won’t need to follow any superstitions to get there.


Many people believe in superstitions because they think their lives are filled with bad luck everywhere they turn, and that they need to follow certain superstitions, like not whistling indoors, to ward off the bad luck. If you believe that there is goodness and love everywhere you turn, then you would not need superstitions to give your life meaning.

, Leave your rabbit's foot at home and see how your day goes. Go ahead and step on a few cracks. Pass on by the clover patch. Incorporate the number 13 into your day (spend 13 dollars at the store, send 13 emails to your friends, edit 13 wikiHow articles, etc.) If this is too hard for you to do at once, work on proving just one superstition wrong at a time and see how far you go.


You can even adopt a black cat, if you’re really committed to breaking your superstitious habits. These lovable creatures are the least adopted kitties in the pound and are therefore euthanized the most. If you have your own lovable black kitty, you’ll see that he brings you nothing but good luck and that superstitions have no basis.

, This depends on what works best for you. It may be challenging for you to decide that you’re going to completely break your superstitious beliefs in one day, though you can certainly try it. You can also decide to drop your superstitious habits one by one, to ease the pain. You can leave your lucky rabbit’s foot at home one week, and then, once you’ve gotten over that, you can go up to the thirteenth floor of a building, and so on.


You can keep building up to dropping the most challenging superstitious beliefs for you. It may take months to fully stop following these traditions, but you will be able to make it work.
You may find that it’ll take your mind a while to catch up with you. That is to say, you may drop the superstitious habits but you may find yourself still believing in their power. Give your mind time to catch up with your actions.

, Another way to stop being superstitious is to work on having a positive energy throughout your day. If you have a smile on your face and have hopes for the future, then you won’t be in search of rituals or superstitions that can make sure your day goes smoothly. You should know that you have the power to make good things happen instead of being a victim to rituals and actions with no foundations.


When you talk to people, talk about the things you’re excited about instead of complaining.
Write down 5 good things that happened to you at the end of each day.
Make a habit of being positive and your superstitious beliefs will feel superfluous.

, You may be watching your favorite sports team and may have the urge to cross your fingers, take three sips of your beer, or do whatever you think works to make your team win. Simply throw that nagging thought away and think about something else. After you’ve ignored the urge, take note of how little effect it had on the outcome of the situation. Talk it through with the person you’re sitting next to so you can have confirmation that you should ignore it.If you have to, just count to ten, or up to a hundred in your mind. Focus on something else as you wait for the urge to pass.

, Though a study proved that certain athletes, such as Ray Allen, who are incredibly superstitious about their pre-game rituals do actually perform better when they stick to their superstitions, this isn’t actually because of the rituals these people followed, but because of their belief in the power these rituals have to influence their performance. They may think they’re going to play a great game because they shot 37 free throws from the same place in a row, or because they’re wearing their lucky socks, when in fact, the belief that these things give them power is what makes them do well, not the actions themselves.This means that your lucky rabbit’s foot won’t have any effect on your test performance. It will, however, put you into a positive mindset that allows you to perform well on your test. You need to realize that your mind has the power to generate these positive feelings without the help of any superstitions.
The same goes for believing a superstition brings you bad luck. If you pass a black cat, you may get it into your head that you’re going to have a terrible day at school, and you’re thereby almost guaranteeing that this will happen.

, It can also be a big help to hang out with people who have no superstitious beliefs whatsoever. Watch sports with people who don’t have the need to wear their lucky jersey for their team to win. Hang out with someone who lives on the 13th floor of a building. Walk with someone who steps on every crack in the sidewalk without even noticing. Getting used to the idea that other people can go about their daily lives without caring at all for superstitions can show you that it can be possible for you, too.


You can even pick their brains about how they’re able to go about their daily lives without worrying about cracked mirrors and the like. You may even learn some new strategies for stopping your own superstitious beliefs.

, Some cultures are full of superstitious rituals that make daily life possible. In Russian culture, for example, people believe that hugging in a doorway will cause people to fight, or that stepping over a person who is lying down will keep him from growing. While you may not be able to break these habits, you should make sure you know that you’re just doing them because of a cultural habit, not because they will actually have any effect on what happens. You can still do them, while knowing that they have no power at the same time.


If you participate in these rituals with other people of your culture, have a talk to them about how you’re trying to break your superstitious habits. They may be hurt or try to discourage you, at first, but they should understand.

, It’s one thing if you’re just terrified of black cats or have a few rituals that you can’t break. But if you feel like your life is governed by a series of rituals and that you can’t go about your daily life without following a very specific routine and panic if you have to do something unexpected, then your superstitious beliefs may actually indicate that you suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder. If this is the case, then you may not be able to stop being superstitious on your own, and your best bet may be to see a doctor to discuss the next steps in anxiety management.Don’t be ashamed of admitting that you have a real problem and that rituals have taken over your life. The sooner you get help, the better.

Set the stage.,
Assume a comfortable position.,
Obtain an image of the place or time you wish to explore.,
Focus on the image.,
Chant your personal mantra.,
Close your eyes and reach out to the universe.,
Reengage with your physical body.",How to Become a Psychic2," Are you in search of guidance? Personal growth? Enlightenment?

, A room lit only by candlelight will provide a quiet, meditative space. A room bathed in moonlight will also bring you peace and give your projection experience an ethereal quality.

, Some people like to lie down; others prefer to simply recline in a wide-backed chair or sofa.

, Try to use an image that has a variety of elements and a high level of detail.


If you don't have a good image, or wish to explore an a temporal world, you can simply envision the place you wish to go.You can also achieve astral projection by envisioning your body lying prone, then “zooming out” from the perspective of a balloon rising higher and higher.

, Gaze at your chosen image at least thirty minutes. Let your eye wander over each object or element of the image in a slow, repetitive cycle.

, This is a short phrase you can use to focus your thoughts and energy. For instance, you might chant ""I am present in the moment.""


You can chant out loud at first, but wind down towards a silent chant.

, Picture yourself in the time or place you wish to explore, or visiting the individual you want to contact.

, One tried and true method is to envision yourself falling down into your physical body again. You could also simply envision your physical body in the place you left it and recognize your desire to return to it. "

Learn to tune into your body.,
Look for positive physical reactions.,
Watch for negative physical reactions.,
Write about your intuitive responses.",How to Be Intuitive2," Your physical reactions to people and situations can be a powerful way to see what your intuition is telling you. When you are out in social situations (at parties, at work, on a date, etc.) do regular checks of how you feel physically. These regular checks should help you to stay tuned into your body and look for clues about the situation.As you go through your day, try asking yourself, “How do I feel? Where do I feel it? Is it a good feeling or a bad feeling?”

, If you are having a positive reaction to a situation or person, then you might notice that your body is exhibiting those signs. For example, you might notice that you are leaning in to talk to the person, smiling, making eye contact, and laughing. You might also notice that you feel calm and happy. These feelings would indicate that you are having a positive reaction.If you are having a positive reaction, then your intuition might be trying to tell you that the person or situation is a good one. For example, if you felt this way on a date, then your intuition might be telling you that the date is going well.

, Your body can also send you signals that indicate a negative reaction to a situation. For example, you might notice that your stomach is cramping, that you feel nauseous, or that you are crossing your arms or clenching your fists. You might also notice that you feel anxious, frightened, or sad. These reactions would indicate that you are having a negative reaction.If you are having a negative reaction, then your intuition might be telling you that the situation or person is a bad one. For example, if you feel this way every time you arrive at work, then your intuition might be telling you that it is time to look for a new job.

, After you have experienced an intuition, take some time to write about it. Describe what happened, how you felt, and what you did. Recording these responses may make you more aware of them in the future and make it easier to keep strengthening your intuition.For example, after meeting someone new, you might write down how your body and mind reacted to meeting that new person. Recording your feelings might also make it easier to access your intuition the next time you meet someone new.

Immediately write down the basics of your experience.,
Include as many details about the object(s) as possible.,
Note their size and how far away the objects likely were.,
Include details on the shape of the craft.,
Note the weather at the time of the sighting.,
Include any pictures or video.,
Take note of any impediments you were facing at the time.,
Write it all together in a cohesive, engaging report.,
Choose which agencies to report your sighting to.,
Fill out their form to the best of your ability.,
Be ready for further questioning or a request of evidence.,
Never pay anyone to exhibit your experience.,
Put the video up on YouTube.,
Contact your local TV stations.,
Report it to general media outlets.,
Join a local UFO organization.,
Be prepared for naysayers.",How to Report a UFO Sighting," Regardless of where you file your report, you need the same basic set-up. It’s best to do this immediately after the sighting so everything is fresh in your head. When it’s fresh, it’s more likely to be accurate. You'll use this information to file a report to specific agencies. Here's what to start with:Number of witnesses (to be valid, there needs to be at least 1 other person)
Time
Location (if you live next to an Air Force base or other similar area, your report may be discarded)
Number of objects seen
Do ‘’not’’ include your personal information in the body of the report. It will have to be removed later.;
, The more details you have, the more convincing your story will be (or the easier it will be to determine if it’s something else). Think back to experience. These are the aspects you should cover:


Lights (How many were there? Were they flashing or solid?)
Color (Did the color ever change?)
Brightness (Compare it to another object, if possible)
Motion (How fast did it go? Did it move up and down? Back and forth? Smoothly or erratically?)
Behavior (Did the object move or land, emit lights, sounds, or other objects?)
Interactions with space (Did it engage with other aircraft in the vicinity, produce electrical or magnetic effects, such as a car engine stopping?)
Trail, haze, etc. (Was there an aura or haze around the object, any cloud or smoke trails from the object?)

, Think of holding up an object at arm’s length to block the view of the UFO.Would you need a dime? A cookie? A plate? Something in between? This may be about as close as you can get.


Think of the other objects around to determine how far away it was. Was it well above the trees? Hills? Power lines? Satellite towers? This can help you assess it's apparent distance.

, There are a few common standards currently known – does your experience fall in line with any of these shapes?



Saucer: there are three varieties – domed (stereotypical), lenticular (pistachio-shaped), and lenticular with dome

Hat: there are three varieties – conical hat, double hat, and flat top straw hat

Sphere: a standard circular shape

Saturn: in the shape of the planet, as if the object has rings

Ellipsoidal: egg-shaped when hovering, football-shaped while flying

Cylindrical: this object looks like a giant cigar

Dirigible: shaped like a pointy bullet; generally followed by a luminous plume

Triangle/boomerang: wedge-shaped or v-shaped, like a boomerang

, The better the weather (fewer clouds, no rain, etc.) the more reliable your story will be and the harder it will be to argue you didn't see what you saw. However, that being said – don't be tempted to lie if it was bad; it's quite easy to find out what the weather actually was that day if need be.


If it was cloudy or rainy, explain how that affected your vision. Did it obscure anything, even if just partly, from view? Did anything change as the clouds parted or as the rain lifted? Could anything you saw be due to visual distortion from clouds or other natural phenomena?

, One of the most effective ways to make your sighting convincing is to include pictures or video – good pictures or video, that is. Don’t bother fabricating something – UFO hoaxes have been around long enough that most can be debunked.


The best photos aren’t digital. In fact, negatives (on tangible film) are best to prove it hasn’t been tampered with. If it is digital, don’t even think about even so much as resizing it. If it’s been changed from its original form even in the minutest detail, it might get thrown out.
The best videos have other objects in them for reference and are stationary, so you can see the UFO’s movement, instead of a video that’s panning along with them.

, Were your senses impaired or impeded? These may be similar to points a law enforcement agent would cover. Think of the following details (and be honest):


Objects between you and the UFO that obscured your view
If you were wearing contacts or glasses at the time of the sighting
If you were wearing headphones or anything to impair or prevent your hearing
If you had a cold or anything preventing your olfactory sense from working properly
If you were taking prescription drugs, or under the influence of alcohol or other drugs

, Break it up into paragraphs to make it easy to read. Include any specific knowledge you have from your background that aids the story (for example, if you’re a pilot or have flight/mechanical training).


It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be typed up (you'll likely submit it online, so you can just copy and paste it over) and spell-checked. The better it is constructed, the more it will be taken seriously.
Include a drawing of the UFO. Do your best to show relative size, shape, lights, etc.

, There's a lot of junk out there online, but there are a few reputable sources. A UFO witness should report a sighting to the following reliable organizations:


Local law enforcement agencies
National UFO Reporting CenterMutual UFO NetworkCenter for UFO StudiesAlien UFO ResearchSome of these agencies have hotlines if you would rather make a phone call. However, most reports are now done via the Internet.



, Each website has it's own form to fill out, but they are all essentially the same – the details you constructed together about your experience. Your personal information shouldn’t be in the actual report; it should be in the form on the website (or given to the operator on a hotline).


The additional questions will vary from your age and background to your beliefs and your habits prior to that night. It’s all with the purpose of weeding out the people that are mistaken or trying to start a hoax.
You are completely welcome to file a report with every agency. In fact, it may not be a bad idea. The more resources you tap into, the more likely you are to get results.

, If your report is valid and intriguing, you may be requested for interviews. If the process continues on, your camera may be requested and you may even be asked to go under oath. This type of thing is taken very seriously; if you’re just having fun, you will be found out.


If you prefer to remain anonymous, most (if not all) forms can accommodate you. This will not affect how your report is processed. Only in incredibly rare situations will you be asked to name yourself (if you have undoubtable footage, for example).

, There are tons of websites out there that are scams. If you have a true experience, only go to reputable sources. Do your research beforehand and never have anyone “sell your story” for you. It’s yours. You get to do with it as you please.

, There are already thousands of UFO videos on YouTube, but only the good ones become popular. If you have a good video, put it up! It may go viral before you even know it.


Ignore the comments. YouTube is infamous for people using it as a platform to be disparaging and ridiculous. For every person that is negative, there's someone else who finds your video fascinating.

, If you have good pictures or video and some particularly interesting details you could offer the general populace, contact your local TV station for news coverage. It's possible other people had the same experience. Some may need someone else to speak up for them and convince them they saw what they think they saw.


Of course, only do this if you're comfortable going in front of the camera and being a local celebrity. Alternatively, you could choose to remain anonymous in this realm as well.

, In addition to TV, there's also newspapers, magazines, and radio. It doesn't have to be local either; nowadays, all of us live in a global village connected by the Internet. Contact a few blogs or websites devoted to reports and add your experience to their archives. Every detail gets us closer to the truth.


There are hundreds of organizations out there (ranging from the small and silly to the large and serious) looking for more data to prove that we're not alone. Just make sure in doing this that you're working with people you can trust. Never give out any of your personal information that could compromise your identity.

, Many big cities (and some smaller ones) have groups of people dedicated to proving or debunking UFO stories. Some take the gig very seriously and for others it's just a way to kill time after work. Either way, it'll be a great method to meet with others who have likely had similar experiences and who can help you sort out what you saw.


They can also point you in the right direction of who you should talk to to get your voice heard. These organizations sometimes have more credibility that a single individual can have and therefore may receive more positive, immediate reception.

, When the topic of anything supernatural comes up, people are always on both sides of the fence. There will be people who hear your story and deem you certifiably crazy, and that's fine. There will also be people who are inspired and wish they'd have their own experience. Don't let anyone's opinion get to you. It doesn't really matter what they think anyway.


The bigger you go (TV, YouTube, etc.) the more naysayers there will be. In certain situations, there may be a backlash. If you're concerned about this, keep your name out of the equation. However, most cases don't receive enough publicity for this to become an issue.

Pray or meditate on a question.,
Spend time in nature.,
Try a blind reading.",How to Be Intuitive3," Your intuition can also help you find the answers to difficult questions. To find an answer to a question that has been plaguing you, you may want to spend some time praying about it or meditating on it to see how your intuition responds.For example, you might start your prayer or meditation by asking out loud (or in your head), “What should I do about ___?” Then, try to clear your mind and await a response.

, Taking a break from intrusive technologies like phones, computers, and televisions can allow you a chance to get in touch with your intuition and find answers to your questions.Try taking a walk outside, alone, and without any devices that might distract you. As you walk, focus on your surroundings and try not to dwell on your question. Just allow your mind to wander and look for cues from the natural world.

, A blind reading may also help you to find an answer to a difficult question. In a blind reading, you try to figure out what your intuition is telling you by writing down three solutions and feeling out your response to those solutions.Think about your question, then write the three most likely solutions on three separate index cards.
Then, shuffle the cards and place them face down on a table.
Next, hold your hand over each card and rate your attraction to that card on a scale of one to 10 (with 10 being the highest).
After you have rated each of the cards, turn them over and see which solution you were the most drawn to without knowing what was on the other side of the card.

Do darshana (seeing the image of the God).,
Worship the qualities of the God.,
Say a prayer.,
Follow up your prayer.",How to Pray in Jain Temples," Along with the darshana, chant the most fundamental prayer, the Namokara Mantra nine times. The Namokara Mantra is dedicated to Pañca-Parameṣṭhi (Sanskrit for ""five supreme beings""), a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The Namokara Mantra:Ṇamō Arihantāṇaṁ- I bow to the Arihantas (Omniscient beings)

Ṇamō Siddhāṇaṁ- I bow to the Siddhas (Liberated souls)

Ṇamō Ayariyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Acharya S (""Preceptors"")

Ṇamō Uvajjhāyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Upadhyay (Preceptors of less advanced ascetics)

Ṇamō Lōē Savva Sāhūṇaṁ- I bow to all the monks;
, The eight qualities of Siddhas are:infinite faith or belief in the tattvas or essential principles of reality.
infinite knowledge
infinite perception
infinite power
fineness
inter-penetrability-It means that the liberated soul does not hinder the existence of other such souls in the same space.

agurulaghutva – literally, neither heavy nor light. Due to this quality of agurulaghutva, the jīva (soul) continues to manifest through its form, complete and perfect.
infinite bliss

,




""I bow to the Lord, the promulgator of the path to liberation, the destroyer of mountains (large heaps) of karmas and the knower of the whole of reality, so that I may realise these qualities.""


You can also say special prayers. For this, see the symbol below the image to identify the Tirthankara to whom the image is dedicated. For example, if the image is dedicated to Tirthankara Mahāvīra (symbol-lion), you may say the following verse:


Namāh śri Vardhamāna-e nirdhutakalilātmane
Sālokānāma trilokānāma yadā-vidyā darpanāyate!
Tr.- I bow to Śri Vardhamāna Mahāvīra who has washed off the impurities of karmic filth from His Soul, In Whose Perception scintillate the three Worlds and the infinity of Space, as in a mirror.



, After darshana, you can sit and do meditation. You can also use a rosary (present in all Jain temples) to chant the sacred mantra, the Namokara Mantra.

, God promises to show you His will in John 16:13, ""However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come."" Jeremiah 33:3, ‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’

, Help me to show your Love to others. Pray with thankfulness: ""Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving."" Colossians 4:2

, Forgive so that you can be forgiven! Be a peacemaker and peace keeper...

, Words of faith in God are the most powerful things in the Universe. God said, ""Let there be light"" and there was light. It was His will. Yes, it's like the law of gravity will tell you that you can't last very long walking in the air. So you must believe God's promises (His will.) are laws that are as sure as gravity. Believe to receive.

, That is what it is: it's yours. You must continue praising God for the answer whatever it is--even if you do not agree with the timing or the way it comes.

,,, Go forward believing; look up and expect the answers to happen, and leave them to the power of the will of God. If your dreams don't come true don’t get depressed and most of all don't loose hope. Always remember that God may be preparing a better dream for you to fulfill. Remember also that in every failure and success there is always a reason. When God closes one door, He opens another.

,;
, He sees it all.

, It will never work!

,



Justice is coming and ""you shall receive the desires of your heart,"" so watch the bad attitudes or your ""rewards"" can be opposite of your desires whether in the short or long run.

,


One is never perfect, but ""God is always just."" He knows how one accepts His good graces, gifts, shares his abilities, and knowledge and how one, then forgives those who seek forgiveness and does not despise the weak or hopeless.

, And, believe that He is already answering your prayer... it's that little thing called ""faith""!""Do not fret... or be envious of those who do wrong... 'Trust' in the LORD, and 'do good'... 'Delight' yourself 'in the LORD' and he will give you the desires of your heart. 'Commit' your way to the LORD..."" Psalms 37:1 - 5 "

Revere God: Do what it takes for following Christ, and to maintain your reverence for God.,
Pray thankfully and praise God and end your prayers positively.,
Increase (or start) thanking, and praising, and lifting up (be a booster of) God and Jesus for any good things (called blessings) in your life.,
Stop harboring sin in your life: Yep, this would kill it from the get-go!,
Forgive others: Live as God's child that He loves ""positionally"" in Christ, and you will be in His joy forever, including in sorrow He's your comfort (joy).,
Obey God: John 15:7, ""If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."",
Believe, never doubting.,
See the results and be inspired.,
Confirm God's will in prayer, for God is not mocked: as whatever a man plants into other lives and hearts, he will also harvest.

,
Ask for God's will to be done.,
Stand firm without giving up: Sometimes God wants us to persist in prayer...,
Love your enemy and never treat others wrongly.,
""Bless and curse-not"".,
""Pray without ceasing"" 1 Thessalonians 5:17.,
Open up towards God, and ask Him what you will in faith.",How to Pray Effectively (Christianity)," Know that He is mighty, is the creator of the Universe and deserves glory, praise and honor. Your prayer life should acknowledge the Lord in His rightful place in your life.;
, Overcome attitudes like unnecessarily emotional begging and pleading to God 'at bedtime' because -- for example this might cause upset sleep and bad thoughts can lead to bad dreams; be peacemaker in your own mind: how -- believe that God already knows and wants for you what you need and rightly desire (not coveting or envying). Then give thanks in advance, expecting good results (that's trusting). There is, of course, a time and a place for that pained, pleading and begging: ""work out your salvation with fear and trembling"", anytime you like, but bedtime is not always the best time. Though, happiness is not the goal -- rather ask for joy in whatever you experience -- for trying to stop anxious thoughts or bad dreams, ask the Lord to show you the root cause of these and take them to him in meaningful prayers (personalized), believing. Colossians 4:2, ""Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"" -- and everyday thanksgiving can bring peace into your life!

, God and Jesus have promised to bless one who blesses others and who thanks God for blessings.

, God can not look upon sin. I Corinthians 6:9-10, ""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""

, Yet, you need to access His righteousness and forgiveness, remembering that you must also forgive, or you will not be forgiven ""relationally"" as a friend (and follower). So that you yourself may be more pleasing in His eye, always forgive, as it comes back to you in kind! Mark 11:25, ""And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.""

, Notice what you will should be in His pleasure for you. Sin is disobedience and separates us from Him (out of His pleasure). The Holy Spirit will not dwell in an unclean temple; therefore you must repent often, be saved once and remain yielded to the will and the grace of God. Whatever you plant into the lives of others grows in your own life, i.e.: ""You reap what you sow.""

, Be wise enough to pray for what you want and be sure that you have the wisdom to believe when you pray, and so you shall receive. Faith makes it possible. James 1:5-8,
""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.""

, How? Make a prayer journal or a prayer list of things, people and missions you pray about. Your prayer journal may enable you to keep up with the progress in the things you pray about. But be careful. Your prayer journal is a list of things to pray about. However, it's not a score card to grade God's answers.

,, ""Study to show yourself approved, unto God,"" and to know the mind of God and His will from His written word.

, When we quit: that's it. Ephesians 6:13-14, ""... and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, ...""

, Love one another as He has loved you. Love mercy and do it! And if they are sick you should pray for them to be healed Matthew 7:12, ""Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.""

, Seek goodwill and the good of others in all you do or say! Pray for God to bless your enemies with good things. Considering that is a direct instruction from His word, we need to practice that whether we like it or not.

, Remain in a spirit of thankfulness and gratitude: blessing others for God hears such things as a living prayer, and it counts as praying ceaselessly as you glorify God as you treat others as you would want to be treated. And whatever you do to the least of these, you do to the Lord, good or bad.

, God obviously knows every aspect of your life (lying won't help), and He knows your struggles and sins. He knows how you feel. He loves and cares for you without limit. Since He is love and mercy, He doesn't unfairly favor anyone because He created and seeks to heal and save all of us if we have faith and follow in God's will.



Jesus said:""When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.""Matthew 6:5-6
Jesus also said:""When you pray, do not keep on babbling like Pharisees, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.""Matthew 6:7-8
Pray with right motives, not self-serving. Let your thoughts be of good reasons, and when you pray ask yourself whether it is going to bring glory to God or not. (James 5:3)

Prayer is simply talking out loud to the one who created you.,
The most powerful prayers are not the ones spoken in old English formality but straight from the most vulnerable place inside you, your heart.,
It is beneficial to get someplace private, that if you need to yell, stomp, cry or talk out loud, you can without anyone hearing or seeing you.,
Start speaking out loud.,
Let there be silence between your sentences.,
Are you feeling your world has somehow expanded?,
These are a few common side effects of God acknowledging and responding to your prayer.

,
As a note: Prayer is considered a way to change the outcome of circumstances and events that entangle our lives.",How to Pray For Relief," There are many ways, formulas,and kinds of prayers but here is just a simple start to get you some relief. This is in no way all there is on prayer but simply a start point.;
, Talk as though you were telling your most trusted mentor what is bothering you, where you failed, where it hurts, etc.

, (beneficial, but not an absolute need)

, What do you say? Just start out ""God, I need you."" (suggestion: you may want to simply say it slowly again and again until you mean it) then just start emptying yourself out by saying whatever is inside you, unedited. Most people find it helpful to close their eyes to help focus on their inner turmoil. Be honest to what you are saying and feeling. For example: ""God, I'm feeling ... Numb, scared, overwhelmed, angry, wronged, out of control"". Empty yourself out of all the held back, pent up stuff buried inside you.... This may take some time at first. And if you need to yell, or cry now is the best time to let it all out. Speaking honestly is power here. Once you are empty. Then just tell him ""God, I need you I can't handle all this by myself, please help me."" (you may want to repeat this until you mean it)

, In the silence listen with your whole self. Listen , is there suddenly a word in the back of your head like ""let go of it"" or ""forgive"" or ""mercy"" or maybe a picture of someone you are at odds with? Listen and pay attention. Once you have resolved the inner turmoil you will begin feeling comfort,like being with a close friend. Are you feeling peaceful, like everything is going to be ok - even though nothing you know of has changed? Relaxed? Are you feeling like an invisible barrier of protection is surrounding you? One of the most common side effect of prayer is falling asleep during it - that is real peace. Are you feeling connected to something greater, that you somehow are not alone in the moment?

, That you are not limited only to the resources you can see, touch and feel? Do you suddenly know what you need to do to make things right between you and the other person?

,, There are many people across all walks of life and cultures that have a story or testimony to a simple prayer and then how events took a sudden turn in their favor.

"
"
Get a notebook or a card file of some kind.,
Make your prayers effective... and remember, you might have to keep praying for these things, etc... so review them later.

,
Record your requests to God in your notebook or cards.,
Keep up with each prayer's progress by reading over them occasionally and rejoicing in hope and the achievements.

,
Keep a separate place in the record book or among your cards for noting just how and when each prayer is answered.,
Give God your honor, praise and thanks when your prayers are answered, and on a daily basis, of course.",How to Keep a Prayer Record," A small one (a few cards) that you can keep with you would be just perfect.;
,, You might want to separate your items of prayers according to what kinds of prayers too--and cards make that task simple. You can have several dividers in your notebook or different colors of ink or colors of cards.

,, The back of the cards could be for this follow through. You can date and number the pages or cards to keep them in order.

, Glorify God by how you react and how you live from day to day--in every way honor God.

In order to get rid of many forms of bad luck you can take a pinch of salt and throw it over your LEFT shoulder (throwing salt over your right shoulder will bring you more bad luck).


Alternatively, you can cleanse your body of bad luck by bathing in salt water. Simply add two tablespoons of salt to a bath of hot water.






Another method is to sprinkle sea salt in the corner of each room and underneath each windowsill. This will protect your home from bad luck.;
, If you break a mirror you should never just throw the pieces away. This will effectively seal your fate and give you 7 long years of bad luck.


You can either take all of the pieces of the mirror and grind them down to dust and scatter it in the wind or take a single piece of the mirror (big enough to reflect but not big or sharp enough to be dangerous to yourself or anything else) and wait until the next full moon.
Depending on how close you are to the full moon you'll still get bad luck for a small while but if you use the mirror to reflect the full moon and gaze into it, it nullifies the bad luck. You can then bury the piece of mirror or keep it.

, Burning incense is an effective way to get rid of bad luck and negative energy.


Choose pungent scents like sandalwood or jasmine, and if you are burning more than one stick, make sure to use an odd number rather than an even number.
If you are experiencing bad luck in your personal life, burn the incense at home. Carry the incense from one room to the next, letting the scented smoke fill all four corners of your home.
If you are experiencing bad luck at work, burn the incense in your office.

, Small, protective charms are a great way of warding off bad luck as you go about your daily life. They can be worn on a chain or bracelet or carried around in a pocket. Some of the most common ones include.



Keys: Key charms have been used to bring good luck since ancient times. Wearing three keys together is said to unlock the three doors of of wealth, health and love.







Shamrock and clover: Wearing fresh shamrock or clover, or wearing a charm in the shape of the rare four-leafed clover is a popular method of bringing good luck in Celtic mythology. Each of the four leaves represent a lucky characteristic; wealth, fame, love and health.







Horseshoe: Horse shoes are said to be lucky, as they ward off the ""evil eye"". Hang one in your home for protection or wear a Horseshoe symbol on a chain - just make sure the ends are pointed upwards, otherwise the good luck can ""escape"".







Rabbit foot: A rabbit's foot is believed to bring good luck and protection in many cultures. However, not any foot will do - it must be the left hind foot. In addition, the foot must be stroked or rubbed in order to activate the good luck., Sage has been burned by people of various cultures for years as a way of clearing out negative energy. The practice of burning sage is known as smudging.


Buy a stick of sage or some dried sage and light it up. It should smolder rather than burn. Carry the sage around your home, waving the smoke away from you into every corner of the house.
Open the doors and windows to let the negative energy exit. If you like, you can burn some sweetgrass afterwards to invite positive energy into your home., Various crystals and stones are believed to have mythical properties, ranging from protection, to warding off negative energy to bringing good luck. Keep these crystals or stones in your home, place of work, or carry them on your person.


Black tourmaline will protect you from negative energies, such as the ill-wishes of others. Rose quartz will encourage positive energy to replace the negative.
Labradorite will protect you from psychic vampires or leeches, who will attempt to suck your energy and positive emotions from you.
Amethyst will protect you from harm while travelling, and protect soldiers from harm.
Other stones that can be used for protection from negative energies or evil spirits include: ruby, quartz, peridot, obsidian, jasper, moonstone, black onyx, emerald, turquoise, blue topaz, sugilite, citrine, carnelian and bloodstone., One of the best ways to change your luck is to earn yourself some positive karma by doing good deeds. This is a way of repaying for any bad things you've done in this life or a previous one.


Improve your karma by making a donation to charity, or by helping people in need, such as the homeless, elderly people or orphaned children.






It is important that you do these good deeds out of a sincere desire to help others. If you are only performing good deeds to win good karma and make your own life easier, the action is voided.Engaging in charity work will also help to put your own situation in perspective - you may think you have suffered from bad luck, but once you see the suffering of others you may realize that your situation is not so bad.







, Fresh flowers can be used to cleanse your seven chakras - getting rid of negative energy and inviting new fortune.


You will need at least seven different types of flowers, in as many colors as possible (any color but white). Remove any stems and leaves, you just need to flowers themselves.
Place the flowers in a basin of water and put it outside to soak in the sun for an hour. This allows the water to soak up the positive energy of the flowers.
Bring the basin to the bathroom and use a washcloth to bathe in the flower-energized water. As you bathe, concentrate on a patch of light emanating from the center of your forehead. Allow this light to spread all over your body.
When you have finished bathing, carefully collect the flowers, place them in a paper bag and dispose of them. Imagine your bad luck being thrown away with the flowers., Praying to God, or whatever spiritual being you believe in can help you to regain good luck. Remember to pray regularly, and ask for forgiveness for past wrongdoings and negative thoughts.Take some time during your prayer sessions to reflect on who you are as a person and whether you could take any steps to better yourself.






Thank God for all of the good things in your life - this simple action could change your perspective on your perceived ""bad luck"" and make you realize that you are, in fact, blessed.







, Living in an untidy home can block positive energies from flowing through the house and create negative feelings and bad luck. This simple action can give you renewed energy and empower you to change your luck from bad to good.


Start by decluttering your home - remove any unwanted or disused items and throw them away. Then give your house a thorough cleaning - clearing cobwebs and removing dust.






Try rearranging your furniture, to improve the flow of energy and repaint your walls to bring new life to your living space.






Try listening to music and burning incense while you work and leave all of the doors and windows open to let the sunshine in - this will encourage positive energy to flow into your renewed living space., Introducing bright light into your home is an effective way of getting rid of bad luck and diffusing negative energies.


Try turning on all of the lights in your house and lighting candles, so there are no dark spots for bad energies to hide in.






One practice which uses the power of light to protect you from bad luck and attract good luck in its place is to light three candles - two of them must be white, one for protection and one for cleansing, and the other one must be orange, to bring about a change in luck.







, Traveling to another country is said to get rid of bad luck, as the bad luck gets left behind and will disperse in your absence. The further you can get away from your home country, the better.


Crossing an ocean or flying to somewhere in a different time zone works best.Travelling could also help you to realize that the bad luck is not on you, but on your house or job situation.






Taking some time away may help you to understand the changes that need to made on your return, in order to get rid of bad luck.







, Many superstitions regarding things that bring bad luck are well known, but it is a good idea to recap on the main ones. This way you can try to strategically alter your behavior to avoid bad luck. Even if the bad luck is unavoidable, you will be able to recognize the signs and take immediate steps to reverse the it. Some common indications of bad luck include:


Breaking a mirror - this is said to bring seven years of bad luck.






Seeing a crow - if a crow crosses your path, it is said to be bad luck. However, if two cross your path, the bad luck is reversed.
Walking under a ladder- this is believed to be bad luck as a ladder leaning against the wall forms a triangle - symbol of the Holy Trinity. By walking through the triangle you are violating sacred ground.






Putting shoes on any table - In England, putting shoes on the table was said to be a sign of respect for a dead miner. Therefore, by putting shoes on the table you are tempting fate.






""Jinxing"" yourself - this means saying out loud something bad that you think will happen to you. This is a form of tempting fate. To reverse it, knock 3 times on a table or any other surface but, make sure your knocking can be heard.






Wearing opals is believed to be bad luck - unless you were born in the month of October
Stepping on a crack in the pavement/sidewalk. As the old saying goes: ""step on a crack and fate will break your mother's back!""






Having a black cat cross your path is said to be bad luck. This superstitions comes from black cats' association with witches and magic.
Opening an umbrella indoors is considered to be bad luck - a superstition that comes from the Ancient Egyptians (who used umbrellas for shade). In those times, opening an umbrella indoors was believed to be an insult to the God of Sun.







, Some superstitions are less well-known. It is a good idea to read up such superstitions and be aware of the risks associated with certain actions, otherwise you may inadvertently bring bad luck upon yourself. Examples of some of the less well known causes of bad luck are:


Picking a penny up if it is tails up.
Getting dressed with your left arm/left leg first.
Seeing an owl during the day
Knitting a pair of socks for your boyfriend - he'll walk away from you.
Killing ladybugs or spiders (especially money spiders).
It is bad luck to close a pocket knife unless you were the one who opened it.
""Sleeping with feet towards a door will lose you your soul forevermore""
If an owl hoots three times in your garden.
Sleeping on or under a dinner table.
Starting a venture on a Friday.
Killing a bee within your home.
Turning a loaf of bread upside down once it has been sliced will bring you terrible luck.
Saying the word ""Pig"" at sea.
If you ever drop a knife, picking it up yourself will bring you bad luck in money and love. You should ask someone else to pick it up for you.
To start a new venture, meet someone new, or start a relationship on Friday 13th.
Stabbing needles though your yarn balls brings bad luck to anyone who wears something made from that yarn.
If you buy a new pair of shoes, you must wear them on the wrong feet first or you will have bad luck whenever you wear them

, Most superstitions only foretell bad luck, however some superstitions also foretell death and sickness. You should definitely familiarize yourself with these:


If a robin flies into a room through a window, death will shortly follow.
You must hold your breath while going past a cemetery or you will breathe in the spirit of someone who has recently died.
If you open your front door and are greeted by a magpie staring at you, this is a sure sign of death
If you dream of death it's a sign of a birth, if you dream of birth, it's a sign of death.
If the left eye twitches there will soon be a death in the family.
A white moth inside the house or trying to enter the house means death.
Dreaming of white is believed to foreshadow death.

, Once you have taken some positive actions to get rid of your bad luck, it is important that you stay alert to signs that your luck is changing. Examples of such signs include:

Let go of past mistakes.",How to Lead Worship," Know what worship is and is not. Worship should be all about praising God, and as a worship leader, your main purpose is to encourage the entire congregation to praise God through song and prayer.


Instead of modeling personal worship on stage, focus on leading community worship.
Worship is not a time to show off your own talents or worry about making yourself look good. You may not mean to glorify yourself, but pride often finds its way in undetected, so keep a watchful eye out for it.;
, Give thanks to God for the opportunity to lead others in the act of worshiping Him, and ask for the guidance, humility, and courage to make the worship session a good one.


A few things worth considering as you pray may include:Understanding of the lyrics you sing and the ability to convey that understanding
Love for the people you lead
Wisdom in selecting the songs and verses used for worship
The ability to act on the truths you sing and speak
The humility to lead in a way that glorifies God instead of yourself or the congregation
The ability to guide the congregation to an improved relationship with God



, Find out from the pastor what that week's lesson will be about and try to choose songs around that theme. Doing so will make the entire service seem more cohesive and meaningful.


You'll also need to pick out short scriptural verses that go along with the songs and the overall lesson, as well.

, The idea is to get others to actively participate in worship by singing along. If the congregation doesn't feel comfortable singing that songs you've chosen, they probably won't sing.


People generally don't sing songs that are unfamiliar to them. Stick primarily with songs you know the congregation will know. When you introduce a new song, plan on including it in multiple worship services so that people will have more opportunity to get used to it.
Also note that some songs are meant for solo singers while others are more suited to group singing. Obviously, the songs you use for group worship should be songs that groups of people can sing together.
You may have a superb vocal range, but know that most people do not share that same skill. The songs you pick need to fall within a shorter, more concentrated range so that more people can sing along.

, Know how many songs you need to pick out. In many churches, there is already some set order to the service. In others, you may have a little more flexibility. Regardless, you should pick out enough songs to fit the format and select the right songs for the right parts of the service.

, Memorize any verses you plan on saying. You can have an open Bible or sheet music in front of you during the service, but it's best not to rely on them.


As you practice saying these readings, emphasize verbs instead of pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs. Verbs typically convey the greatest amount action and meaning, so emphasizing them can help draw out the truth of the text.
Learning the words you'll be singing and saying beforehand will make you feel much more comfortable during public worship, which will allow you to lead worship in a more natural manner.

, You might be the only one leading worship at church. Then again, you might have an entire worship team to work with. No matter how many people are involved, it is crucial that you practice the songs you plan on singing a few times before you have to perform them at church.


Make sure that everyone on your worship team knows when each song will be sung. Try to keep everyone as informed as possible so that there are no surprises.
Listen to the input of others on your worship team. If the general consensus goes against your initial opinion, rethink your ideas and consider altering them as needed.

, Worship is a spiritual thing, but as a physical being, you also need to keep your physical strength up. Get a full night's sleep the night before. Hydrate yourself and eat enough that morning to give yourself the energy you'll need to make it through the service.


If you're the sort of person who easily gets sick on a full stomach, make sure that you only eat enough to wake yourself up and not enough to make yourself feel queasy.

, Meet up with any other members of the worship team before the service to do one final, quick practice session.


As a worship leader, try to show up 15 minutes or so before the rest of the worship team is due to arrive for your final practice. During that time, do sound tests to make sure that the equipment is set up, tune any instruments you'll be using, and flip through your notes to make sure that everything is in order., Your body language needs to convey energy and sincerity. Even though worship is not about you, you'll still need to have enough of a stage presence to catch the congregation's attention. If you don't seem excited about worship, those you're leading probably won't get excited, either.


Consider asking someone to take a video of you as you lead worship. Watch that video later and review your body language. Note which movements seem awkward or distracting and which are helpful.
Make sure that you look the part, too. You need to look clean, and your clothes and accessories should be neat, modest, and understated.Maintain good posture and make eye contact during the service. Smile when appropriate and keep a friendly yet strong presence.

, Keep an eye on the congregation as you lead them in worship and take cues from them as needed. Be prepared to make small changes as needed during the service to get things in sync with the rest of the church.


If people seem bored or confused, they may not know the song or feel comfortable singing it. You can encourage them to sing by making a statement like, ""Let's worship God together,"" but avoid guilt tripping them with statements like, ""I don't hear anyone singing with me.""
It's also possible that a technical error prevented to words from displaying correctly on the screen, so glance behind your shoulder to make sure that things are on track.

, The easiest way to worship like you mean it is to actually mean it. Focus on the words you sing and speak as you lead. If you're only going through the motions without being sincere, people are bound to notice.


While you don't need to ""act out"" each song, try to use body language and verbal language that matches the tone of the songs you sing. Smile and move around when you sing joyful songs. Be more subdued during serious or reflective songs. Your movements do not and should not be theatrical, but the right movements can emphasize the importance of what you're saying more effectively.

, Keep people actively involved during worship. Lengthy instrumental solos and content of that nature are an open invitation for people to let their minds drift. These things may sound pleasing to your own ear, but they if they aren't practical, you should leave them out.


You don't need to cut out all the instrumental parts, but ask yourself which are really necessary and which aren't. When an interlude provides a helpful transition, keep it. When the arrangement breaks up the flow of community worship, discard or shorten it.

, As noted before, the verses you read should be picked out and memorized beforehand. The prayers can be written beforehand, as well, or you can ad lib them if you believe that doing so will make them more sincere.


As with the songs and the readings, your prayers also need to connect to the message or lesson being conveyed.

, When it's time for the pastor to deliver his sermon or for someone else to speak, give that person your undivided attention. You're a leader in the church whether you're “on” or “off,” so your actions will be noticed by the rest of the congregation even when you aren't singing or speaking.

, While you need to set aside your personal feelings to some extent, you shouldn't push yourself to make a show of worship if doing so doesn't come naturally to you. On days when you feel more subdued, allow your worship to be more subdued. On days you feel energized, let it show.


A little bit of honesty can go a long way, but again, make sure that you do not spend time focusing on yourself as you lead others in worship. Instead of saying, ""I'm having a really bad day,"" point out that there are times in life when praise can be difficult, but state that it's important to continue worshiping during those times nonetheless.

, Prayer is vital throughout all parts of this process. Thank God for the worship session after it passes, even when things did not go the way you would've liked. Ask God for guidance as you reflect on the service and plan for next time.

, Shortly after the service ends, write a few notes for yourself about what did and did not work. Use these notes to as you plan for future worship sessions.


A few things you might need to work on may include diction, volume, and pitch. You may not know how you'll sound in the sanctuary until you actually lead worship there once or twice. Make adjustments to the way you speak as needed to compensate for things like echo and poor acoustics.
If others critique you or make suggestions, listen to them humbly and with an open mind. Some of the advice others give may not be practical, but some of it will be. Make sure that you're able to honestly distinguish the difference between helpful criticism and destructive criticism without letting your ego get in the way.

, Learning from your mistakes and mishaps is great. Dwelling on those problems and allowing them to negatively taint your thinking is not so great. Think about ways to correct mistakes of the past and let go of those errors as soon as you make plans to avoid them.


Flaws and mistakes often serve as helpful reminders to keep yourself humble. Those imperfections can also remind the people you're leading that all of us are only human. If you accept your own faults gracefully, you can encourage those watching you to do the same.

Write about your feelings.,
Meditate.,
Distract yourself.,
Sleep on it.",How to Follow Your Intuition1," Keeping a journal can be a great way to get in touch with your feelings and unlock your intuitive side. Write out whatever you are feeling or thinking about without worrying about rationalization or your judgmental inner voice. Stream of consciousness writing, or just jotting down the first word or thought that pops into your head, can help you become more aware of what’s going on in your subconscious mind., Meditation can help you become more in tune with the intuitive signals your body is sending you. Try some basic meditation techniques to help you become more mindful of your physical state.Find a quiet and comfortable place to meditate where you will not be bothered or distracted.
Sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and focus on the sensations of your own breathing. If your mind wanders, gently redirect your attention to your breathing.
Try doing a “body scan.” Lie down, close your eyes, and mentally focus on each part of your body in turn, starting with the toes and moving up to the top of your head. Be aware of any sensations you are experiencing in each part of your body, and make a conscious effort to relax any tensed muscles. When you are done, focus on your entire body for a few minutes. Take a few minutes to focus on your breathing.

, While it may seem illogical, distraction can actually help you come to a decision. Your brain processes information on a subconscious level even if you are not actively focusing on it or thinking about it. If you find yourself struggling to make a decision, do something else for awhile. Then return to the problem, and go with the decision that feels “right.”, Sleep is important for resting and repairing our bodies and minds, and it also helps process information that we take in during the day. If you’re having trouble making a decision, try putting it aside and getting some sleep. When you wake up, you may find that your intuition has led you to a decision."

Use your knowledge and common sense.,
Listen to your intuition in familiar situations.,
Listen to your instincts about people.,
Listen to your instincts about your health.,
Let your intuition help you with big decisions.",How to Follow Your Intuition2," If you are in an unfamiliar situation, trying to solve a complex problem, or need to make an important decision, do some research or seek advice before letting your gut take over. Your intuition will work better for you if you use it along with practical knowledge, reasonable expectations, and an understanding of your options.

, Our brains are great at recognizing patterns. This allows us to come to decisions quickly and without much conscious thought. You have probably used this type of intuition while driving or riding a bicycle. Once you’ve practiced something a few times (like giving a speech, performing a musical piece, or playing a sport), try letting go and letting your intuition take over instead of referring to your notes, looking at the clock, or thinking about every step., Our gut reactions to other people are a survival instinct. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel fearful of or nervous about another person for no obvious reason, you may be picking up on subtle signs that are not apparent to your conscious mind. Be on guard when interacting with someone who gives you a bad feeling, even if you’re not sure why. If you feel like you are in immediate danger, remove yourself from the situation or seek help., You know your body better than anyone else. If you feel that something is wrong, even if it’s subtle or you can’t clearly explain it, seek medical advice or attention. If you still feel like your concerns have not been addressed after seeing a medical professional, get a second opinion. You may be picking up on something your doctor hasn’t.You may also develop a strong intuition about the health needs of people you are close to. If you are the parent or guardian of a child, or if you live with someone who has health problems, pay attention to your intuitive signals about their condition. You may get the sense that something is wrong even if they do not bring it to your attention or notice it themselves.

, If you’re faced with a big choice like making a major purchase, deciding which college to go to, or getting married, logic and practical considerations are important. But once you’ve weighed all the pros and cons and narrowed down your options, you are likely to get the most satisfaction out of your choice if you let intuition guide you to a final decision."
"
Listen to your gut.,
Follow your nose.,
Use your eyes.,
Pay attention to your physical reactions.",How to Follow Your Intuition3," It’s not just a metaphor – we really do some of our “thinking” with our guts. Your “gut brain” may let you know that you’re stressed or excited before your mind does by giving you a stomach ache, a feeling of butterflies in your stomach, or that distinctive sinking feeling that you get when you hear bad news.If your stomach hurts or feels uncomfortable when you’re dealing with or even thinking about particular situations or people, this is may be your body telling you that they are a source of stress for you. Be aware of these signals, and take a break or avoid the triggering situation or person if possible.

, You may not always be aware of it, but your sense of smell can be a powerful survival tool. Your nose can tell you if something is unsafe to eat, and can even help you evaluate another person’s emotional or physical state. Boost your sense of smell by exercising regularly and avoiding pollutants that damage your sense of smell, like cigarette smoke., When you enter an unfamiliar situation, take a quick look around. Even if you aren’t consciously aware of everything you’re seeing, your eyes may pick up on important visual cues that can contribute to intuitive responses. For example, you may subconsciously pick up on subtle changes in another person’s facial expressions or body language beyond what is immediately obvious. If something seems amiss or alarming about a person or situation, it might be because your eyes noticed something that your mind didn’t., Dangerous or uncomfortable situations may trigger a physical stress response. In addition to an upset stomach, you might feel your palms sweating and your heart racing. In some cases, our bodies pick up on the signs that something is amiss before our brains do. Listen to what your body is telling you: these stress reactions are a signal to the conscious mind to be on guard."

Whether you're a devoted believer, or are looking to make a change in your life, taking time out of your busy schedule to sit and speak with the god you believe in is the single most important way to get closer and focus on your faith.


Prayer doesn't need to be an hours-long commitment, unless you want it to be. Take a five minute break at work to pray. Pray before a meal. Pray while you're stuck in traffic.
If you struggle to find the time, or to remember to pray, set a phone alarm, or find some other way to remind yourself to pray at a consistent time. Make it a routine, part of your daily schedule.
Many people will distract themselves with busyness, filling up with other seemingly ""necessary"" activities to avoid prayer or devotion. Sometimes, praying and focusing on your relationship with god can be emotionally draining, or difficult, as much as it can be uplifting and joyous. Make the time for it more regularly, to make it less of a chore.;
, God doesn't expect everyone to be a saint. Nobody's perfect, and just acknowledging that you're not is one of the easiest ways to grow your relationship with faith and your belief in the god you come to. If you're not sure what you're supposed to say, or how you're supposed to act, that's fine. Talking to god doesn't require you to become someone you're not, at least at first.


If you've never prayed before, or weren't raised with any kind of understanding of a god, check out this article to get started with some of the basics.

, Some people pray by fully prostrating themselves on the ground, and bowing. Some people pray by closing their eyes, clasping their hands, and bowing their heads. Some people chant. Some people just sit quietly and introspectively. There's no one, correct way to pray.


Try to find a quiet space, somewhere you'll be able to really focus on your faith and what you're trying to say. Close the door, take a few deep breaths, light a candle, and sit quietly for a few minutes.
It's not ""better"" to pray loudly, or to adopt practices you see others engaging in. That doesn't mean someone is closer to god than you are. It's important to develop a personal relationship, not one based on observations of others.

, What do you say to god? Largely, that will depend on your unique condition and circumstance. What do you want to say to god? What needs to be heard? Sometimes it can be hard to know exactly how to get started, but focusing on open-ended questions, both about concerns and devotional joys, is common way of praying. Ask questions that focus on:


Your struggles, personally and spiritually
Your joys, personally and spiritually
Your family, their trials and their successes
Injustice and suffering in the world at large

, One of the most common things to do in a prayer session is to confess your sins and your guilt, helping to alleviate the burden. Being up front about your failures and your shortcomings helps you to become a better person, and to bring yourself closer with god. Be honest and forthright with your assessment of yourself.


What do you feel guilty for doing in the past week?
What do you want to change about yourself?
How can you lead a better life?

, Prayer is a funny thing. The way that god chooses to answer prayers varies from person to person, from theologian to theologian. Whatever you believe, though, and however you choose to pray, part of getting closer to god is in learning how to listen, and what to listen to.


Look for signs to interpret. Pay attention to things that seem heavy with meaning. Many people believe ""chance"" encounters are anything but. Did you get a phone call from an unexpected source? Take ""random"" things as a sign.
Listen to your intuition. What your gut tells you is important. Many people believe that voice inside yourself isn't necessarily your's in the first place, but is influenced by the god in whom you trust. What do you instincts tell you? Trust them as you trust god.
Be willing to work for an answer. Answers to prayers won't come as shouts, they'll come as whispers. Five minutes after praying about unemployment, it's unlikely that a knock will come at the door offering you a new job. Hit the bricks, scan the classifieds, and do the work of finding your answer.

, Prayer isn't about calling up to the heavens and asking that it rain cash money. If you go into prayer expecting the clouds to part and a briefcase full of tens to come down on a lightning bolt, you'll be disappointed. That's not how prayer works, and whether or not you're close to god will have nothing to do with it.


Think of prayer as a conversation with a trusted friend and advisor, someone who cares for you like nobody else, and who has your best interest at heart. There may be no answer to your queries, but there's an ear that's always there.

, As iron sharpens iron, one man sharpens another, is how the Bible puts it. While prayer is essential to whatever religion you practice, it's difficult to grow your faith and your relationship with god all by yourself. Fellowship with other believers is one of the most important ways to build a relationship and to find peace.


If you want to become a member of a church, check out this article for a good introduction.
If you're not able to connect with people in your area, check out online venues and message boards for members of the religion you're a part of. This can be a great way to connect if you're feeling isolated from other believers.

, Whatever religion you're a part of, it's important to head to the source and study the big books at the center of it, instead of relying on the words of preachers and supplementary books. Most religions believe the central texts, the Bible, The Quran, the Mahabharata, the Torah, and countless other texts, are all divinely inspired, if not the actual words of god. Reading them is a great way to get closer.


Try organizing your own prayer group, or a religious book club. These can be great ways to get together and get closer to god as a group, as well as struggle through what can be difficult reading together.

, Growing your faith in god requires that you relentlessly explore the intricacies of your faith and your relationship to your belief system. Don't shy away from the big questions, in your prayer practice. Try to embrace the questions that might scare you, or keep you up at night, to move yourself closer to god. Consider things like:


Why are we here?
Is this a good life that I'm leading?
What is my purpose?
What can I do for god?
What happens when I die?
Why does suffering exist?

, Doubt is a part of faith, just as death is a part of life. You're going to confront it, and the way you choose to confront it has the potential of bringing you even closer to god. It's important to anticipate doubts about your faith and learn to deal with them.


Talk to others, when you have doubts. Many believers fear being ""outed"" as doubters, when they should take the opportunity to have deep discussions about matters of faith with other believers. Look at doubt as an opportunity to deepen your faith.
Always pray about your doubts. Take your concerns and your worries to the source. Even just talking to god can help some people assuage their doubts.

, For many believers, a growing relationship with god can come with a (literally) ""holier than thou"" attitude. Believing that yours is the one true god, and that your relationship is great can make it hard to deal with non-believers in a more simplified way. As you become more and more confident that your relationship with god is deep, it's important to learn how to discuss your faith with others, and keep an open mind.


Keeping an open mind doesn't mean opening yourself up to doubts, necessarily, just that you don't need to condescend to others when matters of faith are at stake.

, Sometimes, getting away from the hustle of your daily life and devoting some time to reflection and contemplation is an excellent way to get closer to god. Lots of religions make retreats or pilgrimages a formalized ritual, but there is also an opportunity to do one yourself, just to grow your relationship personally.


Try visiting holy places, or spending a week at a monastery, or at a nature retreat to pull away from your responsibilities for a break from the concerns of the mortal coil.
Retreats can cost big money, but they don't have to break the bank with a little creativity. Worship in your own way, on a camping trip, or by just taking a long weekend to read quietly and pray. If you're a hunter, you can get closer to god while you're sitting in a blind at 5 am, watching the stars hide.

, For one thing, perfection is an impossibility. It's important to recognize your imperfections and your shortcomings. People who are close to religion believe that god is all-knowing, meaning that god recognizes your shortcomings as well. There's no sense in becoming someone that you're not. There is no lying in prayer.


At the same time, it's important to recognize the things that you're able to change about yourself and try to work on them. Self-improvement doesn't require you to be perfect, but it does require honesty and diligence.
Keep a list of things you'd like to work on, spiritually and just in your general life. How do you want to live? What do you struggle with? What would make you a stronger believer? Establish clear goals.

, It's not enough to be close to god when you're at church and become someone else when you're in public. When you take action, let those actions be influenced by your spirituality. Would one course of action serve your relationship with god better than another? Is your behavior at work in line with the religious text you believe in? Your personal relationships? Keep all things pointing back to god.


You don't have to prove this to anyone but yourself and to god. Acting extremely pious by connecting even the most basic actions to your god might just come across as fake. You don't have to dedicate every bowl of cereal to the glory of the creator to be close with god.

, What choices in your life will give you the biggest opportunity to grow spiritually, to live happily, and to live well? The best way to approach these questions is to hand the reigns over to the god that you believe in. Imagine god were making your decisions for you.

, Like the secular world, some religions come with lots of trappings. Bringing yourself closer to god doesn't necessarily involve having more statues, crucifixes, or prayer candles than your neighbor. It has to do with the personal spiritual journey that you're on.


Judaism, Christianity, and many other religions practice some form of tithing, or donating a certain sum of money (often 10% of your income) to the church to which they belong.While tithing is celebrated by some as good practice, it is derided by others, or at least complicated.Spending more doesn't make you a better servant to god, though it helps to give back to the church, which helps to spread the ability of others to worship, which brings you closer to god in turn. There are lots of ways to look at the issue, so it's important to pray on it yourself and make your own decision.

, In many religions, the closest one may become to god is to devote your life to monasticism, priesthood, or ministry. While this is a big step that may involve leaving your family and your way of life behind, this in itself is a major rite of passage to the most devoted believers. Explore the options your religion has to offer.


If you're interested, visit a monastery or talk with a church leader at the church you attend. Express your interest and try to find out what it takes.
If you aren't able to devote yourself to god full-time, there are still many ways to volunteer what free time you have to service. Mission trips, leading youth groups, and forming prayer groups are all common ways of bringing yourself closer to god and donating your time.

For example, It may be difficult to get people to come to an early morning or Friday night meeting. Try choosing a time that is convenient for people such as a Sunday afternoon or weekday evening.


Think about choosing a time when there is usually a mass scheduled. That way it’s a time that would normally be convenient for people.
A prayer meeting usually lasts about an hour, although you can adjust the time if desired.;
, Even if you want to host a prayer meeting outside of church you should keep the pastor involved. While others can lead the prayer meeting, it is important to keep the church leadership involved so that people respect the legitimacy of the prayer meeting.

, Usually prayer meetings will be held in a prayer room or other room at the church. You can also host small prayer meetings in other locations such as homes if you choose. Whatever the location, make sure it is ready to host the meeting and is a clean space for hosting prayers.

, Announce the meeting to the members of the congregation. Make an announcement at mass or send out letters and emails. Try to get as many people involved as you can to strengthen your prayers.

, Sometimes people are hesitant to join or try something new. Speak to people individually and encourage them to come to the meetings. Sometimes people need just a little push to join in.

, You may keep the entire group together for prayers. If you are a big group you can also split into smaller groups for prayer. Other options include asking specific individuals to pray for specific issues or asking two or three people to pray for a specific issue and then asking another two or three people to pray for a different issue.


You can also do a combination of formats such as beginning with everyone praying together and then allowing people to pray for personal issues in smaller groups.

, Planning will determine the difference between a vibrant, effective prayer meeting and a dull, ineffective one. People need guidance, categories for prayer, models for prayer and boundaries for prayer. You need to keep people’s interest by planning the prayers in advance.

, Choose specific issues to pray for during the meeting. These issues should be relevant to the people praying and have a clear objective. This is important so that people maintain their motivation for coming together for prayer.

, Beginning with a short period of silence can help people connect to God through themselves. Encourage people to completely focus on God during this time.


Alternatively you can sing two or three worship songs before prayer begins.

, It can help to give a few instructions about prayer before beginning the prayers. People need guidance and direction in order to feel comfortable during the meeting. This way they will also be more open and willing to participate actively.

, Sometimes it is nice to allow people to request certain prayers or topics to pray for. However, be careful that this discussion does not take more than five minutes. It is very easy for a prayer meeting to turn into a discussion about prayer rather than a time for actual prayers.

, This is not required but can help get people into a spiritual mode. Make sure this passage is short; it should be about 5 minutes long and definitely no longer than 10 minutes.

, The point of a prayer meeting is to pray. If you let people speak about their own personal prayers or read verses for a long time then it is no longer a prayer meeting. Make sure you keep the focus on prayer throughout the meeting., Make prayer meetings different from one another and use different prayers within the prayer meeting. Try different forms for the meetings such as singing prayers, changing between small and large groups, being led in prayer, praying through confessions and taking prayer requests.

, Allow people to pray when they feel they want to rather than going around the circle and having everybody pray. Going around the circle is time-consuming and people end up composing their prayers as the circle gets closer to them rather than fully joining the prayers.

, Choose an issue and stick to it for a time until you are finished praying for that topic. Only once you have finished praying for that issue should you move to another. Keep prayers focused on one topic to keep the people focused and thus make those prayers strong., Praying for an hour can seem difficult but if you break it up into shorter prayers, including silent prayer, led prayer, read prayer, large group prayer and small group prayer then you have broken it into smaller pieces. Keep the prayers moving and over time an hour of prayers will no longer seem like a long time.


On the other hand, don’t be afraid of silence. Give people a time to let the prayers sink in and connect with their hearts.

, One good way to end the meeting is with a Bible reading relevant to the meeting topic.

, Praying out loud is difficult for some people and praying for 30-60 minutes can feel awkward at first. It takes practice. Keep working at your prayers and the group will grow together and become stronger., You want people to feel comfortable praying so the meeting should be flexible and intentional. Create an open environment for those who attend the meeting so that they can pray with their whole hearts and minds. This will also help to get everyone to participate., Even though children may have shorter attention spans they can be easily included in prayer meetings. Oftentimes children will pray out loud and fully participate in the meeting, bringing energy to the prayers in their youth.

, When God answers your prayers you should be grateful and express thanksgiving. Always express these feelings as a group as part of your prayer meetings.

, Spend some time together after the meeting. You can have snacks or dinner such as pizza and ice cream. This brings the group together and gets the kids excited.

Perform a Christian blessing.,
Perform a Jewish blessing.,
Perform a Hindu blessing.,
Perform an Islamic blessing.,
Perform a Buddhist blessing.",How to Bless a House1," The blessing of a Christian household is an ancient tradition which can be found in the Protestant, Orthodox, and Roman Catholic churches, amongst others. The blessing may be performed by an ordained priest or pastor, or by the owner of the house themselves.


If you would prefer to have your house blessed by an ordained priest, invite him to your house to perform the blessing, and he will be happy to oblige.
Normally, the priest will walk from room to room, sprinkling each with holy water. As he walks, he may recite one or more passages from the holy gospel.
If you prefer to bless the house yourself, use anointing oil (which can simply be cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil, blessed by a minister) to mark a cross on each of the windows and doors inside the house.
As you mark the sign of the cross, utter a simple prayer asking God to bless the room. For example ""In the name of Jesus Christ I ask for Your peace and joy to inhabit this room,"" or ""May Your Holy Spirit flow through and fill this home up with Your Spirit."";
, There are an abundance of Jewish traditions associated with moving into a new house, or simply blessing an old one.


When moving into a new home, Jewish families are required to affix a mezuzah (parchment inscribed with Hebrew phrases from the Torah) to each of the doorways in the house.
As the mezuzah is installed, the following prayer is recited ""Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix a mezuzah"".
It is also believed that Tuesday is the best day for moving into a new home, that bread and salt should be the first items to enter the house, and that shortly after moving in a Chanukat Habayit or housewarming party should be held, where friends and family gather and words of the Torah are spoken.During the housewarming party, it's tradition to eat the first fruit of the new season while reciting the shehecheyanu blessing, as follows: ""Blessed are You, L-rd our G‑d, King of the Universe, who has granted us life, sustained us and enabled us to reach this occasion."", Hindu house blessings vary greatly according to different regions. In some places the housewarming ceremony is second in importance only to a couple's wedding day.


However, across all regions the house blessing must be performed on the morning the homeowners move into their new home. An auspicious move-in date must be chosen by the local Hindu priest, who must also perform the ceremony.
On the day, it is traditional (in some regions) for the homeowners to supply a gift tray or dakshina for the priest's use throughout the ceremony. This gift tray usually contains items such as raw, washed rice, mango leaves, ghee, coins, herbs, spices, fruit and flowers, among others.During the ceremony, the homeowners will often sit in front of the fireplace, wearing their best clothes and repeating mantras. The priest will usually recite a prosperity prayer to the Hindu gods, asking for prosperity, purity and serenity to be bestowed upon the people of the house.Contact a priest at your local Hindu temple for information on how the housewarming ceremony is performed in your region.

, Muslim people bless their house mainly by reciting prayers - usually there is no official ceremony that needs to be performed. However, certain prayers and traditions are recommended:


Upon moving into a new house, it is a good idea to perform a two cycle prayer, asking Allah to bestow baraka (blessing), rahma, (mercy) and dhikr (remembrance) upon the home.
You can also recite a prayer to protect your home from the evil eye and the envy of others using the following Prophetic Supplication: ""I seek refuge for you in the perfect words of Allaah from every devil, harmful thing, and accusing eye.""It is also recommended that you invite your friends and family over for dinner, as feeding others is viewed as a charitable act, and a way of showing gratitude to Allah. At this dinner, you and your guests may recite passages from the Qur’an together.
Aside from blessing your house when you first move in, you can also bless your house every time you step through the door using the following prayer: ""I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created"". Repeating this prayer three times will ensure no harm comes to you while you are in the house., In Buddhism, a ceremony known as Khuan Ban Mai is performed (in certain regions) when a new house is built to protect the house and its inhabitants. The ceremony is performed by a group of nine monks, who must be invited to the house early on the morning of the ceremony.


The monks then perform a ritual involving sacred lustral water and wax candles. As the wax melts and drops into the water, it is believed to wash away evil and sorrow.
The monks also chant prayers in the Pali language, while passing a white string through each of their hands. The vibrations from the chanted prayers are believed to pass through the string, protecting the houses and its inhabitants.
After the ceremony, the monks sit down to a meal prepared by the host family and their friends and neighbors.They must finished their meal before noon. Then one monk sprinkles holy water in each of the rooms of the house, before they all leave.Once the monks leave, the rest of the guests sit down to eat the remaining food. In the afternoon, they perform the thread ceremony, where the guests wrap a white thread around the homeowners and offer them their blessing."

Define luck for yourself.,
Be bold.,
See challenges as opportunities to succeed.,
Take advantage of good fortune.,
Take control of situations.,
Stop thinking and start feeling.,
Work hard.",How to Feel Lucky1," What is good luck for you? Your dreams and desires are the roots of the concept of ""luck"". One person might feel most lucky in acing an exam, another person in getting his cancer into remission, while another person in scoring her first hole in one. Feeling lucky is to identify your deep desires, which is different from person to person. Identifying and amplify your desires will give yourself a better chance of attaining your goals and getting what you want. Luck reflects faith in obtaining these goals.


If you feel unlucky, may be because you have not identified what it is you want to be doing, what you want out of life, and what you can do to attain it. The first step in getting somewhere is deciding where you want to go.
For some people, it might be smarter to start with a five-year plan, while others might need to start smaller. What do you want today? What do you want to get out of Wednesday? Make this a daily exercise.
Focus on things that will improve your lot in life on a deep emotional level, not just a superficial one. But you will maximize your luck if you work on not just the one-in-a-million chance, but also take advantage of the little opportunities to fulfill your desires. For example, if you want to be financially secure, you may trust your luck in making it happen. Wanting to win the lottery is all well and good--someone has to win, after all! But do not invest heavily in lottery tickets; find opportunities to save money and invest as well!
Feeling unlucky can happen because of a setback or delay or even failure in your goals. You get laid off, for instance. Or get into a car accident. Your strawberry crop fails. Recognize that life is not a constant string of successes. But focusing on positive steps (however tiny) will ensure you will see your opportunities and things to be grateful about rather than dwelling on things that happen that work against us.;
, People who feel lucky put themselves in situations which face the possibility of failure. It takes courage and a positive attitude that accepts failure as a momentary setback. Instead of wasting time coming up with reasons to avoid tough situations or challenging scenarios, people who feel luck come up with reasons to act, to confront, and to succeed.


Being bold does not mean reckless. Put your faith in luck, but there is a reason for seat belts in vehicles.
An old saying goes, ""Going into a situation expecting to fail is the best way to ensure failure.""
The ""unlucky"" are often experts in making themselves comfortable and safe, but achieve little. Put yourself out there and give yourself the chance to succeed. But it requires that you preserve the chance of failure. Removing any chance of failure takes away the possibility of succeeding as well. Say yes instead of no.

, You've just been offered an exciting but intimidating new responsibility at work? Take it with enthusiasm. You've been asked to speak in front of a crowd of people? Write a great speech. You've been tasked with picking up a famous artist from the airport? Chat 'em up. Treat intimidating moments as chances to make your own luck, not as hopeless obstacles.It may seem corny, but try talking yourself up. Make a psych-up playlist to play before you show up for work every day, or have to do something that scares you. ""Up Above My Head"" by Sister Rosetta never made anyone feel unlucky.

, Unlucky people chalk up good fortune to accident, using good luck as a chance to self-deprecate, or to make excuses. Lucky people take good fortunate and turn it into more good fortune. In the newspaper experiment Wiseman conducted, the only difference between the lucky and the unlucky was that the lucky people kept an eye out for advantage, fortune, and luck, and the unlucky–given the exact same advantage–missed it.

, Francis Ford Coppola, award-winning filmmaker of Apocalypse Now and The Godfather is famous for his unusual ways of making movies, which isn't really very strange at all. When he wants to make a movie, he just starts making a movie. No script, actors, or studio support? Doesn't matter. He's got an idea and doesn't let anyone get in his way. Respect yourself enough to give your wants and your desires precedence over other concerns.


Don't say ""I wonder if I'll be allowed to do this,"" but say ""Who's going to stop me?"" Giving yourself the responsibility to succeed gives you the ability to succeed. Give yourself the position of control, not other people who are supposedly keeping you from getting what you want.
Don't wait around for permission to do things. Take what you want. At work, don't write up a project proposal for approval, just do your project and show off the results. Don't wait to get an outline of your book put together so you can get an advance from a publisher and write it, just start writing it.

, Lucky people have learned to respect their intuitions, hunches, and gut instincts. If you've got a tendency to overanalyze situations and find reasons to feel slighted, offended, or unlucky, learn to listen to your gut instead.


Try this experiment: Next time you've got to make an important decision, let yourself make it instantaneously. Go with your fastest gut reaction and don't give yourself the chance to rethink it. It just occurred to you that you're not in love with your partner? Break up. Now. You just got the urge to quit your job and volunteer on an organic grape vineyard for a couple months? Put in your papers. Make it happen.

, Coppola still had to make those movies he blundered into. That meant hundreds of hours of dull slogging through the jungle in Vietnam, and early mornings dealing with Marlon Brando's weirdness, and hundreds of reels of film to edit. But he threw himself into it. Sow the seeds of luck with labor. Work hard.


Hard workers open up opportunities and advantages because their results are that much better than everyone else's. If you're working twice as hard at work, your work will be twice as good, and you'll feel twice as lucky for having done it.
Try to focus on doing one thing at a time and doing it extremely well. On Monday, don't worry about everything you've got to do for the rest of the week. Try not to even think about what you've got to do in the afternoon. Just think about this moment, right now, and finishing what you've started.

As the group grows, make decisions together as a group.",How to Start a Church," Before you attempt to file for non-profit status and make your church official, it's best to establish a somewhat sizable and united fellowship of people with similar beliefs to undergo the process together. Start talking with like-minded people and getting together on a regular basis.


The IRS requires you to have three founding members who are not related by blood or marriage.;
, You can establish a church at varying levels and the better you define your aims for the church, the easier it will be to establish your tax-exempt status. Establishing a ministry, for example, is somewhat different than forming a corporately structured church, housed in its own building. Consider:



Your possible membership. How many do you reasonably expect?

Your location. Where will you worship?

Your commitment. Will this be a part-time job, or a full-time calling?

Your financial aims. Will your church collect funds? How? How much will be necessary?

, Why are you starting a church? What core beliefs will govern your ministry? What distinguishes your church in terms of doctrine and creed? These are questions to take up in a statement of belief. Think of this as the ""Declaration of Independence"" for your church.


To form a religious organization, you need to also establish a series of bylaws by which your organization will be governed. Think of this as the rule book for your church's operations. Will you perform weddings and funerals? Under what protocol? What community outreach programs will your church participate in?
Sample outlines of bylaws are available online that you can use and modify for your purposes.

, You'll need corporate officers, a board of directors, and a membership to file for incorporation with the state. Make sure ahead of time you've got willing participants to fulfill the various procedural and accounting roles necessary to make a church run smoothly.These roles will be different than church staff. You don't necessarily need to think about janitorial and secretarial roles just yet, but make sure you've got some idea of the board of directors, visiting and youth ministry, music, and fundraising. The decision-making players need to be in place before you move forward.

, A commonly overlooked step. Give some thought to naming your church something distinctive, unique, and descriptive of your niche in the ministry. Also make sure you're not repeating a commonly-used name.

, It's perfectly possible to apply for incorporation and tax exemption without consulting a lawyer, but it's not the most straightforward process in the world and it would be beneficial to consult a lawyer after preparing the paperwork to the best of your abilities. Always get your work double-checked, but try to save money by doing as much of it as possible yourself.

, Your church must satisfy the following requirements:


The organization must be organized and operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific, or other charitable purposes.
Net earnings may not inure to the benefit of any private individual or shareholder.
No substantial part of its activity may be attempting to influence legislation and may not intervene in political campaigns.
The organization’s purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy.

, Obtain the documents of incorporation from the Business Bureau in your state. If you've already configured your corporate offices, composed a belief statement, and meet the proper requirements, you're halfway there.


Get a few copies of the same documents to practice on. If you mess up, just start over.

, At the regional IRS office, ask for a formal revue of your documentation and a notice of exemption. As long as you meet the requirements, all churches should automatically qualify for 501 status without more action.


It's not necessary to take any extra step to ensure tax exemption. However, many churches take the extra step of IRS recognition to ensure to church leaders, members, and contributors that the church is recognized, exempt, and in good legal stead with the state. This is especially important when a church is just starting out and hoping to promote legitimacy.
You can also fill out IRS form 1023, found here: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1023.pdf


, Regardless of whether or not you hire employees, it's important to acquire an EIN from the IRS to allow you to open a church bank account and also to file returns with the IRS.


Find this form here: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.pdf


, Use your EIN and other documentation to open an account used specifically for the church's funds.To open an account, you'll typically be asked to provide:


Proof of your EIN
Photo ID, and social security numbers of the principal signers
Master list of the church's board of directors and corporate officers

, Eventually, as your church grows, you'll probably want to take it out of the living room and into the world. Find an appropriate location that will be easy to grow in, and easy for new followers to find and make it to. Find somewhere you can afford and take the time to organize and decorate it according to your particular aesthetics and core beliefs.

, Why should people come listen to your interpretation of your common beliefs? What do you bring to the table? How can you enrich their spiritual life in a way that other churches and communities can't? These are important questions to consider as you build your program and begin holding services. Address basic questions:


Who will preach?
What sort of music will be included?
How will a service be structured?

, If you're within the umbrella of a pre-existing denomination, consider joining up with the regional office and sending representatives to the yearly meetings in your area. This can be a good way to make connections in your area and attract new members.


In general, be careful about ""leeching"" off the memberships of established churches in your area. It's probable that people who attend your church might be dissatisfied with their options, and you should create a welcoming space for those people. However, don't actively preach against other local churches, or attend their services and sow dissent. Create harmony rather than strife.

, When you're first getting started and have built a small group of followers and regular attendees, set a regular time for services and actively seek new members. Hold informal functions like cookouts and street festivals to attract neighbors and other potential members, and maintain an open door policy to build your church.


Regularly hold open-house events to attract new members. Advertise your church regularly in local weeklies and maintain an open-door policy to cultivate a welcoming presence. If you want to gain a membership and a solid community, get the word out.

, A church without a community is just a building. People will continue to come if they feel welcome and cared for, and you want to make sure that your church is a place people feel free to worship and come together.


Take a personal interest in each person and their family. Visit or call during the time between the meetings, taking an honest interest in their beliefs, their lives, and their needs from the church.

, As a founding member, you may have a great idea about having a Christian Metal festival with a pop-up skatepark, but your congregation may not be thrilled about the idea. Discuss it openly and come together to make the decision. It's not your job to push legislation through--it's your job to build up a community that worships together.

Record everything.",How to Channel," Different traditions use the word ""channeling"" in different ways. Some channelers aim outward, in an attempt to contact others, or inward, to learn more about the self. Depending on your interests and goals, this decision can lead you into very different traditions, rituals, and practices, though most types of channeling involve a similar process, first inducing of a trance-like state and then communicating with some ""other.""



In supernatural or spirit channeling, the goal is to tap into the world of spirits and communicate with them. Practitioners often want to contact deceased relatives or famous historical figures, or otherwise make some contact with the dead. Spirit channeling as we think of it today, with crystal balls and Ouija boards, was extremely popular in intellectual occult circles in the mid-to-late 19th century. Though this kind of for-profit mediumship is widely dismissed by scientific skeptics as an orchestrated con against the often-wealthy participants, spirit channeling has historical roots that extend far beyond the Victorian stereotypes.

Consciousness channeling is a newer phenomenon. In some New Age philosophies, practitioners of channeling will meditate and attempt to visualize archetypal figures that are manifestations of their own subconscious, ""past life"" figures, or metaphorical representatives of some psychological trauma. This figure will often guide the participant through different interactions and communications with the aim of healing the spirit and learning about the self.;
, Whether you want to find comfort and understanding by consulting an oracle, or you seek a deepened understanding of life and death, it's important to articulate your goals for channeling and be realistic about them. If you're going to embark on a channeling journey, it's important to commit to an often-quizzical, mysterious way of interpreting the messages you receive. The better you are at receiving them, the more you'll get out of the experience.



Embrace the mystery of it. Anyone who's ever cracked open an iChing or tried to learn about Tarot knows that channeling can be a frustrating and complex process. It doesn't always work like a movie, where a candle flickers and you hear the voice of some long-dead relative. Have a specific inquiry in mind–a specific thing you want to learn–and accept that you might not get the answer you're looking for.

Take it seriously. If your goal is get out a Ouija board and ask a ghost what afterlife farts smell like, you should probably spend your time doing something more constructive. Channeling only works if the participant is fully committed and open to the possibility of learning something about yourself and consciousness that might be hard to believe or understand.

Read up on occult symbology and symbolism. Because the process often involves the interpretation of symbols, it's important to do a little research before you jump in head-first, to get more out of the experience. Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces and The Occult by Colin Wilson are excellent primers to the ideas and images you'll need to be familiar with. James Merrill's modern verse epic The Changing Light at Sandover chronicles his communications with a spirit named Ephraim.

, All methods of channeling require that you have a very specific inquiry in mind for your spirit guide or your own subconscious. It's unlikely that any spirit guides–internal or external–will come forth to answer a question that's unserious, dishonest, or trivial, so give some thought to an appropriate question that deserves a complicated answer.



Make it specific, but not too specific. A question like ""Does Bill really hate me when I show up late for work?"" is probably better saved for a Magic 8-ball. You want your query to be broad enough to allow for complexity and personal enough to be worthwhile: ""How can I be a better person in my work?"" is more like it.

Let one question lead to another. If you're concerned about your work persona, let that question spiral into more questions, so you may look for possible answers in your investigation. Who am I when I work? What does my work mean to me? How should I approach my work? What is a worker? These may all be applicable questions that circle around your initial one. Look for the answers to questions you didn't ask.

, As you embark on a journey into your mind, you may find it more and more difficult to distinguish between the dream state and your waking life. Symbols will surround you and will pop up at unexpected times. This is a good thing! You just need to be ready to capture them for further analysis later, making a dream journal or a channeling journal an excellent resource for your investigation.


Keep a small composition book beside your bed. When you wake from any dream, however boring or uneventful. Write down everything you remember from it immediately. What did you see? What did you feel? Who was there? This kind of interpretation and attention to detail will serve you well in your channeling experiments.

, Find a quiet, meditative location where you'll feel comfortable and calm. Settle into a comfortable sitting position, on the floor or in a straight-backed chair, and sit with your body upright, your back straight. Go with soft, natural lighting and silence. Close your eyes or focus somewhere in the middle-distance–a blank wall or a calming spot would do nicely.


Articulate your intentions for this meditation by centering yourself around some mantra like, ""I will achieve trance and I will return to normal consciousness with a full memory of what I experienced. I will achieve a deeper and deeper trance state with practice.""
You don't need to sit in the lotus position in the middle of a crossroads at midnight or prostrate yourself in front of a goat skull and candles to channel. Focus on your comfort and achieving the trance-like state, not superficial details from the movies.

, Sit quietly and breathe deeply. Feel your breath go into and out of your body. Feel the air going into your lungs, filling you with nourishing oxygen, and going out into the world. Breathe in and breathe out. Do nothing but breathe for several minutes. Let thoughts come and go, focusing on none of them. Just focus on breathing.

, To move deeper into a trance, start with a specific part of your body, like your left hand. As you breathe, feel the air coming into your body in your left hand. Move your consciousness into your left hand, and focus your energy on relaxing your left hand. Say, ""My left hand is relaxing, my left hand is relaxed.""



Move the relaxation to your left arm, then your right hand, your right arm, and your legs in the same fashion. Spend 30-60 seconds on each part of your body, focusing your full consciousness and attention on relaxation. Wait until you feel that part of your body relax before moving on.

After you've relaxed your body, give weight to your body. After you've relaxed your body, you want to introduce a feeling of heaviness, as if your body were covered in many blankets, or buried in sand. In the same fashion, establish a consciousness connection with your left hand, focusing your energy into it fully. It should still be relaxed. Say, ""My left hand is heavy."" Spend 30-60 seconds focusing on each part of your body in the same way.

After you've given weight to your body, give warmth to your body. In the same way, move around your body giving warmth by saying, ""My left hand is warm."" Focus your energy on achieving a state of warmth, as if you were in a warm bath, or had placed a heating pad on each part of your body. Your body should feel extreme comfort, but you should not feel sleepy.

, When you decide to return to normal consciousness, focus on your fingers and your toes, wiggling them and returning them to a more normal state. Feel your body gradually cool down and look around the room, letting your mind return to it's normal way of thinking. Stand up and walk around when you've stretched out a bit.


Don't just jump up and start pacing around–if you've been sitting long enough, you might have sleepy limbs and could sprain an ankle. Bad juju for consciousness meditation.

, The goal of the trance is to blur the lines between your body, your consciousness, and the world around you. Move through the stages described in the previous step, achieving the trance slowly, focusing on calming your body. Practice introducing your body to the trance-like state with many days of practice before attempting to deepen your trance or channel in any way. This is a process you must commit to, if you want to achieve results.


It may be slow going at first, but as you progress, you might notice the previous steps becoming easier and easier. If you focus on warming up your left hand, you may feel your left arm become warm at the same time, or both arms become warm. This is a good sign that your training your mind and body to achieve a trance state more quickly.
When you think you're ready to move on to a deeper state of consciousness, add another step to your trance: feel your forehead grow cool. In many traditions, the ""third eye"" located on the forehead signifies your connection to the subconscious or the world of the unseen. Isolate that part of your body by saying, ""My forehead feels cool.""

, If you want to start seeing results and get some sense of how strong your connection with the world of the unseen has become, try an experiment: select a very specific time that you'd like to wake up, and plant the seed of that time into your mind at the end of your trance meditation. After cooling your third-eye, focus on the time you've selected by saying, ""I will rise tomorrow at 6:00."" Don't set an alarm and try sleeping as normally.

, After much practice in achieving your trance state, you should start to feel more comfortable moving into and out of that state. If you've grown quite strong, it's time to start spending more time exploring it. This is the beginning of real channeling. Before you find a guide or source to transmit to you, though, spend some time working on visualization and finding a deeper more immersive layer of consciousness.


Visualize objects and colors. After you've cooled your third-eye, let your subconscious suggest a color. Say, ""I see blue,"" and repeat it until the color settles into your mind and you really see blue. At first, you may see a mishmash of colors, but continue practicing until you can settle and ""see"" what your mind tells you to see.
It may be helpful to give the color an object, like a pen or a car. See the blue pen. Watch it. Feel it's weight in your hand and try to ""use it."" Spend time visualizing many colors and objects before moving on.

, Different mediums or channelers use a variety of exercises to fall deeper and allow the subconscious to take over. This is an important way of getting more in touch with the world of the unseen, and can be quite exhilarating when you re-emerge from your trance state.



Fall from a ladder into space. Visualize yourself climbing a ladder in darkness. Your body should be warm and comfortable. Climb the ladder for a while and then let go of the ladder. Feel yourself falling away. If you become dizzy or disoriented, focus on your body consciousness until you regain comfort and warmth.

Take an elevator down. Some practitioners find success visualizing an elevator that's traveling down the wall of an endless rock face. Imagine an elevator with a glass door that allows you to see out: on three sides there is darkness, but on one side there is a rocky cliff with crags and tiny imperfections. Visualize them as closely as possible and continue traveling down ever farther.

Personalize your fall. There's no right way to visualize, so do what feels comfortable for you. Some channelers like to visualize themselves as a falling feather, a ring of smoke, or as climbing down a long rope., As you progress in your trance meditation you may find that you have more and more difficulty ""controlling"" your visualizations, and that they're happening without your ability to stop them. Let this happen. This is a sign that you've moved deep enough to find a guide for your investigations. This is channeling.


Different traditions think about this state of being in different ways: if you want to refer to this as ""going clear"" or ""entering the spirit world,"" you're right on all counts. You don't have to put a name on it, necessarily, but feel free to call it what you want.

, After you've fallen from the ladder of yourself or otherwise descended deeper into your consciousness via trance meditation, settle yourself in some comfortable location. Spend time exploring it. See as many of the tactile details as possible in this waking dream. Focus your energy on inhabiting that space and really ""being"" there.


In some New Age traditions, it's suggested that you fill your location with all manner of esoteric crystals and golden cushions, while other traditions may suggest you imagine a mossy wood straight out of Tolkien. Go for it. There's no right place.

, Visualize a person you know and watch their behavior as they come into your place. Let them be and observe them and their behavior. If your subconscious suggests people that you don't know, or don't recognize, be especially conscious of them and remember their faces and their movements. You know you're knocking on the door of channeling when you can start interacting with people you don't know.


Pay particularly close attention to movements that people make, things they may say, or other imagery. When you emerge from your trance, write these details down immediately. Things that may not ""make sense"" to you in the moment will probably be often and will require analysis and consideration later. That's channeling.
Again, if you want to think of these figures as ""dimensional archetypes"" or ""angels"" or the ""voice of your DNA,"" that's fine. Pick the symbolic representation that makes the most sense to you, and listen to what the figures have to say for themselves. It's not a matter of right or wrong when you're dealing with the subconscious and the unseen.

, Increasingly, you may notice the figures in your channeling approach you. It may happen right away, or it may take a very long time. Let them approach you and interact with them. Speak with them.



Come clean with your intentions. Tell the figure why you're here and what you're looking for. Ask the figure if they've got your best interest at heart, and if they're willing to guide you in your investigation. If they cannot, ask the figure to leave and continue your practice.

Establish a mutual agreement. Ask them the question or central issue that you've been meditating on, or allow them to show you what they wish to show you. Together, decide how you'll communicate. Let the guide do their job: guiding you. Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with, but let the guide take charge of showing you what you want to learn.

, Your questions may already be answered, and it's your job to pay attention to what you're being shown. The more time you spend investigating common symbols of the occult and learning what you can about archetypal representation, the more significant your subconscious observations and communications will become. It may be largely visual.If your location is suddenly filled with scuttling lobsters and lions with their heads on backward, unbidden, you may come out of your trance and think, ""Whoa, trippy!"" But don't let it drop just there. Lobsters appear on the Tarot card for the Moon, signifying lunar energy and the subconscious, while the lion appears on the card for Strength. Significant? You decide.

, If you've found a guide to the spirit world or the center of your own consciousness after deep meditation and practice, you may want to find more direct and simple methods of communicating with that world, without meditating for hours or end and seeking them. The Ouija allows for quick communication and transmitting. This is also an excellent way of bringing other parties into your investigation, introducing them to your guide and allowing a mutual discourse to take place.


Meditate on your specific inquiry or question, articulating your intentions aloud and allowing your contact to get in touch. All parties should place their hands on the planchette at the center of the board, then allow it to move and spell out the answers to your questions.

, Over the centuries, experienced mediums have experimented with lots of different methods of communicating with their spirit guides by manipulating objects, including the use of crystals, rocks, smoke, and even bones. There are hundreds of different methods to choose from, and your spirit guide may even suggest a preferred method of communication.



Capnomancy refers to consulting the patterns of moving smoke to interpret the messages of the spirit world. Burn some sage or jasmine, laurel leaves, or sacred incense, depending on your tradition and interests, and observe the smoke as part of your meditations. Let symbols reveal themselves.

Sciomancy is the study of shadows and shades for symbols. Headless shadows are generally interpreted as ominous, though the spookiness shouldn't keep you away from this communication method. Make a candle a part of your meditation, and observe the shadows cast in the room on the walls, for symbols or messages to appear.

Scrying is the technical term for gazing into a crystal ball and looking for prophecies or symbols. You don't need to have an expensive ball of crystal to practicing scrying, however: it's also common to gaze into bowls of water, mirrors, or other reflective transparent surfaces.

, If you're more interested in hearing the sounds produced by the spirit world, sound-capture methods of communication may be more appropriate for your investigations.



In trumpet channeling, a phenomenon called ""direct voice phenomenon"" is the desired result of the consultation. The trumpet is basically a cone made of aluminum, a foot or two long, and used to transmit the ectoplasmic vibrations of the spirit guide.In electronic voice phenomenon (EVP), you can record on a digital recorder or tape recorder, the white noise of the room, while you ask the questions of your spirit guide that you want to ask. Wait quietly and listen closely to your recording to see if inaudible responses were captured on the tape.

, For some participants, especially those interested in plumbing the depths of their consciousness, experimenting with automatic writing is an effective way of communicating with the unknown. Start with your trance meditation and move to writing in response to your queries. All you've got to do is get out a pen and a piece of paper and write unconsciously, without pausing or paying attention to the words you're writing.


This is an excellent way of getting in touch with your own messages and reinforcing the agency and divinity of the self. You've got your own answers and can get in touch with them via automatic writing.
It's also effective to write down all your communications with your spirit guide, after extracting yourself from your trance state. It's important to keep a record of these communications, to allow yourself to investigate them later for parallels and symbolic echoes.

, Tarot and iChing consultation are formalized methods of questioning-and-answering that give up the agency of the answer to chance. Depending on how you choose to think about it, devote yourself to it, and prepare for it, this can work alongside or as an alternative to more complex consciousness channeling.



The Tarot doesn't require a complicated guidebook or method to start using. Get a deck and spend time analyzing each card, giving it weight. Draw cards and let your initial gut reaction to the card clue you into it's symbolic meaning. This can be an excellent way of having your queries addressed.

Consult the iChing for anecdotal responses. Using three coins, you can create a hexagram (six broken and unbroken lines) that corresponds to a particular symbol and entry in the iChing, called the ""book of changes."" With each hexagram is a brief symbolic anecdote, which can be read as a metaphorical response to the question you're meditating on.

, Depending on your interests and your tradition, you may find it necessary to chakra cleanse thoroughly prior to channeling, as a way of balancing and cleansing your energy pathways. On the other hand, you might find it more effective to pray, recite a mantra, or otherwise center yourself physically and emotionally.


However you choose to cleanse yourself for your investigations, make sure that you establish a mutual understanding and respect with your spirit guide. It's extremely important to establish boundaries and articulate your desires.

, Spend a considerable amount of time in trance meditation, developing your relationship with your guide before you start demanding the answers to life's mysteries. This may involve picturing the source as a person or presence with a name, image, or voice, if it hasn't already appeared to you as such. If you believe the source is within you, this may involve becoming more aware of yourself and your thoughts, feelings and habits.


End each session on a positive note. Thank your guide for their assistance and their guidance, offering respect and appreciation. Try not to end it in frustration or anger.

, Make the transmissions public by writing or otherwise recording your sessions with your guide. This both serves to distance the transmission from your psyche, and readies you to receive the next message. Keep the communication flowing through you, not sticking around and gunking up your subconscious.

Center your thoughts and quiet yourself, then wash and rinse these areas three times: your hands, mouth, face, nose, and lower forearms. Wash your head and ears once, then wash your feet three times (starting with the right foot).You can then point your right index finger to the sky and recite a prayer of witness: ""Ash-hadu anlaa ilaaha illALLAHu wahdahuu laa shariikalahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhuu wa rasuuluhu.""
The English translation is, ""I bear witness that there is no deity other than Allah alone; He is One; He has no partner and I bear witness that (Hadrat) Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) is His (chosen) servant and (true) Messenger.""
Perform Ablution after it’s been canceled by urination, defecation, discharges from the penis or vagina, excessive bleeding, and deep sleep.;
, Make sure your space is clean enough to be suitable for prayer. Place a mat onto the floor to ensure cleanliness. Position the mat so it (and you) face the Qibla, or Mecca.

, Start by centering yourself on your intention. Raise your hands to your ears while standing and say, “Allah Akbar,” which translates to “Allah is the Greatest,” to open your prayers. Then recite the Isteftah Dua, or opening prayer, followed by the Ta’awwuz and Tasmiah.


The Isteftah Dua is: “Subhana Kal-lah hum-ma wabi hamdika wata-bara kasmuka wata'ala jad-duka wala ilaha ghyruka.” This translates to, “Glory be to you, O Allah, and all praises are due unto you, and blessed is your name and high is your majesty and none is worthy of worship but you.”

The transliteration of the Tasmiah is, “Bismillah hir-Rahma nir-Raheem,” which translates to, “In the name of Allah, the most Kind and the most Merciful.” You should recite Tasmiah before each Surah, or chapter of the Quran, that you recite.

, Before offering the Salat-al-Istikhara, recite two rak’ah (prayer cycles), starting with the Surah Fatiha. Remember to start each Surah by saying, “Bismillah hir-Rahma nir-Raheem.” The Surah Fatiha is recited in each rak’ah. Its transliteration is:
Alhamdul lil-lahi rab-bil 'alameen
Ar rahma nir-raheem
Maliki yawmid-deen
Iyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'een
Ihdinas siratal mustaqeem
Siratal Lazeena an'amta 'alayhim
Ghai-ril maghdubi 'alayhim
Walad dal-leen. Ameen.
In English, this translates to:
Praise is only for Allah, Lord of the Universe.
The most Kind, the most Merciful.
The master of the Day of Judgement.
You alone we worship and to you alone we pray for help.
Show us the straight way,
The way of those whom you have blessed.
Who have not deserved your anger,
Nor gone astray., After the Surah Fatiha, continue your two rak’ah recitations with the Surah al-Kafirun, or chapter 109 of the Quran. Be sure to start each Surah by saying, “Bismillah hir-Rahma nir-Raheem.”


The transliteration of the Surah al-Kafirun is:
Qul yaa-ai yuhal kaafiroon
Laa a'budu ma t'abudoon
Wa laa antum 'aabidoona maa a'bud
Wa laa ana 'abidum maa 'abattum
Wa laa antum 'aabidoona ma a'bud
Lakum deenukum wa liya deen.
This translates to:
Say : O ye that reject Faith!
I worship not that which ye worship,
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
Nor will I worship those whom you have worshipped;
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
To you be your Way, and to me mine., Say the Surah Fatiha once again, then recite the Surah al-Ikhlas. Start with Tasmiah, or “Bismillah hir-Rahma nir-Raheem.”


The transliteration of Surah al-Ikhlas is:
Qul huwal laahu ahad
Allah hus-samad
Lam yalid wa lam yoolad
Wa lam yakul-lahu kufuwan ahad
The English translation is:
Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;
Allah, the Eternal, Absolute;
He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;
And there is none like unto Him., After offering two rak’ah, you are ready to recite the Istikhara supplication.The Salat-al-Istikhara transliteration is:
Allahumma innee astakheeruka bi ilmika wa-astaqdiruka biqudratika wa-as'aluka min fadhlika al-adheem. Fa innaka taqdiru walaa aqdiru. Wa ta'lamu walaa a'alamu wa anta allaamul ghuyoob.

Wa in-kunta ta'lamu anna haadhal amr sharrun liy fiy deeniy wa-ma'aashiy wa-'aaqibat amriy. Fa asrifhu 'annee wa-srifni 'anhu. Wa aqdur lial khayra haythu kaana thumma a-rdhiniy bihee.
The English translation is:
O Allah! Behold I ask You the good through Your Knowledge, and ability through Your Power, and beg (Your favour) out of Your infinite Bounty. For surely You have Power; I have none. You know all; I know not. You are the Great Knower of all things.
O Allah! If in Your Knowledge this matter be good for my faith, for my livelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then ordain it for me, and make it easy for me, and bless me therein. But if in Your Knowledge, this matter be bad for my faith, for my livelihood, and for the consequences of my affairs, then turn it away from me, and turn me away therefrom, and ordain for me the good wherever it be, and cause me to please with it.
Where ""haadhal amr"" (this matter) appears, mention the affair for which you seek guidance.

, You may choose to repeat the Istikhara supplication or continue reciting as many rak’ah as you desire. Continue to incorporate Istikhara into your daily prayers until you have found resolution. Try performing it for seven days, but stop if you feel you have been given an answer."

Expect luck.,
List your accomplishments, daily.,
Celebrate little wins and big wins alike.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Try to be more outgoing.,
Be more flexible.",How to Feel Lucky2," The reason luck happens to the lucky is that lucky people go into a situation expecting success and expecting a lucky outcome. It's just like grandma always used to say: If you think it's going to be boring, it will be. If you go into work expecting a rough day, chances are it's going to be a rough day. If you go into an experience expecting that you're going to have an opportunity for success, you're going to make it happen.


Expecting a lucky outcome will make you more aware of advantages and opportunities. Like the lucky people looking through the paper, you'll be more aware and on the lookout for that little thing that's going to get you ahead of the game, rather than giving up prematurely, because you feel unlucky.

, At the end of each day, reflect back on what you've accomplished. Each thing ticked off your to-do list, each goal finished for the day should be celebrated with a mental note and a reward. Don't think about things you wish you would have done, or the things you'd liked to have made time for. Think about what you actually did. Focus hard on your accomplishments and celebrate them.


List big accomplishments and small ones. Cleaning up the kitchen without a fuss? That's an accomplishment. Getting out of bed and riding the bus to work? Huge deal. Feel lucky about it.

, Take a little time out of each day to celebrate the things you've accomplished. It doesn't have to be a blowout party with champagne and cake, but some quiet reflection over new accomplishments and old successes is very important to help you feel lucky.


Learning to look back over each day to examine your accomplishments will also help you to move forward and set yourself up for more accomplishments. Get addicted to that pleased feeling of having done something productive today.
Make sure your celebrations aren't counterproductive. Celebrating a hard day at the office with a long night at the bar won't make tomorrow very easy on you.

, We tend to compare ourselves to people in our social circles: siblings, Facebook friends, or high school classmates. All too often, we may not feel we ""measure up"". But the only person you have got to please with your accomplishment is yourself. Feeling that you do not compare with others make you feel that you are somehow unfortunate, too. Social networking can be a real downer. People tend to post the good things, and not mention the ordinary or the bad as much. As a result, you may see your ex-roommate's awesome photos of his trip to Puerto Rico, and feel jealous. But you may not hear about how he fought with his wife the whole trip!
Remember your qualities if you compare yourself to others. Maybe you do envy your friend's artwork. However, you are the person she comes to when she needs her computer fixed -- a practical skill that she lacks. That is every bit as admirable as artistic ability!

, Learning to put yourself out there can help you make connections and feel fortuitous and fortunate. Expect that every interaction you have with a stranger, even five minutes on the subway, could be life-changing and critical. Maybe the bored guy chatting with you at the post-office might be a like-minded musician you could start a band with. Maybe the cute barista is ""the one."" Don't let opportunities pass you by.

, Having plans is a good way to feel unlucky and disappointed. No one will feel lucky all the time, or experience good fortune every day, but learning to roll with the punches and be at least a little flexible will help you to get the best out of those situations that don't go the way you want.


Try to stay focused on the bigger picture. If your peaceful Sunday at home, a day you wanted to devote to cleaning, or spending with your partner, has been interrupted by your friend needed a ride to the airport, don't overreact. Celebrate the chance you'll get to hang out with your friend before a trip. Go into with positive energy.

Supplement your hard work with lucky charms.,
Look for lucky insects and animals.,
Keep lucky plants.,
Wear lucky charms.,
Make your space lucky with feng shui.",How to Feel Lucky3," While it may seem superstitious to some, it's true that adorning yourself with lucky totems or keeping an eye out for lucky signs can help lots of people feel more lucky. You shouldn't stake all your good feelings on arbitrary symbols and signs, but it's perfectly healthy to feel fortunate on any day you're landed on by a ladybug, or any day that starts with a positive omen.

, Across cultures, insects and other animals are often thought of as being either unlucky, or lucky, depending on the situation. If you're out among the wildlife, keep an eye out for the following lucky insects or animals:


Crickets. Crickets are though to bring good luck from Europe to Asia, as well as the Native American tribes who thought of crickets as bringers of fortune. In some cultures, imitating the sound of a cricket is seen as unlucky.
Ladybugs. Some people think that a ladybug that lands on a recently-wedded woman will reveal the number of children she will have in its spots, or the number of dollars soon to be found. Also, ladybugs are thought to bring signs of good weather. Never kill a ladybug if it lands on you.
Dragonflies, scarabs, rabbits, eagles, tortoises, dolphins, frogs, bats and many other animals are also commonly thought of as being lucky. If you've got a favorite animal, carry a picture or a totem of that animal with you for luck., Aromatic and lovely, keeping plants in your house can be a wonderful way of livening up your space, as well as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in many cultures. Different plants are thought to have a variety of luck-bringing properties. Some common lucky house plants include:


Honeysuckle, lavender, and jasmine are some of the most aromatic plants you can grow, instantly bringing soothing scents into your space. Some people think that the presence of these plants can help to influence your dreams, easing you off to sleep and helping to ease you into a new day of luck and fortune.
Bamboo is one of the luckiest plants, thought to bring wealth, creativity, and health to the planters. Bamboo forests are considered mystical and sacred places in many cultures.
Basil, rosemary, and sage are all thought to be protective herbs to grow in your home, or around your home. Tenacious plants in many climates, these aromatic herbs are useful in cooking and were even commonly used in exorcisms., You don't have to go out looking for lucky charms–bring them with you! Having a lucky necklace, rabbit's foot charm, a special rock or other little trinket in your pocket can give you feelings of fortune that will help translate into positive actions and luck-making behaviors.


Alternatively, some people actually find good energy in ""unlucky"" objects and things. For instance, black cats or the number 13. If you find your black cat keychain gives you peace of mind, who cares what popular opinion says.
Superstitious beliefs may not suit your personal sensibilities. But it may be helpful to have a soothing object to remind you of a person, place, belief, or moment that centers you and remind you how fortunate you really are. This will also make you feel lucky without superstition.

, While it may sound silly, organizing your house according to the principles of design will help to channel your positive and lucky energy into good behaviors. If you feel good by creating a lucky and healthful space for yourself, you'll behave in ways that suit your best interests. At the least, a tidy house will make it easier to make your plans come to fruition.


De-clutter the entryway to your house. According to feng shui, the entrance to your house emphasizes flowing positive energy. So clean up around the front door. Maybe that will increase your luck, but at least it will make it more likely you will have luck finding your keys.
Some people think the color of your doors can help make your home lucky. According to the principles of feng shui, south-facing doors should be red or orange, while north-facing doors should be blue or black.
Arrange furniture to create circular spaces. Boxy organization can interrupt positive energy and luck in your home. Instead, look to create curved arrangements for your furniture, to create a more fluid living space.

Hard to ring the bells.",How to Maintain Church Bells," The church should maintain a log concerning the bell(s) that includes date of purchase, place of purchase, make, style (including photos in case of theft) and maintenance schedule.;
, Depending on your church fund availability, you may choose to have someone employed part-time as part of the church staff or you may choose to bring in restoration and care contractors regularly.

, There are some key things that an inspection should include and you should make sure that the person caring for the bells covers these elements:


Visual overlook of the entire structure (bell, tower (steeple), wooden or steel supports etc. Any signs of cracks, aging or wear and tear should be noted and looked into.
Bolts should be examined. Loose bolts should be tightened and rusting bolts should be replaced.
Examine all pulley structures. If there is any sign of wear, stress or obstructed rotation, they may need replacement or adjustment.
Check ropes for wear. Any ropes that are fraying or damaged should be replaced.
Check out the clapper joints. These should be adequately lubricated. Adjustments may also be needed.

, Ask the person responsible to file a report of work performed and add your own observations as well.

, Occasionally you may need to consider metal restoration coatings or other refinishing activities to ensure the continued upkeep of the bell(s). This will restore the shine and glory of your bells.

, This might be a sign that the pulley blocks or wheel are loose, poorly aligned or damaged. Also look for signs of rope wear.
Muffled or stuttering bell. This could be a sign that the clapper return springs are loose or broken.
Shock comes down when ringing bell. This may be a sign that the bell is loose from its yoke connection. Immediately desist use, clear the area and call for repair. The bell is at severe risk of tumbling.

Consider the following: who will you loan books to (the community or just the congregation), how long will you loan books out for, creating a committee to decide on which books should be included, when should books be taken out of the collection, how will the books be arranged (e.g. alphabetically: by author or by title or by subjects), will any resources be allocated to running the library (purchasing materials or books or computers).

, Try to keep a running total of the number of materials checked out and how many people visit to show how useful the library is to your community.

,, Make sure that this area is well ventilated and not a humid space. Also make sure that this area is accessible for all of your members.

, Focus on authors that would fit your congregation or mission statement best. Then begin making a list of books which you plan to have at the library.

,, Using a 4 X 9.5 inch envelope sealed shut and then cut in half will hold an index card.

, These index cards (since they hold up better than just paper) will help you keep track of when and how often the book is loaned out. These cards should list the title of the book and then below the due date and who it was loaned to. The due date should also be stamped on the library card holder in to book itself.

Pray the Istikhara when you need to make a decision.,
Perform Istikhara after Salat al-Fajr or Salat al-Lail.,
Seek advice from knowledgeable people when praying for guidance.",How to Do Istikhara2," Performing Istikhara is appropriate whenever you have to make a non-obligatory decision. It’s a powerful prayer of guidance for whenever you are unsure about a decision. Examples could include:Choosing a university or graduate school.
Deciding whether to take a job offer.
Choosing a spouse.

, It’s always best to recite two rak’ah before asking for guidance. It’s advised to incorporate Istikhara into your morning prayer (Salat al-Fajr) or after Salat al-Lail. Salat al-Lail is a voluntary late night prayer. It does not have a mandated number of rak’ah, but if it you perform it, it must be after the obligatory Isha, or night prayer., When you recite Salat-al-Istikhara, you should also seek advice from those you believe are wise and knowledgeable. Avoid thinking that your answers will simply come to you in dreams or visions.For example, suppose you are deciding whether to take a new job. You should consult a knowledgeable elder, like a relative or mentor. Ask them, “Will you help me understand how this new job might affect my life and my faith? Do you think this is a good decision?”

"
"
Pray with sincerity.,
Say the prayer with firm convictions instead of begging.,
Don’t be impatient after saying the prayer.",How to Do Istikhara3," When you center yourself on an intention in prayer, you should say truthfully in your heart and mind that you are asking for guidance and need help. Further, you should be open to receiving it and taking action. To be sincere, you should be willing to get an answer and follow through even if it’s not the one you want to hear., Your intention should only be to clearly ask for guidance with firm convictions. Avoid begging or pleading. If you beg or plead, you’re not really asking for guidance, but asking for something you desire to come true., You shouldn’t put Allah on a timetable. Be patient, and avoid showing haste or desperation. Remember not to expect miracles or symbolic visions when praying Istikhara, but to be open to answers in the forms of advice and subtle signs or feelings."

It is also advisable to sterilize food preparation areas, tables, high chairs and all equipment related to feeding and the preparation of food., Make sure that children wash their hands as well, before and after., After a child sleeps in a crib, the sheets should be washed before another child sleeps in the same crib. Have enough spare sets of clean sheets available for each service. Crib mattresses should be wiped down at times too. Ensure that child friendly products are used. Mattresses must be covered with waterproof material to make wiping them a practical way to clean them. Cloths used to wipe mattresses must also be sterile., Objects like light switches, door handles, pens, counters, sinks are touched frequently and should be wiped off with disinfectant wipes weekly or more., Better yet, wash the toys with dish soap and water, then soak them in liquid disinfectant and rinse or just spray them with disinfectant.

A large room, a park in good weather, or the beach in the summer are great places for teenagers to connect.;
, Word of mouth works great, so encourage frequent members to talk to their friends about the youth group. Place an announcement in the church newsletter and Sunday bulletin. If the church has a website, add a link for youth ministry information. Don't forget Facebook and Twitter, as these are very popular with youth.

, For a lot of these kids, the youth group will evolve into their greatest friends base, and that's a wonderful thing- if you can get it to happen. Play some get-to-know-you games, encourage group discussion and mingling. Get the teens out of their pre-set cliques. Make sure there are no teens left out or uncomfortable.

, The youth know what the youth want. Often, it's best to pick 11th or 12th graders to form a ""core"" or ""leadership"" team to plan events and the like. At this age, they'll have developed maturity, planning skills, and hopefully a sincere love of God.

, Youth love music, and if you can find the right kind of music, even the quiet type will open up eventually. Set a mood, and use song as prayer. Those who aren't willing to sing under most circumstances tend to find themselves singing with joy when the Holy Spirit acts through them.

, Many youth groups are stagnant because the youth just don't care. Love of God is contagious, so let yours show for the benefit of those around you.

, Away from the hustle of routine life, retreats can truly cause amazing spiritual conversions, and encourage youth to attend the regular meetings as well.

, There is perhaps no more important thing to do for your youth ministry than this.

",How to Keep the Church Nursery Safe," This is the first step to having a safe nursery. Hold training classes for nursery workers and hold a test at the end. Screen and interview all workers and helpers. Train workers in:


CPR
First Aid
Child Development
Child Safety
Rules and Policies
Child Behavior
Child Care (feeding, diapering, holding, sleeping, calming, toileting);
, Have parents fill out information cards when they drop there child off. Have the information include:


the child's name
the child's age
the child's allergies and medical conditions
the parent's name
the parent's location or phone number
an emergency contact
requests
sign in and out times
parent's signature

, Place a name tag on each child when they come in. Have the child's information on the name tag, too.

, This step is very important because some nurseries can't care for a newborn. You probably don't want a six year old playing with the twelve month old. Decide on an age. Normally four is the oldest age. You can decide on the youngest ages depending on  workers and the number of children that come each week.

, All toys should NOT be able to fit inside a toilet paper tube. If any toy, or parts of the toy can fit through it, do not use.

, Have the professionals come in yearly to make sure that your furniture is still safe. If the furniture is not, get rid of the piece of furniture and buy a new piece. It is best to replace all furniture every three years.

, Make sure all edges are not sharp. Make sure that it is strong and durable.

, Have an escape plan and how-to instructions on what to do in a fire posted on the wall next to the emergency numbers and fire extinguisher. Have fire drills each week. If possible, have the nursery be close to fire exits. Have windows in entrance doors. Label exits clearly.

, Cover them with child safe electric outlet covers.

, Make sure that you can still exit quickly in a fire, though.

, Don't keep blankets, pillows, toys, stuffed animals (unless the child brought one and is over 12 months). Make sure that a soda can can't pass through the space between the mattress and the crib. Have all mattresses down as low as they can go. Make sure that crib sheets are on tightly. If a child is over 35 inches (88.9 cm) tall, do not use a crib.

, Strap children in with a safety strap. Never leave a child's side.


Make sure that the child can not reach the wipes, cream, ointment, gloves, bags, or lotion. Dispose of diapers properly immediately after changing the diaper.

, Never leave a pail or container of water within a child's reach. A child could drown in the water.

, Do not let children handle them. Don't keep them within a child's reach.

, Never use any glass or breakable items with children. Other objects to keep locked up include knives, scissors, sharp objects, small items that can be choked on, plastic bags, tools, chemical cleaners, and anything else that presents a possible hazard to the children.

, Install window guards. Don't place furniture that a child can climb on, stools, or cribs by windows. Make sure that windows are easily accessible in a fire. Tie window blind cords up. Do the same to window curtains.

, Put a child proof lock on the door to the bathroom. Monitor children in the bathroom. If possible, have everything in the bathroom be child-sized. If not, keep a step stool in the bathroom but, only take it out when an adult is around. Keep hazardous objects up and put away. Make sure that stools and toilet seats are safe and durable.

, Always lay infants down on their backs. Support infants' heads if they are under six months. Do not let little children carry the infants around.

, Provide safe activities that teach to stay away from hot items, to not touch sharp items, to stay away from poisonous items (see below), to not put anything in your mouth except food, to stay in the nursery until your parents come, to follow instructions in a fire or weather related disaster. This should be done with children one and over.

, Place a sticker that stands for poisonous on any poisonous items. See the last eight items in seventeen and vitamins, medicines, cosmetics, cleaners, detergent, shoe polish, and perfume. Have poisonous items in a locked and out of reach cabinet from children.

, 1 adult to 3 children under 24 months, 1 adult to 4 children 24 to 30 months, 1 adult to 5 children 31 to 35 months, 1 adult to 7 children that are three years old and over.

, Make sure that at least two more volunteers than you would normally need are trained and ready to help each week.

, This prevents choking.

, Make sure that everything is safe each week.

, Have tornado drills or other weather drills depending on your town. If you live in a high-risk tornado town, have these once a month. If you live in a town where they are only likely during certain times of the year, have them then. If you are likely to have an earthquake, have these drills monthly.

Be at your spot.

,
When commanded to by the tower captain, use the rope to pull the clapper, let it fall back a little, and then pull the clapper again with the other bell ringers.,
The mass will soon begin.

",How to Ring Church Bells2,", This will repeat until you are commanded by the tower captain to stop the bells.

,"
"
Be at your bell.

,
When commanded to by the bell ringer manager, begin pushing your bell and making it swing.,
Bring the bells to a complete standstill when commanded to by the bell ringer manager.

",How to Ring Church Bells3,", Be careful as the bell can come back at you very fast, so you will need to time your pushes precisely.


If the bells are rotating, keep pushing your bell as it makes it's rotations.

Or, if you are using an electric mechanism to rotate the bells, be sure to be careful going near your bell.



,"
"
Find your spot.,
When commanded to, power on your mechanism.,
Power off your mechanism when commanded to/ when the mass is about to begin.

",How to Ring Church Bells4," Be where the electric mechanisms are (if there are multiple operators of the mechanisms, stand by one of them).

, This mechanism will automatically begin swinging the church bell connected to your mechanism back and forth and not only that, ringing it.

,"
"
Locate a place to put the nursery.",How to Start a Church Nursery2," You may want to convert an existing room into a nursery, or your church may choose to build a new addition to the church just for the nursery.


You will want the nursery located as close to the sanctuary as possible. This is convenient for parents who are bringing their children to the nursery. Be sure to check that the noise from the nursery will not hinder the church service.
It is a good idea to have an adjoining restroom to the nursery. This is for the caretakers to have access to a restroom without having to leave the babies. It is also good for children who are toilet training.
Access to a sink is also important for a nursery. The sink should be located in the same room.

"
"
Paint the nursery with paint that is safe for children.,
Cover the floor with carpeting.,
Decorate the walls with colorful pictures and baby decorations.",How to Start a Church Nursery3," You may want to choose paint colors that coordinate with your room accessories, or you could choose a paint color first, and then pick your accessories to compliment the wall color. Try a color such as blue that helps calm children. Search the internet for how colors affect children.


Wall murals are popular in church nurseries. Consider hiring someone to paint a mural on the wall that coordinates with the room's theme.

, You will want a floor covering that is easy to clean. You could also include a rug that matches your colors or your theme.

, You want this room to be inviting and pleasing to parents. You may even want to pick a decorating theme, such as Noah's Ark.

"
"
Purchase furniture for the baby nursery.,
Buy toys and play things for the nursery.,
Stock necessary items in the nursery.",How to Start a Church Nursery4," You will need to buy enough baby beds to accommodate the babies for the size of your church. You will want to purchase a changing table for changing diapers. You will need rocking chairs for the nursery workers to have a place to sit. A children's table and chairs works well for feeding and playing. High chairs may also come in handy for feedings.


Include some type of storage unit for diaper bags in your baby nursery. You may want to purchase a cubby unit with shelves. Some nurseries have peg hangers attached to the wall for hanging diaper bags.

, Mobiles and baby play stations are good accessories to purchase for a church nursery. A baby swing with music could also be purchased.

, You will want to have a good supply of diapers and wipes. Consider purchasing antibacterial soaps and paper towels. You should purchase a first aid kit.


You will want to purchase a special cabinet for storing any supplies.
Monitor the supplies in your cabinet and be sure to restock as needed.

"
"
Ask for volunteers to work in the nursery.,
Hire nursery workers.",How to Start a Church Nursery5," Most churches have people who are willing to take turns working in the nursery.


Set up a nursery schedule for the volunteers. Post the schedule so that nursery workers know when they are responsible for working.

, Some churches have a budget that includes enough funds for hiring nursery workers.

"
"
Research to learn if there are parent disclaimers that will be necessary for the operation of the nursery.,
Check to see if your church will need special insurance to cover the operation of a nursery.",How to Start a Church Nursery6," You may wish to have parents sign permission forms before allowing their children to stay in the nursery.

, Your church insurance agent should be able to answer any questions you may have about nursery insurance.

Find out whether the church design architect has a valid license to work in the state you need to build.,
Ask to see other projects by the church design architect that are similar to what you're looking for and you're willing to spend.,
Take note of whether you feel that the church design architect understands the church's worship style.,
Ask what kind of information the architect company needs from the church.,
Be sure that the architect respects the church's goals and budget of the church.,
Find out how the church design architect company will charge the church and when the payments expected.,
If there are design changes, ask how your architect will deal with the changing of fees for the church.,
Ask the architect to provide you with a list of references so that you can talk with personally to get other people's full opinion?,
Ask whether the architect is willing to provide smaller projects if the larger plans do not meet the church's budget.,
Always find out what the steps, or phases, are in the design process and how long should each take.",How to Discuss Renovations with a Church Design Architect," This is a vital question to ask. This lets you know the church design architect is up to date on the insurance and have completed a required course of knowledge to get their certification.;
, When you've an individual who doesn't do a good job, they'll hide their inferior work in the hope that they can drum up business. Be sure you check into the individual's previous work and reputation to determine if they're a good match.

, Is it likely that the designer will take it into consideration with the design of the building? For some religions, there are special design structures that are needed. In some cases, altar placement will be essential. It is important that the church design architect knows your religious practices to ensure they meet your needs.

, Giving the church design architect company the information they need is vital. They may need to know specifications and sizes to ensure that your minimum needs are met. Providing them this info helps you to avoid future problems.

, Ask them how they intend to keep these goals and budget constraints. While you might have someone willing to do the job, they might not be willing to honor your budget. Only you know what your church wants to accomplish and the funds that you have. Keep this in mind and make sure the church design architect understands this.

, Some architects want payments up front, while others look for them to be spread over the course of time. Make sure you have the money they need for the process during the expected payment times. Never simply give them money up front and wait for them to return work.

, Some of these individuals will provide a few minor changes for free other church design architect companies will charge a nominal fee. Be sure you understand the fee structure before you go in. This way you can gauge the cost based on how clearly you define your needs.

, This can prove to be essential. A good church design architect will have no problem giving you contact information for references that had a good experience with them.

, Sometimes you need to work in smaller portions. You might begin with the altar and move to the kitchen. If this is the case, check with the church design architect to see if they will do this, to keep you in budget.

, Because you have never dealt with this process before, you should check to see what phases you can expect during this process. On top of that, you should ask them how long each step will take to keep them on schedule as you are planning your workers and other tasks that needs to be done.

Keep all external entrances and egresses shut.,
Line the pews.,
Provide kneeling cushions.,
Lay down rugs over cold floors.,
Keep the congregation close together.,
Install heat lamps above pews.,
Hold a fundraiser to get money for central heating.,
Consider more than heating.,
Ask the congregation to help with warming improvement projects.",How to Make Your Church Warmer," During winter or on cold days, all windows and doors that lead outdoors should be kept shut, except those crucial for some ventilation.;
, Use rugs or runners to line pews. Have the ladies' group knit or sew such items as a defined project. This can become quite an honor for those involved in creating the pew wear.

, To prevent knees on cold floors, use kneeling cushions. Tapestry covered cushions are ideal, but other less labor intensive versions will also do.

, This will help to stop damp from rising.

, Ask members of the congregation to fill the church from the front to back. That way, if there are not a lot of people at any one time, they are at least at the front near the priest and they are generating warmth together.

, These can be obtained for a minimal cost and many are very energy-efficient. They can be switched on when the congregation is in attendance and they can be switched off at the close of service. Only those near people need be used to reduce heating costs.

, There are many different fundraisers you could think of with the purpose of heating the church.

, Fill gaps under doors and around windows. Seal cracks in the ceiling. Shut doors leading to internal rooms as well as these will only draw away the heat. Shut extra vents (not a majority of vents so the back pressure doesn't hurt the heater) in the back of the church on weeks there is no one to sit there there. Install ceiling fans to blow hot air down and mix it in rather than allowing it to accumulate at the roof and transfer heat out at a high rate near the ceiling.

, This volunteer labor will reduce costs and will also raise ideas among the members of the congregation.

"
"
Add a website for your congregation.,
Improve the signage around your church.,
Think about adding social media to your public relations efforts.,
Use press releases to the media to update the community on your upcoming events or any special congregational news.,
Plan an event at your church that is open to the public.,
Distribute post cards, fliers or door hangers in your immediate area.

,
Make your congregants stewards of your church.,
Keep the people who visit you by making them feel welcome.",How to Grow Your Church," This will be a useful tool to promote your church, and it will allow you to post basic, yet helpful, information such as service hours, contact information and general or historical information about the organization. It will also allow you a means to post event schedules and a way to solicit email address sign-ups from potential new members wanting information.;
,


Make sure that people know who you are and what kind of church or service that you offer.
Post your service times, and be sure and include that all are welcome to attend.
Choose a large, legible font.
Consider lighting for the signage.
Think about signage where you can change the letters on a portion of it. That way you can update the message on a regular basis and communicate upcoming events or special themes for the church.

, This no-cost marketing technique will be particularly popular with the younger crowd.


Sign up for a Facebook or Twitter account, and list general congregation information.
Add friends and spread the word that you now have a Twitter or Facebook account.
Post information such as upcoming sermon themes or tell the congregation and your guests about upcoming church events or fundraisers.

, This is a great tool to publicize events, fund raisers or to share with your town about special anniversaries or large gifts.

, Remind the congregation to invite their friends and families, to post signage and too send out press releases.

,,


Teach your congregants how to be disciples of your church by conducting mini-seminars, offering evangelism courses and putting tips in your program.
Encourage them to set a goal of bringing a certain number of new guests each month.

,


Make sure to have greeters at every entrance.
Have the pastor welcome all new guests in his or her greeting.
Collect information on the people who visit, and send emails inviting them back for future events and services.

"
"
Think of a new program idea: for instance whether to build a new church building.

,
Do informal research among your acquaintances at the church.,
Get support for your program idea.,
Select a strong inspirational leader who can advocate the program as a spokesperson and chairperson.

,
Talk to the pastor.,
Attend the whole church business meeting for the voting members of the congregation to discuss the idea of the new building program--perhaps scheduled before an evening-service time or after a day-service time.,
Have a Finance Committee report at a church business meeting to explain the bond program.,
Have the Building Plan Committee search for an existing church design of the size/kind that your church likes.,
Have a Building Plan Committee meeting to present the plans to be voted upon, expecting them to be accepted.

,
Continue selling bonds using materials furnished by the bond company.,
Church Board can proceed with the acquiring of the land, if that will be needed.

,
Have the Church Board select a general church building contractor who will hire the subcontractors and oversee purchasing materials and services for the construction.

,
Have a ground breaking ceremony, and begin the building process.

,
Register the plans with the city building development and inspections department.

,
Finish the building with proper procedures like using plumbers and electricians and getting inspections as required on various stages of the construction.

",How to Begin a New Program or Activity at Your Church,", See how many agree that this is needed or is a good idea.

, Form an informal discussion, but be careful not to include more than one church board member, or this may be considered a ""meeting of the board excluding the pastor."" That will present immediate problems, if the pastor is a strong minded supervisor of that church.


Also regarding the pastor: he/she should not decide pro or con about such new programs without meeting with the board and having their support, at least informally discussing it with key members and volunteers, etc.

,, If he likes your idea and the research that you have done, then ask for a board meeting to discuss it and to schedule a church business meeting.


The rules of business of the church should be listed in the church ""constitution and by-laws"" or similar document. Who is eligible to vote on business should be explained there also.

,


The members will be allowed to discuss the idea whether you need to move or build at present location or to find an area in which to buy land.
The members will decide when to make a motion when the discussion is finished and vote on the motion to build or to buy land or both.
If the idea is agreed upon, then elect or appoint a Finance Committee and a Building Plan Committee to learn about how to proceed and to present their findings later.;
,


Ask for and take pledges of amounts that members will promise to donate monthly or in a lump sum to help pay off bonds.
Have a presentation by an approved/recommended"" church bond company that can handle issuing church bonds.

Get volunteers to agree to sell bonds for free (with no commission or pay).

,


Ask about their design and engineering plans, etc., and request to buy or borrow a copy of those building plans for a relatively small donation to their church.

,, The interest rate is considerably better for the buyer than one can get at a bank. The church has to pay these off with interest.


The bonds are for various numbers of years so that the investor can tie up their money for about as long as they like.

Before the service starts, set up the count room with all the supplies needed to count the offering.,
Once the offering is taken, have at least 2 or 3 people proceed to the safe to lock up the offering.,
Once the Offering is secure, return to the service.,
After the service, all counters should proceed to the count room.

,
Enter the count room.,
Remove the offering from the safe and place it on the table.

,
Pray.

,
Empty the container onto the table and put the empty container aside off the table.

,
Separate the loose plate cash from the checks and enveloped offering.

,
Open each envelope.,
Depending on how many counters you have, assign at least two or more counters to the cash and one or more counters to the checks.,
Compare the tapes of the cash and check envelopes with the tapes of the actual cash and checks.",How to Count the Offering," You will need a count table and enough chairs for all counters, tally forms, Transaction sheets, pens, calculators, stapler, deposit slips, deposit account ink stamp, deposit bag(s).;
, No one person should be in the room once the offering has been taken. This is known as dual control.

, The offering will not be counted until after the close of service.

,, (Men, do not wear your jackets into the count area.) Once entering, put all purses, books and papers, etc. in a designated area away from the count table. Your table should already be set up with everything needed to do the count.

,,,,, Check the following for each:


Make sure the envelope is filled out with at least a name. If it is not, you can fill out the envelope if it contains a check. If it contains cash there is no way for you to know who the contributor is so put the cash in with the loose plate cash.
Check the amount in the envelope against the amount written on the envelope. Make a correction on the envelope if necessary.
Write on the envelope either ""Cash"" or ""Check"". If the envelope contains both, make sure you write both ""Cash and ""Check"", specifying an amount for each.
As you empty the envelopes, separate the checks from the cash, and further separate the cash by denominations. Put each denomination in the proper denomination basket and the checks in a pile.
After all envelopes are emptied, run a tape on the cash envelopes and a separate tape on the check envelopes.

,


Cash counters will each take a tally sheet. Each will fill out their tally sheet as they count the cash. In the end all tally sheets should be the same. If they are not find and fix the error.
Cash counters will counter the loose cash, following the same process as outlined in step 13.
Check counters will sort the checks from lowest amount to highest amount (by sorting them in this manner, it will be easier to find an error later should the totals not match). One person will run a tape on the checks. Then another person will run a tape. The two tapes should be the same. If they are not find and fix the error.

, They each should match.

Determine what attributes and features of the church are likely to capture the attention of the public.,
Evaluate local print media options.,
Create and launch a web site.,
Use social networking.,
Encourage word of mouth advertising.",How to Advertise a Church," This may be some belief or aspect of the worship experience that is a normal part of the church's culture, or programs or upcoming events that may be of interest to the wider community. Knowing specifically what you want to advertise will make it easier to choose the right methods to reach people who are more likely to respond.;
, Some local papers offer special rates to faith-based organizations that want to run ads for specific events. Local publications sometimes have religion editors who are happy to write a small blurb about a church or some upcoming event. Find out how much these types of ads will cost, as well as what types of free advertising in the form of short articles or community notices can be placed in local and weekly print publications and reach a sector of the community.

, Many churches today create and maintain web sites that provide information about worship schedules, ministries offered, and upcoming events. Consider including audio or even video links to past sermons or worship services so people can get an idea of how the services are structured. Don't forget to include the ability for visitors to the site to make contact via email if they have any questions.

, Creating groups or pages on major social networking sites can be a great way to get in front of people who live in the area and make use of this communication tool regularly. This tool also makes it easy for members to share information about upcoming events with their friends by linking over to the page or group. Many of these social networking sites are free to use, making them ideal for use by non-profit organizations.

, Support efforts of members to spread the word about upcoming events that would be of interest to others in the community. Provide simple handouts and brochures that members can leave with friends, and that those friends in turn can pass on to others. This simple approach is often effective over time, enhancing the reputation of the church as being a welcoming and friendly place.

Be considerate of the other religion.,
Always speak respectfully of faith in all of its forms.,
Arrange for meet-ups between your religion and the other religion.,
Talk to the priests if you learn of anything causing problems in the neighborhood as a result of religion.,
Encourage learning between the religions.,
Attend a service in the other religion.",How to Live in an Area With a Predominant Religion and Not Add to the Religious Polarization," While it may not conform with your beliefs, it is important that inter-faith respect be promoted and actively observed. You can set a great example by showing this respect.;
, Do not try to place one religion above another but see them as faith in general. Lead by example and others will feel comfortable in following this style of communication.

, It might be something as simple as a potluck supper, or something as elaborate as a food fair where you provide the neighborhood with the opportunity to sample different fare associated with the cultures behind each religion.

, Priests tend to have the respect of their religious community and are an important means through which any inter-religious unrest can be prevented.

, Have open days where the different faiths can be explored by the neighborhood.

, Show interest and obey their requests for different ways of dress, seating, etc. This will help to increase your understanding and respect for the other religion and provides you with an opportunity to meet key people in the other religion who can help explain things that you are curious about.

Match your site's size and complexity to the volunteers you have who will maintain it.,
Start with a Home page, with a brief welcome, schedule and, if possible, a picture of your members smiling into the camera.

,
Write a Map page.,
You need a page about your Minister.,
Activities/Schedule Page: Sunday Services at 9:00 and 11:00 will be on the home page.,
A ""Beliefs"" or ""Statement of Faith"" page may be helpful.",How to Design a Church Web Site," You don't want something elaborate that will go out of date quickly when the person who set it up goes off to college. Don't set up pages for ""Weekly Sermon Topics"", ""Upcoming Events"" or ""Calendar"" unless you have someone willing to update the content every day, week or month.;
,, You might want to label it ""How to find us"", so that visitors don't confuse it with the site map page. See the related article, ""How to Design the Map Page for a Simple Church Web Site"".

, It might have a biography, a welcome statement from him/her and a picture or him/her.

, Repeat it here, but this page is mainly for Wednesday night Bible study, Saturday softball, Book discussion groups, etc. Note again that if you don't have someone willing to update this page regularly, either don’t have it or list just the events that happen every month/week.

Create a mission.,
Gather a committee.,
Create a vision.,
Decide on a logo and a theme.,
Come up with a theme for each of the Sunday School classrooms.,
Add decorations for a nice touch.,
Advertise widely.",How to Begin a Children's Ministry," Your mission statement is a written piece of paper setting out what your children's ministry is out to do. It provides evidence of what your children's ministry promises to do and what it will not do. Remember to hand out your mission. Keep the original and copy it to give out to all of the people in your church before the children's ministry takes off. Take on board the comments that will help to ensure your mission is exactly as it needs to be for the children's requirements.


Here is a sample of a mission: We, the children's ministry committee, are set out to bring each and every child closer to Jesus. We will do our best to reach every child and accommodate your needs. We cannot promise that everything will turn out as you please, we must make all of our decisions for the benefit of the whole congregation. No physical punishment is ever used as well as bad words or lies. Every child is disciplined and brought up to the will of God. We are set out to keep everyone safe and healthy, as this as our priority. Join us as we follow Christ.
;
, Look for possible people in your congregation to recruit. The ideal minimum number for people in the committee is six. This would consist of: One person for the nursery, one person for Sunday School, one leader, one special events coordinator, one special needs coordinator, and one person to be in charge of training all volunteers in your children's ministry. The committee is then formed by the minimum five people in charge of children's ministries.


Try to schedule a meeting with each possible committee member, telling them exactly all of the job meetings, expectations, payments, and any other information.

, Do this with the committee's help. A vision is a typed paper with all of your goals. Based on these goals, you can choose activities and events to help you move further in this direction.


Here is a sample: Imagine, a nursery full of infants, toddlers and fully certified volunteers. Children are being rocked. The children are being taught and know that Jesus loves them and cares about them. Calming music fills the air, along with laughter and a steady, perfect noise altogether. An updated bulletin board is in full view, all children have name tags and a parent is given a pager along with filling out a slip of paper about their child. On Sunday, Sunday School classrooms are filled to the brim with children. More than enough adults wanting to volunteer. Exciting games are played, Bible stories are told in creative ways, crafts are made. Children return again and again. On Wednesday the excitement continues with children's classes filled to the brim and attendance flying out the roof. the nursery is open, more than enough volunteers are helping, and parents have their own class, too. There are three VBS programs, one morning in the summer, one evening in the summer, and one Christmas. Children gather with joy and adults are right with them! Fall festivals are held as well as an Easter family celebration that gets everyone in a good mood. And it's all topped off with a summer ice cream social an preschool programs that bring kids from near and far.


, For example, your children's ministry could have a yearly theme such as ""The Fruit of the Spirit"" or ""Jesus' Little Lambs."" Create logos online with clipart and drawings. Include this logo on everything in your children's ministry.

, Here are some ideas:


Create a barnyard room for your preschoolers! Paint farm animals on the walls and attach textures such as cotton on the sheep, fake grass on the bottom of the wall, a hairy horse, feathers on a rooster, etc. Also turn a corner of your classroom into the ""Barnyard Corner."" Provide farm books, farm animal stuffed animals and plastic figures, a sensory table with mud and plastic pigs, a little kiddie pool with paper fish and real nets to ""catch"" the fish. Another option is to have a tub of soapy water and old clothes to pretend to wash and barnyard dress-up clothes with a full length mirror. You may need to block this area off during class time.
Create an ocean room. Paint the walls blue and let children paint ocean animals on to the walls. Have a fish tank in your classroom with eels, fish, starfish, and plants. If this is a classroom for younger children, provide a sand table with buckets and shovels, or a water table with plastic ocean creatures.
A home room may be ideal. Paint a roaring fire on the wall and place pillows in front of it to curl up for a Bible story.
Another room idea is a tree house room. Paint trees and forest scenes on the walls. Place stuffed forest animals such as squirrels around the room. Having a loft in the room that is named ""The Tree house"" and naming your room ""The Friendship Tree Room"" will add even more excitement and interest.

Curling ribbon works greats to hang from ceilings. Try hanging pastel colors in the church nursery to create a feeling of comfort. Add primary colors to the ceiling of your Sunday School classrooms or special events room to create energy. Season or holiday colors are also fun. For example, green and red for Christmas, blue for winter, red for Valentines Day, and so on.
Mobiles are also nice. You can make a homemade mobile by forming pipe cleaners into a circle and hanging doves, shapes, or other pictures and items form it with string or yarn. Otherwise, you can just purchase a mobile with animals and other items.

, Here are some ideas for ways to get the word spread around:


Create a bulletin board in your church's main hallway. Use children's handprints or a border that has to do with your theme or logo. Staple your theme and logo to the top of the bulletin board and write papers about children's ministry, events, and items that need donated. You can also try putting a paper rocket ship with the number of days left on a chalkboard.
Hand out brochures. In your brochures, write about what programs your ministry will offer, your children's ministries mission and vision, and pictures. Hand these out all over town and at your church.
Make a website. If your church already has a website, consider putting the link to your Children's ministry's website. On your website, write a full description of each part of your children's ministry, including: the church nursery, your mission, your vision, Sunday School, VBS, training events and certifications volunteers must do, special events, and any other parts of your children's ministry. Create a page for each different part of your ministry.

Be colorful! Make sure all pictures and videos are in color, and add colors to your words such as red words for one page, rainbow with all colors on another page, and so on. Color is pretty and appealing to the eye.
Include pictures! Take pictures of each room such as the Sunday School rooms and nursery rooms. You don't need to take pictures of the storage room or the training room, just the main places. Make sure that the rooms look colorful, neat, and appealing in each picture. It's best to keep the rooms like this always, not just for pictures time. As time goes on, take pictures of children doing activities and playing games. Just be sure to ask parents if their children's pictures may go on the children's ministry's website.
Upload videos. Record training outlines, for volunteers to review and parents to see what volunteers are being taught. Putting slideshows of programs such as a special event or VBS, is a great thing to place on your website.
Always include your logo and theme. The home page should include this, and having each page include this is even better.
Try adding clipart. Attach pictures of symbols of ""nursery"" or ""Sunday School.""

, You can find them in the bible, but here they are as well:


“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before Me.
“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My Commandments.
“You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.
“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
“You shall not murder.
“You shall not commit adultery.
“You shall not steal.
“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
“You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.”

Otherwise, you may end up saying or doing something that you do not mean to, or even engaging in physical fighting with your step-sibling. You can use relaxation techniques to help yourself calm down, such as:Doing deep breathing exercises.
Imagining a calm place, such as a sunny beach or a lush forest.
Doing some relaxing yoga poses.;
, If you are upset about something that one of your step-siblings has said or done, then it is important to address the issue in a constructive way. You can do this by using direct, assertive communication. Simple things like arranging a time to talk and using “I” statements can help you to communicate more assertively with your step-sibling.Ask your step-sibling when would be a good time to talk. Try saying something like, “Hey, I have something kind of important to discuss with you. Do you have some time to talk after dinner tonight?”
Use “I” statements when you share your concern. Using “I statements will help to take the focus off of you step-sibling and this may prevent him or her from becoming defensive. For example, you might say something like, “I felt a little hurt by what you said to me at school today. I heard you tell someone that I was ‘annoying’ and that hurt my feelings.”
Avoid accusing your step-sibling of trying to hurt you. Just explain how the event made you feel. Focus on your perspective, not your step-sibling’s perspective.

, After you have shared your feelings with your step-sibling, it will be your turn to listen. Make sure that there are no distractions by turning off the TV, closing your laptop, and putting away your cell phone.Use your body language to show you are listening, such as by facing your step-sibling, making eye contact, and leaning in towards him or her.
You can also show you are paying attention by nodding your head and asking questions if something is confusing. For example, you might say something like, “It seems to me that you are saying you were annoyed by something I said this morning, but that you do not find me annoying. Is that right?”

, After you have said what you are upset about and heard your step-sibling’s side, it is important to look towards the future. Your step-sibling cannot take back what he or she said. However, you can explain what you would like him or her to do in a similar situation in the future.For example, you might request that your step-sibling not talk about you to other classmates. Instead, you might ask your step sibling to tell you if he or she is feeling annoyed by something you are saying or doing so that you can make an effort to stop. Try saying something like, “The next time this happens, will you please talk to me about it first? I really want us to get along and I think that would help.”

, Tempers might run high sometimes, but it is important to avoid engaging in any sort of physical fighting or name-calling with your sibling. Otherwise, the situation might become worse over time. Also, when people are angry they tend to feed off of the other person’s energy. To defuse your step-sibling’s anger, do not engage with them in the way he or she is engaging with you.


For example, if your step-sibling starts to yell at you, then lower your voice and speak quietly. If your step-sibling comes towards you, take a few steps back to put distance between you. Doing these things will help you to get the upper hand and calm down your step-sibling in the process., Deep down, a lot of problems between step-siblings are based on competition, rivalry, and jealousy. It can be especially hard to get along if you think that your step-siblings get more attention or are treated differently than you. The best thing is to avoid this sort of comparison altogether.Keep in mind that your step-siblings might be used to doing things differently at their home or used to different treatment from their parents. You are not comparable to each other.
Don’t be dismayed if your natural and step parent decide to do things slightly different for you and your step-siblings. You might continue to go to your old schools, for example, play different sports, or get different kinds of birthday gifts.Don’t mistake different for unfair treatment. But if you feel bothered by something – like maybe you feel discipline or chores are imbalanced – express yourself honestly.

, Another possible source of rivalry is attention, especially attention from parents. Your biological parent will want to form a relationship with your new step-siblings just as your step parent will probably want to get closer to you. This might make you feel resentful or jealous. But remember: this is natural and you all have to get along.Remember that you don’t have the only claim to your natural parent’s time, love, and attention. You may already share these things with natural siblings – why not with others?
Be assured that your parent won’t stop loving you. In fact, in many blended families parents recognize that they’ll stay closer to their own children and respect that. Your old relationship won’t go away, though it will have to change in some ways to include the new family., One way that you can get past feelings of rivalry is by doing things together, as a family. You’ll feel closer after spending some time as a unit, seeing how your step family interacts, and sharing some experiences. This will help to build connections between you.For instance, go to your step-siblings’ soccer practices, swim meets, or school plays as a family. Encourage the whole family to all come to your activities, as well.
Try to have family dinners and use the chance to talk to your step-siblings about things that they care about, for instance, “So Eliza, I hear that you play the clarinet at school. What’s your favorite piece?”

, Building a family dynamic will help you and your step-siblings get along. You can also try to build personal connections by spending some time alone together. You don’t have to become best friends with your step sibling. But ideally, you’ll be able to get along politely and respectfully.Ask your step sibling to join you for a walk, bike ride, game of basketball, or some other activity. Use the opportunity to see what your shared interests are. Say something like, “So, Craig, what sort of stuff do you like to do in your spare time? Really? I like that, too.”
If you go to the same school, say “Hi” in the halls or ask to sit with your step sibling at lunch in the cafeteria once in an while.

, Conflicts with your new step-siblings can also come from feeling that you don’t have enough privacy and personal space. Maybe you have been asked to split or share a room that used to be yours. Personal space is an important issue and may be something to raise with your natural parent. Some experts even advise that step-siblings should have separate rooms, if possible. Your parent might not think that sharing a room is a big deal. Explain what you are feeling openly and honestly, like by saying, “Dad, I just feel like uncomfortable. I don’t know X very well yet and need my own space.”
Your parent and step parent might not have the money to get a bigger house. In that case, you might be able to find some kind of compromise. If your step-siblings only visit once in a while, for example, you can suggest getting a fold-out couch for their stays., Sharing is a good thing. But, we sometimes need to have limits on what we’re willing to share. Like your room, you probably have clothes, toys, and belongings that are yours and that you don’t necessarily want to share with a step sibling. This is natural. Having boundaries on these things will help minimize problems with your new sibling.You shouldn’t be expected to share everything you own with step-siblings or to make everything communal property.
If you’re going to share a room, talk to your natural parent (and maybe your step parent) about what can be communal and what you want to keep private. For instance, it would be hard to prevent your sibling from using a television or PC in a shared room. But you could ask that he or she not use your telephone or iPod.
Talk to your parent, again, if you feel that your step sibling is overstepping bounds. For instance, “Mom, can you talk to X about “borrowing” my clothes? I don’t like it” or “Dad, X has been reading my diary and I want him to know that that’s private.”

, You and your step-siblings also shouldn’t have to spend all of your time together. You both need space, whether that means spending time with your own friends or having some private moments with your natural parent and siblings. Getting along will mean, sometimes, being apart.


Your parents might ask you to include a step sibling in an outing with friends. This is OK, but speak up if you want some space every now and then: “Dad, I don’t mind when X joins us sometimes. But I also want time alone with my friends.”
It’s also important to have time alone with your natural family, too. See if you and your dad or mom can run errands together once or twice per week, for example. Some step families even take separate vacations to get quality time together.

, There’s a good reason why people call step-families “blended homes.” It takes effort and compromise to meld together two families. Since you’re a member of the household, you might be able to have some say when your parents decide how things will run. Ask to be included in these discussions.Add your perspective when it comes to planning and rulemaking, especially if you are a bit older. You might also ask your biological parent if you can express your opinion, like “Dad, can I add my opinion, too?”
Focus on compromising. While your perspective matters, it is also important to consider the perspectives of your step-siblings and try to reach a compromise. Try to imagine what your step-siblings’ needs are and how they might be feeling about the changes. For example, if your step-siblings moved in with you and your parent, then your step-siblings might be feeling uncomfortable about their new surroundings or even missing their old home.

, See whether you can hold a whole family meeting to set new family rules and chores so that everyone knows his or her responsibilities and no one gets extra consideration. Chime in at family meetings and don't be shy to share your thoughts or opinions.


During the meetings, you should communicate openly. If you want to keep your old room, say so and give your reasons why. You may not get your way in the end, but it’s better that your family blending take in everyone’s perspective.
You should also try to be respectful of your step-siblings and be a good listener during the family meetings. Remember that you’re trying to solve problems, not to win an argument. You will not get your way in everything – a new family takes compromise.

, Things in your family are changing and won’t be like they were in the past. While you can’t go back, you do have some say over how well your new family gets along.Don’t feel like you need to hit it off with your step-siblings immediately. But be open to forming relationships with them.
Remind yourself that the family is your new “normal.” This may take some time and even a bit of mourning. That’s OK and it can take months or more to start to feel natural.
Try to participate in new family routines. Eat dinner with your step-siblings, participate in family games and activities, and be open to relationships with your step family.

, Though you may try to accept your new normal and your new step-siblings, you may still struggle with this from time to time. You should reach out to other family members and friends for support. Talk to a favorite aunt or uncle, speak to a cousin, or have a one on one with a close friend.


Share your feelings and thoughts around having a new step sibling with your support systems so your emotions are not held in. This will allow you to release any anxiety or stress you may be feeling about the new changes in your household and get some support from others.

, While blending, the focus is often on getting the two families to work together as a team. But this shouldn’t mean that your ties to your biological parent and siblings get ignored. Make sure that you are able to communicate with and remain close to your natural family members.You should still be able to talk with your biological parent sometimes without having to share with your step parent or step-siblings. Be clear when you need to do so, for example, “Mom, can we have a one-on-one discussion for a sec? I have something I want to say to you.”
As said, ask to do things alone from time to time with your natural parent and siblings.

Consider major events with caution.",How to Break Growth Barriers in Your Church," If you want to break through the growth barriers at your church, you need to firmly believe that God wants those barriers torn down. Before you can believe it, though, you also need to listen for God's voice and make sure that this sort of growth is His will for your church.


There are two systems of belief regarding church size. The first states that God wants all churches to grow. The second states that God has a need and a place for both large and small churches. Regardless of which camp you fall in, if you want your church to grow, you need to have confidence in the belief that breaking through these growth barriers is something God wants for your individual church.;
, Once you believe that God wants to grow your church, you also need to have a firm conviction in your personal desire to see it grow.


The idea of growing your church can scare many church leaders into inactivity and complacency. Dissolving the barriers that prevent growth is hard work, and the steps aren't often clear-cut.
While the fear can be both strong and warranted, if you let it control you, you won't be able to get anything done. Once you make the decision to start growing your church, you need to stick with it. It shouldn't be your opinion that the church needs to grow—it should be your conviction.


, As long as there are a few seats left each Sunday, you might think there's already plenty of room. If your church reaches 70 percent of its seating capacity, however, visitors are less likely to show up and stick around.Determine how many seats you have in your main worship space and multiply that number by 0.7. Compare that percentage with your average attendance from last month. If your attendance is greater than 70 percent of your seating, it's time to expand.
Expand according to your resources. You may need to move to a larger building, or you might be able to build an addition onto your current one.

, When space gets tight and physically expanding is not an option, the next best thing to do is to introduce a new worship service time.Understand that this alone may not fix your space issues, even though it can help. People are more likely to stick with the service they're already accustomed to, so new worship times are often less crowded than the old times. In a church with 120 regular attendees, 100 may attend the old service while only 20 might switch to the new one.

, A larger church will require a larger staff. It might seem sensible to wait until the church expands before you start the hiring process, but it may actually be better to hire the people you hope to need beforehand.


Finances may restrict the number of new staff members you can hire. Start with those positions that seem most crucial to your growth as a church. As the finances start accumulating, quickly hire more staff, even if your long-term budget projections aren't quite high enough yet.

, Look to the large, thriving churches in your region, even if they belong to other denominations. Attend worship services there and speak with the pastor and staff.Once you find out what growing churches in your area are doing to break through the barriers, you can adapt those same strategies to your own church. You do not and should not copy these churches exactly, but you can try to weave some of their ideas into your own church structure.

, Growing a church is an expensive business. You need to have faith that God will provide financially, but you also need to be a good steward of all financial resources that do come your way.


If no one among the church staff can handle finances in an expert manner, someone new will need to be hired. A full-time finance officer is ideal, but you can also check into contract financial consultants if doing so will be easier on your current budget.

, During this growth period, everyone from the pastor down to the newest member may have some difficulty adjusting to the change.Pastors often struggle to adapt to the feeling of having less control and less personal interaction.
Members of the congregation may feel that their church is less of a ""home"" and may resist the changes going on.
As the church grows, its leaders will need to prepare themselves for the changes that will come. These leaders also need to be out among the members of the congregation, encouraging them through the changes, as well.

, This usually means that the pastor will have to grow along with the church. It also means that he will need to shift himself into a leadership mindset.


The pastor needs to be both a minister and a leader. Ministry requires you to respond to others' needs. Leadership requires you to take initiative without consulting others.
Study up on topics related to the logistics of growth. Learn how to equip your church for ministry and how to raise money. Research time management and learn to balance your resources.
Spend time reading on ministry-related topics like theology, church history, and Scriptures. Commit to a certain reading goal, like a book every one or two months.
Pastors can also benefit from attending conferences and meeting with mentors in the field of church leadership.

, In a small church, the pastor can run the business affairs of the church while still being there for every member of the congregation. As the church grows, however, it will need to have a pastoral care team to help minister when the pastor cannot.


Sometimes, you'll need to hire assistant pastors to formally meet the pastoral needs of your church.
A pastoral care team may also consist of thriving lay ministries. Lay people of the congregation won't be able to help preach and teach, but they can assist with worship, visiting the sick, and leading small groups., The governing board of your church needs to be geared toward managing a larger organization. A board packed with members who fixate on the detailed organization of a small church will struggle to adapt to the needs of a large church.When accepting people to the board, keep in mind that they should be comfortable with larger budgets, larger systems, and larger staff numbers.

, Growing churches are very active churches, and very active churches typically offer plenty of activities and groups for members and visitors to get involved with.


The groups don't need to be large, and they don't even need to meet on church grounds.
The important thing is to vary the nature of the groups so that you can provide a little bit of everything. Have groups for different ages, circumstances, and interests.
Organize based on the gifts of the people. Get to know your staff, volunteers, and congregation. Find out which skills and gifts the people of your church have to offer, then develop programs around those attributes.

, Build the sort of worship service you want to need, not the sort of service you need right now. It's easier to draw in a larger crowd when you already have a service meant for one.


Try to energize worship time or have more passionate preaching. Build the ambiance of excitement that you would expect to find in a larger church.
Ask for feedback on the service. Look for ways to view the service through the eyes of both guests and regular attendees, then tweak the service as needed.

, Programs focused inwardly on current members of the congregation are important, but if these programs vastly outnumber programs focused on the community, you won't be able to draw new people from the community in.


Encourage more outreach by teaching on relational evangelism and by telling stories about inviting people to church. All members of the staff and congregation should be challenged to invite friends.

, When someone suggests a new idea that can help grow the church, the leadership needs to automatically begin thinking of ways to make it happen.


Church leadership teams that immediately assume new ideas cannot happen lack vision, and a church without vision will struggle to grow.
You should, of course, evaluate each new idea honestly. Those that honestly won't help the church should be set aside, but those that are helpful yet difficult to accomplish should receive attention.

, Some churches may plan one or two major events during the year to create community interest. This can have a positive result, but the result is often minimal at best.


Attendance will usually spike for a few weeks after the event. As time continues to pass, however, new visitors may lose interest and stop coming, causing the numbers to drop back down.
Major church events only work at breaking growth barriers when your church is structured in a way that can keep the interest going after drawing in that initial crowd.

The first step to making sure they are all done on a regular basis is to identify them all. Sit down with all the members of your family who are old enough to do chores and work it out. Letting everyone have a say in their chores and getting them all to agree on their chores will help you get everyone to do them.


Make a list of every chore that has to be done and how often it should be done.
Divide the chores up amongst all members of the family.

Do not get caught up on old fashioned gender roles. If he does not mind washing dishes and she hates it, then he can do the dishes. By the same token there is no reason why a woman could not clean out the garage or mow the lawn. Try to make everyone happy, or least minimize their unhappiness. These are chores after all.
Make sure that everyone gets at least one chore they do not mind or even like. Try to make sure no one gets too many chores they hate.

;
, Now that you know who does what chore you can get a separate chore calendar and fill in who will do what chores, when. Make sure everyone who does chores knows where the calendar is.

, You can never get anyone else to do their chores if you are not doing your own. Make sure that your behavior is a model of how everyone else should be when it comes to housework.

, Gently remind people who forget what their chores are and when they are supposed to do them. Avoid criticism and nagging because they only create resentment.

, Sometimes your first arrangement will not work well, so try again. Finding just the right balance might be very difficult. Just keep your mind focused on the harmony you will have once everything is settled.

While the influence of your environment is not necessarily a bad thing, it can lead to lower states of self-awareness and sometimes a loss of true self-identity. Solitude is seen by many as a bad thing. However, having alone time is imperative for your mind-body-soul to rejuvenate. It allows for time to reflect on life, on yourself, and the how you may fit into the bigger scheme of things. Here are a few other reasons why you should accept and embrace your alone time:


It enhances our inner awareness and creativity. When you allow yourself quiet alone time, you reactivate certain areas of the brain that enhance creativity. You can delve deeper into your thoughts, contemplate and develop new ideas.
Having quiet time gives your brain a reboot. With so much information coming in, you sometimes do not give yourself enough down time to fully process the information you have received. To function at your optimum level, your brain needs to have time to rest. This is the same for your body as well.
Alone time allows you the opportunity to have inner self-reflection. A time to get to know who you are, and to be comfortable with that. What you like or dislike without being influenced by the external activity of life and people. Alone time may even give you the opportunity to reflect on varying issues or concerns in your life to help you solve problems.
Being consistent with having alone time frequently will enable you to feel more confident and less dependent on others. You may increase your comfortableness in your own skin, making it easier for you to meet new people and develop long-lasting and healthy relationships.;
, Decide on suitable ways to keep your sacred time alone, such as locking the doors, barring access, going somewhere that others can't find you, or leaving your usual spot and going where people don't know you.Discuss your preference to be alone in a given spaces as well. For example, you might tell your family members something like, “On Wednesday and Thursdays from 6:30-7:15 I will be putting up this 'do not disturb' sign on my bedroom door. That means that any questions or emergency things will have to wait until 7:15.”


You can also leave your home to find someplace to be alone, such as a garden, park, local library, small café, or art gallery.

, If you have trouble getting alone time for yourself, be direct about your needs. Let people know that having alone time is something you need to do for your health, or that you simply have no energy for social outings at the moment.Be sure to be direct and honest about your need for alone time. For example, you might say something like, “For my own well-being, I need to have at least a few hours to myself every night. Please don’t disturb me when I am in my room.”
If someone invites you to do something with them, then you might say, “Thanks for the invitation, but I am not up to it right now.”

, Give yourself permission to take a little bit of time for yourself and not feel overwhelmed by guilt. Many people feel constantly pulled in so many directions that they need some time to themselves to regroup, but it is common to feel guilty because you think you’re abandoning your family or being selfish.The people in your life will also benefit from your alone time. You will be happier and more enjoyable to be around. So don’t feel too guilty about it.
To overcome the guilt, try remembering how much more energized you feel after you’ve had some time to yourself. This is something you need that makes your life better.
Or you can try thinking about all the things that you DO accomplish each day. Make a list if it helps you visualize all you do. This should help you feel less guilty about taking a few moments for yourself.

, Keep people out from a house quiet spot by making it evident that you need to be alone, and left undisturbed. Try making your bedroom a sanctuary instead of a family room. That way, your family will know that they should be considerate of your time when you are in that room.You could put a sign on the door saying ""Do Not Disturb"" or ""Gran's Quiet Time"" or ""Studying, Don't Interrupt.""

, It will help others if you explain why ""alone time"" is important to you, so that people don't feel disrespected and can, in turn, respect your needs. Ask politely for your siblings, parents, spouse, and children to stay out for a set amount of time. They may be curious and want to spend time with you, not understanding how important it is to have time to yourself. But discussing the importance of alone time with them will help them realize why it matters to you.Try saying something like, “You know I love you, but sometimes I just need a little time to myself so that I can clear my head.”
Or, “When I have a little bit of alone time, it helps me get things done faster so we can enjoy our time together more.”
It's a good idea to remind others that ""alone time"" is good for them too, and that you'll respect their alone time when asked.

, People will be much more responsive to your request for alone time if you bring it up to them in a positive manner. Don’t bring up all the reasons you want to be alone – too many responsibilities, feeling overwhelmed or suffocated, or being depressed about life at the moment. Instead, talk about how having alone time will make you feel more energized and allow you to be more present when you are with the people that you love.Instead of saying, “I feel suffocated in my life with you,” try saying something like, “A little alone time will help me decompress so that I can be more productive and enjoy our time together more.”

, Start going for a walk every morning or use that exercise bike in the basement. Create a routine that is just for you – then everyone in your life will come to expect this alone time ritual and it will become less and less difficult to get this time for yourself each day.When you make alone time part of your daily ritual – especially if it’s something exercise or health-related – people in your life will be less likely to put up a fuss about it.
Identify and choose what activity you want to do by yourself for your alone time. It could be journaling/writing, meditating, exercising, drawing/painting, reading a book, taking a quiet walk in nature, or going to a movie. Ensure that whatever activity you choose, it will be something you like and find enjoyable. It could be an activity you have done in the past that sparked a light in your own physical, mental, or emotional being.

, Find out when you are least likely to be disturbed and use that time to schedule the chores, intellectual work, or anything else that requires time alone. This might be early in the morning, in the lull before the kids get home, later at night, or when the kids are napping. It might vary depending on weekdays or the weekend. Pinpoint these times and make the most of them as ""alone time"" to get these specific things done without being disturbed.You can also be more productive when you’re alone, so it’s good for everyone if you get a little alone time.
If you take your alone time when fewer people are demanding your attention, you’ll probably feel less guilty about taking the time for yourself.

, If you are having trouble finding any alone time for yourself, it may mean that you are taking on too much in your daily life. Talk to your family and friends (particularly those who live with you) about how you are feeling overwhelmed and ask them to take on some of the burden, even if only for a little while.Delegating these tasks should free up some time for you and it can be beneficial for your children or other household members to relate a little more to just how much you do every day.

, So often, we get bogged down by the busyness of our lives. So take the time to enjoy your alone time because it is a precious commodity. It is your time to relax and rejuvenate your mind so that you can face another busy day.Try doing some self-care activities during your alone time – like getting a massage, practicing your yoga, or getting a haircut. These things can help you feel more relaxed and replenished in your daily life.
Most importantly, turn off your phone while you are engaging in your alone time activity. Avoid the distractions of social media, phone calls, and text messages.

Don’t enable bad behavior.,
Accept the limits of what you can do.",How to Get a Stubborn Family Member to Look After Themselves," It’s often difficult to keep track of your thoughts during difficult conversations, so it’s helpful to plan your main points in advance. In the heat of the moment, you don’t want to end up blurting out something you don’t mean.


You might try writing an imaginary letter to your relative expressing all your concerns. Then, read that letter, imagining that you’re in your relative’s position. This will help you to frame your concerns in a constructive way.Try to imagine your relative’s objections will be. Develop respectful, thoughtful responses to those objections.
Include reasons why your family member’s behavior has a negative impact on others, including on you.
Share your concerns with a trusted third party. Don’t rehearse the conversation, but be clear about what you want to express and what you hope to achieve.;
, Planning a conversation in advance will help you address your concerns with out making your relationship worse.


Plan the conversation in advance. Don’t wait until a crisis to bring up what’s bothering you.
Let your relative know you’d like to speak with him seriously. Avoid springing a heavy conversation on your relative. Instead, give him time to prepare.
Choose a comfortable setting. You might demonstrate your good intentions by taking your relative out to lunch. Avoid settings that evoke the problem: for instance, don’t talk about problem drinking in a bar.

, What looks like stubbornness to you might be covering up many different emotions or issues. You will need to phrase this question carefully. You want to convey that you are genuinely interested in hearing the answer. In addition, you want to avoid asking the question in a way that sounds like nagging or pressuring.


For example, you might say: “I know that we don’t always agree on this issue, but I’d love to know more about your perspective.” Or, ask: “What scares you most about reaching out to a therapist?”
Don’t imply judgment with your question. For example, don’t ask: “Why do you refuse to eat healthy food?” Instead, ask: “I’d like to understand your decisions around food better. Can you tell me more?”
Some people are angry about needing help or guilty about the burden their situation imposes on others.
Others might be frightened about their condition and seeking reassurance through making their relatives and loved ones take on too much responsibility for their care. They might be lonely and see failing to take care of themselves as a way to get attention from you.

, Let your relative talk, and don’t rush to interrupt or provide solutions. Although your relative’s words might bring up many feelings for you, don’t express them all at once. Reacting with anger and resentment will only make the situation worse. Instead, practice non-judgmental listening.


Put yourself in your relative’s shoes. Listen to what he is saying about his own experience, and try to be empathetic.
Accept that your relative’s feelings, judgments, and perspectives might be different from your own. That’s ok.
Be genuine. You don’t have to pretend to think that your relative’s decisions are great. Instead, be calm and honest. For example, you might say: “I understand that taking medication for your depression is frightening for you. I don’t agree with your decision, but I can accept that you feel that way.”

, Be aware of mental health issues, memory loss, or other factors that might make it hard for your relative to take care of themselves or even to understand and remember why she should take care of herself.


If you observe changes in your relative’s behavior that make you suspect dementia or other cognitive issues, you will need to get your relative evaluated by a professional.Recognize that some behaviors have physical causes. Low blood sugar, for example, might cause a diabetic relative to become cranky or confused., Emphasize the negative impacts his choices are having on you, on his career, or on his children.Where possible, use “I” statements. Instead of saying, “You’re making everyone miserable!” offer specific examples. You might say: “When you come home drunk, I see that your children are scared and worried.” Or, “I feel overwhelmed when I have to come over every night to make sure you’re ok.”

, Even if you haven’t been able to achieve all your goals in the conversation, close it by telling your relative something that you value about her. Let her know that the relationship is meaningful to you. Thank her for taking the time to talk honestly with you. The point is not “winning” the conversation, but continuing to built a trusting relationship., Another relative, friend, or trusted member of the community might be able to reach your relative in a way you can’t. In addition, hearing the same message from more than one person might help your relative to understand the seriousness of the situation.


For example, you could reach out to a pastor or rabbi whose opinion your relative respects. They might be able to explain why it’s damaging to family relationships not to take responsibility for one’s own health and well-being.
If you have a relative battling addiction, you might choose to stage an intervention. This should be carefully planned in consultation with a doctor or licensed drug counselor., Positive reinforcement is more effective than criticism at encouraging healthy behaviors.Make a practice of noticing when your relative does something good for himself, and point it out to him.


For example, you might say: “I’ve noticed that you’ve gone for a lot of walks lately with your friends. That’s great! It makes me so happy to see you enjoying yourself and getting exercise.”
Or, you could send a simple, supportive message: “Nice job going to therapy today. I know it’s not easy!”

, You can't make someone else take care of herself, but if you show her that you are willing to get rest, practice healthy nutrition, talk about your feelings, and move and breathe in healthy ways, then you'll feel better no matter what she chooses to do. And, you might just inspire her to try it.

, If your relative is suffering from a mental health issue, patterns of communication that work in general might not work as well with them. Support groups or your own therapist or counselor might be able to offer advice on effective communication strategies. In addition, reading up on your relative’s condition on your own might help you to understand the situation better.

, A friendly invitation shows that you value your relative and want to spend time with him. What’s more, doing an activity together can strengthen your relationship and offer you things to talk about besides your conflict over his behavior.


For example, go for a walk or a jog together.Sign up for the same water aerobics or yoga class.
Turning exercise into a social occasion will help lessen your relative’s loneliness as well as supporting her in making good choices.

, While you need to set boundaries on what you do for your relative, it doesn’t mean that you can’t do anything for your relative. Develop a set of things that you can do that feel sustainable to you and that bring you satisfaction as well as helping your relative.


For example, buy and cook healthy food for your relative if you have her over for dinner. It’s not your responsibility to feed your diabetic relative every day. But if you host a party and invite her, preparing a diabetic-friendly treat could be a nice gesture., Caring for a relative is stressful.No matter what your motivations or situation, recognize that taking on any aspect of a relative’s care will have an effect on your own well-being. You need to take care of yourself as well.

, There are some common thought patterns that stop caregivers from taking adequate care of themselves. These patterns suggest that you need to seek support for yourself so that you do not become overwhelmed with caregiving.


For instance, you might believe that no one else can care correctly for your relative. In reality, you may be feeding into a cycle of dependency; your relative may be better at seeking help from others or at taking responsibility for herself than you realize.
You might believe that it’s selfish to prioritize your own needs. In fact, it’s necessary to meet your own needs first.
Caregiving might seem like the only way to earn your family’s respect.

, Talking to other people who have been through what you’re facing can be very helpful.


Al-Anon is an organization that provides support for relatives of people with drinking and addiction problem.The Brain Injury Association provides a list of local organizations with resources for family members of people with traumatic brain injuries., This is a sign of a co-dependent relationship.While it may be hard, it is not your role to prevent your relative from ever feeling the negative consequences of his own behavior. You should not turn your own life upside-down in order to accommodate his unhealthy or irresponsible choices.Co-dependent and enabling relationships are not sustainable and will ultimately take a significant toll on you.

, Ultimately, your relative gets to make her own decisions about her own life. Accepting this can be difficult but necessary.


If your relative is genuinely unable to make decisions, consult your doctor about your legal options. You may be able to obtain guardianship,a health care proxy,or other legal powers that will allow you to make decisions on behalf of your relative.

Head to the library.,
Check out websites devoted to names.,
Find out what naming means in your culture.",How to Find Out What Your Name Means1," Ask your librarian to direct you to books about names. Don’t be satisfied with the meaning listed in just one book. Books can list slightly different meanings that can alter the nuances of the name.


For example, the name Hilary is typically translated as “cheerful one,” but it can also be rendered as “bringer of joy.” ;
, If you prefer to learn about your name in the comfort of your own home, the internet has endless information about name meanings.


The database website Behind the Name lists thousands of names, from every culture and period, along with a description of the name etymology and mention of historical figures who bore each name.Check out Baby Center! They not only have information on name meanings, they also have polls on names and data on the most and least popular names.

Arrange a time to talk to your extended family.,
Explain your side calmly.,
Describe the children to them.,
Listen to their side.,
Talk with someone your family trusts.",How to Get a Strict Extended Family to Welcome Your Out of Wedlock Kids1," Instead of trying to talk to your family all at once, consider talking to them either individually or in small groups. This may be easier than talking to the family all at once. You may be able to convince some family members to accept your children while others may take longer to come around.


You should talk to the family without your children. This will help you and the family member focus on the issue without any distractions. If you get upset, your child will not be there to witness it.;
, Though it may not be what you want to do, you should sit down and talk to your extended family members. Explain to your family members that you want to talk about your children because you would like to include them in your children’s life.Start with the family members you believe will be most accepting. It may help you to get a few people on your side before you talk with family members who will be less willing to accept your children.
When you talk to your extended family about starting a relationship with you and your children, you should do it alone. The children should not be present.
Remain neutral instead of hostile. Remember, this discussion is aimed at coming to a place where they will accept your children.
Say to them, “I would like to talk to you about my children. Could we arrange a meeting?”
If they do not know you have children, you may say, ""I would like to share something with you. It may be a difficult conversation.""

, When you talk to your extended family, you should explain your situation and your feelings. There are many different situations where you may have children out of wedlock. Your family may always have known about your children, you may just have learned you have children, or you may have finally decided to tell your family about the children you've kept from them. No matter the situation, tell your family that you care about them because they are your family, and you would like for them to get to know your children and accept them.If you are telling them about the children for the first time, you can say, ""I know you may not approve, but I have children that I have had out of wedlock. I want you to be part of their lives.""
When you have just learned about a child, you may say, ""I have just discovered that I have a child. I know I am not married, but I am going to be part of my child's life, and I would like you to be in their life, too.""
You may want to explain why you have had your children out of wedlock. For example, you may not be interested in getting married, you may not be able to legally get married, or you may have accidentally conceived. You may explain that you did not know you had a child until recently. If you feel comfortable sharing this with your family, then you could try saying something like, ""I know I am still in a little bit of a shock finding out that I have a child, so I can imagine that it is hard for you too.""
Tell them that it hurts you that they do not accept your children. As family, you may want to be around them and have a relationship with them, but this is not possible if they don’t accept your children. Try saying something like, "" I know your values make this really hard, but I am asking that you get to know your grandchild--who didn't do anything wrong.""

, During the conversation, tell them about your children. Show them pictures or videos. Sometimes, disapproving family members only think about the idea of the out of wedlock kids. When they start seeing the children as people, they may start to give in.


You may say, “My children are loving and wonderful kids. You would be lucky to be in their lives. It’s not fair your disapproval of them is keeping you from knowing them.”
If you have just learned about your child, you can say, ""I am very excited about my child. They are sweet, loving, and wonderful. They are excited about me being in their life, along with my family.""

, Part of having a difficult conversation is listening to the other side. Ask them to explain why they feel the way they do. After they have explained their position, tell them you understand, but you would like to move forward and have a relationship with them.For example, you may say, “I understand you disapprove of the way my kids were conceived. I respect your opinion. However, that happened in the past. I am a person, and my children are people. We would like to be treated with respect and be in your lives.”

, If you need help talking to your family, you may want to seek help from an outside mediator. This person could give advice to both sides in an objective way. They can help you find ways to approach your family members while helping your hesitant family members come around.


You will need to ask your family if they will agree to go see an outside source to talk through the problem. You might say, ""I believe objective advice can help our situation. Would you be willing to see someone that can help us?""
A pastor or other religious leader may be helpful if the root of your family's reluctance is on religious grounds. You may want to talk to the religious leader first to explain your situation and figure out how they can help you. You can tell your family, ""I know that you disapprove of my children because they were born out of wedlock. I would like to go talk to our pastor for advice on how to deal with this situation.""
Family counseling may also help, if your family members are willing to go see a counselor.

Go to the source.,
Speak with extended family members.,
Ask family and friends what associations they have with your name.",How to Find Out What Your Name Means2," Your parents know better than anyone how you got your name. Ask them how they chose it.


Talk with your parents about how you have continued to shape their impression of your name.
If you have siblings, ask your parents how they chose their names. They may have thought about how the names would sound together, or they may have chosen each individually.
Ask if your parents named you before birth or if they waited until they saw you to decide. Some parents feel that they have to see their baby in order to know what his or her name is.If they didn’t name you until you were born, ask them how they knew your name was the right fit.

, If you parents are no longer living or don’t have many thoughts on why they chose your name, you can ask your grandparents, aunts, or uncles if they remember when your parents were choosing your name.


If you were named after someone in the family, you can either ask them directly or ask someone who knew them about their feelings about their name. How did they feel to know someone would be named for them?

, Even if they had no part in choosing your name, other family members and friends might have funny stories about people with your name, or they may have had a reaction when first learning your name

Learn about historical figures that bore your name.,
Walk around a graveyard.,
Look at the US Social Security website.",How to Find Out What Your Name Means3," Especially if you were named for a figure in history, look into the biographies of people who carried your name before you.


Again, you can go to the library or do a quick google search of your name.
Ask family and friends if they know of anyone in history who shared your name. They may know of a lesser-known, but interesting person.

, It may seem morbid, but walking around a graveyard can actually be very peaceful. Next time you’re in the mood for a stroll, go to a cemetery nearby and look at the headstones.


If you find your name listed on a headstone, look to see the years the person lived and if there is any inscription. These are clues as to the popularity of the name and the qualities of other people who have born it.

Pick an appropriate time to introduce your children.,
Introduce your children to separate family members.,
Let the extended family spend time with your children.",How to Get a Strict Extended Family to Welcome Your Out of Wedlock Kids2," When you introduce your children to the extended family, choose a good time. You want to make sure there are no extenuating circumstances that would cause your family to get irritated or view your children in a negative light.For example, don’t choose a day when your children are really rambunctious, in a bad mood, or acting out. This will give a bad impression.
Let your extended family choose the time so they will not be rushed or meeting with you at an inconvenient time.

, When you take your children to meet your extended family, try to make it during a time when all the extended family is not together. Go to one person’s house and interact with just them. This helps reduce some of the pressure on you and your children.


By breaking up the visits, you help your family not gang up on you or convince each other to remain disapproving.
For example, a family reunion may not be the best place to introduce your children because your entire family is there. They may ignore you, feed off each other’s negativity, or talk about you behind your back. When they’re alone, you have a better chance of reaching them on a personal level.

, Until your family gets to know your children, they may not approve. This means you should let your children spend time with your extended family.


The more time your extended family spends with your children, the more they will get to know them. By getting to know your children, they may start to warm up to them and accept them into the family.
If you have more than one child and they are significantly different in age, then you could try introducing one child at a time and give your family a chance to spend time with each child individually.

Set up regular interactions.,
Send the family correspondence.,
Be patient.,
Know when it’s time to let go.",How to Get a Strict Extended Family to Welcome Your Out of Wedlock Kids3," As you work to get your extended family to accept your children, try to set up regular visits. Letting your family get used to your children and your situation may help. It may also help for your family to become more comfortable with you and your children.


Go visit them and invite them to your house for dinner. Go see them around the holidays, go to dinner, or invite them to take the kids to the park.
Invite them to the children’s performances, games, or activities. This helps you encourage them to become involved in the child’s life.
If your family is intolerant of your children or mean to them, protect your children by not taking them around your family members. You don't want to introduce your children to people who are going to treat them disrespectfully and hurt them.

, Help your family get used to the idea of your children by keeping them in the forefront of their minds. Interacting with your family may help remind them that your children are people and important.


Send new school pictures to them in the mail or tag them in pictures you post on social media.
Send Christmas cards and have your children make small cards to go in the envelope.
If your family is hurtful or cruel about your children, you may not want to send them anything or encourage your children to make things for them.

, When you are trying to get your extended family to accept your out of wedlock children, you should be patient. Give the relationship time to build and the extended family time to get used to your family situation.Changing their mind and gaining their acceptance won’t happen overnight.

, Some family members will eventually come around to your children. Others may never accept them. Your first priority is to protect your children. If the family members are not coming around after repeated efforts, stop trying to get them to accept them. Move on to protect you and your family.


This is especially important if your family members are harmful or hurtful towards your family. For example, they may yell slurs or call your children names, and that is unacceptable.
If these things happen, keep in mind that you were uncertain about the process when you started. Be proud of the efforts you have made and turn to supportive friends for comfort.

Watch out for signs of relapse.",How to Find Out How Your Spouse Is Doing in Rehab," Each rehab facility has its own rules regarding when and how often patients may communicate with family and friends, and what methods of communication can be used.Typically there is a blackout period during the first few days your spouse enters treatment. You won't be able to communicate with them at all during that time.
After that period is over, most facilities have specific, limited times during which patients can make phone calls. Find out when those times are and do what you can to be available.
Maintain a calm, understanding, and forgiving tone when you speak with your spouse. Focus on their treatment – any problems between the two of you should wait until after they get out of rehab.
If you don't trust your spouse to give you an accurate picture of how they're doing, take notes on what they say and compare it to information you're given by staff at the facility.;
, Your spouse may be in a rehab facility far away from where you live, making regular visits difficult. However, if the facility is near enough you should plan on visiting at least once a week, or as often as is allowed.Regardless of what is happening in your relationship, being present during your spouse's rehabilitation and recovery is important.
Set a regular schedule for visits and stick to it. Showing up unannounced may lead your spouse to believe you don't trust them and are ""checking up on them"" or getting information behind their back.
As your spouse engages in therapy during treatment, there may be issues they want to discuss with you on visits. Listen to what they have to say, but try to avoid having intense discussions or arguments.

, Most rehab facilities encourage close family members and spouses to become involved in treatment and recovery. Not only will this help you come to terms with the situation, but you can strengthen your spouse's chances at a full recovery.Speak to staff at your spouse's treatment facility about the possibility of joint counseling sessions and other treatment in which you can participate.
Joint sessions can be difficult if your spouse is in a treatment facility far from where you live. However, the facility may be able to arrange for you to appear over the phone or online.
Participating in a group session from a distance may not be ideal – it's better if you're in the same room – but it may be the only way you can participate on a regular basis.
While you can get reports from doctors and staff at the facility (provided your spouse signed a consent form), participating in joint sessions is one of the best and most reliable ways to find out how your spouse is really doing in rehab.

, If you want to get reports about how your spouse is doing in rehab directly from the treatment facility staff, this can only be done with a consent form. Otherwise, facility staff would be violating your spouse's privacy, even though you are married.The rehab facility may have a consent form they regularly use. You also may be able to get a consent form from another healthcare provider – just make sure the facility will accept it.
The consent form must include your spouse's full name, your full name, the name of the treatment facility, and the reason the treatment facility is disclosing your spouse's information to you.
The consent form also should state the dates during which information can be disclosed, and may provide limits as to the types of information the facility can disclose to you. The dates typically are the dates your spouse will be at the facility.

, For the consent form to be valid, it must be signed by your spouse, typically in the presence of a notary public. If your spouse refuses to sign, you may want to speak to someone your spouse trusts and see if they can convince your spouse to sign.You may be able to convince a reluctant spouse by reminding them that they can revoke consent at any time, even orally.
In this way, medical consent forms are different from any other written agreement, which can only be revoked with another written agreement.
However, keep in mind that if your spouse decides to revoke the consent during treatment, that will be the end of any information you get from their treatment providers.

, Depending on the circumstances under which your spouse entered rehab, there may be ongoing legal or financial issues. Handling these matters yourself enables your spouse to focus on their treatment and recovery.Keep in mind that most rehabilitation facilities don't allow patients to use their own mobile phones, laptops, or tablets while in treatment. This can make it difficult, if not impossible, for your spouse to handle regular communications or pay bills.
While your spouse is in rehab, it's up to you to untangle any financial issues and get you both on the right track. Hiring an accountant or other financial professional can be helpful here.
You also need to make sure you have passwords and other information that will enable you to access accounts.
If your spouse has any ongoing legal matters, be prepared to work closely with your spouse's attorney as a sort of point person. Your spouse's attorney likely will have any hearings your spouse is expected to attend continued until your spouse gets out of rehab.

, If your spouse has accounts or other interests that you need to access, you may need to prepare documents to have yourself named as power of attorney. This document gives you the ability to control accounts where you are not listed as a joint account holder.You can find forms online that you can use to create a power of attorney. There aren't detailed legal requirements or particular language you have to include.
Ideally, this document should be completed and signed by your spouse before they enter treatment. Keep in mind that your spouse must sign the document in front of a notary public.
The power of attorney gives you the ability to sign documents and handle accounts in your spouse's name while they are in treatment.

, Many rehab facilities offer programs and resources for spouses and family members of the person receiving treatment. When your spouse enters rehab, you typically will receive information about anything available for you.Your ability to participate may be limited if your spouse is in a facility located far away. However, you still should make the effort to get as much help as you can.
Family support offered by rehab facilities is specifically designed to help you deal with the situation and complex emotions that develop as a result of having a spouse in rehab.
Participating in programs offered by the facility for family members also sends the message to your spouse that you care about helping and supporting them through their recovery.

, Whether offered by your spouse's rehab facility or another organization, a support group can help you connect with others who have loved ones in rehab. These groups enable you to help each other handle the difficulties that come with having a loved one who is battling addiction to drugs or alcohol.The person who is addicted is not the only one who suffers. Being able to talk to people who are in similar situations to yours helps you cope and understand that you're not alone.
People in a support group also have a unique ability to support you because they are dealing with the same issues you are.
The rehab facility where your spouse is getting treatment may be able to connect you to support groups in your area. You also can check with nonprofit organizations devoted to helping people addicted to drugs or alcohol and their families.

, Before your spouse entered rehab, their drug or alcohol addiction likely took up a significant part of your time, effort, and money. While they're seeking treatment, take the time to reconnect with your own interests.Even though finances may be tight, with some creativity you can find ways to pursue your own interests that won't break the bank.
For example, if you enjoy art, you might want to find a community art group at your local community center. Similar resources also are often available at your public library.
Because living with an addict can be isolating, this also might be a good time to reconnect with friends or family members from whom you've become estranged.
Living your own life helps you rebuild your own self-esteem and find positive outlets for your energy and frustrations. Ultimately, this will help your spouse as well.
You're likely already spending a lot of money to get your spouse the help he or she needs. This is not the time to scrimp on help for yourself.

, Particularly if there were problems in your relationship that precipitated your spouse's rehab, knowing how to talk to your spouse can be difficult. Writing a letter helps you compose your thoughts without worrying about reactions or interruptions.A letter gives you the opportunity to talk about issues that are important to you and have more assurance that you are being heard.
If you write your spouse a letter, he or she can read it several times, and discuss it with therapists. Being in rehab gives your spouse time to read and focus on your statements.
At the same time, don't focus on the past or bring up old arguments. Rehab provides your spouse with an opportunity for a fresh start.
Avoid blame, and express your understanding for and forgiveness of your spouse. Stress that now is the time to focus on recovery, and that you are willing to work on issues between the two of you.

, It's hard to help your spouse if you have no idea what they're going through. Learning about and better understanding addiction helps you find ways to support and encourage your spouse after they finish inpatient treatment and come home.The rehab facility where your spouse is getting treatment probably will have resources for you. You also can search online for additional articles and resources.
When reading online, check the ""about"" page of any website before you start reading. You want to make sure the source is reputable and the information on the site is written or at least verified by experts in addiction recovery.
It also can help to read accounts written by others who helped loved ones recover from addiction. You might ask staff at your spouse's rehab facility or people in your support group if there are books they'd recommend.

, After rehab, the dynamic of your relationship may change significantly. A professional can help guide your communication toward a healthy and productive place so that you continue to support each other.In many ways, you will have to become reacquainted with your spouse. Drug or alcohol addiction takes over a person's life, and without it you may find they're a different person.
However, just because your spouse has completed a rehab program doesn't mean that all the problems in your relationship have disappeared.
Having a professional facilitate healthy discussion between the two of you can move the relationship to a positive place.
Without help, questions and problems may fester, damaging the fragile connection you have with your spouse after rehab.

, Not only is recovering from addiction difficult, but transitioning from inpatient rehabilitation back into normal life can be challenging. Talk to your spouse to find out the specific help they need.Don't assume that the tough part is over once your spouse comes back home. In many ways, the real work of recovery only begins after your spouse leaves rehab.
Providing concrete help means you must talk to your spouse and really listen to what they have to say, sometimes reading between the lines.
For example, your spouse may need to find a new job. Helping them manage their job search and driving them to interviews can be a way of providing concrete support.
Professionals who have worked with your spouse during rehab also may have suggestions for things you can do to help them in recovery.

, Supporting and trusting your spouse upon their return from rehab is crucial to their continued recovery. At the same time, though, you need to be on guard for old habits or behaviors that could signal a possible relapse.It can be difficult to walk the line between watching your spouse carefully and making them feel as though you don't trust them. Transparency between you is important. After rehab, neither of you should have any secrets.
Focus on being a team and working on recovery together. Once your spouse returns home, their recovery is a joint challenge you both must overcome.
If your spouse does relapse, try not to take it personally. Recovery is difficult, and it's not uncommon to slip up.

Reassure your love for them.,
Explain that your relationship will not suffer.,
Tell them your stepchildren will not take their place.,
Talk to them about how you feel.",How to Encourage Adult Kids to Accept Your New Spouse1," Children, even those who are grown, may feel threatened by a new spouse. They might think that your love for them will lessen now that you have a new person in your life. Reassure them that you will love them the same, no matter what.


For example, you could say to them, “You never have to worry about me loving you any less, especially just because I married someone. You will always be my child and I will always love you, no matter what.” It may take you saying this more than once, but eventually your child should understand.;
, Your children may believe that a new stepparent in the family will take away from your closeness. In essence, they may feel like they are being replaced. Assure them that your spouse will only add to the family, not take anything away.


Show them your relationship is a constant by not breaking your routine. Changing anything about your relationship with your children after you are married can send the message that they aren’t a priority to you anymore., Everyone has insecurities, even adult children. Your children may fear that your new spouse’s children will come into the family dynamic and take their place. Let them know that would never happen.


Consider trying to help your stepchildren and children become closer. Invite them on outings with you, ask them all to come over to your home, and encourage them to spend time together. Avoid pushing the topic if it is clear that they do not like each other and don’t want to make the effort of building a relationship.Remember that this will all take time, but by initiating the first contact you are paving the way for possible future relationships.

, You may be a parent, but you still have the right to be happy, even if your children seem like they don’t want you to. Let them know that how they are behaving is hurting you. They may not realize how their behavior is affecting you.


For example, you could say to them, “I understand you’re not too fond of my new spouse. However, your behavior towards them is not only disrespectful to them, but it’s disrespectful to me, as well. You don’t have to like them, but I want you to show respect.”
Asking your children to welcome your new spouse into the family isn’t too much to ask, and you shouldn’t feel bad about doing so.In fact, not speaking up might align you with your children against your spouse.

Be a good example.",How to Enjoy a Screen‐Free Week with Your Family," Let your children know ahead of time that the family will take a break from screens so that they can mentally prepare. Tell them what to expect and offer some suggestions of activities to do instead of watching television or playing video games. Talk about what is allowed and not allowed to use during the week.


You can also talk about acceptable exceptions. For example, if a child needs to complete a report, they might be able to use the computer during a specified time.
If possible, don’t restrict listening to music. Use music sources that don’t rely on a screen, such as an mp3 player or voice-activated system.;
, No one wants to dread the week or count down the seconds until it’s over! Especially if this is your first screen-free week or your family tends to heavily rely on screens, you’ll want to plan some activities to do before the week begins. Create an activity calendar or social calendar for the week. For example, you may want to take a daily walk together at the park or let the kids play at the playground after school.Have some activities for your kids to choose from in their free time. Write some options on popsicle sticks and put them together in a jar. You might include activities such as, “Jump on the trampoline,” “Paint/Draw,” or, “Build a pillow fort.”
Give your kids some say in their activities so that they feel like they’ve contributed and have something to look forward to.

, Now is the perfect time to encourage your family to explore new interests. Maybe there’s something you’ve always wanted to do, like an exercise class or play mini golf. Challenge each person in your family to find an activity they want to try and try something new during this week. They might be surprised and learn that they love baking, building towers, dancing, or singing.Teach your child a new skill and allow them to practice it, like riding a bike or climbing a tree.
Let your child start a new karate class or help you with a project.

, If it’s impossible for your entire family to commit to going a week without screens, set a realistic goal for each member of the family and for the family altogether. For example, it may be more feasible to set a goal to lower screen time or cut out one thing, such as television, for a week. Or, ask each member to cut out social media for one week. Include all family members in decision-making and discuss exceptions case by case.If you work from home or your kids use the computer for school projects, have a certain time limit when devices are turned off. For example, turn off your computer past 5:30 p.m.

, Avoid bringing work home if you can. If you can finish some work the week before, put in a few hours so that you can fully participate in the screen-free week. If you have a separate work phone, consider leaving it at work for this week or at least not responding to any texts or calls that are not urgent.


Check and respond to emails only during work hours.
If you can’t cut out work obligations, try to cut back.
Clarify that screens can be used at school and at work. If children need a computer to complete an assignment, let them use it. However, consider sending them to the library or another place to do the work. Doing it outside the house can help them stay focused and not tempt them or other family members.

, Make sure you consider all screens in your home, from cell phones and tablets to television screens. This also includes video games and portable game systems. Designate a safe and secure location, then have your children hand over their screens. This will help each family member be accountable for their actions and not be tempted to sneak in time.Keep the screens somewhere that won’t tempt any family member to sneak some time. For example, keep all screens in a box, uncharged, and in a place difficult to access, like the attic.

, Set aside time specifically for the family to be together. This is especially helpful if the kids attend dance classes or violin lessons and are often scattered throughout the week. Find a time when everyone is (or can be) home and spend some time together. Do a fun activity that everyone will enjoy.


For example, go on a hike or play basketball at a park.
Rearrange your living room furniture so that the television is not the centerpiece of the room. Instead, face chairs so that everyone can face one another and participate in games and discussions easily.

, Kids and parents enjoy playing games together. Take out board games, card games, or make up your own games. Games are a great way to enjoy family time and have fun together. Depending on your children’s age, play something simple like Chutes and Ladders or Candyland or something more complex like Uno, Sorry!, or Settlers of Catan Junior.Friday nights are great to have a game night. School-age kids may be allowed to stay up a little past their bedtimes and play games.

, Make meal preparation family time. Involve the children in kitchen activities, no matter how small. For example, small children can help pour ingredients into a bowl while older children can help mix ingredients or cut vegetables. Working together can make meal preparation fun and make the meal even more enjoyable to eat.Give each child a task and show them how it contributed to making the meal. Your children can feel satisfied in creating something altogether.

, Make a point to sit down and enjoy meals together. Maybe your family meal is breakfast before everyone leaves for work or school, or perhaps it’s dinner once everyone is home. Find time when everyone is around and eat food together. Having a screen-free meal can help kids eat distraction-free and contribute to conversations.For example, have each person talk about a highlight and a lowlight of their day.

, Encourage your family to spend some time outdoors. This is a great way to get out of the house and stop thinking about watching television or wanting to look on social media. Get your family interested in the outdoors and raise their curiosity. For example, see who can find the most animals on a walk in the woods. Plan a treasure hunt for kids to look around and find things like acorns, leaves, and caterpillars.Have your kids create a fairy house or a nature mobile out of sticks, leaves, and other natural items.

, Include other families in on your plan to go screen-free and get together with them. It might be easier for kids to play creatively when they’re around friends who also are screen-free. Parents can support each other and let their kids have fun playing without a screen. Share ideas and activities with other local parents.Plan some activities with other families, like a picnic in the park or a hike to a waterfall.

, The first day will likely be the hardest one for everyone. If kids are whiny or feeling antsy, don’t give in. Instead, offer ideas of activities to do or friends to play with. Remind each family member about the rules of the week and let them know when they can get their screens back., Screens discourage children from interacting creatively or coming up with ideas and play on their own.Additionally, play arms children with emotional, cognitive, and social skills.Get your kids involved in creative play during this time. Encourage them to do art, dance, create music, and build with blocks or other materials.


Have them build in creative ways. For example, encourage them to build a theme park for their action figures or a robot out of legos.

, Encourage your kids to get creative and crafty. Let them play with paints, crayons, colored pencils, popsicle sticks, glitter, and other craft items. Set some time aside each day for them to be creative in their art and make something. Perhaps they want to sculpt with clay or make puppets and put on a puppet show.Challenge your kids to put on a play at the end of the week and get ready by making props, costumes, and a set.
Encourage your family’s artistic abilities. Have your kids create crafts, songs, play, sculptures, etc. Grab some fabric scraps, paper, cardboard, photos, and magazines and have each family member create something unique., Take your family to a food or music festival or out to a museum. Explore the fun things to do near where you live that you’ve never gotten around to doing before. You might find an exciting children’s museum or a public garden your kids enjoy. Get out and find new things to do in your community.


Attend a farmer’s market or craft show. See a play at the local high school or community center.

, If your family agrees not to use screens for a week, this also includes you. Be a good role model for your family (especially your kids) during this time by purposefully staying away from screens. If they are struggling, Your good example can help them stay motivated.Even if you feel it, don’t complain or count down til you can use a screen again. Being a good role model means showing a good attitude about the week, even if it’s difficult.

Remind your children of your happiness.,
Tell them having a spouse provides care for you.,
Let them know marriage for you means less responsibility for them.",How to Encourage Adult Kids to Accept Your New Spouse2," It’s safe to say your new spouse makes you happy. This alone should please your children. Talk to them about how it does, if they don’t already know. Remind them that they should be happy for you, not causing you stress.


For instance, you could say, “My new spouse makes me happy, and I wish you could be happy about that. Your being upset brings stress and sadness into my life. I can’t be completely happy until you are happy for me, so I wish you could be.”, Older people who are single often rely on relatives, like their children, to care for them during their last years of life. This is difficult for many adult kids, as they have their own families to worry about. Having a spouse care for you can take the burden off of them.


Also point out that they don’t have to worry as much about you because you aren’t alone. You have someone with you to keep an eye on you and help you if you become sick or hurt., You may have relied on your children for help with certain tasks when you were single. You may have asked for a ride when your vehicle was in the shop or called them when you needed advice about your taxes.


You likely don’t need to rely on them as much anymore now that you are remarried. That may take some of the pressure off of them."

Assure them that you know what you are doing.,
Be sensitive to your children grieving a deceased parent.,
Figure out how to manage after a divorce.,
Talk about your finances.,
Have alone time with them.",How to Encourage Adult Kids to Accept Your New Spouse3," Your children may believe that your new spouse is taking advantage of you or is wrong for you. However, you are an adult and are fully capable of making decisions for yourself. You can let them know that you appreciate their concern, but you made the right choice for you.


For instance, you could say, “I know you care about me and worry that I’ve made a mistake. However, I am able to take care of myself and trust my decision.” Hopefully what you say will put their minds at ease and allow them to begin accepting your new spouse., You might be able to move on and get a new wife or husband, but your children cannot get a new mom or dad. Keep this in mind as you try to assimilate your new spouse into the family. Don't act as if their deceased parent never existed. Pay homage to them through family traditions and continue to share fond memories.


When the other parent has died, children fear that a new spouse will try to fill the space of their other parent. Reassure them that you and your spouse will honor the parent who passed away. Let your children know that you do not expect them to love your spouse in the same way they loved their own parent.
Be especially mindful if this new relationship came quickly after the loss of their parent. If more time has gone by, you can expect and request more understanding from them.

, If you and your previous spouse divorced, they are probably still in the picture. This means that you will need to learn to navigate social interactions with them along with your new spouse. Don't try to assert your new spouse as the ""parent."" Respect your ex's role after a divorce and continue to let them parent.


You can try saying, “My husband is not trying to be your other parent. Instead, he just wants to be a part of your life in a different way. We respect the relationship you have with your father. We are not trying to interfere with that.”, As selfish as it may sound, older children may worry about their inheritance if you marry someone new. They may fear that your spouse will now receive what they thought was supposed to go to them. Let them know that your estate will still go to them and that is what is written in your will, if this is still what you want for them.


You may also consider talking about your prenuptial agreement, if you have one. This would prevent your new spouse from receiving a good part of what you own should you become divorced. Talking about this with your children may help them feel better about the situation., Spend some time with your children without the company of your new spouse. Part of the reason they may not be accepting of your new partner is because they don’t get to spend time with just you anymore; now they spend time with you only as a part of a couple.


By being together with them away from your spouse, you show them that they will not take a backseat because of your relationship."

, One of the biggest obstacles to greater fitness is time. If you need to drive your family 45 minutes to get to your gym, you are all less likely to go. Select a gym in a convenient location for your family.Choose a place that is close to home.
Choose a place that is on the way to school or work.
Consider parking costs and availability.

, You need your gym to be open when you have time to go. Additionally, you need the classes you want to be available when your family is.Compare the gym’s hours with your family’s free time.
Watch out for extra fees for early morning or late night classes.
Find out if hours or class times are subject to change.

, Many gyms will offer additional amenities or services that might sway you. Read over each gym’s website or talk to a representative about what else they might provide.Be aware that some of these services may cost extra. This can include things like:


Equipment for rent.
Lockers.
Showers.
A climbing wall.
A snack bar.

, Membership fees can vary widely from location to location (or even from package to package at the same gym). Additionally, what is included versus what costs extra can be very different from place to place. Before you sign anything, compare costs at different gyms and ask a lot of questions!You might ask:


”What if I need to exit my contract?”
”Do fitness classes cost extra?”
”Do I have to pay extra to rent a locker?”
”Can I pause my contract if I leave the country?”

, Make your gym experience more affordable by looking into potential discount options. Inquire at your gym and/or contact other discount-providers directly.These can include:


Discounts through your employer.
Discounts through your insurance company.
Family membership discount.
Deals on Groupon or Living Social.

, Many gyms will offer a brief free trial period and/or guest pass for you to try out their facilities. Bring your whole family along and try to get everyone’s sense of the place!Some gyms may only offer to give you a tour or a day-pass instead of a free trial.
Some gyms will ask you to provide credit card info. Be sure to “cancel” before your trial period is over to avoid fees.

, While you are there, check the place for safety and sanitation. Keep an eye out for anything that seems dangerous, gross, or just off.Does the facility seem clean?
Are members required to wipe down machines after using them?
Does the equipment seem to be functioning properly?
Does the equipment seem like it’s being maintained?

, Ultimately, whether you like a gym or not comes down to a feeling. If you enjoy being there, you are far more likely to go. Talk to everyone in your family and discuss the things you liked or disliked about each gym.Does the staff seem knowledgeable?
Were they helpful?
Do you feel comfortable there, or intimidated?
Can you see yourself working out there?

Typically you need to file in the county where the child lives. Keep in mind that in some counties you would use the county court of general jurisdiction, while others have a specific family court for divorce and child custody issues.
If a court has already established paternity of the child pursuant to an order, or if you have another order granting child support, you typically must file your petition for child custody in that court.;
, Depending on the context in which you're filing for custody, you may have to supply different types of documentation to the court along with your petition.


You typically must have evidence that paternity for the child has been established. This would consist of either an affidavit acknowledging paternity that was signed by both parents when the child was born, a declaration of paternity filed by the father, or a court order declaring the man the legal father of the child.You also will need the child's birth certificate, and copies of any other court orders such as a child support order that pertain to the child.If you have not yet had paternity of your child established, you may first need to file a complaint to establish paternity. You typically can have the judge decide custody of the child in the same order that establishes paternity., Many courts have fill-in-the-blank forms you can use to file a petition for child custody.


To find the forms you need, look on the court's website or go to the clerk's office of the court where you plan to file your petition. Legal aid offices or family law clinics also may have court-approved forms you can use.
If there's no website for the particular court you're using, you may be able to find a self-help website for the entire state that has forms available. If you plan to use these forms, read the instructions carefully.Keep in mind that state forms sometimes can't be used in certain counties. Additionally, some counties may have additional forms that must be included with your petition. The form's instructions typically will list any such differences or exceptions.
Legal information websites such as FindLaw have links to forms related to child custody, child support, and parenting agreements available for each state., If you're using a prepared form, make sure you fill in all areas honestly and completely.


If you were unable to find a form, you will have to format the petition yourself. Ask the clerk for copies of petitions filed in the same court in other cases that you can use as guides. Make sure you only copy the format of these sample petitions – you will have to adapt the language within the petition to fit your own case.

, Different courts have different forms that must accompany a petition for child custody.


In some courts, the clerk will complete the summons that tells the other parent to appear in court; in others, you must fill out at least part of the summons and present it with your petition.If the court has not already ordered child support, you may be required to fill out additional forms to calculate child support. There also may be parental responsibilities worksheets that are required when you file a petition for custody.If you've downloaded a packet of forms from the court, typically all required forms will be included in the packet along with instructions on how and when to fill out and file each document.In some jurisdictions, you must fill out and file a notice of appearance if you plan to represent yourself in your custody proceedings. If you've hired an attorney, he or she will fill out and file an appearance., In some jurisdictions, you may be required to sign your petition in the presence of a notary public.


A petition or complaint requiring a notary's seal and signature typically is called a ""verified"" complaint. The notary verifies your identity by reviewing identification documents from you before you sign your court documents.Before you sign your petition, double-check the information you've included to make sure everything is true and correct to the best of your knowledge. You also should make sure you've included any other documents that are required to file the petition.
Typically any affidavits you've included would have to be signed in front of a notary as well, since affidavits are signed under oath., The clerk of the court that will hear your case must file your petition and assign it a file number.


You will need the originals and two copies of the documents. The first copy will be for your own records and the second will be for the other parent. The clerk will keep the originals for the court files.The clerk will stamp your originals and copies ""filed"" and assign the case number. You must pay a filing fee to have these documents filed. This fee varies greatly among courts, so you may want to call the clerk's office before you file to find out how much you'll have to pay.
Generally you can expect to pay between $100 and $300 to file your petition for child custody. If you cannot afford this fee, you can apply to have the fees waived. The clerk will have an application you must fill out and disclose details about your income and assets. If you qualify as low-income, the court will waive court costs for you., Once you've filed your petition, the other parent must have notice that you've requested a custody determination from the court.


The clerk will issue a summons for the other parent to appear in court. Typically you must pay a sheriff's deputy or court officer to hand-deliver the summons and petition to the other parent, although you may be able to use certified mail with returned receipt requested.If the other parent is difficult to locate or seems to be avoiding service, the court may appoint a special process server to locate him or her and serve the papers., When your petition has been delivered to the other parent, you typically must file a document showing that he or she has notice of the case.


If you've served the documents using certified mail, the return receipt can serve as your proof of service. This form typically must be attached to a court form in which you describe how the other parent was served and when service was completed.
Keep in mind that it may take several months to get a final custody order, depending on the time of year and how busy the courts are.The service forms required by your court may include an affidavit or other form that must be signed by the person who completed service., After the other parent is served, he or she typically has a period of time to file an answer to your petition.


Most courts give the other parent between 20 and 30 days after he or she is served with your petition to file an answer to it.If that deadline passes and the other parent hasn't responded, you typically will be entitled to a default judgment, which means the judge will approve whatever custody arrangements or parenting plan you've described in your petition.In some courts, an initial hearing is scheduled rather than requiring a written response from the other parent. The clerk will let you know what your next step is. If an initial hearing is scheduled, you must attend or your petition will be dismissed., Although uncontested custody proceedings are generally simple enough to handle on your own, you may want to get legal representation if the other parent is contesting your petition, and especially if the other parent has hired an attorney.


Most states view shared custody as in the best interests of the child. If you are seeking sole custody of your child, you will have the burden of convincing the court that this arrangement is actually in the best interests of your child. In such a situation, hiring an attorney may be the best way to accomplish your goal, particularly if the other parent has a history of violence or abuse.If you're worried about being able to afford an attorney, consider checking with your nearest legal aid office to see if you qualify for services there. Many communities also have family law clinics or law school clinics where you may be able to receive free or reduced-fee assistance.
If the other parent has a history of violence or abuse, you may be able to find additional resources at your nearest domestic violence shelter.

, Some jurisdictions require parents filing for custody to successfully complete parenting classes dealing with aspects of legal custody and the best interests of the child.The clerk will have information about any required parental orientation classes or programs, and will provide you with a description of the requirements along with schedules and locations where you can take the classes when you file your petition.These classes typically teach parents the ways children deal with divorced or separated parents, and how to avoid harming the children. You also will learn about your court's procedures in a custody case and how judges evaluate custody using the ""best interests of the child"" standard., Many courts require parents in custody proceedings to attempt to arrive at an agreement regarding parenting time before a court hearing will be scheduled.


If the other parent files an answer or appears at the initial hearing, the court may order mediation to discuss and agree on a parenting plan.Keep in mind that generally it's in the best interests of both parents and your child to come to an agreement on a parenting plan rather than have one ordered by a judge. If you're able to come to an agreement through mediation, you have more control over the outcome and can devise a custody plan that works best for everyone involved.In most cases, you still will have to go to court even if you come to an agreement through mediation, because a judge must approve the parenting plan that you and the other parent have proposed., If you and the other parent don't come to an agreement on custody arrangements, you must prepare for a court hearing on the matter.


Keep in mind that the judge will decide custody based on the best interests of the child. Thus, you should prepare evidence that tends to show that the custody arrangement you've requested is in the best interests of your child.Generally, you must be able to show that the child has a stable living environment with you, and that you are able to meet your child's basic needs. You also must demonstrate that you have a good relationship with your child and are able to provide your child with adequate emotional support and supervision.In addition to any documentary evidence, you might consider calling witnesses, such as a religious leader or your child's teacher or coach, to testify on your behalf.
You also must be prepared to testify on your own behalf. The judge will ask you questions related to your child, the other parent, and your petition for custody."

You can check if your computer has an adapter installed by opening the Start menu or screen and typing ncpa.cpl. Press ↵ Enter and the Network Connections window will open. Look for a connection labeled ""Wireless Network Connection."" It will have a signal bar icon underneath the connection icon. This indicates that you have a wireless adapter installed.
See Install a PCI Card for instructions on installing a network card in your computer.

, This is a free, open-source program that can easily share your computer's internet connection via a new wireless network using protocols built into Windows. You can download it from virtualrouter.codeplex.com.

Virtual Router allows you to share your connection via wireless using the same card that your computer using to connect to the network. In other words, you only need a single wireless connection on your computer to create a Wi-Fi access point and share your internet with mobile devices.
If you're using Windows 10, you can try this method, but many users report that it doesn't work on their systems. See the next section for a method that is much more likely to work in Windows 10.

, Follow the prompts to install the program. You can leave any settings at their default. If you downloaded the program from virtualrouter.codeplex.com, it should not have any adware or malware.

You can find the downloaded installer at the bottom of your browser window, and it can also be found in your Downloads folder.

, Once you've installed Virtual Router, you'll need to launch it. Find and open the Virtual Router Manager program in your Start menu., Virtual Router requires a wireless device with drivers that are made for Windows 7 or 8. If you haven't updated your wireless card drivers in a while, or you upgraded your computer from Windows Vista or earlier, you may need the latest drivers for your device. If you do not have a wireless adapter installed, the program will not start.

Press ⊞ Win+R and type devmgmt.msc to launch the Device Manager.
Expand the ""Network adapters"" category, right-click on your wireless adapter, and select ""Update Driver Software.""
Click ""Search automatically for updated driver software"" and follow the prompts to install any drivers that Windows finds.

Test your device.",How to Connect Audio Devices to Computers1," On desktop PCs, this port is typically on the back of the CPU box, while iMacs have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the back of the monitor. Some common audio-out methods include the following:



Optical - A pentagonal port. Optical cables will usually work with high-end, modern speakers.

RCA - A red port coupled with a white port. These ports receive 3.5 millimeter cables of the same colors.

Headphone jack - The 3.5 millimeter headphone jack can reliably be found on most computers.

HDMI - HDMI slots work the same way on your computer as they do on your TV, which includes audio transmission.
On laptops, the audio-out port is typically the headphone jack.;
, The microphone jack is the same size as the headphone jack (3.5 millimeters), and it usually has an image of a microphone next to it. If you're connecting a device that needs separate microphone input (e.g., some gaming headsets), you'll need to know where the microphone port is.


USB ports can also double as audio-in connections.

, If you have a new set of speakers and an old computer, for example, you might need an optical-to-RCA adapter, since your computer likely only supports RCA or headphone input.


You can find audio converters, also known as ""audio extractors"", in most tech departments in retail stores or online.
If you have to use an audio extractor, you'll also need to purchase a separate set of cables in order to attach the extractor to your computer.

, Things like speakers and condenser microphones will likely need a power source (e.g., a wall socket or your computer's USB port) to function.


You may also need to press an ""On"" switch on the back of the main speaker unit.

, The device's main unit (e.g., the headset or main speaker) should have an audio cable that plugs into your computer's audio output port.

Trust your partner.,
Be patient with your partner.,

Communicate clearly.,
Handle disputes fairly.,
Keep your promises.",How to Create Your Ideal Relationship," Consider what you want out of a relationship and try to come up with some specific characteristics of your ideal partner. No relationship is perfect, but taking some time to think about what you want out of your relationship can help you move forward in creating an ideal one. An ideal relationship is one that can keep itself strong even after having ups and downs. People in ideal relationships work hard to communicate and avoid misunderstandings.As you set out to create your ideal relationship, make sure you consider what you want from it. If you are looking for stability and security, search for a partner with those traits. If you want attention and affection, look for someone who gives you that. Be clear with yourself about what you want from the beginning.
Take time to get to know yourself to learn more about what you want from a relationship. Ask yourself questions such as, ""Do I like me? Are there things I don't like about myself that I would like to change? Are there qualities in others that will enlighten the qualities within myself? Do I like myself enough to even be fully invested in providing the quality of attention that my significant other may need?"";
, Often, one of the biggest things that can get in the way of your future happiness is your past and any hurt you might hold onto from past experiences. In order to move forward in your life, you need to work on forgiving those who wronged you and let go of anything you may be struggling with from your past. Creating an ideal relationship requires commitment to the possibilities of the future, not bitterness about the past.This doesn’t mean that you should forget everything that ever happened to you. Rather, work on learning from your past experiences and moving forward.
For example, think about your past relationships and why they didn’t work out. If there is something about your former partners’ characters that influenced the failure of the relationship, keep these qualities in mind as things to avoid when searching for a new partner.
As you reflect on past relationships to identify ""failures"" and why you are no longer with the individual, think about what you have learned from that experience. Ask yourself questions like, “What did I learn and take away from my past experiences? What has changed that may make a new relationship better?”

, No one wants to be around someone who is grumpy or pessimistic all the time. Optimism attracts more optimism. If you want to find an ideal relationship, try to picture the future as full of opportunities.Be aware when you and/or your partner may be having a bad day. Be willing to forgive and allow for a pessimistic day if needed. Just avoid letting this happen every day.
Don’t feel like you need a relationship to be happy. Try to love yourself and recognize your good qualities. Nobody is perfect, but being positive about yourself and your life will be attractive to potential partners.
For example, if it is in your nature to be impatient with people, try to practice being more patient. Maybe you could babysit for a friend. Kids are notorious for trying the patience of adults, but it’s hard to stay upset at children. So this is a good way to practice being more patient. Try meditating for 10 to 15 minutes each day to focus your attention inward. This may help to keep you from focusing too much on what your partner is doing.

, Everyone has faults – there are no exceptions. Often, these character quirks are what make people lovable and memorable. Your family and friends should love you in spite of your flaws, but there may be some things you need to work on in order to attract your ideal partner.


Of course you shouldn’t change yourself for someone else, unless it is a positive change that you want to make for yourself.
This includes things like kicking bad habits (smoking, gambling, drinking, etc.), getting into better physical shape (not just improving your physical appearance, but your overall health and wellbeing), or becoming more focused and dedicated to your professional work.
Remember that nobody is perfect, so don’t be too hard on yourself. Feel free to accept yourself for who you are, but consider trying to improve some of your negative qualities., Everybody has different needs and desires, and you'll be more likely to get to your ideal relationship if you clearly say what you are looking for. For instance, if you know you want a long-term commitment, tell potential partners that. If you want daily communication, be up-front about it so that your partner can see if they are on the same page. If your ideal relationship involves only seeing each other occasionally, then tell your partner that.

, No true relationship can thrive without trust. If you want to create your ideal relationship, you’ll need to start the journey with someone you can trust and show them that you trust them on a daily basis. Trusting your partner means giving them the benefit of the doubt instead of always jumping to conclusions. Trust that your partner has your best interest at heart until they show you otherwise.A trustworthy partner should be reliable, faithful, and honest with you. In return, you should exhibit those same qualities toward your partner.
Don’t act suspicious or jealous. Avoid snooping through your partner’s phone or checking their email.
Remember that you need to be trustworthy yourself if you want to attract a trustworthy partner. Practice being trustworthy on a daily basis – with all of the people in your life, not just the person you’re in a relationship with.

, That is one of the most important things to remember in an ideal relationship. To feel really loved and respected, most people need to feel that their partner gives them the patience they think they deserve. This is a relative term based on each person’s experience, but things can be handled and solved much more easily by displaying a little patience.Have patience if your partner is not able to spend much time with you during a particularly stressful period at work.
Try to keep yourself calm while having arguments. This will help your partner see that you are trying to be patient with them.

, The most amazing gift on earth is to love someone and to be loved back. But you really can't get love unless you give it sincerely to your partner. If it applies to you and your ideal relationship, show your partner that you care about them unconditionally and make this the foundation of your relationship. This will help you create an ideal relationship.It’s important to tell your partner that you love them, but you also need to show your partner love through your actions. Do things just to make your partner happy even if it is something you don’t enjoy. Spend quality time with your partner and support them in their decisions.

, Show your partner the real you. This means always being honest about who you are, what you like to do, and what you want in life. If you give your partner a false idea about what kind of person you are, then your relationship will be based on this façade instead of who you really are as a person.Talk with your partner about your beliefs, your aspirations, your life goals, and your expectations. Be clear about what you want so you can determine whether or not the two of you are on the same page. Also, keep in mind that people change over time, so you and your partner may develop new beliefs, goals, aspirations, and expectations over the course of your relationship.
Don’t try to imitate other couples that you see. Every couple is different and the way they interact might not work for you. Don’t compare your ideal relationship with someone else’s.

, Relationships require time and energy. Try to switch it up a bit and surprise your partner every once in a while. This could mean doing something sweet to break the routine or coming up with a grand gesture to show them how much you care.Try giving your partner flowers or cooking breakfast for them in the morning. You could also plan a special date or a trip away for just the two of you.
Make sure to give your partner space as well and do not try to spend every waking moment with them. Allow each other to be individuals.

, One of the most beautiful things about being in a relationship is creating special routines and inside jokes that only the two of you share. These intimate shared behaviors help create a stronger bond in an ideal relationship.Create a special morning ritual that you always do when you wake up. Or come up with cute pet names for each other.
This also means that you shouldn’t rely on your relationship behaviors from the past, especially if they clearly didn’t work out the last time. For example, try to work on communicating your emotional wants and needs to your partner more effectively, especially if communication was a problem for you in past relationships.

, Being able to effectively convey your feelings to your partner is an important part of being in a relationship. Your partner isn’t able to read your mind, so you’ll need to work on talking to them about what you think and how you feel.Work on talking things out, even when you’re upset at one another. Talking about your feelings can help you resolve fights and avoid future problems.
For example, try saying things like, “When you cancel our plans, it makes me feel like I’m not a priority in your life.” Or you could say, “I have been feeling a little depressed about my work situation lately, so I would really appreciate it if you could be understanding about that and help cheer me up.”
Keep in mind that while it is good to be insistent to fully express your wants, needs, and desires in any relationship, be mindful of considering your partner’s needs, wants, and desires also. If you push too hard to express what you want in a relationship, it might have the opposite effect and push your partner away.

, If you disagree about something, try not to get too upset about it. It might help you to take a moment to calm down before you start discussing the problem if you are both angry. Let yourselves cool down a bit and then try to talk calmly about the situation.Keep in mind that your partner may need more or less time than you to feel ready to return to the discussion. Try to respect their needs and honor your own as well.


Give your partner a chance to tell their side of the story and really listen to what they have to say. Try to see the problem from their point of view so that you can come to a compromise to resolve the problem.
For example, try saying something like, “I don’t understand why you are so upset about this. Can you explain it to me again?” Or you could say, “I feel like you’re not listening to my side of the story. Would you please let me explain myself more clearly?” Make sure that you allow your partner to verbalize their perspective too.

, Your partner needs to be able to trust you completely in order to maintain an ideal relationship. Because of this, it’s crucial that you always stay true to your word and keep any promises you make to your partner.Don’t make promises you aren’t sure you can keep. It’s better to avoid a potential situation in the future where you might have to take back something you said.

Just jump into an interaction and start.,
Immerse yourself in a high energy environment.,
Approach her right away.",How to Dance with a Girl to Attract Her (in a Club)1," When you enter a party or a club, don't waste time. - Just start doing what you intended. This is a crucial step; the more you delay, the harder it would get. So just as you enter the club, push yourself to begin, even if every fiber in your body is against it. You will realize that your mental state prior to pushing yourself was irrational and feel better instantly. Some of the ways to do that are:


Start talking to people around you.
Jump on the floor and dance alone for a while until you feel more relaxed.;
, Night clubs and parties are very high energy environments, so it is necessary to increase your energy to that level if you want to have fun. If you don't, it is likely that you will never ramp your energy and will lag behind while standing at the side watching other people dance. So don't analyze or think - just jump into the lively interactions. This is not only attractive, but also helps you become action centered.

, If you see a girl dancing with another girl or alone, just approach her without wasting time. Use common sense when a girl is dancing with a guy then don't approach her. The more you delay, the harder it's going to be and creepier you will feel about yourself.

Go to her.,
Grab her hands and lead her.,
Pull her crotch closer to yours.,
Go for the make out.,
Try other angles.,
Whisper in her ears.,
Gently touch and stroke her.,
Try again for the make-out.,
Shuffle her to talk.",How to Dance with a Girl to Attract Her (in a Club)2," Approach her in a way that she sees you coming and start dancing with her, without touching. This will tell if she is down to dance and comfortable with you. There is another dominant way to do it and if done properly then you can skip a lot of steps in between.


Go and grab her waist. Approach her from side or front, say something like 'Hi, you look adorable' and grab her waist. Don't have a firm grasp, it will sub-communicate that you are too drunk and doing it because of the 'liquid courage'. Don't have a loose grasp either as this will tell that you are unsure and creepy. Keep a balance. This requires a lot of confidence which says that you believe in your core that 'you deserve and are worthy to dance with her and even if she doesn't want to, it would not be a big deal for you'. If she feels uncomfortable after this move, back off and go slow, if she is still dancing besides you, or move on to the next one if she is gone.

, After dancing with her for sometime, grab her hands and lead her as you dance. Learning some simple dance moves does help. Along with that you can also do things like:


Place your hands around her waist and move her body in a zig zag motion. Use common sense as you both are dancing so it doesn't not mean shake her with force. Go with the flow as your bodies are already moving with the music. Don't use it as a crutch either, see what works for you and what doesn't
Grab her hands and place them on your shoulders or around your neck. This move will improve the focus between you and the girl and bring you both even closer. This is a very attractive and will emit sexual vibes between you two.
Keep an eye contact. If you felt awkward or nervous for a mili-second you are most likely going to lose her. Keeping an eye contact shows confidence and also is seductive. Also your eye contact should sub-communicate what you want.

, So far if everything is comfortable between you two then the next step is to pull her crotch closer to yours. Grab her butt with both hands and gently but dominantly pull her closer to you. Again keep a solid eye contact.

, Now as there is a good eye contact, you can feel her breath, bodies are fused together, you are dancing slowly and she is not offering much resistance etc, then go for the make out. If she denies, stand your ground and stay there as if its not a big deal, because its not. She is still dancing with you, right? A confident and humble smile helps a lot.

, Trying the same thing again and again is going to hurt your plan. You must 'keep her on her toes' by trying different angles. There are many different things you can do in this situation to make out with her, like.....


Grind. Flip her around, in a way, that your crotch is rubbing against her butts(Grinding). Read Grind to learn more about it. This is a sexually charged and effective move to arouse both of you. While your crotch is rubbing against her hips, grab her waist or thighs and pull her closer to make the body contact even tighter. Rub your crotch in any motion to keep the sexual energy going. Adjust your height according to her as the main thing is to keep her hips and your crotch at the same level or its not going to very arousing.
Bite her neck. Its biology, while animals are having intercourse they bite each others neck because it arouses them even more. Since we have the same instincts within us, so it helps arouse your partner.

, Since the music is loud so this gives you an excuse to bring your face closer to her ear and talk. This is quite sensual as ear is one of woman's erogenous zone. This is a high energy environment so using sexual allusions or references can help your game and take her mind off the uneasiness, if she is feeling uncomfortable.

, Take advantage of your grasp around her. Stroking around her body like her back, butts, shoulders, neck etc is a turn on. Make sure you do it gently. Don't be a creep by going for her breasts, this is not going to get you anywhere, in fact it's going to reduce the sexual energy.

, Go for the make out after trying every angle. Remember the rule: As long as she is smiling and not leaving, she is down. It matters only if you think it matters.

, After making out with her if you feel there could be a good chemistry between you two, then shuffle her to a place where you can talk and connect. This is important if you want to hook up. Read Pull a Girl Home for more depth.

Be confident.,
Keep a balance.,
Ignore everyone else.,
Have fun.,
Be dominant.,
Its normal to feel anxiety and fear.",How to Dance with a Girl to Attract Her (in a Club)3," Yes its a cliché but truth. Mind creates the environment around you. Its subliminal and not completely understood, but you would have noticed it that when you are feeling confident and exhilarated from deep inside, this is seen in your actions and this is also reflected in the feedback from people around you, this also makes you look attractive. Good things happen to you when you are feeling good from the inside. In the same way when you are feeling anxious and fear, you get more related thoughts and same is seen in the environment around you. To snap out of irrational and anxious state of mind, push yourself without wasting time. Just Jump.

, The balance is, ""I want to dance with you but I am fine without you."" This is important, as girls are attracted to guys who are not needy.

, The girl in your arms is your priority. Make her feel special, genuinely, because she is. She agreed to dance with you and allowed you to come so close to her, Right?

, The most important thing is to have fun. Thinking and nonsense thoughts are only going to make it worse. You gave your mind any room to think and this is going to destroy your game. Ask yourself, What's the worst that can happen? She will say no. That's it, bottom line. Remember If you are not having fun you are not doing it right.

, Women like a guy who is dominant as since ancient times men are the one who lead women. Women like to be lead. Keep the fact in mind that in even-though women are seen as leaders, entrepreneurs, politicians etc and are totally equal as Men(status wise and intelligence) but in some some aspects they like to be treated as women because of the biological factors and evolution. If you are not being dominant enough you are, more likely, going to lose her.

, Yes, its normal. Who would feel like home after coming to a club or party?.

Hard Drive – This is the disk in your computer where all your data, programs, and files are magnetically stored.,
Learn the software terms:


Driver – A bit of software your computer uses to operate hardware.,
Learn the terms relating to actions you can perform:


Downloading – Taking a file off the Internet and saving it to your computer.,
Imagine you just purchased a new bookcase from Ikea.,
Learn what an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is.",How to Decode Computer Jargon,"






Router – A cigar box sized box, usually with a small aerial attached which splits the internet signal coming into the house and transmits it both wirelessly and down cables attached to it.






RAM – Random Access Memory. This is the temporary memory of the computer used to store things it is currently working on. Think of preparing a meal. You have all your ingredients (data) in the cupboard (hard drive) and you have your kitchen counter (RAM) where you are going to prepare the meal. If you have a small kitchen counter then you can only prepare one part of the meal at once, and you need to spend more time making trips to the cupboard to retrieve the ingredients.

, It acts as a translator allowing your computer to talk to hardware devices.

Operating System – Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 are all operating systems - the main program which allows the user to access data, run programs, etc. The purpose of an operating system is to organize and control hardware and software so that the device it lives in behaves in a flexible but predictable way.

,
Installing – Installing a program is often confused with downloading a program but it is important to understand the difference.
Uploading – The opposite of downloading. Taking a file stored on your computer and saving it to the Internet (such as a server connected to the Internet)

, Downloading it would be having it delivered in its box. Installing it would be unpacking all the parts, putting it together and setting it up in the location you want it to go.

, An ISP is a company that supplies connection to the internet i.e. Sky, Virgin, British Telecom, etc. Often they will also provide their customers with an email account.

, Look for the “Download” button and click on it. The file will be downloaded to your desktop.


Note that this program should only be run on HP business desktops, notebooks, and machines.

, The downloaded file is an executable file that will extract all the contents into another folder in your computer. Run the file by double-clicking on it, and note where the files are extracted to.

, Go to the folder where the extracted files were put. The extracted files include disksan.exe, disksan.iso, ReadMe.txt, and HP_EULA.txt.


Disksan.exe file is a DOS-based utility that erases the hard drive securely through multiple overwriting passes. This is the main program that does the disk sanitation.
Disksan.iso is a bootable CD ISO image that includes disksan.exe.
ReadMe.txt is the job aid or instruction manual for the tool.
HP_EULA.txt is the end-user license agreement.
More detailed instruction can be found in the ReadMe.txt file.

, Before you begin any deletion, formatting, or disk sanitation, be sure that you have properly backed up all important files from your computer. Burn the files on a CD or DVD, copy them to a USB or external hard drive, or upload them to a file storage cloud.


Once you start the disk sanitation, you won’t be able to access your files on the computer anymore.

, Burn disksan.iso to a blank writable CD or DVD. You will use this CD or DVD to run disksan.exe.


Disksan needs to be located outside your hard drive for this to work. The file can also be copied to a bootable USB drive.

, In order for Disk Sanitizer to run properly, it needs to be detected by the computer as the first item to boot. If it was skipped, the computer will just boot normally using your current operating system. The boot order needs to have the CD or USB drive as the first one.


Once the CD or USB drive is detected during boot-up, HP Disk Sanitizer will automatically run.

, In order to prevent accidental deletion of your other storage devices, unplug or remove them from the main computer. All the hard drives detected by Disk Sanitizer during its run may be included in the process.

, Insert the bootable CD or DVD or the USB drive that contains the disksan file. Restart your computer, and it should bring you to the HP Disk Sanitizer screen upon boot-up.

, If this is chosen, HP Disk Sanitizer will write zeros to all addressable location on your hard drive. It will only take one pass.


This is the fastest option to erasing your hard drive.

, This is the DoD-accredited method in securely erasing a hard drive. If this is chosen, HP Disk Sanitizer will pass over the hard drive three times. The first pass will write zeros, the second pass will write ones, and the third pass will write random bytes.

, If this is chosen, HP Disk Sanitizer will pass over the hard drive five times. The first pass will write zeros, the second pass will write ones, the third and fourth passes will write random bytes, and the fifth pass will write zeros again.

, If this is chosen, HP Disk Sanitizer will pass over the hard drive ten times. The first pass will write zeros, the second pass will write ones, the next seven passes will write random bytes, and the last pass will write zeros again.

, If this is chosen, HP Disk Sanitizer will pass over the hard drive 15 times. The first pass will write zeros, the second pass will write ones, the next 12 passes will write random bytes, and the last pass will write zeros again.


This is the longest option. Unless there’s really a critical or security risk, there’s no need to go over the last few options.

, Upon boot-up, HP Disk Sanitizer will load and display a menu. Select the first option for “Erase Hard Drive.”

, The next screen will ask you which hard drives would be erased. Select the hard drive you want to be wiped clean.


You can also select all detected hard drives here to erase everything attached to the computer.

, On the next screen, select the erase method you’d like to use (which are listed in “Understanding the Erase Methods”).


Do note that it will take some time for the disk sanitation to complete, especially if you chose the higher number of passes. The size of the hard drives will also matter, as it will take longer to pass through a hard drive with a large capacity.

, Once you finish your selection, the disk sanitation will start. You will be able to see the progress on the progress bar on your screen.


You won’t be able to use your computer while the disk sanitation is running.
Once the process is completed, you won’t be able to use your computer as it is. It needs to be made bootable again with a fresh operating system properly installed.

Microsoft Edge: Right-click on the ""AdBlock"" option and click ""Disable.""

, If you want to permanently delete AdBlock, click the ""Remove,"" or the Trash Can icon on the menu from the previous step. This will completely remove it from your browser.

Take a short break every 30-60 minutes.,
Step outside for fresh air and natural light.,
Listen to energetic music.,
Do eye exercises every 30 minutes.,
Adjust your posture.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Try the Bellows Breathing Technique.,
Stretch your back.,
Do neck exercises.",How to Deal With Computer Fatigue1," Take a few minutes to relax your eyes, shoulders, and hands. Use this time to move different muscle groups. Stretch, refill your water bottle, or walk to another area of your home or office.


Taking a 10-minute brisk walk on your break will improve your blood flow and increase both physical and mental energy.;
, Breathing in fresh air increases the oxygen in your lungs, which increases brain clarity.If it’s daytime, exposure to natural daylight will remind your body that it’s still the active part of the day.


If you can’t get outside, open the blinds, and if possible, move closer to a window to maximize your daylight exposure.

, Music triggers the feel-good neurotransmitters in your brain, helping you stay not only happy, but focused. If you’re doing complicated work, try music without lyrics to minimize distractions.Jazz artists like Miles Davis and John Coltrane both have lyric-free albums that are steady-paced, yet lively.
Classical music typically doesn’t have lyrics and is often upbeat. Try Schubert’s Symphony No. 5 or Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.

, Staring at a screen for a long time can cause serious eyestrain. Try these exercises to keep eye fatigue (and pain) to a minimum:Eye rolls: With your eyes closed, slowly move your eyes around in circular motions for one minute.
10-10-10: Every 10 minutes, look at an object about 10 feet away for 10 seconds. Blink naturally and let your eyes relax on the object rather than stare.

, If your posture is poor, your muscles have to work much harder to hold up your body.Muscles get tired when they work too hard, so readjust to this orthopedic surgeon-approved position when you find yourself slouching:Straighten your spine so your ears are lined up with your shoulders.
Relax your upper arms, keeping them close to your body. Extend your lower arms straight in front of you so that you can comfortably reach the keyboard and mouse. You may have to move your chair closer to the keyboard.
Place your feet flat on the floor (you may need to adjust the height of your seat).

, Dehydration leads to fatigue, so it’s important to drink water throughout the day. Feeling tired could be your body’s way of telling you it’s thirsty. Try to reach for a glass of water instead of coffee or energy drinks. Too much caffeine can make you more tired., This exercise, recommended by both doctors and yoga practitioners, will boost your energy level and restore alertness.Don’t try this if you have a breathing condition.


Sit with your spine upright and make sure you’re comfortable.
With your mouth closed, inhale and exhale rapidly through your nose. Each breath should be the same length, but keep them short (3 in-and-out breath cycles per second).
Continue the short breaths for 15 seconds, and then breathe normally.
If you feel lightheaded, stop immediately.

, These back exercises will keep your spine bright and your focus sharp.Upper and lower back stretch: While seated, extend both arms to the ceiling, your fingers interlaced. Make sure your arms are straight, then lean slowly from side to side.
Back arching: Stand up and support your lower back with your hands. Gently arch your back backward, holding the pose for 5-10 seconds.

, Long-term computer use can cause strain on the neck, especially if your computer setup is not ergonomically ideal. Use these techniques to keep your neck muscles from getting stiff. Repeat each of these exercises several times:Head rolls: While sitting, lower your ear to your shoulder and hold the position for about 10 seconds. Then, slowly roll your neck down, and over to the other side (so that your other ear is lowered to the other shoulder).
Head Turns: Turn your head to the right and look over your shoulder, holding the position for 10 seconds. Then, slowly turn your head to the left and do the same.

Use the Rule of Thirds.",How to Crop a Picture to Make It Look Great," When you choose the cropping tool in Photoshop you will see Width / Height / Resolution in the Options Bar. Note that you don’t have to fill in any figures for these options, you can simply start free form cropping,but the dimensions options gives you some additional abilities.


For example, if you know your result should be 1000px wide, you can put that in the width, but you can leave the height dimension blank. Now any cropped image will be 1000px wide, but its height will be determined by your mouse-determined selection, and it will be proportionate to its width (ie. it won’t be squeezed, squashed or out of proportion).
When you start cropping an image you will see the options in the Options Bar change. You can see drop down menu beside Crop Guide Overlay. These are grid tools to help you make a better crop. There are three choices – None / Rule of Thirds / Grid.;
, You might have heard about this rule before, but if you haven’t here’s a quick synopsis. It’s a method of composing an image by dividing it into 9 equal parts – three horizontal columns and three vertical columns. The idea is that by aligning the subject or focal points to one or more of these columns the visual dynamic and tension is increased and is more appealing than a photo with the subject placed in the centre.


Let’s have a look at this theory in practice. Here we have an image of a Thai Yak statue. The image to your left is the non crop image. It has a distraction in the top left with the bright highlight.
The subject of the image is neither in the middle nor to the left. So let’s use the cropping tool to make a quick adjustment. In the image to your right you can see the cropped image.

Here the Rule of Thirds was used to align the focal points of the image. The picture was cropped closer to the subject, removing the distraction on the top left, aligning the statue’s face to two of the thirds’ rules.

Use the right chair.,
Use a monitor, mouse, and keyboard with your laptop.,
Set up your desktop for comfort and efficiency.,
Get rid of screen glare.,
Keep the room temperature at about 71 degrees (F).",How to Deal With Computer Fatigue2," You can take steps to prevent fatigue by making some changes to your work area. Using a chair that properly fits and supports your body will greatly reduce muscle fatigue and pain caused by computer use. Your chair should have:Armrests that support the weight of your arms. They should be adjustable so that when your forearms are at rest, your elbows are aligned with your waist.
A seat that’s at least an inch wider than your thighs and hips. The seat bottom should also slope downward slightly.
An adjustable base, so that you can place your feet flat on the floor as you work.
Wheels, preferably 5 wheels attached to a 5-point base for maximum support.
A backrest that supports your lumbar (lower back). If your chair doesn’t have lumbar support, try rolling a towel and placing it behind you at your waist., If you do most of your computer work on a laptop, you’ve probably noticed that laptops are not designed for prolonged use. Extended laptop use will cause neck, hand, and wrist fatigue much faster than a standard setup. You can connect a monitor and input devices to your laptop, or use a docking station.

, Your workspace should be laid out so that you can use your computer without wasting energy.


Position the keyboard right in front of you (rather than at an angle) so that your wrists are straight while you type. Sit close to the desk so your arms rest on the chair’s armrests as you type.
Position your monitor at eye level, at least 18 inches from your face.

, Not only does glare make it difficult to see what’s on the screen, but it’s also a leading cause of eye fatigue. If there’s a glare on your screen, tilt it slightly until it’s glare-free (glare is a cause of eye fatigue). If glare is still an issue:


Switch from overhead lighting to lamps.
If glare is coming from the window, use a curtain or blinds to minimize the light.
Move your workspace to a location with less glare, if possible.
Buy a glare-reduction screen or glare-proof monitor.

, Research shows that this is the optimal temperature for productivity.Warmer temperatures can cause fatigue, while cooler temperatures can be distracting.

Eat small, frequent snacks.,
Cut your caffeine intake.,
Eat a balanced breakfast.,
Reduce your time spent on the computer.,
Take a warm bath.",How to Deal With Computer Fatigue3," Eating healthy snacks throughout the day keeps your blood sugar level and your mind clear. Opt for unprocessed snacks like fruits, vegetables, and nuts throughout the day, even when you don’t have a long day of computer use on your agenda.

, While a cup of coffee may give you an initial burst of energy, too much can cause a major caffeine crash. Stick to no more than 1-2 cups of coffee per day, and try not to ingest any caffeine after 3 pm., If you know you have a long day of computer work ahead, start your day with an energizing meal. Skip the breads and sugary cereals, and opt for a protein-enhanced smoothie, overnight oats, or a homemade breakfast burrito.

, If you use the computer for both work and play, try to find areas where tasks can be completed without the aid of a computer. Less time at a computer means less computer fatigue. Some examples:


Write ideas, lists, reports, poems, etc on paper instead of relying solely on a computer.
If you’re a computer gamer, try off-screen games like live action role-playing, Soitaire, or Magic: The Gathering.
Use a phone to make calls instead of video chat.
Watch a DVD on the TV instead of on your laptop. Because you’ll be sitting further back from the screen, it’s better for your eyes.

, If your muscles are sore after a long day of computer use, run a warm bath. You add epsom salt, sea salt, herbs, and essential oils to relax your central nervous system."

Know the goal of your bat file.,
Familiarize yourself with the available commands.,
Open a simple text editor.,
Write your code.,
Check your code for syntax errors.,
Save your code as a bat file.,
Test your new bat file.",How to Create a Batch File," The bat file programming language is generally considered easy to learn and does not require you to use external programs or compilers you may be unfamiliar with. If this is your first attempt at writing a bat file, a good starting goal is to learn the use of commands and syntax.


In programming, syntax is the spelling and grammar that your computer has been programmed to understand.Think of this as the language you will use to communicate with your computer. If you violate the rules of the programming language you are using, your computer will be unable to interpret and execute the commands you program.;
, You should be cautious when using some commands, like the delete command, which can alter files that your computer needs to run.If this happens, you may have to reinstall windows on your machine.


A complete list of commands can be found in your command prompt window. Find the ""Run"" command in your start menu, or press ⊞ Win+R. Once the black command prompt screen appears, type ""help"" and press enter. A complete list of command prompt commands, which also work for bat files, will appear.

, Most programmers prefer a no-frills text editor, like Notepad++. This is because extra features in word processing software are usually included for improved interface for the user. Your computer, already understanding the rules of batch file programming language, only needs to read the code you have written.


Notepad++, in addition to being free, is also coded to ensure a high execution speed of the programs you write, as well as minimizing the file size., The first line of code in your bat file should always be ""@echo off"", unless debugging. The use of the symbol ""@"" will prevent the echoing of your line of code, and following the echo command with ""off"" will prevent your computer from displaying the command prompt when your bat file runs.After this first line of code, you can use basic commands and syntax to write the code you wish your bat file to perform.

, Any misspelled words, improper format, or grammatical mistake could result in critical error that renders your bat file useless. If you receive an error message, you might want to consider using the ""pause"" command to stall your program at a point in the code. When your computer reaches the ""pause"" command, it will stop running your code and display the message, ""Press any key to continue"".If you receive no error message prior to the point in your code where you have inserted ""pause,"" you know that your programming syntax, grammar, and spelling were correct up to that point. Adjust the location of your ""pause"" command to narrow down where you've made a mistake.

, Now that you've finished writing your code, you can click the ""File"" menu, likely on the top menu bar of your text editor, and select ""Save as"". This will open a directory where you can navigate to a location on your computer where you wish to save your bat file. When you have selected your save destination, name your file in the field to the bottom of your save directory, and end your file name with the extension "".bat"".


For example, if your file name were ""CreateABatchFile,"" you would end the name of your file like so: CreateABatchFile.bat.

, Navigate through your file directory until you have reached the location to which you saved your bat file. Double-click the file or right-click it and select the ""run"" option to see if your new bat file works.

Decide which method is best for you.,
Make sure that the scanner will work with your PC.,
If the scanner comes with software, then you should be able to start scanning straight away, otherwise you will need to obtain scanning software.,
Before you start scanning take the time to calibrate the scanner.,
Do some practice scans.,
Now the moment you have been waiting for.,
When you come to scan the image you will need to set some basic parameters up to tell the scanning software what type of image you are scanning.,
After you have scanned the image in you then need to save it to the hard disk.",How to Copy Photographic Slides into a Computer," Flatbed scanners are very cheap (you can purchase a good one for under $100) and most will have the ability to scan photos and slides. If you are primarily interested in scanning slides, look for one with a slide scanning attachment.;
, If you are using a Mac, ensure that the scanner is Mac compatible; likewise with a PC running Microsoft Windows, or Linux.

, One of the best, and reasonably priced, is VueScan. This works with both Mac and Windows.

, Some scanners come with a calibration sheet, if not these can be purchased for a reasonable price. Although they are not absolutely essential, calibrating your screen and scanner will make for a much more accurate end product. Especially if the originals get lost or damaged.

, Test the scanner with various control images. Use black and white pictures to ensure that you are getting the full range, and that the blacks are black, not grey, and that the whites are truly white, and not off white, or worse, tinted with a colour.

, The actual scanning. Organisation is the most important part here. Create a directory tree structure where you are going to place the scanned data. By thinking this through before you start you will be able to ensure that your scans will be easier to locate at some later date. How you organise them is up to you, but pick a scheme that makes sense to you. You could organise them by Year, then by subject or you could choose to organise them by subject, then year. However you do it it will be better than just dumping them into one big directory.

, The most important of these will be whether colour or black/white, and what resolution you want to scan at. Colour or B/W is fairly obvious. You are not going to get any benefit from scanning a B/W image in colour. It will work, but it usually results in a much bigger file size for no benefit. Best to pick a Greyscale scan. With a colour picture the options are often more complicated and revolve around the amount of colour detail you are looking to conserve. Many scanners will be capable of scanning from 256 colours to several million. In practice the eye has a hard time differentiating more than a few thousand levels of colour, but as a general rule the more the better. What is the down side of using more colours? It's file size. The more colours, the bigger the file. However with modern computers coming with hard disks of hundreds of Gigabytes this is really a no brainer.

, This is where another decision must be made, since there are a number of different formats in which the image can be stored on the disk. The two main type are lossless and lossy. Lossless is what it implies. The picture data is stored exactly as it was scanned, nothing is altered or lost. If you reload the image from the disk it will be exactly as it was scanned. The other method, the lossy method, will store the image but if you reload it it will not be exactly as it was when scanned. Why would you do this? Well the answer is to save disk space. By compressing the image it is possible to trade a little (or a lot) of the detail of the picture for a smaller file size. This means that you can get more images on a given disk when compressed than when uncompressed. The most common form of compression is JPEG (or JPG) which achieves phenomenal amounts of compression while losing only a small amount of detail.

, Once you've found the link, press and hold it until a new menu appears. It may take a few moments for the menu to show up., The wording for this will vary depending on the app you are using. Look for wording similar to these examples:


Copy
Copy link address
Copy link URL
Copy address

, Once you've copied the link, you can paste it anywhere you can type. Tap the text field to place your cursor.

, Release your finger after a moment. A new menu will appear.

, You'll see the ""Paste"" option in the menu that appears. Tapping ""Paste"" will paste the copied address into the text field.

, If you've received a text message with a link on your Android device, you may have to do a little more work to copy it, especially if there is other text with it. Not all Android messaging apps will function the same:


Press and hold on the message that contains the link.
Tap the ""Copy"" button that appears. It may just be an icon of two pages stacked on each other at the top of the screen.
Paste the copied text where you want to paste the link, and then manually delete any extra text that came with the original message.

,, Save the file to a convenient place on your hard drive, usually in ""My Pictures."" Ensure you name it and/or remember the name and where you saved it.

Once you hit ""Save,"" you will have the image for use and/or manipulation.


What if it's protected? Almost all images belong to the copyright owner or photographer. Few people really care if you use them around the house or just on your own machine. But when you publish them publicly or try to make money from them, you're opening a real can of legal worms. Sometimes when you right-click on an image, an ""image protected"" message appears. Seek permission of the webmaster. If that fails and depending on how you intend to use it (see the note on Fair Use below), you can still copy the image.
With the image on screen, hold down the Alt key and press the Print Screen key (or Prt Scr, it's usually up and right of the backspace). This will make a low-resolution copy of everything on your screen.
Open your image editing software or the program you wish to put the image in (if all else fails, try MS Word). Create a new file. Hold down the Ctrl key and press the V key. This will paste your screen image.

Check your recovered files.",How to Recover Overwritten Files1," When you notice that you've accidentally delete or overwritten a file, do not save anything else on that hard drive. Avoid running programs as well. Whenever new data is written to the drive, there's a chance that it could be set to override the data from the old file. Not saving anything increases the chances that you'll be able to recover the file.
, This is a powerful free file recovery program. It isn't pretty, but it can do a lot of the same things that expensive file recovery programs do. You can download PhotoRec for free from www.cgsecurity.org as part of the TestDisk utility.


PhotoRec is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux.
Make sure to do this on another computer to avoid overwriting the file you are trying to recover. You can also download PhotoRec to another drive on your computer, but it's safest to get it on another computer.

, Ideally, you'll want to use a USB drive that is big enough to hold both PhotoRec and any files that you want to recover. This is because recovering the file to its original drive increases the chances that the recovery will write over the original, corrupting it in the process.


PhotoRec is only about 5 MB in size, so any size USB drive will be able to hold it.

, TestDisk comes packaged in a ZIP (Windows) or BZ2 (Mac) file. Extract the TestDisk folder.

, This will allow you to run PhotoRec from the USB drive.

, Open the TestDisk folder on the USB drive.

, This will launch your Command Prompt or Terminal.


You will use the arrow keys up, down, left, and right to navigate and Enter or Return to confirm selections.

, The disks are just numbered, so you will need to go off the size of the disk.


If your disk has multiple partitions, such as a C: and D: drive on one physical disk, they won't be listed until you select the disk they are on.

, By default PhotoRec will try to recover any file that it supports. You can speed up the search by specifying which file types you want to focus on.


You can change the file types options in the File Opt menu.
While in the File Opt menu, you deselect everything on the list by pressing S. You can then go through the list and enable each filetype you want to search for.

, You will need to judge which one is correct based on the size of the partitions. Some partitions may be labeled.

, If you are using Linux, select ext2/ext3. If you are using Windows or OS X, select Other.

, Your choice here depends on how the file was lost:



Free - Select this option if you manually deleted or copied over your old file.

Whole - Select this option if disk failure caused you to lose access to the file.

, Make sure that this isn't on the same partition as the files you are trying to recover.


Use the .. at the top of the directory list to navigate back to your installed disks. This will allow you to find a location on another partition or USBN drive to save the files to.
Press C when you've located the directory you want to save the files into.

Understanding the type of fraud can help you prove your case. These types of fraud are also usually criminal in nature and should be reported to law enforcement.


Telemarketing or mail fraud. The phone call or letter claims that if you ""act now"" and pay money, you will receive some sort of benefit that seems too good to pass up on. Too late, you discover the truth is that the telemarketing, ""Nigerian prince"" letters, and other advance fee schemes are fraudulent.Health care fraud. This includes doctors or other medical providers over-prescribing or obtaining medical equipment and charging your insurance. Instead of the healthcare you need, you end up with extra co-pays, co-insurance bills, or higher insurance premiums.
Investment fraud, Ponzi schemes, and pyramid schemes. You are promised a great return if you invest money in the ""business."" Your profit depends on you recruiting other investors and, unbeknownst to you, any payouts you receive come from money that others have invested.Work at Home scams. The backs of magazines are full of them. They promise that by working at home you can stuff envelopes, do assembly work, or start your own computer business. To access this bounty, all you have to do is buy a kit, or invest in equipment, or give your credit card information as a security deposit.;
, To prove fraud in court, you must allege and prove all of the elements found in historical common law. In general, you must look for and define six elements:


There was a statement or representation that was false. The first element of proving fraud is to nail down the statement, also called the representation, that was made to you. The representation can be words or actions presented to you as being the truth.For example, someone offers to sell you an antique painting for $100. This is a fact that, if false, would cause you to change your mind and not complete the deal.The other party either knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard to the truth. It's not enough that it be simply misleading, a significant part of the statement must be an outright lie.The false statement must relate to a material fact. For instance, you examined the painting and discovered it was a print or a recently created copy.
The statement was made intentionally made to induce you to act on it. This can be very difficult to prove. The other party must have known the statement was false.It is not enough for the seller of the painting to be wrong, he must have known he was wrong and intentionally hidden that from you.In this case, the seller wanted you to buy the painting he knew was fake and intentionally lied to get you to do it.
You relied and acted on the false statement. Reliance means that without the false statement, you would have made a different decision.If you believed what the seller told you and paid $100 for an ""antique painting"" that proved to be fake, then you relied and acted on the seller's intentionally false statement.
You suffered damages, either in a direct loss of money or having to spend more money to correct the situation, as a result of acting on the false statement.The purpose of damages is to restore you to where you would be if the fraud had not occurred., If you plan on suing someone for fraud, you will need to select a court to argue your case. If your claim meets the dollar limit, usually $10,000, then you can file your case in small claims court.Small claims court has some advantages because the rules of procedure are relaxed and you do not need a lawyer to assist you with the case. However, you still must be able to document and prove each element of fraud in order to win your claim.
If your losses are more than the small claims limit for your state, you will have to go to the district court. If this is the case, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a civil attorney for an evaluation of your case and potential representation. In civil court, you will be bound by the full rules of civil procedure for your jurisdiction and held to the same standards as the attorneys.

, Go to the courthouse in the county where you live. The court clerk will have a form package for small claims court. Fill in every space. Do not leave anything blank. If a question does not pertain to your situation, mark it “N/A.” You will need your name and address and the other party’s name and address.In the section where you describe the factual basis for your case, you must reference each and every one of the six elements of fraud as they pertain to your situation. You must identify the false statement that was made intentionally to induce you to act. Then that you acted and suffered damages.
You must also act for a specific dollar amount in damages. Typically, your damages will be the amount of money you lost in the fraudulent transaction. You can also ask to be reimbursed for your court costs to sue in small claims court.

, Once you have completed the petition, you must file it with the court clerk in the county where either you or the other party reside. You will have to pay the filing fee, typically $25 to $50. Bring either exact change or a check. Many counties, especially smaller rural court systems, cannot take credit cards.


The court clerk will give you a court date, usually about 60 days out to leave time for service and to give the other party a fair time to respond and prepare their case.

, In order for the lawsuit to go forward, you must have the papers legally delivered to the other party. This is called service of process. The easiest way to effect service is to contact the sheriff in the county where the other party is located. Expect to pay around $20 for this action.The sheriff will file an affidavit of service with the court when the papers have been delivered.

, When you present your case in court, you will have to prove each of the six elements of fraud. While the rules are relaxed in small claims court, you will have to provide credible evidence for each part of your claim. Using a plaintiff’s checklist can help keep you organized., At this point, you should pull together every scrap of paper that has anything to do with your claim. Good documents include contracts, receipts, cancelled checks, letters, phone messages, and advertising material.


Make a list of your documents and mark each one with the element of fraud that it supports. For example, an advertisement that is misleading can be the false representation. The invoice where you paid a higher price shows you relied on the advertisement to your detriment. The amount on the sales receipt goes to show your damages.

, You will not have time for a parade of witnesses in small claims court. Some elements, like intent, may be explained by someone who witnessed your dealings with the defendant. However, you are usually your own best witness. As the plaintiff, you will be able to make a statement, essentially testifying on your own behalf. Look at the six fraud elements and jot down some statements that go to each element. For example, if you questioned the defendant about the price of an item or contract terms, this can go toward the defendant’s intent to defraud you.

, Using the statement of facts you wrote in your petition, arrange your documents in order of the elements of fraud. For example, advertisements showed the false price, the defendant’s name on the advertisement shows that he knew what was in the ad and intended the price to be what was listed. The contract shows that you relied on the advertisement. The invoice shows you were charged another price, and your receipt, cancelled checks, or defendant’s collection letter shows your damages.


Jot down statements about each document. In court, you may be nervous and lose your train of thought. Your notes will keep you on track and help you with a professional presentation.
Arrange your documents and notes in a binder or folder for easy access during court. Make two copies of each document and collate them into sets. One set is for the judge. The other set is for the defendant. This will make your case go smoother if you don’t have to pass individual documents around.

, It is critical that you are on time. If your case is called and you are not present, your case may be dismissed. You should aim on being at least 30 minutes early. This will give you time to find the courtroom and organize your thoughts.


Give yourself plenty of time to find parking and bring change for the parking meter.
Arrange childcare ahead of time. Many judges do not allow young children in the courtroom and you cannot leave them in the hallway unattended.
You don’t have to wear a suit or fancy dress, but your clothing should be neat, clean, professional, and respectful to the court. Don’t wear t-shirts with designs, flip-flops, very short or revealing clothing. Be comfortable. Depending on how many cases the judge has to hear, you could be there for several hours., As the plaintiff, you will speak first. Walk the court through your argument, one element of fraud at a time. Refer to your documents. Finish your presentation with a request for damages and court costs. Plan on keeping your presentation to roughly 15 minutes.


If the judge asks you any questions, answer them as simply and directly as you can.

, After you finish, the defendant will give his side of the story. You have to listen quietly and respectfully. Do not make noises, roll your eyes, or fidget in your chair. Listen attentively and make notes of anything you disagree with.


When the defendant is finished, the judge may ask if you have any final remarks. If you can rebut anything the defendant said, keep it short, no more than a few minutes.

, The judge will usually make a decision immediately, either in your favor or the defendant. Regardless of how the judge rules, do not comment, complain, or enter into discussion with the defendant. Gather your documents and exit the courtroom.


The judge may instruct you to go to the clerk’s office for further instructions.

If there is no printer friendly version of the page you want, you may need to copy and paste the content into a Word document and print from there (though this is not absolutely necessary). Copying to a Word document is especially true for printing emails, particularly those other than Outlook.;

If there is no Print button, click File. This should be located towards the top of the window for both Macs and PCs.

Ensure that you have an appropriate printer.,
Choose the appropriate paper and ink.",How to Print a Document2,"


You will need a printer which is ready and capable of printing. This means it will need to be properly hooked up to the computer you are printing from, all of the necessary drivers must be installed, and the printer will need to be full of both paper and ink.
Don’t forget to plug it in and turn it on!
Also, be conscious of whether you have an inkjet or a laser printer. They print in different ways and require different materials to print with. Laser printers can print only in black and white.

,


You will need to determine what type of paper you want to print on before printing. Choose heavier paper for more formal prints (such as invitations or resumes) and thinner paper for basic flyers and other mass prints. This paper will need to be loaded into the appropriate slot, so that it will be used when you go to print. You will also need to determine if you need color or black and white prints.
Make sure that the paper you are using is not too thick for the printer.

Situate both your computer and your keyboard so that they are centered and you are facing them directly when using them.,
Make sure that the top of the computer's monitor is at eye level to avoid tilting your head forward or back, as this will stress your neck and shoulder muscles when sitting at it.,
Ensure that the monitor is placed at arm's length from your eyes when you are sitting.,
Avoid window glare when positioning your monitor screen, along with the headaches, eyestrain, and discomfort that glare often causes, by placing it at an angle to the window and tilting it accordingly.,
Position your keyboard at the level of your elbows so that your hands and wrists are straight.,
Opt for a swivel arm if your work situation requires that you interact with others on a regular basis.",How to Position Your Computer," You want to make sure that you don't have to twist or turn from left to right needlessly as this will lead to pain in the neck and shoulders.;
, You can place your computer monitor on top of the computer if you need to raise it up to meet this height requirement, or you could manipulate your chair up and down accordingly. With a monitor that is larger than 20 inches (50.8 cm), consider positioning your monitor 3 inches (7.6 cm) above eye level.

, Any closer may strain your eyes. With a monitor larger than 20 inches (50.8 cm), you will have to sit further than arm's length away.

, Don't place your monitor right in front of your window either, since the glare of the outside will produce a challenging viewing condition. Note also that glare can be caused from overhead lights. If glare is something you cannot avoid in your work environment, then consider purchasing an anti-glare screen.

, Consider attaching an adjustable keyboard tray to your desk.

, A swivel arm will allow you to position your computer monitor in the suggested location for use, but at the same time, provide the ability and convenience to swing your monitor out of the way while you are not using it.

Buy the right equipment.,
Purchase a slim fitting, quilted, padded cover.,
Consider making a special cover for the laptop or computer that can be ""worn"" during use.,
Keep the laptop or computer well-wrapped during travel.,
Keep a laptop snug in a cover (as described above), then place it in its carry-bag and - if you can - slip it into a backpack for additional warmth.,
Avoid taking it out of the car into a sudden drastic change of temperature.,Given that you are less likely to use it, don't try to use it in a freezing cold hotel room; wait until the room and the computer warms up first before switching it on.,
Ditto for when you arrive at your final destination - give the computer time to temperature settle before powering it up.

",How to Prevent Your Computer from Freezing," For those who must work in sub-zero temperatures and take the laptop or computer with them, it is important to buy one that fits the bill. Biologists tracking caribou trails need a laptop that can stand the rigors of temperature changes, along with quite a few knocks. Ask your local computer specialist for advice. Many times, the laptop or computer will need to be specially modified to cope.;
, Keep your laptop in this inner sleeve at all times that you are not using it. If you need it, take it out and fire it up, use it and then return it to its cozy little bag to retain heat. If you have a pet dog, tuck the laptop under the dog where it is sitting as this will help keep it warm. Failing that, use the car heater zone, or the tent heating zone to keep it in a warmer part of your operations.

, Something made from a fire blanket might be a good option provided that is non-flammable (they are supposed to be). You will need to make absolutely sure that the material is non-flammable and it must be cut away from any vent areas of the laptop or computer to allow it to remove any heat build-up (ironically this will still occur despite the cold, as that is the nature of computing hardware).

, Even if you are not an intrepid explorer or a poorly paid biologist on a field trip way up North or way down South, you need to take good care of a laptop or computer being transported in your vehicle during cold weather., If you need to use it en route, only turn it on inside the car with the heating on so that it is in room temperature environment., For computers, just make sure they are well wrapped for both warmth and damage-proofing so that it reaches its destination in good condition.,,"

Fix your keyboard so it stands up.,
Think about the curvature of your hands as you place them on the keyboard.,
Raise your wrists a tiny bit above the desk (if you are forced to type on a laptop keyboard).,
Learn that both hands will need to sit on the keyboard at first.

,
Place your hands down on the keyboard.,
Learn a little about the names to the rows on a keyboard.,
Place your left hand on the keyboard.,
Place your right hand on the keyboard.,
Learn where your thumbs go.,
Learn just how much pressure it takes to depress each key.",How to Position Hands on a Keyboard," Fold-out the keyboard stand from the back top corners of the keyboard. Doing so improves typing and decreases chances that you'll injure your hands after lots of use of typing at the keyboard.;
, At first, you won't need to place any fingers down, but learn just how they are to be held. First of all, your fingers should form the shape of the letter U as you place them down on the keys.

, Doing so like this makes up for the space-degrees that a regular computer would have been raised up to. Bring your wrists up about a half inch above the edge of the bottom portion of your keyboard.

,, It won't be natural at first, but after a few weeks of extended proper use of a keyboard, it will be so natural, you wouldn't even have thought you didn't know about this topic before, and you might even end up modifying your wrists and hands to improper positions.

, Although where you place your hands when typing is called the Home row, the row directly above that is called the top row and the row below the Home row is called the bottom row. You want your hands to be resting on the home row until you are ready to press down a key.


Those with experience will know how to strike the remainder of the keys of a keyboard, such as the shift key, Caps lock key, number keys/symbol keys and all the other keys on the keyboard.

, Place your pinkie on the A key, place your ring finger on the S key, place your middle finger on the D key and place your pointer finger on the F key. This is the makeup of everything but your thumbs as to pertain to the left hand.


Make sure that the keyboard doesn't click when you place your hands down; otherwise the key will activate and, if you are in a typing box, the letter or keystroke will appear.

, Place your pinkie down on the semicolon and colon key, place your ring finger down on the L key, place your middle finger down on the K key, place your pointer finger on the J key. This is the makeup of everything but your thumbs as to pertain to the right hand.


If your keyboard has a numeric-entry keypad, you'll have to move your hand to the number pad.However, you should limit the use of this portion until you are well-experienced with using the keyboard with your hands and using the numeric row on your alpha-numeric keyboard instead.

The only time your hands should be lifted is when you should need a function key press. Otherwise it's hands-down without letting the keys make a sound until you need to start typing!


Make sure that the keyboard doesn't click when you place your hands down; otherwise the key will activate and, if you are in a typing box, the letter or keystroke will appear.

, As you probably learned in keyboarding classes in school, your thumbs rest on the spacebar. Your left thumb should rest on near the left half of the spacebar and the right thumb should rest on the right hand portion of the spacebar.

, This may take several taps to make it successful. Only depress each key until you hear the key click and release each finger until your fingers return to their proper positions on the keyboard. On some laptop keyboards, it's become commonplace for the sounds of the taps to not be as loud as they used to be, so these clicks aren't as loud but are still notifying.

Produce quality content, especially if you haven't already been doing so.,
Provide reliable and accurate information that interests your visitors.,
Produce content that is ""win-win-win"".,
Make the effort to meet the requirements behind the Panda update.",How to Produce Website Content Liked by the Google Panda Update," The Panda update targets poor quality content. If it's poor quality, then it will get poor results in the search engine returns. The algorithm used discounts the low quality sites and prefers those sites with unique content that creates or gives value to readers. Content that is duplicating in nature is penalized.


Avoid adding duplicate content to your website. It is worth paying extra for original content to avoid being penalized in ranking.;
, The Panda update rewards sites that it considers to be trusted and of high quality. In other words, you can create a partnership with Google from your end by providing reliable, accurate, fulfilling, and original content.


Optimize your website to provide excellent, original, and accurate content. If you don't know whether it is accurate, have people researching it and referencing it where needed, or quality assuring it in some way so that anyone who checks its veracity is reassured.
Google says: “Google depends on the high-quality content created by wonderful websites around the world, and we do have a responsibility to encourage a healthy web ecosystem. Therefore, it is important for high-quality sites to be rewarded, and that’s exactly what this change does.” This means - give your reader or viewer what they want. Don't treat your reader like they don't know; everyone online is savvy, switched on and able to source errors in an instant.

, The old approach, long since outdated, is to provide content that ranks well. The Panda Update requires that your site do the following:


Win 1: Give your visitors content that they actually want to read, that solves their problems or questions, that is accurate without having to check so, and that is entertaining or of good value.
Win 2: Optimize the content for easy indexing by Google.
Win 3: Learn from your visitor's comments and statistical preferences to make much-needed changes that ensure your visitors are getting the experience that they want from your site.

, Your reward will be a good rank in search engine returns, happy readers or viewers, and increasingly solid and reliable reputations. It's really no different from anything else in a business – produce quality and you will keep everyone happy.

You can use more advanced code editors like Notepad++ or TextMate as well, which can be useful for syntax highlighting and advanced editing. You can still see all of the information using a simple text editor., Your XML file will open in your text editor. The complexity of the file is dependent on what it was created for. Use the tag labels to find the information you are looking for. Generally the labels will be fairly self-explanatory, allowing you to browse through the data and find the information you need.


You'll likely see <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> at the top. This indicates that the following content is in XML format.
XML uses custom tags to house pieces of data. Each of these tags are created for whatever program is using it, so there is no common syntax to the markup labels. For example, one XML file may have a <body></body> section, and other might have <message_body></message_body>, but both may function similarly.
Tags can be nested inside other tags, creating a tree. For example, Each <note></note> tag may have several tags inside, such as <title></title> and <date></date>.

Download Permanent Eraser.,
Drag and drop files onto the Permanent Eraser icon.,
Open Permanent Eraser to clear the contents of your Trash.",How to Permanently Delete Files7," Permanent Eraser is a free secure erase program available for Mac. It securely and permanently deletes files, folders, and data from your computer, and can be used to clear the contents of your Trash or to delete a few select files on their own. You can download Permanent Eraser here: http://download.cnet.com/Permanent-Eraser/3000-2092_4-10668789.htmlThis program deletes data even more securely than the ""Secure Empty Trash"" option does. The former overwrites data seven times, but this utility overwrites the data 35 times, scrambles the original file name, and truncates the file size to nearly nothing before unlinking it from the system entirely.

, With the Permanent Eraser icon displayed, either within its original directory, on the Dock, or on the Finder's sidebar, navigate to the file or folder you want to delete. Click on this file and drag it over to the Permanent Eraser icon before releasing.


When you do this, the program should kick in and begin immediately wiping that file from your hard disk.
Place the Permanent Eraser icon on your Dock by navigating to the application and dragging the icon down to an empty space on your Dock.
Place the icon on your Finder's sidebar by dragging it onto empty space on the sidebar and releasing it there.

, From its original location, the Dock, or the sidebar, click on the Permanent Eraser icon to activate the program. After an initial prompt asking you to confirm your decision, the entire contents of your Trash will be permanently deleted. This option will wipe out all contents, not a single file or folder.

"

Note that this option is available through Gnome and other Linux platforms, but may not be available for all Linux platforms.

, Pressing Ctrl + Del on your keyboard will temporarily delete the file and send it to your Trash, where it can be reviewed before permanent deletion. This is usually the preferred option.

, Press and hold ⇧ Shift first before pressing Del. You will be asked to confirm your request, and upon confirmation, the file or folder selected will skip over the Trash and be permanently deleted from your computer.

, If you have deleted your files and folders the traditional way and they are waiting in your Trash for deletion, right-click the Trash icon in the sidebar and select the ""Empty Trash"" option that pops up.


Depending on your Linux platform, this may or may not permanently and securely wipe the files from your hard disk. If it does not, it will only delete the link or pathway allowing you to access that data without deleting the data itself.

-n allows you to overwrite a file N number of times. If you wanted to overwrite the file 15 times, you would type -n 15


-u instructs the tool to remove the file after it has been shredded.

-z instructs the tool to overwrite the file with only zeros after shredding it with ones and zeros. As a result, it will appear as though it has not undergone a shredding process.
For example, if you want to shred a file called ""secret.txt"" 20 times, you would type, shred -u -z -n 20 secret.txt

All header and footer setting must be entered manually each time you want to print a document. These settings cannot be saved. To change headers and footers, choose Page Setup from the File menu and enter the desired command(s) in the Header and Footer text boxes. The following is a short list of header and footer commands:


&l Left-align the characters that follow
&c Center the characters that follow
&r Right-align the characters that follow
&d Print the current date
&t Print the current time
&f Print the name of the document
&p Print the page number
Leaving the Header or Footer text box empty will result in no header footer on your printed document.
You can insert words into the Header and Footer text box and they will print in their appropriate position. Letters after the ""&"" sign do not need to be capitalized.
In Notepad, your header is centered, regardless of the formatting codes you use, if the formatting code is not the first item in the Header text box. For example, to align a title to the left side of the page, use &lTitle text.

, Undo is the first item you will find under the Edit pull down on the menu bar. You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Z for this function also. Once you use Undo you will find Redo as an option in its place.


The rest of the menu, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Find, Find Next, Replace, Go To, Select All, and Time/Date, are standard in nearly all Windows programs that deal with word documents.
The “Go To” option is only available if Word Wrap is disabled and if your document contains numbered lines. Notepad defaults with Word Wrap turned off.

, Unless Word Wrap is enabled, all text you type will be on the same line until you press the “Return” key and the line will scroll indefinitely. In order to fix this, open the next pull down on the menu bar. Word Wrap is the first option you will see. Simply select Word Wrap and your document will be adjusted accordingly.

, Select Font from the Format option on the menu bar. Now, you have the ability to select from a series of preloaded fonts, choose options for Bold, Italics/Oblique, or Bold/Italics. You can also select your font size from this window.


A change in font affects the entire document. You cannot use one type of font on one part of the document and another type on another part.
From the dropdown menu item listed as “Script” in the Font window, you can find characters that are not available in the standard “Western” style fonts.

, The only option you will find is called “Status Bar.” This option is also only available when Word Wrap is disabled. When word Wrap is disabled, a notification will display on the lower border of your document window showing you where your cursor is located in the document.

, It is recommended that you enable Word Wrap. Adjust the font as you desire and remember that it will be consistent with the entire document text.


Note that the “Tab” key will move your cursor ten spaces across your text line, unlike Microsoft Word, which moves five spaces.

, Once you have finished, navigate to the “Save As” option from the File pull down on the menu bar. Notepad uses the default folder “My Documents” on Windows 7, and the “OneDrive” folder on Windows 8.1.


If you would like to save your document in a different place, simply browse your preferred folder from the “Save As” window and select it. Notepad will switch to this choice for future documents.
Remember that all of your files will be saved with the .txt extension.

, Click on the File menu and then select the Print option from the dropdown. This will bring you to a separate window where you can select the printer and options you would like, and click print. To change the settings that determine how your printed document will look, click the File menu, and then click Page Setup:


To change the paper size, tap or click a size in the Size list.
To change the paper source, tap or click a tray name or a feeder in the Source list.
To print the file vertically, click Portrait; to print the file horizontally, click Landscape.
To change the margins, enter a width in any of the Margins boxes.

, You can use the escape key as a quick and easy way to get out of any dialogs. The escape key is essentially a ""cancel"" button. Pressing the escape key will also hide outputs. The escape key is generally located toward the right-hand side of your keyboard and is sometimes indicated by a small arrow pointing to the left.

, To go to the next window, you can use either Ctrl-Tab or Ctrl-F6. Press and hold these buttons together to activate the shortcut. Depending on your options, this will navigate through documents in Windows' own recent window order, or will use a Visual-Studio window stack system.


You can hold down the Shift key with either of these combinations to scroll through windows in the opposite direction.

, Press the F8 key located along the top of your keyboard and the shift key located on the left-hand side to scroll through dockable output windows and individual output windows.

, Using shortcuts reduces the time you spend on minor adjustments while working on your document. Notepad has a ton of shortcuts ranging from simple actions to complex ones. Here are some of the popular shortcuts for Notepad:

Understand the difference between Shutdown, Sleep and Hibernate.,
Use the mode.,
Set your mode.","How to Use Shutdown, Sleep, Hibernate Modes for Your Laptop","

Shutdown: is a quite familiar shutdown mode with users. When you select Shutdown, all opened programs will be closed along with the operating system. After it has been shutdown, a computer will not consume power. However, if you want it to go back to work, you will have to turn it in, wait for the system to boot, wait for the operating system to run and restart the required applications for the work.



 


Sleep: also known as Standby or Nap mode. In Sleep mode, the computer is put into a state that consumes less energy than normal. Power is only used to maintain the system's memory with the applications and data you are working on while other parts of the computer will be shut down to save power. When you turn on your computer from Sleep mode, the system will boot quickly and the data will be retrieved from memory in a few seconds. You can quickly return to work without waiting for the system to restart from the beginning.






Hibernate: also known as hibernation is a less well-known mode. Hibernate is similar to Sleep mode, but instead of saving the data in RAM, in this mode the data will be saved to a file on your hard drive. When you restart the computer from Hibernate mode, like Sleep mode, the operating system and running applications as well as your data will be removed from the hard drive and loaded into RAM so that you can continue the work.





;
, The use of the computer depends on the needs and habits of users. However, very few people take advantage of all the advantages and the convenience of these different modes. There are people who always shut down the computer; there are also some who keep it on 24/7.

Sleep: Sleep mode is useful when you need to leave the computer for a short time, such as nap time. Instead of letting the computer operate, you can put it in Sleep mode to save power and battery. When you come back, you can quickly continue the work, instead of waiting for it to restart and the system's boot time.
Hibernate: Hibernate mode saves more power than Sleep. You should use this mode when not using the computer for a longer period of time, such as when you sleep at night and plan to continue the work on the computer in the next morning.
Shutdown: This is usually the most common mode for desktop users but those who use laptops often put the machine in Hibernate mode, due to energy saving while still being able to quickly return to work. However, occasionally a few applications may not work properly when launched from Hibernate mode, at this point you will need to shut down and reboot. Sometimes computer users should reboot in order for the system to operate the most effectively.
You should also note the difference with Reboot and Shutdown mode, it consumes power to boot the operating system and the data that are removed from the hard drive. Thus, leaving the computer for a short time, if you choose Shutdown mode, it may consume more power than Sleep.

, When you've chosen your commonly used mode, you can set the mode when pressing the power button on the computer or when closing the laptop screen.

To change this setting, press the Windows key, type Power Buttons and press Enter. You will see a window of Control Panel to customize. Now you can customize the Shutdown, Sleep or Hibernate mode when pressing the power button or folding the laptop screen, in two scenarios, when using battery and when being plugged to a power source.

, Go to Project, Add New Item, and make sure to select a .cpp source file.

, This will allow you to declare integers and Boolean types without receiving syntax errors.

, This will be the integer you base your if...else loop on.

, You may use a cout statement to let users know which number to input, but it is essential to declare a cin statement, so they can input a value for x.

, This is the first part of the if...else loop. By writing if(x==1), and then having a cout statement ""True"" in the body of the if statement, you can ensure that an input of 1 will return the cout statement you have written.

, Since ""else"" is used for all remaining possibilities, it does not require an expression. Output the statement ""False"" in the else body.

, To do this, select debug, and click ""Start Without Debugging"". If it asks you to build the program, press Yes.

, To do this, enter 1 in the program and press enter. You should receive the output ""True"".

, Enter any number other than 1. You should receive the output ""False"".

Open up the compiler.,
Add all header files, libraries, and namespaces.,
Analyze the problem.,
Choose a function(s) type that best suit the problem’s needs.,
Choose a name for the function.,
Consider your function formal parameter(s).,
Choose how the actual parameter will pass to the formal parameter.,
Create the function heading.,
Define the function body for a Return Value Function.,
Define the function body for Void Function.,
Create a function prototype for all of the functions, excluding main.,
Call the function.",How to Use Functions in C," Popular compilers for C++ include x-code for Mac’s and Visual Studios for Windows.  Code can also be writing one in text editors like notepad, Text Wrangler, etc.;
, Add any header file to call the function in a main function or in other functions.


<iostream> is a standard library for you cin and cout.
""using namespace std"" is a standard namespace

, Determine what the problem is asking for. Think about what are the best methods. What steps are necessary to solve the problem? These are questions that should be asked and answered before coding. Having a plan will help guide you with your algorithmic design. These steps are the starting points for how to build functions.

, There is return type that will return some value and void which will not.#*Some of the basic return type functions include int, double, char, and bool.


Say your problem needs you to print out some data, then a void function would be the best choice, but if you need to return the sum of two number a int or double function would fit better.

, Naming the function is important for you and for anyone else that may be looking at the code. Name in a way that tells people what this function does.


Again, say the functions prints out data, an appropriate name would be print or even more specific PrintsToDisplay, which would let someone know that this data is being printed to a display.

, The formal parameter(s) is define in the function header as oppose to the actual parameter which is used to call the function. The formal parameter will list the data type and the variable name. Decide if the function takes any parameters; if they’re not needed don’t add them. Decided what data types should be used in the parameters and how many parameters is needed.

, Keep in mind that they’re two types of formal parameter: value parameters and reference. Value parameters get a copy of the value and can do anything it wants within the functions without affecting the original value passed from the actual parameter. Reference parameters are opposite, it gets access to the actual parameter memory address. With a reference parameters, any changes to the original value while in the function will be reflected outside of the function. In order to pass by reference, add a '&' at the end of the data type in the formal parameter. By default, functions are passed by value.

, The function heading is the combination of the function type, name, and parameter, all together in a specific format for C++.

, The function body will come after the function header and will be between two brackets '{}'. This is where the algorithm, the methods needs to solve the problem.


The biggest thing for a return value functions is it has to return value, without that the function will not compile. At the end there needs to be a returned express. A return can only return one value.

, The void as previous noted does not return anything; in the function body between the two brackets '{}', all that needs to be included is the algorithmic steps needed to solve the problem.

, In order to call the functions within the main functions either the functions must be defined and place before the main function or created a functions prototype. This is very similar to the function heading. The key difference is it ends with a semicolon. Functions Prototype includes:


Function return type or void
Function Name
Function Parameters

, A function call is how the function is accessed through the main or other functions. The function call consists of the function name and actual parameters.
